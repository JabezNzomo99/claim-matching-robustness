The man is believed to espouse extremist ideals, drawing attention to the acts of domestic terrorism by U.S. citizens \u2014 a problem that the Trump administration typically does not address when speaking about the threat of terrorism in the United States.\n\nThe list does not include domestic terrorism (such as the Charlottesville attack). \u201cIf you exclude all convictions for \u2018domestic terrorism\u2019 at the outset, how can you draw any overall conclusions on the citizenship status or national origin of those convicted of terrorism?\u201d wrote Shirin Sinnar, an associate professor at Stanford Law School, who obtained and analyzed a more updated version of the list from the DOJ National Security Division through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies warned in May 2017 that white supremacist groups were \u201cresponsible for a lion\u2019s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups,\u201d according to a bulletin prepared by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, obtained by Foreign Policy. White supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 \u2026 more than any other domestic extremist movement,\u201d the document shows.\n\n\u201cThe data Trump cited in his speech to the Joint Session of Congress simply don\u2019t support his claims that a \u2018vast majority\u2019 of individuals on the list came from outside the United States \u2014 unless, that is, you include individuals who were forcibly brought to the United States in order to be prosecuted and exclude all domestic terrorism cases,\u201d according to Lawfare Blog researchers Nora Ellingsen and Lisa Daniels.\n\nYet for his speech to Congress in February, the White House relied on the June 2016 research from Sessions\u2019s former Senate office, not the current Department of Justice under Attorney General Sessions, PolitiFact found. Unless the Department of Justice, now led by Sessions, provided some other data to the White House, Trump\u2019s claim is not supported by facts.\n\nWhat other DOJ data could possibly exist that support Trump\u2019s claim? Was the DOJ consulted before the White House wrote that speech? That\u2019s what the lawsuit filed by Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare Blog and senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, aims to find out. (The blog also has a weekly podcast, Lawfare Podcast.)\n\n\u201cI believe the president was lying not merely about the underlying facts but also about his own Justice Department,\u201d Wittes wrote in April. \u201cOr, in the alternative, I believe it\u2019s possible that the Office of the Attorney General may have supported the White House\u2019s claim. But I think it extraordinarily unlikely that the folks at NSD [National Security Division] actually provided data in support of this presidential statement.\u201d\n\nUnless the Department of Justice, led by Sessions, provided some other data to the White House, Trump\u2019s claim is not supported by the June 2016 analysis by Sessions\u2019s former Senate office. The information in that analysis came from the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division, but Trump twisted the data to make an unsupported claim.\n\nSessions has been attorney general for six months. He has had ample opportunity to release official findings to either correct the record, or back up the president\u2019s claim. Sessions and the administration must set the record straight for the public, and he has a duty to release all relevant information regarding the president\u2019s claims about the threat of terrorism to the United States.", "lang": "en"}
