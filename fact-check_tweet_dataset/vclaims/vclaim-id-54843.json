The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nAnil Deshmukh, on April 22, released a list of 101 people arrested for the lynching of three people, including two sadhus, in Palghar. He released the list after a certain section of media and people on social media started communalising the incident.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Deshmukh said that there are no Muslims on the list.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Deshmukh said, \u201cPalghar lynching is a grotesque incident which happened due to rumours on social media about child kidnappers and thieves prowling in the area. A high-level inquiry is going on. People are requested to verify the facts from trusted sources and not fall for rumours.\u201d\n\nThe above information proves that the viral quote attributed to Anil Deshmukh is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
