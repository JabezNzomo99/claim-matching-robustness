Chris Christie, a Republican, has reminded listeners of that history during various radio interviews in recent weeks. During a Dec. 23 interview with WFAN\u2019s Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton, the governor corrected Carton when the co-host said Christie was raising tolls by 50 percent.\n\n \n\n \"Oh, and by the way, I\u2019m not raising tolls 50 percent,\" Christie said.\n\n \n\n Carton asked, \"Who is?\"\n\n \n\n \"Jon Corzine did,\" the governor responded.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie has his facts straight.\n\n \n\n The toll hikes, which took effect New Year\u2019s Day, represent the second phase of a two-part rate increase approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in October 2008 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. A Democrat, Corzine, signed off on the plan.\n\n \n\n The first phase of the toll hikes began on Dec. 1, 2008 with 40 percent and 43 percent increases on the Turnpike and the Parkway, respectively. The second phase represents a 53 percent hike on the Turnpike and a 50 percent increase on the Parkway.\n\n \n\n The toll increase was initially scheduled to support a $1.25 billion contribution to a Hudson River commuter train tunnel project, known as Access to the Region's Core, or ARC. But citing potential cost overruns, Christie terminated the project in October 2010.\n\n \n\n In September, the turnpike authority agreed to redirect $975 million from the canceled tunnel to local road and bridge projects. Those projects are part of a five-year capital plan unveiled by Christie earlier this year.\n\n \n\n The increased toll revenue also is going toward the authority\u2019s $7 billion capital program, which includes a Turnpike widening project between exits 6 and 9.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n In a radio interview, Christie directed blame for the new toll hikes to his predecessor, claiming \"I'm not raising tolls 50 percent....Jon Corzine did.\"\n\n \n\n The governor\u2019s planning to spend the money, but he didn\u2019t raise the tolls. With Corzine\u2019s approval, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority approved the two-phase toll increase in October 2008.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
