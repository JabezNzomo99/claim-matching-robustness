The couple went into self- isolation thereafter.\n\nHowever, netizens went into utter shock when a website called \"the-daily-star.com\" ran a piece of news with the headline, \"BREAKING: CORONAVIRUS CLAIMS LIFE OF TOM HANKS\".\n\nThe website claimed that the \"Cast Away\" actor has passed away at the age of 63, in Queensland, Australia. It says, \"A Queensland Health spokeswoman said the actor passed away late Friday night AEST from complications in relation to Covid-19.\"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a hoax. Tom Hanks seems to be doing well as he is still active on social media.\n\nThe website \"the-daily-star.com\" published this news on March 13, 2020. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of the website which says, \"This is satire\". Other contents of the website also confirm that it is a satirical website.\n\nThere is no news about Tom Hanks's demise in any mainstream media. In fact, he is quite active on social media. On March 15, 2020, the actor tweeted thanking \"the helpers\" and asking people to take care of \"each other\".\n\nHe is also quite active on Instagram.\n\nThe actor was in Australia for a film shoot when he and his wife were detected with coronavirus. But the news of his death is absolutely false.", "lang": "en"}
