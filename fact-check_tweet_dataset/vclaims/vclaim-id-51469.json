The links can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWe found this image on a website called Lebanon Postcard. However, no dates of the image were available.\n\nWe then ran a reverse image search on different search engines using Duplichecker and found a blogpost link on Bing. The post was published 3 months ago.\n\nThe result on TinEye showed us that the picture has been available on the internet since 2016.\n\nA Yandex search led us to the same picture that was posted on a website called Project Reality in 2013.\n\nMoreover, the recent satellite image of Beirut, taken after the explosion shows a massive crater at the site of the blast in Beirut\u2019s port (which is not visible in the post in question).\n\nHence, from the above fact check, it is clear that the post in question is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
