Our response to the Dean is that it's very unlikely.\n\nPeople have to register with the police after being convicted or cautioned for certain, listed sexual offences. The list includes the crime of \"exposure\" of the genitals, but to be convicted of that the person must have intended to be seen by someone and to cause them \"alarm or distress\".\n\nThe Scottish offence of \"sexual exposure\", which also gives rise to registration, specifies that the exposure has to be \"in a sexual manner\", as well as intentional.\n\nA clandestine duck behind a wall isn't likely to satisfy these kinds of criteria, although a very public display is obviously more risky.\n\nUrinating in public without the intention to expose oneself and \"alarm\" others will usually be charged under a local byelaw or the Public Order Act 1986, according to the College of Policing. That kind of conviction is not \"sexual\" and doesn't require registration as a sexual offender.\n\nEven if a court felt that there was a sexual element to your behaviour, the requirement to register as a sexual offender doesn't follow automatically. Unless someone who saw you is under 18, you wouldn't have to register if fined rather than sent to prison.", "lang": "en"}
