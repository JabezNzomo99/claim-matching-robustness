The claim originated on a satire website.\n\nThe image falsely alleges in a post that a trend called \u201cred lighting,\u201d in which people install red bulbs in their porch lights to indicate gun-free zones, has become popular among activists who oppose guns. It then encourages Facebook users to like and share the post if they disagree with the tactic.\n\n\u201cA Gun Free Safe Home is everything America is supposed to be,\u201d the post quotes someone named Jane Seymore as saying. (RELATED: Are Most Gun Crimes Committed With Handguns?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that people opposed to guns are using red porch lights to signal that their homes are gun-free. The Daily Caller searched the internet and news coverage for such a trend but only found media outlets debunking it.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated on ImmediateSafety.org, where a 2015 article described the same \u201cred lighting\u201d trend and quoted Seymore, a director at the nonexistent Department of Protecting Everyone. Though the website doesn\u2019t describe its articles as satirical or fake, the headlines of other stories posted on it indicate that its content is indeed fictional.\n\nThose headlines include \u201cGoogle Driverless Car Flips Off Asia Woman Driver\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump Replaces George Washington Painting In The Oval Office With Vigo The Carpathian.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
