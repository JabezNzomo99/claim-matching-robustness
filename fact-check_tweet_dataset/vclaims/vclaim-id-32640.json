The post went viral when a screenshot was shared by a pro-vaccine Facebook page named Light for Riley:\n\nIt is unclear, however, if this purported nurse was making a genuine offer, or if the offer itself was a hoax designed to inspire internet outrage. For one thing, there is no actual \u201cRoyal Children\u2019s Hospital\u201d in the town of Brisbane, Australia, as reported by Australia\u2019s news.com.au:\n\nThe woman\u2019s Facebook description [claims] she works as a staff nurse at the \u201cRoyal Children\u2019s Hospital, Brisbane\u201d. The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital is actually located in Melbourne and while there was a Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Brisbane, it was renamed to Brisbane Children\u2019s Hospital in 1943 before being changed back in 1967. The only children\u2019s hospital in Brisbane now is called the Queensland Children\u2019s Hospital, which was opened in 2014.\n\nFor another thing, Queensland Health, the entity that oversees all the hospitals in that Australian state, says nobody bearing the name of the alleged nurse works at any of their hospitals:\n\nCommenting directly on the viral Facebook post, a spokesperson from Children\u2019s Health Queensland confirmed she was not a nurse \u2014 nor has she ever been. \u201cThere are no current or former employees by that name that have worked for Queensland Health as a registered nurse,\u201d a spokesperson from Children\u2019s Health Queensland said. \u201cThis is a serious issue and has been referred to police, who are investigating.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the Queensland Police Department to ask if its investigation had turned up any new information, and we will update our post if any such information is provided. Because it is unclear who this Facebook user actually is and what the person\u2019s motive was behind the post, we rank the claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
