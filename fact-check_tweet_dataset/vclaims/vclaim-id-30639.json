If this continues this situation will prevail in the entire nation. Congress Hindus are requested to look at this video and you will get to know the future of your children. Take off your spectacles and vote for in country's interest.\n\nHere is the archived version of the post.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The video is from 2017 and Dilip Ghosh was being heckled by Gorkhas in Darjeeling.\n\nIn the 1-minute-47-second-long video, the attackers can be heard screaming in Hindi, \"Gorkha ko kya samajhke rakhha hai\" which translates to, \"What do you think of Gorkhas.\"\n\nWe ran a keyword search to verify the claim.\n\nWe found several media reports in which it was stated that Dilip Ghosh was heckled by Gorkha Jana Mukti Morcha (GJM).\n\nAccording to reports, on evening of October 5, Dilip Ghosh along with a seven-member delegation, other party members and supporters went to attend a 'Vijaya Sammelani' scheduled to be held in Darjeeling.\n\nA scuffle erupted between the BJP supporters and GMJ supporters as soon as the Bengal BJP chief reached the spot. GMJ workers who gathered there to protest against the BJP leadership chased and attacked Dilip Ghosh and others accompanying him.\n\nThis was widely reported by all media organisations.\n\nWe found news articles where it was written that Dilip Ghosh had called Tamang a 'traitor' which is why the GJM workers were agitated.\n\nWe found a video on YouTube uploaded by Republic TV on October 5, 2017.\n\nMedia reports quoted Dilip Ghosh after the incident as saying, \"All of a sudden they rushed to the dais and heckled everybody including me.\"\n\nAccording to media reports, the BJP Bengal chief claimed that the agitators were supporters of expelled Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Binay Tamang. A police complaint was filed and police started investigating the incident.\n\nSo it is quite clear that the attackers were GJM workers and the claim that Dilip Ghosh was heckled by Rohingya people when he was entering a Hindu colony is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
