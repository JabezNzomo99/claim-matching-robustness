Both Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan had tweeted condolences on February 15, 2019, a day following the attack.\n\nSaurabh Mishra, the man at the helm of the channel, did not respond to messages from BOOM asking for an interview.\n\nSince May 2016, Delhi-based Only News 24x7 has relied on half truths and opinion to churn out nationalistic pro-right propaganda through videos, while adding an impressive 1.27 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more perplexing is that Only News 24x7 started out as an unofficial fan page of badminton player PV Sindhu. More on that later in the article.\n\nThe channel even received a \u2018Gold Play Button\u2019 award from YouTube for crossing 1 million subscribers last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n Getting the Gold Play button from YouTube\n\n\n\nOne of Only News 24X7\u2019s earliest videos on YouTube was of a toddler doing Yoga.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u2018Cute 18 months old baby doing Yoga On International Yoga-following Modi\u2019\n\n\n\nSince then, it has built a library of nearly 1300 videos rarely deviating from its pro-Bharatiya Janata Party, anti-opposition, anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan stance.\n\nThe description of the channel on YouTube states it has special focus on Pakistan.\n\n\u201cOnly News 24x7 is outbreaks the conventional news reading and brings to you the real face of every information at one click! Latest news from India and the world special Pakistan politics and nation, entertainment, sports and science.\u201d - Only News 24x7.\n\nBOOM had fact-checked Only News 24x7 in December 2017 when it used a video of a Pakistani cricket fan and claimed that a school teacher in India had chanted \u2018India ka baap kaun? Pakistan, Pakistan\u2019.\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the woman in the video was a Pakistani and that the video was uploaded to YouTube by Pakistani netizens after the Indian cricket team lost the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 finals to Pakistan on June 18, 2017 in London.\n\nRead: Hindi Website \u2018Only News 24X7\u2019 Uses Video From Pakistan To Stir Bigotry\n\nThe video has since been deleted from all social media accounts of the channel.\n\nBack then the channel had 5,31,420 subscribers on YouTube and since then it has grown its subscriber base by 40 per cent to 1.2 million.\n\nBOOM found other examples where Only News 24x7 has used sensational and downright false captions in the thumbnail images of its videos as click-bait.\n\nSample some of the captions below.\n\n\u2018Rahul Gandhi forgets his father\u2019s name, says Modi is his father, in Germany\u2019\n\nThe thumbnail image for this video says Article 370 and Article 35A have been scrapped though the actual video does not make the same claim. This video alone has over 1.8 million views.\n\nOnly News 24x7 videos are also popular on WhatsApp and enjoy a long life on the app\u2019s end-to-end encryption ecosystem.\n\nIn this video (below), Only News 24x7 has targeted Trinamool Congress founder and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nThe headline with the thumbnail says 'Mamata Banerjee caught with terrorists, all of them were Muslims' (\u092e\u092e\u0924\u093e \u092c\u0928\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0940 \u092a\u0915\u095c\u0940 \u0917\u0908 \u0906\u0924\u0902\u0915\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925, \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928).\n\nThe video, at no point talks about Mamata Banerjee being caught with terrorists. It rather repeatedly mentions presence of Rohingya Muslims in West Bengal.\n\nIn another video, the caption with the thumbnail says 'Asaduddin Owaisi Thrashed by Public for Insulting PM Modi.'\n\nHowever, the report is basically a vox pop and the reporter can be seen prompting people for a statement on Majlis-e-Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi. Incidentally, no one from the public said that Owaisi should be thrashed.\n\nWhile Only News 24x7\u2019s Facebook page has about 10 per cent of its following on YouTube, the page\u2019s genesis is bizarre.\n\nOnly News 24x7\u2019s Facebook page was set up as a fan page of PV Sindhu on August 19, 2016, the day the badminton shuttler won a silver medal at the Olympics.\n\nThe name of the page was changed to \u2018Pride of India\u2019 on September 12, 2016 before finally changing it to its current name \u2018Only News 24X7\u2019 on December 27, 2016.\n\nThe page's history can be accessed through the 'Info and ads' tab in Facebook.\n\nCreating fan pages of athletes and celebrities is a common ploy of fake news and propaganda pages that aim to build a large fan base before switching track to publishing politically motivated content.\n\nScrolling through old photos of the page show numerous images of PV Sindhu.\n\nA promo video is a tagged to the top of the Facebook page.\n\nIn it, Saurabh Mishra along with three female colleagues appear claiming their reportage is accurate and fearless and only traitors are rattled by their coverage.\n\nBut far from being accurate, BOOM found more examples of the page peddling fake news.\n\nIn a video in November 2018, Saurabh Mishra showed a photoshopped image of the Congress party\u2019 24 Akbar Road headquarters in Delhi with a portrait of Aurangzeb in the background.\n\nMishra also incorrectly claimed that it was Babar\u2019s portrait and called the Congress president \u2018Rahul Khan\u2019.\n\nBOOM had debunked the photoshopped image which was created as a joke in 2017.\n\nRead: No, That\u2019s Not Aurangzeb At Congress HQ Looking Down At Rahul Gandhi\n\nIts previous website onlynews24x7.com is now defunct. An archived version of it can be viewed here. The site was registered on June 13, 2016 by one Yashi Mishra in Uttar Pradesh, according to whois.com, a service that records registration details of website domains.\n\nWhois record of the new site does not give away much besides stating that it was created in 2017 and was registered in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nA new website onlynews24x7.co.in has articles that broadly focus on Indian politics, Pakistan and sometimes soft porn, a trait that is not uncommon to nationalist websites peddling misinformation.\n\nAn article about the death of film direct Neeraj Vora had an image of Johnny Lever in the featured image.\n\nThe channel is not as active on Twitter and last tweeted on January 31, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
