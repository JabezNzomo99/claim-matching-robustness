States have broad discretion over Medicaid, including what optional services to cover and whether to expand coverage to get people off wait lists. Not everyone waiting may be eligible for Medicaid because some states don\u2019t check the person\u2019s eligibility until a slot opens.\n\nWhether people move off the wait list depends on many factors, such as how urgent their needs are, how long they\u2019ll need services and whether the states have money to pay for them. Many times, a slot only opens up if someone receiving services moves out of the state or dies.\n\n\u201cAccording to the most recent data from the state, there are 18,701 Illinoisans on the state\u2019s Prioritization for Urgency of Need for Services Medicaid waiting list. These are Illinoisans who, for a variety of reasons, need care beyond what Medicaid currently provides for them and have applied for additional services, such as in-home care. They are children with developmental disabilities, seniors, individuals with severe mental illnesses, and more \u2013 people Medicaid was intended to serve. But, due to a lack of funding, these Illinoisans wait for the care they need. And while the state has been busy enrolling as many able-bodied adults as possible in the Medicaid expansion and not making the needs of these disabled and elderly Illinoisans a priority \u2014 new information from DHS shows the toll it\u2019s taking.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a wait list for this Illinois program since it was created in 1999. The data cited in the column show that between 2013 and 2015, the number of people on the Illinois wait list actually decreased from about 22,000 to 18,000.\n\nNearly all of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion was paid by the federal government, so it\u2019s totally separate from the state waivers that pay for the optional services when people get off the wait list. The expansion and wait list populations are separate, and expansion doesn\u2019t necessarily affect the wait list population.\n\nThe average increase in wait lists in non-expansion states was more than 2.5 times that of expansion states in 2014 and 2015, according to Kaiser. In fact, Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas was one of two states that reported the longest waiting lists for such services in 2015 \u2014 even though Texas did not expand Medicaid.\n\nCruz and Meadows argue that Obamacare expanded Medicaid to new non-elderly populations while other more vulnerable populations are being forced onto wait lists to get care. But the data do not confirm their suggestion that Obamacare expanded Medicaid at the expense of the wait list populations.\n\nStates can choose to keep specific people on wait lists for optional Medicaid services so that they can get care in their homes or communities, rather than being in an institution. But this population is separate from the ones who newly qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare. Further, the federal government paid for nearly all of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, so it\u2019s unclear why it would have affected states\u2019 capacity to move people off wait lists.\n\nData analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation show there\u2019s no correlation between expansion states and the number of people on wait lists for home- or community-based care. In fact, Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas, which did not expand Medicaid, is one of two states with the longest wait lists. Cruz and Meadows are free to argue that states should focus on decreasing their wait lists rather than expanding Medicaid eligibility, but there\u2019s just not enough evidence that the two populations have much to do with each other.", "lang": "en"}
