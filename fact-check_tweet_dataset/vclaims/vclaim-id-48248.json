The picture was captioned, \u201cFill em up! It was great to be with Islamic Relief Canada volunteers in my riding today, marking Ramadan by making food kits for Moisson Montr\u00e9al.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Justin Trudeau was in quarantine after his wife was tested positive of COVID-19. Even after his wife\u2019s recovery, he announced that his family will continue to remain in self-isolation for two more weeks. So, it is extremely unlikely that he would break the rule of social distancing in these times to come out and work in proximity of so many people.\n\nOur Fact Check clearly establishes that the video being circulated is old and has no connection to Covid-19.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
