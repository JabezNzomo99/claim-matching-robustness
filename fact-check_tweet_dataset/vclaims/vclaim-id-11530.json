However, U.S. political divisions are not the main reason for deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow. Russia\u2019s own actions damaged relations more.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 07, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11530", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-reaction-us-midterms/29588073.html", "vclaim": "Russian officials said they were \u201cclosely watching\u201d the U.S. midterm elections, but warned the results were unlikely to have any positive impact on bilateral relations.\n\nRussian state media, however, largely ignored the election, only occasionally reporting statements made by top Russian politicians. In the November 6 elections, U.S. voters chose Members of Congress as well as state and local officials,\n\nThe Kremlin repeated already debunked denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, while Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova quipped that both U.S. political parties can now \u201cblame Russian hackers\u201d for failing to win a majority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nZakharova\u2019s boss, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, claimed to \u201cfirmly know\u201d that \u201cinternal political squabbles in America\u201d are the real reason for the poor state of relations between Washington and Moscow.\n\nWhile Lavrov\u2019s assertion is correct and political divisions in Washington have implications for relations with Russia, his narrative is completely wrong. Relations with Russia started to deteriorate long before the current U.S. president took office, and restrictive measures against Russia have bipartisan support.\n\nMore importantly, Russia\u2019s deteriorating relations with the U.S are not its only problem. The Kremlin\u2019s own actions, ranging from sports doping to military and cyber interventions, to waging disinformation wars and poisoning ex-spies, have steadily damaged Russia\u2019s reputation globally.\n\nPolygraph.info has compiled a list of the Kremlin\u2019s actions that lead to Russia\u2019s current international standing. The list is far from complete but demonstrates the actual basis for condemnation of Russia in the United States and beyond -- and the restrictive actions taken against it.", "lang": "en"}
