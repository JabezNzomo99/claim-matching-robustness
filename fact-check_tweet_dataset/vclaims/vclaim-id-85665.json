The agency cited sources as saying that the woman earlier said that she and her children were not getting food in the lockdown and that there was no inflow of money as she was a daily wage earner. India is in the midst of a 21-day lockdown that is scheduled to end on April 14 but is most likely to be extended. Several states have already announced an extension.\n\n\n\n\"Sources, meanwhile, said that the woman had earlier said that she and her children were not getting food in the lockdown and money inflow had stopped because she was a daily wage earner,\" IANS reported.

Singh denied any angle of starvation as a reason. \"We visited the house and saw cooked food in the kitchen. They did not have any food problems,\" Singh told BOOM.\n\nThe SP also said that the bodies of four out of the five children have been retrieved from the river. They were all below the age of eleven.\n\n\n\nIANS's story was picked up by Outlook.

I was tensed and so I drowned them'. A man asks her, \"Why were you tense? Was there a shortage of food, or some domestic dispute?\", to which the woman says,\"Yes. There were quarrels because of which I was tensed. There were disputes with my husband. The woman also claims in the video that her husband used to beat her up quite often. \n\n\n\nBhadohi SP had also told BOOM about disputes between the accused and her husband. \"Daily quarrels can rile up anyone.
