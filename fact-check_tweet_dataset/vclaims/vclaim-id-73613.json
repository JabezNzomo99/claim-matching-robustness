A large pit on the road can be seen in a viral picture on social media. It is being claimed that this picture of the broken road is from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe claim turned out to be misleading in Vishwas News investigation. The picture of the pit on the road is from Ahmedabad in Gujarat, which is being spread in the name of Varanasi.\n\nFacebook user \u2018Deepu Chauhan\u2019, while sharing the viral photo (archived link) , wrote, \u201cThis is India\u2019s Kyoto Stadium\u2026 # Vanarasi.\u201d\n\nOver 200 people have shared the picture. Many other users have shared this picture with similar claims on other social media platforms.\n\nWe found this picture on the official Twitter profile of Sanjeev Bhatt (IPS) when we Google reverse-image searched it. On 29 July 2017, tweeting the other three photographs along with this photo, he described it is in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.\n\nIn the search, we found a report published on 2 August 2018 on the website of sinewstoday.com, in which this picture has been used. This picture has been reported in an article of Swastik Crossroads in Ahmedabad.\n\nDainik Jagran\u2019s Varanasi reporter Shashwat Mishra denied Varanasi\u2019s claim of this picture. However, this is not the first time this picture has gone viral with false claims. Earlier the picture has gone viral on social media with claim as in Varanasi and Agra-Lucknow Expressway.\n\nThe user who shared the viral picture described himself as a resident of Chhibramau in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nConclusion: The viral picture of a broken road in the name of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh is from Ahmedabad in Gujarat.", "lang": "en"}
