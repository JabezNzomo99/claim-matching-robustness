( A Muslim was tied with a rope and beaten up by a terrorist mob. A protest was held at Parliament Square London against the mob-lynching and terror incidents in India. At least now be ashamed and stop #moblynching or you will further tarnish India\u2019s name?)\u201d, reads the message posted by a Twitter user.\n\nAlt News broke up the video into multiple key-frames with the help of a digital verification tool Invid. We then performed a reverse search on one of the frames and found several news articles pertaining to the incident.\n\nAccording to an article published in August 2017, Mukim, who belongs to the Muslim community and is seen beaten up in the video. The article further stated that he is a resident of Sikri, Bharatpur district in Rajasthan. Mukim was lingering around in a nearby village where he was beaten up by a group of people over suspicion of his involvement in braid-chopping incidents. The victim was brutally beaten up and was left to die. Those present at the scene had shot a video of this incident. The cops arrived at the scene after receiving information about the incident and later got to know during the enquiry that Mukim was mentally ill and hence couldn\u2019t explain or defend himself while he was being beaten up. At the time, police had arrested nine people in the case that was registered by the victim\u2019s father Baljeet.\n\nAlt News contacted Sikri police who corroborated that the incident indeed took place in Sikri, Bharatpur, Rajasthan. Hence, the social media claim that this incident took place in Baroda, Gujarat is false. However, Alt News was unable to ascertain whether or not there was any communal motive behind the crime.", "lang": "en"}
