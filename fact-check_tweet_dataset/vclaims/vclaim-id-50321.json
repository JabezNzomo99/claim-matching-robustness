Ultimately, the bill was overwhelmingly passed by Democrats and voted against by Republicans.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA, posted a tweet asserting that 174 Democrats had voted against a \u201cbipartisan act to stop convicted terrorists & sexual predators from becoming TSA Agents\u201d:\n\nThat tweet was misleading in several ways, however.\n\nFirst of all, the bill in question was not a \u201cbipartisan act to stop convicted terrorists and sexual predators from becoming TSA Agents.\u201d The bill \u2014 H.R. 1140, known as the \u201cRights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020\u201d \u2014 was a Democratic-led effort to grant employees of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) the same protections as other federal employees:\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2017 alone, TSA spent approximately $16 million to hire and train nearly 2,000 TSOs [Transportation Security Officers] who left within six months of being hired. Several factors contribute to TSA\u2019s morale and attrition problems. TSOs are among the lowest paid employees in the Federal government and receive minimal, infrequent pay increases. TSOs\u2019 job responsibilities have grown increasingly demanding, requiring extensive training on advanced security technologies and long hours in crowded, stressful environments. In addition, TSA employees are not granted many of the basic workplace protections afforded most other Federal workers under the Title 5 personnel system. For example, TSA employees have limited options for filing workplace grievances and cannot appeal disciplinary actions to an outside third-party such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. Further, TSOs are limited in their ability to negotiate protections because it is not one of the limited issue areas for which TSA permits collective bargaining. The \u201cRights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020\u201d seeks to ensure that all TSA employees have access to the fair and transparent personnel system established under Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Under that Federal personnel system, TSOs and other employees would receive higher salaries as well as regular salary increases in future years. Employees would also receive access to MSPB processes and collective bargaining rights as are available to most other Federal workers.\n\nH.R. 1140 was not \u201cbipartisan,\u201d nor did it have anything to do with stopping \u201cconvicted terrorists and sexual predators from becoming TSA Agents.\u201d The latter aspect became part of the debate on the bill along with claims that changes wrought by H.R. 1140 could potentially affect TSA\u2019s ability to discipline employees involved in security violations:\n\nCommittee Republicans are concerned that moving TSA employees under title 5 would undermine the agency\u2019s ability to perform its national security mission. According to information obtained from TSA, H.R. 1140 would hinder TSA\u2019s ability to address serious instances of misconduct among the workforce. Under current law, the agency may exercise one-step removal for serious offenses such as intentional security breaches, theft, failure of drug and alcohol tests while on duty, or arrests for certain criminal offenses. Under H.R. 1140, an employee who knowingly allows guns or explosives through a security checkpoint would no longer be immediately fired. H.R. 1140 would expand collective bargaining rights for TSA employees. As a result, security policies needed to protect the traveling public would be negotiable topics in union bargaining. Under current law, TSA can impose new security requirements, such as enhanced passenger screening when intelligence indicates credible threats. Under this bill, how those new security requirements are implemented could be subject to negotiation with the union.\n\nAt the last minute, Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Arizona, made a motion to recommit with instructions (a mechanism used to amend a bill just before it is voted upon by the full House of Representatives) in order to add an amendment to H.R. 1140 related to the TSA\u2019s hiring of persons convicted of certain forms of crime:\n\nThe motion carried, and the version of the bill subsequently voted upon by the House accordingly included the following sentence: \u201cDuring the transition period and after the conversion date, the Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall ensure that the Transportation Security Administration continues to prevent the hiring of individuals who have been convicted of a sex crime, an offense involving a minor, a crime of violence, or terrorism.\u201d\n\nThis amendment did not create any new or additional protections against the TSA\u2019s hiring of \u201cconvicted terrorists and sexual predators\u201d as agents. (Existing TSA regulations already disqualify persons convicted of terrorism, rape, aggravated sexual abuse, and various violent crimes, among other offenses.) As the text of the amendment states, it calls upon the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the TSA continues to prevent the hiring of [such] individuals, and as Lesko acknowledged, the amendment \u201cpreserves the authority the TSA currently has\u201d and \u201csimply ensures that current safeguards remain in place.\u201d\n\nThe vote that Kirk cited was not a vote on the bill itself, but rather a roll call vote on Lesko\u2019s motion to recommit with instructions (i.e., 174 Democrats were voting against the motion and thereby seeking to prevent additional amendments to the bill). Democratic critics contended during House debate that Lesko\u2019s amendment was an unnecessary \u201cred herring,\u201d as the \u201cTSA conducts rigorous background checks and will continue to do so\u201d:\n\nRep. Lesko: [A] bad actor TSA screener told a passenger to reveal her full breasts and lift her pants and underwear. The victim in the case stated that she complied with the TSO\u2019s instructions out of fear. Fortunately, this offender was immediately fired by the TSA. However, under this bill, H.R.1140, if it passed, this predator could be on the federal payroll for months or even years \u2026 My amendment is simple. It would enhance aviation security and protect the flying public by preventing the TSA from hiring any candidate with a history of sexual misconduct, offenses involving minors, or terrorism. Val Demings: Let me be clear, there is nothing in this bill that will allow the TSA to hire individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes or offenses against a minor, a crime of violence, or terrorism. Let me be clear, the example that [Rep. Lesko] cited, there is nothing that would have precluded this person from being hired in the first place. The behavior took place after the person was hired. This is a red herring. We decided not to offer this amendment because it simply isn\u2019t necessary. TSA conducts rigorous background checks and will continue to do so.\n\nWhen the final version of H.R. 1140 \u2014 which included the amendment related to the TSA\u2019s hiring of persons convicted of sex- and terrorism-related offenses \u2014 was voted upon, it was overwhelmingly passed by Democrats (including by all four of the Democratic representatives named by Kirk: U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Steny Hoyer).\n\nOnly 14 Republicans out of 197 voted in favor of the amended bill and its language ensuring a continued prohibition on the TSA\u2019s hiring of persons convicted of sex crimes or terrorism, while not a single Democrat voted against it:\n\nThe bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.", "lang": "en"}
