During sentencing, her lawyers had requested that Butina\u2019s prison term not exceed time served.\n\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Chutkan chose to follow a stiffer sentencing recommendation based on the opinion of the former assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division, Robert Anderson, who had requested 18 months.\n\nSpeaking from the bench, Chutkan said Butina\u2019s offense was \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cjeopardized this country\u2019s national security.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds that Moskalkova\u2019s claim that the \u201cjoint efforts by the bodies of power, human rights activists and the public\u201d helped secure Butina\u2019s return to Russia is false.", "lang": "en"}
