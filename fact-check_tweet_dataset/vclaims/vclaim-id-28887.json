It emerged during the controversy surrounding the decision of many NFL players to sit or kneel during the National Anthem in protest of racial injustice.\n\nThe quote, however, is fake. \u201cAlleged comments by #Steelers LB @jharrison9292 on social media today regarding any protests are false & should not be used as a reference,\u201d Burt Lauten, director of communications for the Steelers, tweeted at the time.\n\n\n\n Soon after it appeared, Harrison confirmed that he never made the statement, expressing his true feelings about the protests to Sports Illustrated. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the individual,\u201d Harrison said of players declining to stand during the National Anthem. \u201cIf they feel like that\u2019s something they want to do, that\u2019s their right.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Harrison was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He announced his retirement from professional football in April 2018 after a 15-season NFL career during which he won two Super Bowls.\n\nThis was not the first fake statement about the protests to be falsely attributed to Harrison. In September 2016, a fake Harrison tweet declared: \u201cIf you on my team and not standin [sic] for Anthem better be from a broken leg or I\u2019m gonna give you one.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
