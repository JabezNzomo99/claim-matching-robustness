Elizabeth Warren once said, \u201cHaving an abortion is no different than someone having their tonsils removed.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Warren ever made the statement attributed to her in the post, though she has made comparisons between the safety of procedures in the past.\n\nWarren has been the subject of viral misinformation on numerous occasions. In this case, a viral post credits the Massachusetts senator with saying a quote equating an abortion to a tonsillectomy. (RELATED: Does Elizabeth Warren Want To Take Guns Away From Republicans?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence of Warren ever saying or writing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller searched the internet, social media and news coverage and could not find any instance of her ever making that statement.\n\nYet, while there\u2019s no proof the Massachusetts senator ever made this statement, she has made comparisons between the safety of the two procedures on several occasions in the past.\n\nOn Jan. 21, 2018, Warren authored an op-ed for Time magazine, in which she wrote, \u201cOn the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I think about what has changed since abortions became legal. Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe v. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women are alive today because of Roe.\u201d\n\nThat opinion column included a link to a 2014 Time magazine article about a study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The authors of the study told Time that they observed the rate of complications following abortions was lower that those following wisdom teeth removals and tonsillectomies.\n\nWarren also made a similar statement on the floor of the Senate Jan. 31, 2018, while delivering a speech in opposition to a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

She again made a comparison between the safety of the two procedures in that July 2018 op-ed.\n\n\u201cToday, thanks to Roe, getting an abortion is safer than getting your tonsils out,\u201d wrote Warren. \u201cBefore Roe v. Wade, many women turned to back-alley butchers to end their pregnancies.\u201d\n\nThe quote, Snopes reported, stems from websites that publishing articles mischaracterizing her comparison of the safety of the procedures in her arguments supporting Roe v. Wade.", "lang": "en"}
