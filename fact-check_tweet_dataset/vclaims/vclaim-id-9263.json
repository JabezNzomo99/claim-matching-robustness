Tammy Baldwin, who drew contrasts between the Democratic ticket and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"I know with Tim Kaine as vice president and Hillary Clinton in the White House, we will have partners bringing the focus back on good-paying jobs for all Americans,\" Baldwin said on Aug. 5, 2016, the same day Trump visited Green Bay.\n\n\"Now, while Donald trump has a long history of exporting jobs overseas, I know that Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton will bring back good-paying jobs right here to Milwaukee. They will crack down on countries that cheat, like China. We need a vice president and a president who will go to bat for Wisconsin businesses, not look to send more jobs overseas.\"\n\nDoes Trump have a long record of exporting jobs overseas?\n\nCreating jobs overseas rather than in the United States -- yes.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by noting Trump has employed many people in the United States. (CNNMoney put the figure at 34,000.) He serves as an executive for more than 500 companies; his Trump Organization owns a portfolio of buildings, hotels and golf courses in the United States (and around the world).\n\nBut he also sells many Trump-label products that are made overseas, as shown by three previous fact checks by our partners, and by our own online browsing.\n\nTrump cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps, mirrors and neckties are made in China. Some of the ties are also made in Indonesia and Vietnam and some of the shirts in Bangladesh. Trump suits are made in Mexico, India and China.\n\nTrump vodka, distilled in the Netherlands. Furniture, made in Turkey. And his crystal barware, made in Slovenia (the home country of his wife, Melania).\n\nBut when Clinton said Trump \"doesn't make a thing in America,\" PolitiFact Pennsylvania\u2019s rating was False. His campaign gear, some of his and other Trump-brand products, including bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are made in the United States.\n\nAnd PunditFact in October 2015 rated as Pants on Fire a claim that Trump\u2019s iconic campaign hats are made in China (they\u2019re made in America).\n\nThe rest of the claim\n\nAs for the rest of Baldwin\u2019s claim, Trump did decide to have some of his products manufactured overseas, rather than in America.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, Trump in 2004 signed a deal with Phillips-Van Heusen, a manufacturer of affordable shirts. It was one of the first of many merchandise-licensing arrangements in which he attached his name to products made by foreign workers and sold in the United States. (PVH said in 2015 it was dropping the Trump line.)\n\nBut it\u2019s misleading to say he exported jobs, in that it\u2019s not as though he created those jobs in the United States and then moved them overseas.\n\nTrump has complained that China manipulates its currency, making it more expensive to make products outside of China.\n\nBaldwin said Trump \"has a long history of exporting jobs overseas.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, although those were jobs that were created overseas, not U.S. jobs that were moved.", "lang": "en"}
