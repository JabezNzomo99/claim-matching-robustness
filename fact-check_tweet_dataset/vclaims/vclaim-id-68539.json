Tim Kaine says President Donald Trump was once offered all the money he wanted for Southern border security, and turned it down.\n\nHis comments came during a Jan.9 interview on CNN, amid a federal government shutdown over disagreements on funding to expand a security wall on the Southern border. Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for project; congressional Democrats are drawing the line at $1.3 billion.\n\nKaine said his fellow Democrats have tried in the past to compromise with Trump on border security, but to no avail.\n\n\"We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal,\" Kaine said.\n\nWe wondered whether Kaine\u2019s statement is accurate.\n\nMiryam Lipper, the senator\u2019s spokesperson, referred us to a short-lived bill the senator co-sponsored in February 2018. The Senate was intensely debating immigration. Trump had announced that on March 5, he would begin winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program - or DACA - that protects from deportation children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. The Senate was seeking a broad compromise with Trump on immigration policies that would save DACA before the March 5 deadline.\n\nTrump backed a Republican bill that would have appropriated $25 billion for border security. The legislation honored four conditions the president set for continuing DACA:\n\u2022 Establish a path to citizenship for DACA children, or \"dreamers;\"\n\u2022 End the visa lottery program that promotes ethnic diversity of immigrants, and\n\u2022 The voting bill known as H.R. 1 would mean \u201cthat millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.\"\n\nEnding the diversity visa lottery and restricting family-based immigration - which the Democrats call \"family reunification - were anathema to Democrats. Without bipartisan support, the bill couldn\u2019t reach the 60 votes needed to end debate on it and to advance to a pass-or-fail roll call.\n\nSo Democrats and a handful Republicans - on Feb. 14, 2018 - introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would muster enough bipartisan backing to pass the 60-vote cloture rule. The measure called for $25 billion in border spending over 10 years for wall construction and a host of other security measures. The bill, however, did not address Trump\u2019s demands to end the lottery and narrow family-based immigration.\n\nOn Feb. 15, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement threatening Trump would veto the substitute bill. Trump, in tweets, called the bill \"a total catastrophe,\" that would create \"mass amnesty for over 10 million illegal aliens, including criminals.\"\n\nThe Washington Post and The New York Times reported that Trump also objected that the bill would allocate the $25 billion over 10 years, instead of all at once.\n\nLater that day, the bill failed. Although a bipartisan group of 54 senators voted for cloture - a majority - they came short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Minutes later, the Republican bill backed by Trump also died.\n\nCongress failed to reach the March 5 deadline to protect DACA, but the phase-out of the program has put on hold by several courts.\n\nKaine said, \"We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal.\"\n\nHe\u2019s referring to a 2018 bill backed by Senate Democrats and a few Republicans that would have provided $25 billion over a decade to significantly expand the wall and fund other programs to improve Southern border security.\n\nTrump vehemently opposed the bill and threatened to veto it because it did not contain two immigration reforms he demanded: ending the visa lottery and deeply restricting family-based immigration.\n\nWe quibble, however, with Kaine\u2019s use of the term \"deal,\" which suggests everything was guaranteed for passage if the president went along. Republicans lawmakers never made that promise. It was really a proposal.\n\nSo we rate Kaine's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
