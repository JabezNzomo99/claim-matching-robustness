There\u2019s also a social media post by someone called Serena Williams getting a lot of attention at the moment in the US and elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe post shows a screenshot of a Facebook post. The screenshot has been shared on Instagram with a banner that tags the @serenawilliams Instagram page of the sports star.\n\nThe Facebook post itself, from someone called Serena Williams, starts with \u201cI\u2019m sick of covid-19, I\u2019m sick of black vs. white, I\u2019m sick of Democrats vs. Republican, I\u2019m sick of gay vs. straight. I\u2019m sick of Christian vs atheist. I\u2019m really sick of the media.\u201d\n\nIt continues with statements that people should support whoever they wish in the upcoming US election and believe in God if they wish, before ending with: \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the fact that you may have a friend that has opposing views as you, then you are not any better than the bigots and the racists. I don\u2019t have to agree with everything you believe to be a decent human being & your friend\u201d.\n\nThe posts have been viewed more than 450,000 times and have been shared by multiple accounts including here and here.\n\nAs issues including COVID-19 lockdowns, the Black Lives Matter protests and the November US Presidential election continue to divide opinions all over the world, Facebook users have been sharing a post that seems to be from champion tennis player Serena Williams imploring people to be respectful of others\u2019 beliefs.\n\nThe 23-time women\u2019s Grand Slam champion has actually been an outspoken figure on issues to do with race and inequality, tweeting a Nike message in May with the line \u201cDon\u2019t pretend there\u2019s not a problem in America\u201d and posting a lengthy discussion about inequality in the United States in June.\n\nHowever the Serena Williams on the account that posted the text is not the tennis champion, as clearly evident from the bio of the original poster\u2019s Facebook page, which states: \u201cNope, not THAT Serena Williams\u201d.\n\nThe post has been edited twice since appearing on June 15. First to add the hashtag \u201c#repost\u201d to the text and later to add an attribution to another Facebook user who appears to have first posted the text on June 3, 2020.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the original post was presented as being from the high-profile tennis player however reposts have tagged her Instagram and Twitter accounts, indicating people believe the post to have come from her.\n\nThe post does not appear on the official Serena Williams Facebook page.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck finds some reshares and versions of the post to be misleading. The Facebook post is indeed by a person named Serena Williams but not the famous tennis player. There is no suggestion that the original post was presented as being from tennis champ Williams, however some reshares have tagged the sports champion\u2019s accounts. Partly False \u2013 The claim of the content is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete.\n\n * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
