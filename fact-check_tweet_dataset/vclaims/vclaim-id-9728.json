Of course not, the story is made up and originated from an article on a satire website.\n\nIt was published by the Southened News Network on March 26, 2018 titled \"Corbyn in new anti-Semitism row after asking man at bus stop: What time's the bus Jew?\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn is embroiled in a fresh anti-Semitism row today after it emerged that on Friday evening he was overheard saying, 'What time's the bus Jew?' According to reports, Corbyn was talking with a gentleman in his fifties at a bus stop close to Islington Town Hall, and witnesses were said to be 'shocked' at the MP's behaviour. One said, 'Before he uttered that disgusting sentence, he was saying a range of other incredibly hateful things about Jews.' 'He admitted that he'd never tried a bagel, and he even said that he could 'take or leave' Neil Diamond.'\n\nThe story looked quite realistic to people who only saw it on social media with no indication that it was satire:\n\nBut the phrase \"What time's the bus Jew\" or \"When's the bus Jew\" is part of a racist joke that's been around for quite some time and which has several variations which we are not going to list here but you can Google for them if you're so inclined. It is unlikely Corbyn would have really used the phrase.\n\nHowever Corbyn is implicated in an actual row about \"pockets of anti-semitism\" in the Labour Party according to the BBC:\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Jewish groups have said in a letter accusing Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. The Labour leader has said he is \"sincerely sorry\" for the pain caused by \"pockets of anti-Semitism\" in the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn said he would be meeting representatives of the Jewish community to \"rebuild\" confidence in his party.\n\nWe wrote about other southendnewsnetwork.net satire articles that got taken for real news before, here are the most recent ones:\n\u2022 Fake News: Government Did NOT Confirm All UK schoolchildren Must Learn Arabic Numerals (Only Now...)\n\u2022 Fake News: Chinese Restaurant Owner NOT Arrested Over Cat in Window Doing Nazi Salute\n\u2022 Fake News: UK Parents Will NOT Be Fined for Every Child Missing School Because of the Snow\n\u2022 Fake News: BBC Did NOT Add Permanent Arabic Subtitles to Eastenders to Help Refugees Settle In\n\nThe Southend News Network is a satirical site pretending to be a news organisation by the English coast in Southend.
