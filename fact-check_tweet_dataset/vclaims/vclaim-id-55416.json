However, the nationalities of the attackers were not disclosed in any reports. The attackers were referred to as \u2018foreign nationals\u2019, or \u2018shop owners\u2019.\n\nOn August 2, a Facebook page posted that Nigerians attacked South African Police, claiming that Johannesburg belongs to them. The 29 seconds clip showed a large crowd of people chasing and stoning the police vans as they exit the scene. The caption read in full:\n\nThe post which attained over 2.9K shares and 558 likes was met with distasteful reactions and derogatory remarks in the comments section. Apparently, Nigerians do not like to be slandered, but were they?\n\nDubawa\u2019s research findings show that this video was also published by a News24 on Youtube, a day before it was posted on the Facebook page and was captioned differently. The caption read: \u201cWATCH: Joburg shop owners turn on cops trying to confiscate \u2018fake\u2019 goods\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, a report by the aforementioned South African news site- News24 which accompanied the same video was discovered. According to the publication, a raid by the police on shop owners alleged to be trading fake goods went awry. This police most definitely were not expecting such a retaliatory show of force from shop owners. A display that led to the vandalization of three police mobiles.\n\nThis report by All4women also corroborates this incident. The report which was published on the 2nd of August, explained how policemen raided shops who were alleged to be selling fake goods. The shop owners in question were foreign nationals, according to the report. The same shop owners charged at the police amid attempts to confiscate their shop goods. Luckily, no death or injuries were recorded\n\nAlso, platforms like Allafrica.com and Nigerianslivinginsouthafrica also threw their hats in the ring in reporting the story. Both making reference to the original publication on the South African news Site, News24.\n\nHow did authorities respond to the incident?\n\nIn response to the attack, the Police in Gauteng have arrested 560 undocumented foreign nationals in a second raid subsequently after the failed first attempt. This is according to the CNN report, published on the 8th of August.\n\nAccording to the CNN report, the nationalities of the arrested were not disclosed. Another report by Dailysun.co.za has it that over 1500 officers were deployed to the venue and five vehicles, which contained counterfeit goods were confiscated.\n\nA police Statement revealed that the raid was a joint operation by the Police and other law enforcement agencies in Gauteng. This comprised of the Provincial Traffic Police and Saturation Unit, the Immigration Officers (Home Affairs), SARS Customs, the Joburg Metro Police Department, and clothing brand owners.\n\nSuccinctly, the action was taken in a bid to end criminal activities and the sales of fake commodities in the Centre Business District of Johannesburg. This is buttressed in the statement by South African Police Minister Bheki Cele:\n\nRegardless, the public are of the opinion that caution should be taken in these matters so as not to inadvertently propagate xenophobia. This is seen in a post by this twitter user who advised the Police not to cause xenophobia in a bid to address the crimes.\n\nYes, South African Police were attacked in Johannesburg as shown in the video. However, the nationalities of the attackers were not disclosed in any credible incident reports. The attackers were referred to as \u2018foreign Nationals\u2019 and/or \u2018Shop Owners\u2019. More so, in the link referenced by the Facebook user, there is no mention of the word- \u2018Nigerian\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
