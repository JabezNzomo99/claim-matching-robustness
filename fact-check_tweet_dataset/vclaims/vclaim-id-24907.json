The claim is false; the clip shows people fleeing their cars on the Indonesian island of Ternate after an earthquake struck the Molucca sea.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on July 9, 2019. It has been viewed more than 82,000 times and shared more than one thousand times.\n\nThe Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA magnitude-4.0 earthquake occurred in Sabah. The people in the cars rushed to open spaces.\u201d\n\nSabah is a Malaysian state on the island of Borneo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe 15-second video shows a woman, who is holding a baby, getting out of a vehicle and running towards a structure sheltering toll booths. Some other people can be seen running past her in the same direction.\n\nThe video was also shared here and here on Facebook with the same claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A reverse image search for keyframes of the video obtained using video analysis tool InVid found the clip had previously circulated in reports about an earthquake in Ternate, in the Indonesian province of North Maluku.\n\nThe footage was published on video-licensing platform Newsflare on July 7, 2019, here. The first two sentences of the caption read: \u201cA powerful 6.9 magnitude quake was felt in Indonesia on July 7. The shaking caused panic in the city of Ternate in Maluku islands which are close to the quake's epicenter.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) with the clip published by Newsflare (R):\n\nOn July 7, 2019, the USGS recorded a 6.9-magnitude earthquake in the Molucca Sea, 133 kilometres west of Ternate city. The data can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\nIndonesian outlet KompasTV reported on the incident on July 7, 2019, here, with the same clip used repeatedly. The clip is embedded below.\n\nThe first sentence for the caption of the video, translated from Indonesian, reads: \u201cA magnitude-7 earthquake occurred in Ternate, North Maluku.\u201d\n\nNo earthquakes were registered in Malaysia on the date the first misleading post was published -- or in the month to July 17.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) measures earthquakes around the world and makes the information publicly available. Its database of earthquakes can also be searched by date and location.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of an earthquake search AFP conducted on the USGS website -- encompassing Sabah and hundreds of kilometres around it.\n\nThe search returned the results in the screenshot below. The blue square was added later to approximately indicate the location of Sabah state.\n\nOrange dots represent the sole quake that happened on July 17 -- the day the search was conducted -- yellow dots are quakes that occurred within a week of the search, while white dots are quakes that hit within a month of the search. Larger dots represent larger quakes.", "lang": "en"}
