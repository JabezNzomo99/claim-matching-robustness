It is also the case that more deprived councils have a greater need for social care.\n\nThis particular figure is correct, based on analysis done by Localis, a think tank. It found that there was roughly 3.5 times the difference between the council which could raise the most by increasing council tax and the council which could raise the least. It does warn that the estimates aren\u2019t precise.\n\nThe social care precept was introduced in the Spending Review 2015 and allows councils to increase their council tax by up to 2% to pay for social care in their area.\n\nWhen it was first announced the government said that by 2019/20 these powers could raise \u00a32 billion a year if all councils used it fully.\n\n144 of the 152 councils in England responsible for social care (95%) used these powers raising an extra \u00a3382 million for adult social care in 2016/17.\n\nLast year just under \u00a317 billion was spent on all adult social care by councils in England. Of this money around \u00a37 billion was spent on support for people over 65.\n\nIn December the government announced that councils will be given powers to increase council tax by 3% in 2017/18 and then again in 2018/19. Councils won\u2019t be allowed to raise any more money than they were already allowed to until 2020, they will just be allowed to introduce the increases more quickly and then they will level off in 2019/20.\n\nThe government has said that it expects these rises to provide \u00a3208 million for adult social care in 2017/18 and \u00a3444 million in 2018/19. Including other funding for social care provided over the next two years it says there will be up to \u00a3900 million available which wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has calculated this increase slightly differently and told us this was because it considered the impact of inflation on the rises. It also looked at the impact of changes to other grants and bonuses which affect how much councils pay for social care. They found that the increase in social care funding for councils over the next two years could be around \u00a3700 million.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund, a health think tank, has said that this money will be \u201cnowhere near enough to address next year\u2019s funding gap.\u201d We\u2019ve written about the funding gap before.\n\nWhat did the analysis find?\n\nLocalis looked at which local authorities would be able to raise the most and the least by increasing council taxes, per person in their area over the age of 65. It compared the 2011 census figures for each local authority with the council tax collected in each over the course of 2015/16.\n\nIt found that City of London would be able to raise the most, \u00a3204 per person, if council tax went up by 3%. The council who would raise the least was Dudley near Birmingham at \u00a358 per person.\n\nIt does describe this analysis as \u201cvery rough\u201d, particularly as adult social care budgets are spent on all adults, not just the over 65s.\n\nWhat else has been said?\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund found that the ten least deprived councils in England will raise almost two and a half times as much as the ten most deprived.\n\nThe Health Foundation, another think tank, also found that in 2016/17 the 10 wealthiest local authorities will raise 50% more per head than the 10 least wealthy.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund has also said that income deprivation among older people is a good indicator of how much social care is needed in that area. The Health Foundation agrees that the more deprived older people are, the more they will need it, but by extension the less the council is likely to be able to raise in council taxes.\n\nHealth experts have said that adjustments to the Better Care Fund, currently used to redistribute money from the NHS to pay for social care, will cover some of the disparity between wealthier and less affluent councils. But they\u2019ve also said that it is not clear how these changes will be made yet and that it won\u2019t happen until at least 2017/18.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about social care funding here.", "lang": "en"}
