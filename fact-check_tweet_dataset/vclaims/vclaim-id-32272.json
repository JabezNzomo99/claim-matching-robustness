It also states that the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay on January 18, although it omits the year, which was 1788.\n\nIt then states that \u201cthe 26th was chosen as Australia day for a different reason\u201d without mentioning what that reason is.\n\nThe post goes on to say that in the \u201cextravagant bicentenary celebrations of 1988\u201d Sydney-siders \u201cdecided Captain Cook\u2019s landing should become the focus of the Australia Day commemoration\u201d.\n\nProfessor Helen Irving, a constitutional law expert from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the post is \u201cfull of confusions\u201d.\n\nProf Irving said the 1988 bicentenary marked the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney in 1788.\n\n\u201cThe first boat of the First Fleet landed at Botany Bay on 18 January, 1788, but the Fleet then moved to Port Jackson (what became Sydney), where on 26 January 1788, the British flag was raised,\u201d she told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cIt was the First Fleet\u2019s arrival in 1788 that was marked at (the bicentenary) in 1988, not Cook\u2019s arrival.\u201d\n\nReports and photos from and about 1988 show the First Fleet was the focus of Sydney Harbour bicentenary celebrations.\n\nAnother claim in the post is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people born after January 1, 1921 gained the status of \u201cBritish subjects\u201d under the Nationality Act 1920.\n\nA report titled, \u2018Australian citizenship: a chronology of major developments in policy and law\u2019 in the Australian parliamentary library states the Nationality Act 1920 \u201cintroduced a definition of a \u2018natural born\u2019 British subject and residence requirements for naturalisation\u201d.\n\nThese requirements for being a British subject included being born in a country ruled by the king or allied with the king, having a father who was a British subject, or being born on a British ship.\n\nHowever, Prof Irving said everyone born in Australia before the Nationality Act 1920 was already considered a British subject under common law.\n\n\u201cThe 1920 Nationality Act simply put this common law principle into legislation for the first time,\u201d she said.\n\nOn January 26, 1949, the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect. This law created Australian citizenship and the conditions by which it could be acquired.\n\nThe post claims that before the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 was enacted, Aboriginal people in Australia were not protected by law.\n\nProf Irving told AAP FactCheck that under the 1948 Act, everyone born in Australia became simultaneously Australian citizens and British subjects.\n\n\u201cThere was no distinction between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians,\u201d she said.\n\nProf Irving said Aboriginal people held British subject status before 1948, in common with other Australians, and after 1948 they held Australian citizenship.\n\n\u201cAs subjects/citizens, they were subject to and protected by the law in the same manner as non-Aboriginal Australians,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAboriginal people were certainly subject to special laws that applied to them specifically as Aboriginal Australians, and these laws were often oppressive and discriminatory, but these laws did not discriminate on the basis of the holding or not holding of citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe Nationality and Citizenship Act took effect on January 26, 1949 and the post claims this is the reason why Australia marks its national day on that date.\n\nProf Irving told AAP FactCheck the claim was incorrect as Australia Day was already celebrated on January 26 before 1948.\n\n\u201cThe date was not chosen to celebrate the proclamation of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRather, the 26th of January was chosen as the date of the proclamation of the Act because it was already celebrated as Australia Day.\u201d\n\nA parliamentary research paper by Margaret Harrrison-Smith notes that Tasmania celebrated \u201cFoundation Day\u201d on January 26 from 1888. Victoria and Western Australia also celebrated the date in the early 1900\u2019s and in 1930 the Australian Natives\u2019 Association suggested an annual \u201cAustralia Day\u201d celebration.\n\nA year later Victoria first adopted the name \u2018Australia Day\u2019 and since 1946, January 26 \u201chas been recognised throughout Australia as Australia Day and a public holiday taken on or around that date,\u201d according to the research paper.\n\nIn September 1948, then-immigration minister Arthur Calwell told federal parliament that when the Nationality and Citizenship Act became law \u201cit will be proclaimed on Australia Day, the 26th of January, 1949\u201d.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post makes several inaccurate or misleading claims. The claim that Australia Day \u201cdoes not celebrate the arrival of the First Fleet\u201d is wrong according to a history professor, the Australia Day Council and Tourism Australia. Contrary to the claim that Australians became British subjects when the Nationality Act 1920 was enacted, constitutional law professor Helen Irving said Australians were already subjects under common law. And Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders did not become \u201cprotected by the law\u201d under the 1948 citizenship legislation but rather had already been subject to the law as British subjects. Finally, January 26, 1949 was not chosen as Australia Day to mark the enactment of the Nationality and Citizenship Act, rather the date of January 26 was chosen for the new laws to take effect because it already had significance as a day of national celebration.
