The claim in false; the photos show next generation and commemorative coins that were minted by the Philippine central bank.\n\nThe photos were published on Facebook here on October 27, 2019. The post has been shared more than 31,000 times.\n\nThe images purport to show new coins in circulation, including a 5,000-peso coin, which would amount to approximately US$100.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post, with the coin photos numbered by AFP:\n\nThe post's Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cHeard these are the new money now seriously they made everything coins\".\n\nSeveral Facebook posts, for example here and here, have shared the same photos with similar captions that claim the Philippine currency is now coin-based. The same photos have also been shared on Twitter here.\n\nBut the claim is false; a review of the Philippine central bank\u2019s official website shows the coins were minted as new generation and commemorative coins.\n\nThe first photo, while it does not appear on the central bank\u2019s website, is a commemorative coin that is not in circulation, the bank said.\n\n\u201cThe said coin is a commemorative non-circulation coin, minted to commemorate the 165th anniversary the Bank of the Philippine Islands,\u201d a bank spokesperson said in an email to AFP on November 22.\n\nThe rest of the coins pictured in the misleading Facebook posts are listed on the website of the central bank, which maintains the sole legal authority to issue new currency under Philippine law.\n\nThe second photo shows a new generation coin that was released by the bank on March 26, 2018. It is shown here in a media release, which states that the coin was minted to improve \u201caesthetics and security.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the second photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the corresponding photo from the central bank\u2019s press release (R):\n\nThe third and fifth photos appear on this central bank page about commemorative currency, which the bank explains are expensive coins minted to \u201chonor a specific person or recognize the significance of a place or event that made a mark in the history of Philippines.\u201d\n\nThe third photo shows 1,500-peso and 5,000-peso coins that were minted to commemorate the 1970s-era \u201cbagong lipunan\u201d or \u201cnew society\u201d, a term used by the late dictator, former President Ferdinand Marcos, for his vision of an improved Philippines. The fifth photo shows 50-peso and 1,000-peso coins that were also minted to recognize the \u201cnew society.\u201d\n\nThe central bank notes that these coins, which bear the faces of Marcos and his wife Imelda, remained legal tender up until April 30, 2019.\n\nThe fourth photo shows a limited edition 500-peso papal coin minted to commemorate Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the Philippines in 2015. It is shown in this central bank media release, alongside a commemorative 50-peso papal coin.\n\nThe coins were released on January 14, 2015 and were created under a license agreement from the Vatican, the press release states.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the third, fourth and fifth photos in the misleading post (L) and their corresponding photos from the central bank\u2019s website (R):", "lang": "en"}
