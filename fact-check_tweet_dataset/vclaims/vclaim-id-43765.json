Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s tool that identifies suspicious posts shared across the platform, also flagged 15 other online posts that carry the same message.\n\nThe facts: The management of SM MOA said the mall\u2019s foundation is not compromised, and that their senior managers have not called for any meetings with their engineers. Local authorities also say there are no reported incidents of visible building damage.\n\nIn a statement on January 12, the official Facebook account of the mall said that the MOA complex is on normal operations. \u201cThere is no truth to the information circulating on Social Media that the foundation of the Mall of Asia Complex has been compromised,\u201d it said.\n\nA day after, the mall released another statement that addressed the chain message: \u201cThe foundation of the SM Mall of Asia Complex is built on concrete piles that reach the bedrock and will withstand extreme situations. The statement where water will make the building collapse is patently false.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also have rigorous annual checks to ensure the safety of the buildings so at no time will the safety of our customers, tenants, and employees be compromised,\u201d the mall added.\n\nThe SM MOA Police Community Precinct also confirmed to Rappler that there had been no incidents reported to their station that may indicate such building damage as of January 14.", "lang": "en"}
