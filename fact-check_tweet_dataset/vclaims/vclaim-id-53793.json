His mind goes blank and he doesn\u2019t remember what he\u2019s supposed to do next. He\u2019s deep into his degenerative neurological disease \u2014 Frontotemporal dementia \u2014 mindlessly lumbering and zigzagging in the grass toward the puddle.\"\n\nBut the 12-second clip, which is from 2019, was deceptively edited to make it look like Trump is wandering aimlessly for no reason. He wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The couple then walk together to board the helicopter.\n\nThe clip was labeled as manipulated media on Twitter shortly after it surfaced.", "lang": "en"}
