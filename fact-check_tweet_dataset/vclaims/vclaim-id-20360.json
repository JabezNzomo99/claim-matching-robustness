But receipts could well have been higher if the rates hadn\u2019t been cut.\n\nAs we\u2019ve pointed out before, successive policy costings from the Office for Budget Responsibility since 2010 have suggested that the government would have collected more in tax if it hadn\u2019t lowered the rates. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies: \u201cCuts to corporation tax rates announced between 2010 and 2016 are estimated to reduce revenues by at least \u00a316.5 billion a year in the short to medium run.\u201d\n\nThese are the best figures we have, but they\u2019re also far from certain. Receipts depend on how big profits are, and these are hard to estimate. Cutting rates can also be beneficial to economic growth in the longer term, which in turn can mean bigger future receipts than would otherwise have happened.\n\nSo why have receipts been going up in spite of rates going down? The IFS points to several factors. Profits have been growing, so there\u2019s been more to tax. Policy measures have also led to increased income, for example through changes to reduce tax avoidance.\n\nThe most recent \u201cshooting up\u201d of tax receipts last year was due in particular to the growth in companies\u2019 profits and the introduction of a Bank Surcharge, according to HM Revenue and Customs.", "lang": "en"}
