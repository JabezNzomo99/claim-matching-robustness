Describing their alleged efforts as \u201cselfless dedication\u201d, it circulated three photographs of RSS workers with the caption \u2013 \u201cOpen your eyes and you will see Swayam Sevaks all around eleven districts of the State of Kerala.\u201d The post has 2,400 likes and 1,400 shares.\n\nThe images have also been circulated by individual users on Twitter who are followed by Office of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal (1,2,3). They have combined retweets of over 750.\n\nThe images widely circulated were taken during RSS and Seva Bharti workers providing aid to victims of Kollam Temple fire. The official Facebook page of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had shared the photographs in 2016.\n\nPostcard News was taken down by Facebook in July, following which it began sharing its content through a page named Post Card Fans that was earlier called \u201cAtal Bihari Vajpayee Fans\u201d. Apart from the aforementioned images, it shared another one with the identical narrative of \u201cRSS workers providing aid during Kerala floods\u201d.\n\nThis image pertains to a relief work carried out during a landslide in Idduki, Kerala in 2013.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents but Postcard News has circulated old images related to RSS relief work in the past as well. Recently, it circulated the same image it had shared in 2016 as Bihar floods as RSS relief work in Kerala.\n\nEarlier, the official Facebook page of RSS shared a six-year-old image as Seva Bharti workers providing aid in recent Kerala floods. It has become a trend to circulate old images of relief work during calamities to gain commendation on social media.", "lang": "en"}
