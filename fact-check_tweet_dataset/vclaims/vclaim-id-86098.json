So when Trump and NARAL Pro-Choice America seemed to use similar statistics to make opposite points on abortion rights, it caught our attention. NARAL tweeted, \u201cThe reality is that 7 in 10 Americans\u201d support \u201cRoe v. Wade and the right to legal abortion.\u201d Trump said abortion was \u201ca 50/50 question\u201d while speaking about his Supreme Court nominee.\n\nNumerous polls look at Americans\u2019 attitudes toward abortion rights. As our colleagues at The Washington Post polling desk pointed out to us, results depend significantly on the questions that pollsters ask. That\u2019s because Americans\u2019 attitudes on abortion rights are very stable but nuanced. To untangle what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s look at polls conducted after the 2016 election that asked in slightly different ways about upholding Roe v. Wade and the legality of abortion.\n\nThere\u2019s a distinction between supporting the court\u2019s ruling and supporting \u201cthe right to legal abortion.\u201d One reason might be that people who oppose the idea of abortion may accept that it\u2019s settled as a matter of law. Pew researcher Hannah Fingerhut wrote, \u201cSupport for maintaining Roe v. Wade is somewhat higher than broader measures of public support for legal abortion, but the overall patterns of opinion are similar.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac University asked the question slightly differently in late June, just as Kennedy announced his retirement: \u201cIn general, do you agree or disagree with the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion?\u201d Put that way, 63 percent of respondents said they did. A poll from late 2017 found that 60 percent of Americans thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nA Gallup poll released July 12, just before Trump introduced Kavanaugh as his nominee, found that 64 percent of Americans want Roe v. Wade to stand. In a separate poll from May, Gallup found that 79 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal under certain circumstances (50 percent) or under all circumstances (29 percent). In a follow-up question to the \u201ccertain circumstances\u201d group, most respondents said it should be legal \u201c\u2018only in a few\u2019 rather than \u2018most\u2019 circumstances.\u201d\n\nThis distinction is important. For example, a separate series of Gallup questions found support for legal abortion ranging widely depending on circumstances: from as low as 20 percent during the third trimester if the woman does not want the child for any reason to 83 percent during the first trimester if the woman\u2019s life is in danger.\n\nLet\u2019s review. NARAL said \u201cthe reality is that 7 in 10 Americans\u201d support \u201cRoe v. Wade and the right to legal abortion.\u201d Focusing on the wording of the poll questions above, this claim wraps two connected but different findings into one: the share of Americans who specifically support upholding Roe v. Wade and the share who support the right to get an abortion more generally. If the court\u2019s decision were to be overturned, abortion rights would not dissipate; rather they would be decided state by state.\n\nThese four recent polls showed that about 70 percent of Americans said Roe v. Wade should not be overturned, but when asked whether abortion should be legal in all or most cases, support was between 54 percent and 60 percent, not 70 percent as NARAL indicated. When we asked for additional evidence, NARAL pointed us toward a 2014 poll they had commissioned and to the Kaiser Family Foundation and Pew polls we reviewed above. While NARAL\u2019s poll found that 7 in 10 Americans said abortion should be available in most cases, it is four years old now, had a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points and used a sample of 501 voters in the Kansas City media market. The more recent polls do not support this claim.\n\nAs for the president, where is he finding a 50/50 split? Other than the specific Gallup questions covering various circumstances under which a woman might seek an abortion, the only polls we saw that found an even split were examining the morality of abortion and how Americans self-identify on this issue \u2014 not the legality. But as we noted, polling results are sensitive to the specific wording of the questions, and it\u2019s very different to ask about morality and personal views on one hand and legal rights and court rulings on the other.\n\nWhen we asked the White House for specifics on what exactly Trump meant, the White House pointed us to a May 2018 Gallup poll that found 48 percent of Americans identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d and 48 percent identify as \u201cpro-life.\u201d In other words, the president was talking about how Americans personally identify, not what they think should happen either to Roe v. Wade or abortion rights more broadly.\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, defended the president\u2019s use of the 50-50 metric. \u201cAbortion advocates are peddling polling that suggests a majority of Americans do not think Roe v. Wade should be overturned,\u201d she told The Fact Checker via email. \u201cThis is a less effective way of measuring public sentiment on abortion, since it lacks a guarantee of requisite public knowledge. People know what \u2018abortion after the 5th month of pregnancy\u2019 means, but not necessarily what Roe v. Wade provides.\u201d As a pollster, she said, she found that the majority of Americans did not know what the decision provided.\n\nBy conflating two different data points \u2014 support for Roe v. Wade and support for abortion rights generally \u2014 NARAL glossed over these nuances. For his part, Trump\u2019s claim that abortion is \u201ca 50/50 question\u201d was vague \u2014 did he mean on the legal issues? How Americans self-identify on the issue? The context of his remark (a Supreme Court nomination) suggests the former, but the White House said he meant the latter.", "lang": "en"}
