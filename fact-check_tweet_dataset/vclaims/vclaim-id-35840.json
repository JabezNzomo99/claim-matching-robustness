In the video, a few youngsters shout slogans against Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: People shout out slogans against Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and CAA after AAP victory in Delhi elections 2020. Fact: The results of the 2020 Delhi Elections were declared on 11 February 2020, and AAP has emerged victorious in the elections. But, the video is found to exist on the internet at least since 21 January 2020. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) has declared the results of 2020 Delhi Assembly Elections on 11 February 2020 and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has emerged victorious winning 62 out of 70 seats.\n\nWhen the video was uploaded on \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes of it were obtained. On subjecting those keyframes to Google reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe was obtained in a video on YouTube. The video had the title \u2018Slogans against CAA at Delhi metro\u2019 and was uploaded on 21 January 2020. But when searched more about the video, information from no credible source was found. As the video was found to exist prior to the declaration of Delhi Assembly Election results, it can be concluded that the claim about the video is false.\n\nTo summarize, an old video is being shared as \u2018incident in Delhi after the victory of AAP in the 2020 Delhi Elections\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
