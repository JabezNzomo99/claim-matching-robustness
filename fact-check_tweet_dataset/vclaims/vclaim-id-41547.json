He claimed that a Muslim woman was manhandled and harassed by RSS workers.\n\nThe clip was also shared by other Pakistani politicians.\n\nThe same clip was earlier viral in India as well with identical claim alleging the incident took place in the counrty \u2014 \u201c\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u094b \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u0928\u092b\u0930\u0924 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0907\u0938 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0940\u0924\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0938\u092c\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092f\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u093e \u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942 \u0907\u0902\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e\u201d (What is happening in this country such hatred for Muslims is this how you will win everyone\u2019s trust is this your New India?)\n\nThe above tweet, posted on July 7, 2019 has now been deleted. The handle had tagged PM Narendra Modi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and the PMO in the tweet.\n\nAlt News found that the same video had been uploaded by a Twitter user in November 2015, claiming that the incident took place in France.\n\nOn Facebook, the video had been posted in October 2015 by a Moroccan social media influencer calling the young men seen in the video as \u201canimals\u201d. The video has been viewed over 475,000 times since then.\n\nThose who have shared the video have suggested that this is an instance of bigotry and hate against the Muslim community. The video and message have also been shared on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News found that the video in question is not from India. An October 2015 article published in Morocco World News claimed that teenage boys attacked a woman with eggs, flour and water on Ashura Day in Casablanca, Morocco. Ashura Day is the tenth day of Muharram.\n\nAnother website 5pillarsuk.com also claimed in an October 2015 article that the woman was attacked in Morocco.\n\nA subsequent keyword search led us to a fact-check published by the French television network France24 in October 2015, which said that while the incident occurred in Morocco, it was not a case of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 as alleged. It states, \u201cWhile throwing eggs and flour may seem violent and mean to most viewers, these are common practices amongst young Moroccans on the Day of Ashura, a religious holiday. On this holy day, Moroccan kids throw all kinds of things including firecrackers, eggs and sometimes even soap. The fun and games occasionally turn to chaos, which is one of the reasons that many Moroccans aren\u2019t fans of the holiday.\u201d\n\nFrance24 further reported that a second video had been posted by the young men seen in the video after it caused a controversy. In this second video, these young men stated that they were only having fun and that they were wrongly accused of assaulting the woman. The woman seen in the first video had also appeared in this second video in which she \u201cseemed to support their version of events\u201d. This set of event, however, could not be confirmed by Alt News as the second video is no longer available.\n\nToward the end, France24 states, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know if her participation in the second video was forced. It\u2019s also impossible to know if she did indeed feel in danger when the boys ganged up on her or if it was all just child\u2019s play, as they suggest. However, it\u2019s clear that the boys\u2019 actions were not motivated by Islamophobia, as alleged by some websites and Internet users.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that the viral video is from 2015 and is unrelated to India in any way. According to media reports from 2015, the incident had occurred in Morocco.", "lang": "en"}
