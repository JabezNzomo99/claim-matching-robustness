Christopher Lawrence \u201cBong\u201d Go saying media giant ABS-CBN should not have \u201churt President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s feelings\u201d if it did not want to get shut down.\n\nThe fabricated post surfaced two days after the committee on legislative franchises of the House of Representatives for a fresh 25-year franchise.\n\nDisputing the claim that the president supposedly did not have a hand in the denial of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise, Paredes tweeted on July 12 a screenshot of a quote card allegedly published by Rappler. Superimposed on Go\u2019s image was text that read:\n\nParedes\u2019 tweet has garnered more than 2,600 retweets and 9,000 likes, with some of the netizens criticizing the \u201coversensitivity\u201d of the president in the replies.\n\nTwo private FB users uploaded the same \u201cRappler\u201d graphic a day earlier, which, collectively, has been shared over 600 times. The page No To Marcos Burial At Libingan NG MGA Bayani posted its copy on July 13.\n\nRappler published no such graphic. Similarly, no other news sources or official records show Go saying the statement attributed to him in the circulating quote card. \n\n\n\nHowever, the senator has indeed mentioned the president\u2019s \u201churt feelings\u201d in the past. During the Feb. 24 Senate hearing on ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise, the former special aide to the president said Duterte by ABS-CBN\u2019s airing of negative political ads about him back when he was running for the position in 2016.\n\nA quote card that carried a similar but longer version of the fabricated statement was also debunked by VERA Files in May. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Bong Go quote on ABS-CBN shutdown FAKE )\n\nA reverse image search revealed the image of Go was taken from Rappler\u2019s article on the House\u2019s probe on Malasakit Centers, Go\u2019s pet project when he was still Duterte\u2019s aide. It did not carry a superimposed quote.\n\nThe fake graphic emerged after the House committee on legislative franchises denied ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise bid on after more than a dozen congressional hearings, each lasting hours. There were 70 votes in favor of denying the renewal, 11 votes against, one abstention and two inhibitions.\n\nThe outcome of the hearings received widespread condemnation from , , , and under the .\n\nOn May 5, a day after the expiration of ABS-CBN\u2019s 25-year franchise, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) served its against the network, stopping its broadcast operations on 42 television stations, 10 digital broadcast channels, 18 FM stations, and five AM stations. The non-renewal of the franchise affects . (See )\n\nThe NTC later issued on June 30 against ABS-CBN to halt the operations of its digital service under TV Plus in Metro Manila and Sky Direct\u2019s satellite broadcast nationwide.\n\nABS-CBN has been at the receiving end of Duterte's tirades since 2017, when he first threatened to block the network's franchise renewal after accusing it of \u201cswindling\u201d him and other candidates during the 2016 presidential elections.
