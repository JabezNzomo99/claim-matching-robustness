Not true.\n\u2022 Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That\u2019s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.\n\u2022 None Trump said Clinton made \u201ca terrible mistake on Libya\u201d when she was secretary of state. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\u2022 Trump cherry-picked Clinton\u2019s words when he claimed Clinton said \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.\n\nThe forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.\n\nTrump said he \u201cwas totally against the war in Iraq,\u201d while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don\u2019t support either candidate\u2019s strong assertions.\n\nOur review of Trump\u2019s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 \u2014 about six months before the war started.\n\nStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\n\nIn the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.\n\nAs for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump \u201csupported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.\u201d\n\nBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war \u201cafter it happened.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign cited Trump\u2019s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.\n\nCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war \u201clooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u201d and he predicted the market will \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn\u2019t offer an opinion.\n\nAs early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews\u201d about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, \u201cI guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\u201d\n\nClinton invited her audience to read Trump\u2019s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, \u201cDonald Trump and the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nTrump said President Barack Obama set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.\n\nNBC\u2019s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he\u2019s not going to give details because he wants to be \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Trump responded, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.\n\nAs we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d\n\nIn the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops \u201ca terrible decision.\u201d As we\u2019ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush\u2019s secretary of state, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.\n\nOnce Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn\u2019t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn\u2019t a deal to be made with Maliki.\n\nSo, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.\n\nTrump said that Obama\u2019s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \u201cthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\u201d when \u201chigh officials\u201d of a host country did not appear to greet the president.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.\n\nTrump referred to the fact that Cuba\u2019s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama\u2019s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China\u2019s handling of the president\u2019s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.\n\nWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.\n\nIn 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China\u2019s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u2018s \u201cFact Checker,\u201d who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s handling of Obama\u2019s visits were \u201cwithout precedent.\u201d Kessler said of Trump, \u201conce again he\u2019s wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\n\nKessler also noted that during Richard Nixon\u2019s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country\u2019s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn\u2019t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.\n\nClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.\n\nBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. \u201cI would not do that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Clinton\u2019s claim that he supports privatization.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign published \u201cThe Goals Of Donald J. Trump\u2019s Veterans Plan\u201d on its website last October. It doesn\u2019t call for the VA to be completely privatized.\n\nOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.\n\n\u201cUnder a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u2019s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\u201d the plan states.\n\n\u201cThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u2019 healthcare dollars,\u201d the plan says.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.\n\nTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent \u201cTen Point Plan To Reform The VA\u201d in July.\n\nPoint 10 of the plan says: \u201cMr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.\u201d\n\nTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.\n\nTo be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That\u2019s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.\n\nTrump criticized Clinton for making \u201ca terrible mistake on Libya\u201d when she was secretary of state. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\nTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be \u201cprepared on Day One,\u201d if elected president, to tackle \u201ccomplex national security issues.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.\n\nDuring the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had \u201cnever discussed that subject\u201d when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya \u201con a humanitarian basis\u201d and \u201cknock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.\u201d\n\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\n\nEven though Trump now says Clinton\u2019s support for intervention in Libya was a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d it doesn\u2019t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi\u2019s removal.\n\nTrump twisted Clinton\u2019s words when he claimed Clinton said \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system \u2014 including the issue of wait times for doctors \u2014 and what she would do to address them.\n\nTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as \u201cone of the big problems\u201d in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn\u2019t think the VA has problems.\n\nLauer interrupted, noting that Clinton \u201cwent on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted his version was accurate, adding, \u201cI\u2019m telling you \u2026 she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. \u201cThe reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,\u201d Maddow said.\n\nMaddow asked if Clinton had any \u201cnew ideas for trying to fix\u201d the VA. Here was Clinton\u2019s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.\n\nClinton: Yeah, and I don\u2019t understand that. You know, I don\u2019t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment. \u2026 Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have. Maddow: But in part because there has been real scandal. Clinton: There has been. And \u2013 but it\u2019s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA. But I think it goes deeper than that, because if you look at not only VA health care, but the backlog on disability determinations, there\u2019s something not working within the bureaucracy. And I have said I would like to literally appoint a SWAT team to bring in people and just tackle the disability, have an ongoing review of the care that is being given, do more to make sure that every VA hospital is delivering care to the highest standard of the community, because, unfortunately, some are doing a lot better job than others are.\n\nClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they \u201cwant it to fail\u201d so they can privatize it.\n\nClinton added, \u201cBut we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to \u201cfundamentally reform veterans\u2019 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\u201d The campaign says Clinton \u201cwas outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.\u201d The site specifically mentions Clinton\u2019s dissatisfaction that \u201c[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals\u201d and promises she will \u201c[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.\u201d\n\nTrump cherry-picked the part of Clinton\u2019s response that said problems in the VA have \u201cnot been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\u201d to make the blanket claim that Clinton is \u201csatisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration\u201d and that \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton\u2019s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA \u2014 including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.", "lang": "en"}
