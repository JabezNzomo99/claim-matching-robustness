Cardiac disease is classed as an indirect cause of death, whereas suicide has recently been reclassified as a direct cause of death. Direct deaths are \u201cfrom pregnancy-specific causes\u201d such as preeclampsia, whereas indirect deaths are \u201cfrom other medical conditions made worse by pregnancy\u201d.\n\nHowever, suicide isn\u2019t the main direct cause of death during pregnancy or within six weeks of giving birth. Between 2012 and 2014, 14 women died this way, compared to 16 who died from an \u2018amniotic fluid embolism\u2019 and 20 who died from \u2018thrombosis and thromboembolism\u2019. These are also classified as direct causes.\n\nWhere suicide overtakes other causes of death is between six weeks and one year after delivery, when it accounts for 15% of deaths\u2014more than any other pregnancy-related cause.", "lang": "en"}
