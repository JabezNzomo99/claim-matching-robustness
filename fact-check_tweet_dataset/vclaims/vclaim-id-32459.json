No, that's not true: It is a fantasy scenario that its creators claim would make \"Liberal heads explode,\" but it ignores section two of the 25th amendment to the U.S. constitution. That amendment provides that the president can nominate someone to fill a vice presidential vacancy, but the choice must be approved by majorities in both the senate and the house. If the house voted to impeach Trump and the senate voted by a two-thirds majority to remove him from office, it is a fantasy to expect that the same bodies would approve Trump's return as vice president.\n\nThe false claim originated as a t-shirt that transitioned into a meme (archived here) shared on September 29, 2019.

Gerald Ford, confirmed and sworn in as the new vice president. Ford enjoyed bipartisan support at a time when there were more across-the-ailse friendships in congress. When Ford became president upon the resignation of Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974, Ford chose former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller to replace him as vice president. It took congress four months to confirm Rockefeller.", "lang": "en"}
