When addressing the crowd, seemingly in reference to Tolson, he said, \"I have some advice for anyone who wants to be successful in their career: Hire and promote smart women. Because they\u2019ll get it done.\n\n\"We went about doing that in the beginning of the administration through [the] transition. We are well represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise.\"\n\nKenney has received both good and bad attention for his hiring. A month into his administration, Philadelphia Magazine noted that 55 percent of his appointees were women. The magazine also reported that 34 percent his appointees were people of color. Does that mean it\u2019s diverse?\n\nThere are multiple ways we could measure diversity in the Kenney administration. Using this organizational chart as a basis, PolitiFact PA estimates at least 60 percent of the administration\u2019s top brass is white, while some 50 percent are women. Exempt employees making more than $90,000, according to the city, are 61 percent white. Reacting to demographics for certain city departments, Council President Darrell Clarke called racial representation across execs .\n\nCity employees overall are 57 percent of color. (Philadelphia demographically is 44 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, seven percent Asian, one percent Native American or Pacific Islander, and 34 percent white.) The disparity between the racial makeup between high-level employees versus the overall workforce predates Kenney\u2019s term. that in 2015, 64 percent of Nutter adminstration staffers making more than $85,000 were white, comparable to the current admistration\u2019s numbers.\n\nThis issue is by no means unique to Philadelphia. Kenney is among a recent wave of American mayors tackling this City Hall hiring gap with new tactics, perhaps following the lead of Boston\u2019s Marty Walsh, Pittsburgh\u2019s Bill Peduto, and former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels. Kenney Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Nolan Atkinson, whom he named before taking office.\n\nMany observers might say that the disparity needs closer examination. (Kenney\u2019s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said as much before the mayor\u2019s swearing-in, in an email to Billy Penn last November.) Advocates and politicians have pointed to hiring practices and a less-than-ideal pipeline that\u2019s not tracking candidates of color for the top jobs. Also of interest: , 57 percent of Kenney\u2019s appointees, \"at least,\" had worked in the previous administration.\n\n\"[T]he City has some complicated, underlying barriers to racial and gender diversity, which the Mayor has acknowledged on multiple occasions,\" Mike Dunn, another city spokesperson, said in an email. \"It\u2019s why he created the position of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, so that is one office\u2019s full time responsibility to address these barriers in a systemic, focused way.\"\n\nDunn mentioned that Pew is currently studying their workforce diversity, looking into policy fixes and best practices. \"The outcome of the study will likely lead to changes made by the City to make city employment more representative of the population,\" Dunn wrote.\n\nKenney said his administration was \"well-represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise.\"\n\nPhiladelphia is where women constitute the majority of workers. It\u2019s a slight majority, and that\u2019s close to what Kenney\u2019s administration looks like. This is something for which Kenney has been celebrated. The other categories in his comment are another story, though.\n\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto gets praise\u2014 his administration has been called Pittsburgh\u2019s most diverse ever\u2014 for appointing a comparable percentage of blacks. But Pittsburgh is about two thirds white. Philadelphia is roughly two thirds of color.\n\nThe Kenney administration\u2019s numbers racially aren\u2019t representative of Philadelphia. Sixty-one percent of the city\u2019s top earners are white. While African-Americans are underrepresented, Asians and Latinos are even more so: Four percent of employees paid more than $90,000 are Hispanic; another four percent are Asian. In the city\u2019s population as a whole, those two groups represent more than 2.5 times that.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
