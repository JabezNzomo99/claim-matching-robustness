Finance minister Zainab Ahmed has said this is to cushion the country from\n\ndue to the Covid-19 pandemic and falling prices of oil, its top foreign exchange earner.\n\nin April 2020, Abubakar, who has vied for the presidency four times, made a number of statements to support his position. We fact-checked six.\n\nWe asked the former vice president to provide evidence for his claims and for clarifications where necessary. We will update this report when he responds.\n\nThe first cases of the novel coronavirus outside mainland China were reported in January 2020,\n\nNigeria spent N2.1 trillion (about US$6.9 billion at the current\n\n) to service its debt in 2019, according to the country\u2019s\n\n($5.5 billion) was for domestic debt, and\n\n, according to the country\u2019s\n\nsources such as oil and gas, value added tax, corporate tax and custom duty.\n\nTaken as a proportion of this revenue, about 44% was spent servicing debt. We therefore rate Abubakar\u2019s figure of 42% as mostly correct.\n\ntold Africa Check that while there are \u201cvalid reasons\u201d for the debt owed by the government, using nearly half of the country\u2019s earnings to repay it was unsound in the long run.\n\n\u201cIn the face of dwindling revenue, governments take loans for projects and to keep the country running. However, debt servicing taking over 40% of the country\u2019s earnings is not sustainable,\u201d Olomola, who teaches at the\n\nfocuses on the economic and social development of the continent.\n\nAbubakar said it was inevitable that Africa would take an economic hit from the pandemic, and said the agency had already revised growth projections for the region.\n\nA spokesperson for the commission, Privat Akochaye, directed Africa Check to a\n\npublished in April 2020. This showed that the agency had pared back its growth forecast for the region for 2020, from\n\nin a best-case scenario. But this could shrink to 0.1% or, in a worst-case scenario,\n\nThe commission therefore did revise its projections, though these forecasts tend to often change as more information becomes available.\n\nThe former VP\u2019s point was that a crash in the price of oil should not automatically \u201ctrigger a crisis\u201d.\n\nAbubakar took office as president Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s deputy on 29 May 1999, serving two terms until 2007.\n\nIn May 1999, the price of Nigeria\u2019s main crude oil export,\n\n, according to historical data from the\n\nthe day Abubakar\u2019s article was published, Bonny Light crude sold at\n\n. Strictly interpreted, Abubaka was accurate that the price of oil was lower in 1999.\n\nBe cautious when comparing oil prices, says economist\n\nBut comparing the prices of oil in 1999 and in 2020 should be done with caution, economics professor\n\n\u201cThere is a need to consider economic fundamentals such as the changes in the demand for the commodity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe US for instance was buying more crude oil from Nigeria in 1999 than it is buying today. It\u2019s not just about the price. Even if it rises to $100 per barrel, if there are no buyers, it would make no difference,\u201d he said.\n\n, Abubakar compared debt levels during his time as VP with those of the current administration of president Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen he exited office in 2007, Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt had been \u201cpaid off\u201d, Abubakar said. Is this accurate?\n\nA highlight of the Obasanjo administration was a debt cancellation deal it negotiated with the \u201c\n\nof the roughly $30 billion Nigeria had owed them at the end of 2004. This was 84% of the country\u2019s foreign debt\n\nNigeria still had to pay\n\n, according to the public announcement by the group, which\n\nNigeria also paid its debt to private banks known as the \u201cLondon Club\u201d in a similar deal. The country\u2019s\n\nin 2007. But this statement of accounts\n\nat the end of 2006 and\n\nat the end of 2007.\n\nThe data shows the Obasanjo government did not settle Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt as the VP claimed. They\n\nto a new government in May 2007. That year, Nigeria still spent more than\n\nAbubakar also faulted the recent approval of a reported N37 billion to renovate the national assembly, which he said was \u201cbuilt from scratch\u201d for less than a fifth of this.\n\nto spend this amount, approved in December 2019, is the subject\n\nin February 1996, with construction lasting two and a half years. The company that built it has given the value of the contract\n\nBut the value of Nigeria\u2019s currency has depreciated significantly over the years, economics professor\n\nWhen comparing the two figures, one \u201cshould consider factors such as changes in exchange rate and in the cost of construction equipment and material\u201d, the economist said.\n\nIn 1996 the exchange rate was\n\n. This means about $320 million was devoted to the construction of the complex.\n\nIn December 2019, when the renovation budget was approved, the official exchange rate was\n\nOlomola said the purchasing power of N7 billion in 1996 is likely to be more valuable than that of N37 billion today.\n\nBuilding costs higher in 2020 than 1996, says quantity surveying expert\n\nThe cost of building equipment and material has also generally increased over the years,\n\n, a professor of quantity surveying at the\n\nNyenke said that if he were provided with the same bill of quantity as in 1996, the cost of building it now \u201cwould be higher\u201d than N7 billion.\n\nBecause of the changes in these fundamentals, it is difficult to know for certain if the repair bill for the national assembly would be less than 20% what it cost to construct it.\n\nSo we rate this claim as unproven.\n\nThe hospital at the president\u2019s official residence is\n\nas being ill-equipped and barely functional despite being allocated a large budget every year.\n\n\u201cIt is virtually useless as we face the most significant public health challenge of our national life,\u201d Abubakar wrote,\n\nwas allocated to the hospital in the five years to 2020. A similar claim was published by\n\nThe budget allocation to the facility in the 2016 budget \u2013 the first of Buhari\u2019s administration \u2013 was\n\nwas budgeted for the hospital, and\n\nfor 2020.
