In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\u201d\n\nThe statement appears nowhere in Frankl\u2019s written works.\n\nFrankl was an Austrian psychiatrist who, in 1946, published the book \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning,\u201d in which he recounted his experiences in as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nHe wrote seven other books, but a keyword search of all these works, as well as \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning,\u201d turned up no matches. Franz Vesely, an archivist at the Viktor Frankl Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email the quote was not genuine.\n\n\u201cTo put it shortly, the author Stephen R. Covey used to recount that he found the quote in a library book,\u201d reads the Viktor Frankl Institute website, \u201cand thought it fitting to describe Frankl\u2019s views \u2014 but he did not note down the book\u2019s author and title.\u201d\n\nThe statement, linked to Frankl through Covey\u2019s summarization of his work, might actually come from psychologist Rollo May\u2019s 1963 behavioral science article \u201cFreedom and Responsibility Re-Examined,\u201d though the wording varies somewhat, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\nThematically related statements have appeared in print since at least 1917.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
