Elizabeth Warren next to a fake, Islamophobic quote condoning rape.\n\nAn old meme that has been debunked before is circulating again on Facebook.\n\nIt features a picture of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is one of many Democrats running for president, next to a quote that says: \u201cIf women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThe quote is fabricated, though. Nowhere in the public record is there evidence Warren made that statement \u2014 there are no news reports about it and those remarks are not found in the Congressional Record. Internet searches for those exact words turn up only different versions of the meme.\n\nOne of the most popular versions was posted by a prolific meme-maker who goes by the name Mike Rilling \u2014 he posts ultra-conservative politics and anti-vaccination messages on his Facebook pages. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFacebook users have been duped by the fake quote since it started circulating widely in early 2017. The Washington Post reported that a former Republican state official in Florida posted the meme on his Facebook page at the time. And two years later, people are still reposting the meme with statements like this one: \u201cEvery Woman in America should hate this ignorant fool! I don\u2019t need to be raped by anyone period.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nWeigel, David. \u201cGOP official in viral town hall video is known for sharing misleading stories, bigoted jokes.\u201d Washington Post. 11 Feb 2017.", "lang": "en"}
