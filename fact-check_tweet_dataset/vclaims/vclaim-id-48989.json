In the tweet, Chavhanke wrote in Hindi, \u201cThe Telangana government is offering free, special kits to Muslims for Ramzan On Hindu festivals Ramnavami, Hanuman Jayanti, Ugadi, it was forbidden to even step out of homes.\u201d This tweet has been retweeted over 8000 times. (archive link)\n\nSeveral Facebook and Twitter users have also posted the viral image.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google and found that there are no reports which state that the Telangana government offered Ramzan gifts in 2020.\n\nOn May 12, an official from the Telangana government told News Meter, \u201cThis year Telangana government is not giving Ramzan gift due to Corona situation. This tweet is mischievous because it implies that the state government gives such festival gifts only to Muslims.\u201d The fact-check report by News Meter also includes a government notice which confirms the official\u2019s statement.\n\nNext, we performed a reverse image search and found that the image shared by Chavhanke dates back to at least 2015. It was posted on a Tamil blog.\n\nThe viral image was also tweeted by BJP-member Raja Singh in 2015. \u201cI am waiting for Telangana Govt to distributing gift pack for Hindu Festivals also WILL HE?\u201d he questioned (archived tweet).\n\nJust like Chavhanke, Singh had also suggested that Hindu festivals are overlooked by Telangana government. Readers should note that in the past the state government has not only offered gifts during Ramzan but also on Bathukamma, which is a Hindu festival, and Christmas. The screenshot below shows 2019 reports on gifts given by Telangana government on Bathukamma, Christmas and Ramzan.\n\nAdditionally, Chavhanke\u2019s second claim that no Hindu festivals were celebrated during the lockdown is also misleading. In April, several media outlets \u2013 Economic Times, The Print, The New Indian Express and Scroll \u2013 reported that social distancing was breached during Ram Navami.\n\nIn short, Sudarshan News editor-in-chief Suresh Chavhanke tweeted at least a five-year-old image of Ramzan gift pack and claimed that Telangana government is offering free kits to Muslims during Ramzan but Hindu festivals were not given the same treatment. A simple Google search shows this is a blatant lie.\n\n[Also read: Sudarshan News and its history of dangerous, communally-divisive misinformation]", "lang": "en"}
