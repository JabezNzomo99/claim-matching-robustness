The video is from 2015 and the woman shown shaking hands with the Pope is not Bibi but her teenage daughter.\n\nThis video, which was posted to Facebook on on November 13, 2018, has a caption saying: \u201cAsia Bibi meet with pope. final Imran Khan release her & she escape from Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe video has a watermark from Rome Reports, a TV news agency based in Rome which covers the Vatican.\n\nRome Reports originally published the video on their official YouTube account on April 16, 2015 with a caption saying: Pope Francis meets the husband of Asia Bibi, a Christian sentenced to death in Pakistan.\n\nBibi was on death row in Pakistan awaiting a Supreme Court appeal in 2015. Her daughter and husband travelled to the Vatican that year.\n\nThe woman shaking hands with the Pope in the video is not Bibi, but her daughter.\n\nHer daughter is seen in multiple news reports, for example here and here, at the Vatican in 2015, and is wearing the same clothes in exactly the same setting as the women in the misleading video.\n\n\u201cHe gave me blessings and I can't remember more,\" the daughter, Esham, told AFP in an interview in 2016, describing her meeting with the Pope the previous year.\n\nFootage from that trip has been widely shared in misleading contexts in recent days, for example here alongside a claim Bibi is in France.\n\nBibi was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death in 2010 after a local imam claimed she had insulted the Prophet Mohammed. She denied the charges.\n\nPakistan's Supreme Court on October 31 overturned Bibi's conviction, igniting protests by hardline Islamists who called for her execution and said she should not be allowed to leave Pakistan.\n\nShe was released from prison one week later, but her location is unknown.\n\nRumours about her leaving Pakistan have been widely shared on social media and messaging apps. Here is a screenshot of one such post shared in WhatsApp:\n\nThe Pakistani government has repeatedly said that Bibi remains in the country at a safe, undisclosed location.\n\nHere is an AFP story after she was freed.", "lang": "en"}
