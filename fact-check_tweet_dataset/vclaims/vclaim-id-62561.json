The 12-second TikTok video shows Maharashtra MLA & SP state President, Abu Asim Azmi, on a railway platform, with supporters chanting around him.\n\nThe video was shared on Facebook by several users, among them, Ravindra Tiwari's text accompanying the clip read, \"Pakistan zindabad at Wadala station in front of Abu Azmi ....welcome to Mumbai of Pakistan.\"\n\n\n\nMultiple Keyword searches led to the same video being shared on Twitter with similar claims.\n\nContrary to the claims, \"Pakistan Zindabad\" can't be heard anywhere in the video. On May 17, in a tweet, Azmi dismissed the claim that \"Pakistan Zindabad\" had been chanted by his supporters and called on the Mumbai Police to take stern action against those sharing the video with 'false' claims.\n\nThe Logical Indian Fact Check team directly contacted MLA Azmi over the incident. We were told by his secretary to regard the above tweet as an official statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, it can be confirmed that multiple social media users shared the video with a false claim of Azmi's supporters chanting 'Pakistan Zindabad'.
