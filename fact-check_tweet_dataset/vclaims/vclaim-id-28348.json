Many Facebook users have shared Ayesha's photos at the protests along with the viral image.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be false. Both the girls are different.\n\nFacebook user \"Manish Soni\" uploaded a collage of two photos - one of a girl wearing glasses and hijab and holding a microphone, and the other of her talking to Rahul Gandhi. The caption in Hindi translates to, \"This is the girl who was found at all the places where riots occurred.\" He also posted the link to Ayesha's profile.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the viral image along with pictures of protests where Ayesha can be seen. The caption in Hindi can be translated to, \"Look carefully at the girl with spectacles who is present in every protest. Also see who is with her.\"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAFWA reverse-searched the viral photo of the girl with Rahul Gandhi and found that she is Safa Sebin, a Class 12 student from Malappuram district in Kerala.\n\nThe Congress leader was at his Lok Sabha constituency of Wayanad in Kerala earlier this month. Just before his speech at a public meeting on December 5, Rahul had said he would speak in English and wanted someone to translate for him. Safa volunteered and won accolades for the same.\n\nNews about this can be read in Kerala Kaumudi and the video can be seen at Asianet News ().\n\nAFWA then reverse-searched the other protest images shared along with the viral photo and found that Ayesha did indeed take a part in them.\n\nHailing from Kerala, the Jamia student's interviews have appeared in the media. Her Facebook account too has many posts about the protests.\n\nAFWA also reached out to Safa who said she is a student of Government Higher Secondary School at Karuvarakundu in Kerala's Malappuram district. \"I am in school and have nothing to do with the protests in Delhi,\" she said, laughing at being compared to Ayesha because of the hijab and spectacles. \"I do know Ayesha Renna; she is from my district. But I have never met her though.\"\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the girl with Rahul Gandhi in the viral image has nothing to do with the protests by Jamia students. She is a school student in Kerala's Malappuram, while the girl taking part in the protests against CAA is a Jamia student.", "lang": "en"}
