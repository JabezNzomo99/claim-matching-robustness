Hence you are humbly requested to share this post as much as possible so that the families of these people are informed -translated)\u201d, reads the text posted along with the video.\n\nTwitter user Rajeev Pandey posted the video with the identical narrative.\n\nThe video is also circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nWatching the video frame-by-frame, Alt News found a plate, in one of the frames, which suggested that it could be from Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nWith a keyword search on Google, we found that a collision between two buses took the lives of nearly 50 people in Zimbabwe in November 2018. According to a report published by News 24, two buses traveling in the opposite direction collided near Rusape, which is located about 170 km east of the capital Harare.\n\nMoreover, we also found a video news report by Africanews, published on November 9, 2018. In the comparison below, we have juxtaposed an image published in a report of the said incident in Daily Mail in 2018 with a screenshot of the destroyed bus from the viral video. This comparison further corroborates that the video is from Zimbabwe and is of the same incident as reported by several international media outlets.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video depicting the aftermath of a road accident in Zimbabwe was falsely shared on social media with the narrative that the said incident took place at Ajmer Highway in Rajasthan.", "lang": "en"}
