The catch and deaths are fabricated.\n\nThe story is a shorter version of a June 20, 2016, post published on World News Daily Report, a satirical news site.\n\n\"We\u2019ve heard a few times about this story, and there's no fact to it,\" said Christopher Yaw, a spokesperson for the District Nine Coast Guard.\n\nGreat white sharks can\u2019t swim in freshwater, as it dilutes their internal salt levels. That dehydrates them and decreases their buoyancy, so that they sink.\n\nThe story quotes a biology professor at the University of Illinois on the rarity of the find, but a search of his name on the university\u2019s database yielded no results.\n\nThe post claims there was a 1916 shark attack in Lake Eerie that led to a 14 year swimming ban, but we found no traces of this attack or a ban. The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water.\n\nWe also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake.\n\nA disclaimer at the bottom of the story calls NotAllowedTo.com a satire entertainment website.\n\n\"We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on this Web Site,\" a disclaimer reads.\n\nThis claim is bogus.
