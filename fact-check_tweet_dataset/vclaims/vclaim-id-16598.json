Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of the claims made in the post.\n\nThe news that WikiLeaks has published the list of black money holders in Swiss bank is doing rounds from 2011. There are many versions of it:\n\nWhen one searches in WikiLeaks.org regarding any such list of black money holders in Swiss banks, no relevant information was found. In 2011, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that black money to Swiss banks mainly comes from India. But the organisation has never published any list of Indians who have stashed their black money in Swiss banks. WikiLeaks through their official Facebook and Twitter posts in 2011 clarified that the lists being circulated are fake and denied releasing any such list.\n\nTo sum it up, WikiLeaks list of Indian black money holders in Swiss bank is a fake one.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
