At the beginning of 2017 a larger proportion of working-age people had a job of some description than had ever been recorded before.\n\nBut not everyone\u2019s convinced that\u2019s the whole story and some of our readers have questioned it in the past:\n\nSo how much of the rise in employment been driven by a rise in insecure, precarious work?\n\nFrom the statistics, it doesn\u2019t seem like unwanted part-time work or unsatisfactory temporary work has been the major driver behind the growth in employment.\n\nIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s hard to answer with statistics alone, partly because one person\u2019s idea of a \u201cgood job\u201d won\u2019t suit another\u2019s. Some people will value secure employment, others flexibility, and presumably most people will want a degree of both. How secure people feel will also depend on things like their relationship with their employer and their own disposition. So questions of job quality are hard to answer satisfactorily with numbers.\n\nThe proportion of workers who simply can\u2019t find permanent or full-time jobs did increase after the recession but it\u2019s been falling for the past few years now.\n\nThe proportion of people who have a job has risen in the past few years to a record high (it\u2019s been driven partly by a rise in the proportion of working-age women with a job).\n\nSome of those people have either part-time jobs or temporary work (or both).\n\nNot all of them are happy about it. About 3% of UK workers work part-time mainly because they can\u2019t find a full-time job. That is around 12% of the 8.4million part-time workers. Between 1-2% of people in employment have a temporary job mainly because they can\u2019t find a permanent one. Around 28% of the 1.6 million temporary workers in the UK.\n\nIf we count these people out of the employment figures it makes very little difference to the overall picture. The employment rate for those aged 16+ is still relatively high by historic standards.\n\nWe\u2019ve used the employment rate for everyone over the age of 16 in the graph below so that we\u2019re using an age group which is consistent with the over- and underemployment statistics (which we\u2019ll get to shortly). The 16+ employment rate is slightly lower than the 16-64 employment rate because it includes people above state pension age, an age group that\u2019s less likely to be in work.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics also collects data on people who want to work more or fewer hours.\n\nThat\u2019s a wider group than just the people who are technically \u201cunderemployed\u201d or \u201coveremployed\u201d.\n\nTo count as \u201cunderemployed\u201d you need to be seeking more hours, work no more than the maximum weekly working hours already, and be able to make the change within the next two weeks. About 11% of employed people say they\u2019d like to work more hours. But 8% of people in employment meet the criteria and are classed as \u201cunderemployed\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re only classed as \u201coveremployed\u201d if you want to work fewer hours and know you\u2019d be prepared to take a pay cut to do it. About 31% of people with a job would prefer to work fewer hours, but only 10% say they\u2019d definitely take a pay cut to do it.\n\nThe proportion of workers who are happy with their hours seems to have been steadily rising over the past fifteen years.\n\nSelf-employment has become more common too. There\u2019s a fear among some that the economy is headed increasingly away from secure jobs and towards short-term, casual work.\n\nThe statistical evidence we\u2019ve seen suggests that people are generally taking up self-employment happily.\n\nWe can also say that industries that make up the \u2018gig economy\u2019 still employ a relatively small proportion of the workforce. If these developments in the jobs market are a worry, it seems to be more of a concern about the direction of travel, rather than about where things are right now for most workers.\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it:\n\n\u201cThe labour market is changing in interesting ways, but not fundamentally (yet).\u201d\n\nWe can also say that the steady increase in self-employment started before the wide use of digital apps to contract piece work, a hallmark of \u2018gig\u2019 industries. The proportion of workers who are self-employed has been rising steadily for about 15 years.\n\nWe\u2019ve written an introduction to zero hours contracts too.\n\nAbout 2.8% of people with a job don\u2019t have a guarantee that they\u2019ll work a minimum number of hours. About a third of them want more hours and about a third of them consider themselves to be full-time in practice.\n\nTotals and averages will never give you the whole picture\n\nMany people\u2019s perspectives won\u2019t match the image of the labour market that comes from looking at national averages, as the chief economist of the Bank of England discussed last June.\n\nBut, at the very least, these aggregates give a wider context for debates about how the job market looks in specific industries or regions, as well as for specific genders, ethnicities, and social classes (however you define them).\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has also looked at what's been driving employment growth.", "lang": "en"}
