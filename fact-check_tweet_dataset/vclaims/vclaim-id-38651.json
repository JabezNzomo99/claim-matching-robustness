In the latest spree, a video where dead bodies of a baby and a woman are dug out from the ground is circulating on social media. A Twitter user Major Muhammad Arif (@marifthahim) shared the clip and wrote, \u201cMuslims are being buried alive in India.\u201d\n\nThe video is being shared with the same claim by several users on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched keyframes from the video on Google and found a report from West Bengal published by eisamay.indiatimes.comon January 31, 2020.
