It can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.\n\nYouTube and Facebook users have been sharing the video that claims blowing hot air into your sinuses will help eliminate the new coronavirus because heat kills it. Someone named Dr. Dan Lee Dimke, who appears to have a doctorate in education, narrates the video.\n\nBut, according to medical doctors, the information in the video is inaccurate and could even be dangerous to one\u2019s health. (RELATED: Does \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Actor Daniel Radcliffe Have The Novel Coronavirus?)\n\n\u201cThey have no data to support that,\u201d Dr. Katrina Armstrong, physician-in-chief at Massachusetts General Hospital, said about the video\u2019s claims in an interview with MassLive.com. \u201cWe have not done randomized, controlled trials of sauna use, but there\u2019s not a reasonable scientist who would suggest that.\u201d\n\nFaheem Younas, an infection disease expert at the University of Maryland, debunked the notion of using a hair dryer to kill the virus, tweeting, \u201cPlease don\u2019t. Our nose carries bacteria, as part of normal flora. Those bacteria may get confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the body is the same temperature, and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest it\u2019s preferentially attacking the sinuses,\u201d Armstrong also noted.\n\nThe video\u2019s claim that heat kills the COVID-19 virus doesn\u2019t hold up either. In fact, the World Health Organization notes on its \u201cMyth Buster\u201d page that the virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.\n\nAt the time of publication, there are 335,991 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map. Some 14,641 people have died from the disease.", "lang": "en"}
