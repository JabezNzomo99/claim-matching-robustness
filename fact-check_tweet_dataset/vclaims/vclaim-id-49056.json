Breaking the video into individual frames using the tool, InVid, a Google Reverse Image search was done. This led to a news report by ANI (Asian News International) which was published on April 29. The report, titled, '\"So coronavirus outside but not inside flight?\": Amateur video shows Pakistanis complaining about no social distancing in PIA flight' suggested that the flight seen in the viral video is a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight. A keyword search with \"PIA flight social distancing\" led to a broadcast on Youtube which was uploaded by a Pakistani news channel, GNN, on 26 April. The video showed the same visuals seen in the viral video.\n\nFurther, a news report by Samaa TV, a Pakistani news and entertainment television network, titled, 'PIA passengers protest violation of social distancing rules during flight' talked about the incident.\n\n The report, published on April 26, said that the passengers complained that the airline was charging a whopping $3,000 for flights that previously cost $1,400 but still failed to take apt measures. \"The tickets were overpriced because the flight had to come back from Canada empty,\" a PIA spokesperson was quoted as saying. Taking to micro-blogging site Twitter, PIB fact check team said that the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation has said that video that is being circulated is fake. The Ministry has also added that the video is from a neighbouring country's airline.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\n Also Read: Fact Check: Who Is Paying For Migrants' Train Tickets To Return To Their Homes?", "lang": "en"}
