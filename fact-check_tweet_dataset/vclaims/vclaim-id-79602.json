The country\u2019s lawmakers banned alcohol at stadiums 11 years ago in effort to curb game-related violence.\n\nOne problem: Budweiser, famous for its beer, is a major sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup being held in Brazil.\n\nSo something had to give. And according to comedian John Oliver, it was the alcohol ban.\n\n\"The amazing thing is here FIFA won. They successfully pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums,\" Oliver said June 8 on his HBO show Last Week Tonight. \"And at this point you can either be horrified by that or relieved that FIFA was not also sponsored by cocaine and chainsaws.\"\n\nWe decided to investigate the brewhaha.\n\nFIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher said \"there is no Budweiser bill,\" though \"it\u2019s true that at the World Cup we will be able to sell beer, and that was part of our requirements.\" Brazil knew about FIFA\u2019s requirements when it bid to host the World Cup, she said.\n\nIndeed, Budweiser and Brahma, owned by Belgian-Brazilian company Anheuser-Busch InBev, are on tap and will be sold in plastic cups at matches, she said.\n\nOliver\u2019s research team sent us many news stories to back up his claim, including a January 2012 highlighting the controversy and comments from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.\n\n\"Alcoholic drinks are part of the FIFA World Cup, so we\u2019re going to have them,\" Valcke said in January 2012. \"Excuse me if I sound a bit arrogant, but that's something we won't negotiate.\"\n\nValcke was also irritated about the country\u2019s all-around lack of progress for the tournament. His comments, in turn, outraged Brazilians two years ago, with leaders at one point refusing to meet with him .\n\nSlowly and controversially, FIFA got what it wanted. A World Cup-related bill in May 2012 and President Dilma Rousseff signed it in June 2012.\n\na temporary amendment that allowed beer to be sold at the World Cup and also the Confederations Cup in 2013.\n\nThe bill that passed actually did not explicitly authorize beer sales at the matches, but government leaders said it allowed Brazil to lift the alcohol ban during the World Cup month, per FIFA\u2019s demand. One senator explained the law simply ratified what the executive branch had already done by agreeing to FIFA\u2019s requirements when it bid for the Cup, according to an\n\nIn short, the bill that passed in Brazil set the guidelines for hosting the World Cup. And by not including a ban on alcohol, alcohol effectively is permitted.\n\nOliver referred to the measure as a \"so-called Budweiser bill,\" but we did not find that characterization widely spread in news stories in a Nexis search, though the connection is unmistakable. His research team pointed to the phrase used in a New Zealand study of alcohol consumption at sporting events ( FIFA\u2019s lobbying in Brazil over beer) and also on a blog called\n\nThis probably won\u2019t be the last time we hear about a country bending its alcohol prohibitions to please FIFA. Similar stadium bans exist in Russia, host of the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that will .\n\nOliver called out FIFA for having \"pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that FIFA demanded beer be allowed to be sold at this summer\u2019s World Cup, and that it was part of an agreement to host the World Cup in the first place. That fits a typical definition of pressure. Oliver took a bit more creative license in calling it the \"so-called Budweiser bill,\" but the characterization does not diminish Oliver\u2019s overall point.", "lang": "en"}
