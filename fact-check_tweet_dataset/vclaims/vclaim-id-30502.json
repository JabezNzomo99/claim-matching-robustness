A U.N. protocol on trafficking, adopted in 2000, provided a definition of trafficking that for political reasons was kept deliberately vague: Trafficking must meet three conditions \u2014 an act (such as movement), means (coercion) and purpose (exploitation). Then, in what American University law professor Janie A. Chuang calls \u201cexploitation creep,\u201d trafficking over time has been recast to include all forced labor, even if a person does not change location, and then has been relabeled as \u201cmodern slavery.\u201d\n\nWhen the State Department set up its office on trafficking in the early 2000s, the numbers were much more modest. The Department\u2019s 2002 report provided an estimate that \u201cat least 700,000, and possibly as many as four million men, women and children worldwide were bought, sold, transported and held against their will in slave-like conditions.\u201d At the time, the George W. Bush administration was largely focused on highlighting anti-prostitution efforts.\n\nThis brings us to the Global Slavery Index. Bales no longer stands by his estimate of 27 million, saying it dates from the 1990s, and points to the GSI as more accurate. (He is the lead author.) But the GSI figure has come under attack from other researchers for having a murky, inconsistent and questionable methodology.\n\nThe Walk Free Foundation, founded in 2012 by Australian billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest, says it wants to eliminate slavery in a generation. The GSI not only provides a total but purports to show how many \u201cslaves\u201d are in each country. GSI relies on an expansive definition of slavery, but confusingly it relies on primary and secondary data that was collected under different definitions.\n\nIn the most recent report, GSI began to introduce Gallup polling in selected countries. This is one reason it says the number jumped by 6 million in one year: \u201cThe increase is due to the improved accuracy and precision of our measures and that we are uncovering modern slavery where it was not seen before.\u201d\n\nThe polling was done face to face in seven countries, and 19 additional polls will be added to next year\u2019s index, said Pablo Diego Rosell, a Gallup consultant. \u201cIn applicable countries, Gallup uses a network sampling methodology. Network sampling gathers information about an individual\u2019s carefully defined family network, including those who may be living elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThis approach is most efficient in the countries that Walk Free prioritized for survey data collection, where modern slavery is either highly prevalent or has greater visibility.\u201d In other countries, where he said slavery is not as visible, the index uses \u201cnon-survey methodologies.\u201d\n\nBut Andrew Guth, who wrote critically of GSI\u2019s methodology, notes that the Gallup polling, if taken at face value, demonstrated that some of the index\u2019s previous estimates were off course. Ethiopia turned out to have a prevalence level five times lower than the year before \u2014 while Russia was deemed to be two times higher.\n\nWeitzer says it is more than a philosophical debate but one with important consequences. \u201cIt matters a great deal in terms of (1) whether human trafficking or modern slavery is indeed a huge problem and (2) all the money spent fighting the problem, and the proliferation of more and more laws and creation of police anti-trafficking units,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line would be: what is the source of the figures propounded by NGOs, governments, international organizations and some scholars.\u201d\n\nMedia organizations are complicit in fostering misperceptions by often citing these figures as established fact, without even an explanation or examination of the methodology. The numbers grow or shrink depending on the definitions that are used, and yet media reports rarely examine that aspect. (A rare exception is a 2007 article by our colleague Jerry Markon, who documented how few actual victims of human trafficking have been found. More recently, the Guardian has published articles critical of GSI.)", "lang": "en"}
