Ralph Northam is facing fallout from a recently surfaced photo that appears on his 1984 medical school yearbook page showing a person blackface standing next to someone dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nNow, a not-so-convincing photographic attempt to paint Republican President Donald Trump as a literal descendant of the Klan is being shared online as well.\n\nAn old photograph spreading on social media makes it look like a younger Donald Trump is posing with his parents while they are donning white KKK robes.\n\nA caption with the photo reads: \"HE HASN\u2019T CHANGED Y\u2019ALL!!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image is not genuine, and a Google search and a reverse image search brings up dozens of versions of the original, in which all three are wearing regular clothing without any Klan symbols.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, was reportedly arrested in 1927 at a KKK rally in Queens, he was never formally charged or cited as a supporter or member.\n\nBut the photograph is clearly doctored, with the robes digitally inserted over the Trumps\u2019 actual clothing.\n\nThis is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
