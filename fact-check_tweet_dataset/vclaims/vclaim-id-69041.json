Tammy Baldwin.\n\nIn a July 31, 2018 interview on the national Fox Business Network, host Stuart Varney had this exchange with Vukmir about Trump:\n\nVarney: Do you back him 100 percent?\n\nVukmir: I have always been there with him, I\u2019ve stood with him, I continue to stand with him.\n\nBefore the Wisconsin primary in April 2016, Vukmir first supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the GOP nomination before dropping out in September 2015. Then she backed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his run in March 2016. Vukmir said she ultimately voted for Cruz in the Wisconsin primary.\n\nSo, Vukmir wasn\u2019t with Trump then.\n\n \n\n (For his part, Nicholson wasn\u2019t an original Trump supporter, either. He supported Rubio initially, but said he voted for Trump in the primary.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the general election campaign that Vukmir endorsed Trump, was part of a women for Trump group and appeared in a radio ad supporting his candidacy against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nVukmir\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our requests to provide information on this fact check.\n\n(Note: We\u2019ve rated as False a claim by Nicholson that Vukmir said: \"I\u2019m not endorsing Donald Trump.\")\n\n\n\nVukmir said: \"I have always been there with\" Trump.\n\nVukmir prominently supported Trump for president in 2016 after he won the Republican nomination. But before that, she supported other GOP contenders for the nomination and was sharply critical of Trump.", "lang": "en"}
