The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the new coronavirus can be transmitted in all areas.\n\nAt the time of publication, the new coronavirus has spread to 180 countries and regions and sickened some 838,061 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map. Amid the global pandemic, some social media users have claimed the new virus cannot spread in areas with warm climates.\n\n\u201cCorona cannot spread in warm weather only cold countries,\u201d says one post shared on Facebook. \u201cWhen the sun is in the virus endemic area, the virus will completely disappear.\u201d\n\nWHO, however, has documented cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus in numerous countries close to the equator, where the climate is typically warmer. Among those countries are Brazil, Ecuador and Indonesia.\n\n\u201cFrom the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather,\u201d the WHO website states on its \u201cMyth Busters\u201d page.

But even this study, which was shared with the public before it was peer-reviewed, noted transmission is still possible, saying, \u201cOur results in no way suggest that 2019-nCoV would not spread in warm humid regions and effective public health interventions should be implemented across the world to slow down the transmission of 2019-nCoV.\u201d\n\nThe post also made numerous dubious claims about how to prevent transmission of COVID-19: drinking hot water, eating certain foods and avoiding ice water, among others. There is no evidence to support these claims, and the theories about garlic, ginger, cold water and sunlight have been thoroughly debunked.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
