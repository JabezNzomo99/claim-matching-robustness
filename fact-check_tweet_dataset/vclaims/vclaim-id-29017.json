He disclosed this at a one-day sensitisation on the dangers of illegal migration at Alvana Secondary School, Owerri, Imo state.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing the information that as we speak, Germany is planning to deport as many as over 30,000 Nigerians. The discussion is ongoing with the top ministries to that effect. These are illegal immigrants but still many are trying to leave Nigeria to Europe or elsewhere unplanned.\n\n\u201cAlso, there are drastic measures across European countries on illegal migration. So, we are here to educate the students and Nigerians in general on the dangers of journeying abroad illegally.\u201d\n\n\u201cGermany said it has about 25,000 to 30,000 Nigerians seeking asylum and they can\u2019t guarantee they will get it. So, there is every possibility that they will be returned to Nigeria,\u201d\n\n\u201cSome who are from the East and West are saying they are running away from Boko Haram while some others say they are gays and were having challenges expressing themselves in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEarlier before Duru\u2019s claim, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Diaspora and Foreign Affairs, Hon. Abike Dabiri Erewa, on June 5, 2018, when speaking at a programme on the topic: \u201cDeveloping a mixed migration strategy for UNHCR Nigeria,\u201d in Abuja, also said that, \u201cGermany is planning to deport about 25,000 to 30,000 Nigerians seeking asylum in the country because they are seeking asylum over reasons that are not genuine.\u201d\n\nVERIFYING THE CLAIM: THE CLAIM IS FALSE; GERMANY IS NOT PLANNING TO DEPORT 30,000 NIGERIANS!\n\nBoth Eddy Duru and Abike Dabiri Erewa are wrong because Germany is not planning to deport 30,000 Nigerians over any illegal migration, Sophia Sabrow, First Secretary, Political Affairs, Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Abuja disclosed to Tribune Online.\n\nSabrow in an email disclosed to Tribune Online that the figure of people set for deportation in Germany is fictitious and that Germany prefers a voluntary return to forced returns, saying that the country even offers various kinds of support to returnees.\n\n\u201cThe figure stated in the media quoted by you is incorrect.\n\n\u201cIn the first four months this year, 92 Nigerian nationals were returned to Nigeria. In the same time period, 53 Nigerians chose to return voluntarily using financial and organizational aid of the Federal Republic of Germany. Currently, around 10,000 Nigerian nationals are legally obliged to leave Germany and to return to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe German government prefers a voluntary return to forced returns and offers various kinds of support which can be found on the website www. returningfromgermany.de. Additionally, a centre for migration, job and reintegration have been established in Lagos which offers support also to returnees.\u201d\n\nAlso, when Tribune Online contacted Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Nigerian-German Centre for Jobs Migration and Reintegration, a centre established to provide migration and reintegration advice to both returning migrants and the local population, and carries out employability promotion measures, including referral services to targeted vocational skills development and entrepreneurial trainings, the Team Leader, Sandra Vermuijten, disclosed to Tribune Online that although she could not confirm the information but urged that the German embassy be contacted.\n\n\u201cI cannot confirm this information. A large number of Nigerians currently in Germany that have requested asylum and whose appeals were rejected are expected to leave the country and return to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get more information on deportation please contact the German embassy in Abuja.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on behalf of the Nigerian in Diaspora (NIDO) Germany Chapter, the Financial Secretary of the association, Kazeem Ojoye, disclosed to Tribune Online that the claim is false in its entirety and that no amount of such Nigerians are set for deportation in Germany, such as he urged that the German Embassy in Berlin be contacted for more information.\n\n\u201cIt is false, Germany is not planning to deport 30,000 Nigerians, and you can contact the German embassy in Berlin for more information\u201d\n\nTribune Online was also able to gather from Mohammed Bello Musa Anka Minister/Consular & Immigration, Nigerian embassy, Berlin, Germany that the claim is false.\n\n\u201cThis was fake news that made the rounds a long time ago. There is no such number of Nigerians scheduled for deportation.\u201d\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The Tribune Online, the online publication of the oldest surviving newsroom in Nigeria.
