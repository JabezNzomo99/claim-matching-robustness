It also alleged that there was open infighting on display at the prime minister's rally in Jaipur.\n\n\"Modi, we have nothing against you. Vasundhara, you will not be spared. Vasundhara, because of you, Modi will also suffer.\" (\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0916\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e\u2026\") several people can be heard raising slogans against the Rajasthan chief minister.\n\nThe clip was also tweeted by Divya Spandana, who handle's the party's social media and digital communications strategy.\n\nAfter BOOM's story was published, Spandana apologised but did not shy away from firing against the BJP once again.\n\nRajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot also claimed that the video was from the rally in Jaipur. Pilot also rhetorically asked if anyone was surprised that the video was not telecast by any news channel on Saturday. Sachin Pilot has since deleted his tweet.\n\nBut BOOM traced the video back to March 8, 2018 at a public event in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan where in addition to Vasundhra Raje being there; the prime minister was present to launch the National Nutrition Mission and extend the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign. Black flags were waved at Raje at the event.\n\n\"As Raje got up to speak, some people started hooting and waving black flags and banners. Raje continued her speech despite the protest. Several BJP leaders, including MLA Shubhkaran Chaudhary, and police officials were seen rushing to the corner to pacify the crowd,\" an article in the Hindustan Times from March stated.\n\nThe below video posted by website Janta Ka Reporter about four months ago shows the same scene from a different angle.\n\nThe video shared by Congress can also be found on YouTube where it was uploaded in March.\n\nNote: This story has been updated with Congress and Divya Spandana's responses following the publication of BOOM's fact-check.", "lang": "en"}
