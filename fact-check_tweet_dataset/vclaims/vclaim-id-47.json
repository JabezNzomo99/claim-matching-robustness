Biden. This is not a photo of either of Biden\u2019s homes in Delaware, where he spent much of his childhood, raised his children and was the state\u2019s longest serving U.S. senator (1973-2009) (see here). The house in the photo actually belongs to the family of former President Barack Obama and is located in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. According to the Washington Post (see here), the Obamas purchased the home in 2017.\n\nAccording to the online real estate database company Zillow, Joe and Jill Biden own a home (here) in Wilmington, Delaware. The Bidens also have a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware (see here). Neither of these homes is the largest in the state of Delaware (Joe Biden was born in Pennsylvania, but spent most of his life and political career in Delaware). According to Zillow (here), the Bidens\u2019 Wilmington house is 6,850 square feet. As reported here by the Washington Post, the Bidens\u2019 Rehoboth home is 4,800 square feet. Zillow lists several properties in Delaware with higher square footage, including 900 Old Kennett Rd in Wilmington, which is 21,000 square feet (here ) and 10 Pyles Ford Road in Wilmington, which is 17,588 square feet (here). Reuters could find no other reports or records indicating that the Bidens owned properties other than these two.\n\nReuters could not corroborate the claim that the Bidens owns a home in Washington, D.C., but they do rent one in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of the nation\u2019s capital (here). According to the Washington Post, the Bidens have been renting the house, \u201cpurchased for $4.25 million in June 2016 by Mark Ein, a wealthy venture capitalist who lives next door,\u201d since 2007. The claim that Joe Biden \u201cjust bought another mansion in D.C.\u201d is unsubstantiated.\n\nReuters could corroborate Senator Bernie Sanders' ownership of three homes, two in Vermont and one in Washington, D.C., rather than four as claimed. As reported here by Forbes, Sanders has \u201ca one bedroom brick townhouse in Washington, D.C.\u201d as well as \u201ca four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom house\" in Burlington, Vermont. A form filed with the Federal Election Commission on February 19, 2019 (see here) confirms Sanders' address in Burlington (221 Van Patten Parkway). In addition, as reported here by Politico, Sanders bought a lakefront property in North Hero, Vermont in 2016, bringing his property count up to three. Reuters could not confirm Sanders\u2019 ownership of properties other than these three.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, the New York Times reported here that the Obamas bought a home in Washington, D.C. (pictured in the Facebook post), and that they would not be selling their house in Chicago. As seen here on Zillow, their Chicago home was purchased in 2005 and is not currently on the market.\n\nIt is true that the Obamas just bought their third house, a property on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, according to Forbes (here). On December 8, 2019, Forbes reported that the Obamas purchased the home the week before Thanksgiving that year.\n\nPartly false: Joe Biden\u2019s house is not pictured in the post and he does not live in the biggest home in Delaware. The Obamas did just purchase their third house, and other claims in the post could not be substantiated", "lang": "en"}
