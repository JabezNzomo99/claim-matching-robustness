For example, there\u2019s a lot we can say about what the highest earners pay, but figures by wealth are harder to come by.\n\nHere we give figures based on what the highest earners pay, but remember this isn\u2019t the same as the \u2018wealthiest\u2019. We\u2019ve asked Mr Grayling how he\u2019d define the term.\n\nThe share of income tax contributed by the top 1% has generally been rising\n\nYou might see this kind of claim a lot\u2014including during last week\u2019s Question Time\u2014referring to how much income tax the top 1% of earners are paying.\n\nThis year the top 1% will pay 27% of all the income tax the government takes in. That\u2019s down slightly on last year, but higher than the share in previous years.\n\nBut this is only part of the picture. Income tax might be the government\u2019s biggest single source of income, but three-quarters of the government\u2019s revenue comes from elsewhere.\n\nThe share of total taxes contributed by the top 10% isn\u2019t changing\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s better to look at what top earners pay in all taxes: those on what people earn like income tax and national insurance, plus those on what people buy like VAT and tobacco duties.\n\nThe published figures only show what the top 10% of earners contribute, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nIn 2014/15, an average household in the top 10% paid nearly \u00a338,000 in taxes. As a group, they contributed about 27% of all taxes paid. A household in the bottom 10% would have paid just over \u00a35,000.\n\nThe share paid by the top 10% is hardly changing. In the last six years it\u2019s been about 27%.\n\nOf course, we\u2019d expect the richest to be contributing more to the total tax pot: they earn more and spend more, so there\u2019s more to tax.\n\nBut what about what the richest pay out of their own budgets?\n\nThe top 10% are paying a similar share of their income in tax\n\nThe latest figures show the highest earning 10% paid about a third\u201434%\u2014of their income in tax. To put that in money, in 2014/15 a typical top 10% household would have got \u00a3110,000 in income and benefits, and would have lost about \u00a338,000 of it in taxes of various kinds.\n\nAgain, that share has hardly changed in recent years, varying from 33% to 35%.\n\nThat share is slightly more than what people on lower incomes pay. Only the bottom 10% buck the trend: they pay about 47% of their income in tax.", "lang": "en"}
