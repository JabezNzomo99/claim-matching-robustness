A video currently viral on social media is being shared with claims suggesting that the Indian pilot was dancing with the soldiers of the Pakistan army.\n\nApart from individual users, Facebook pages have also circulated the video.\n\nSeveral Twitter users have shared the clip with the identical claim.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAs the viral videos were of poor quality, the faces of the soldiers could not be made out. Alt News looked up YouTube videos with the keywords \u2013 \u201cPakistan soldiers paf dancing\u201d \u2013 and stumbled upon a video posted on February 23, 2019, days before the wing commander was captured.\n\nThe video uploaded by Zee Creations was described as, \u201cAmazing moments of Pakistan Air Force airbase officer celebrate victory moments with staff on Chita Chola Song. #chitachola #dance #army . chita chola se dey darzi,chita chola see darzi full song,chita chola mujra.\u201d\n\nAs this video was of much better quality, the soldiers\u2019 faces could be clearly identified. None of the officers resembled Indian air force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman.\n\nMoreover, the officers\u2019 uniforms adorned the Pakistani national flag.\n\nSince the announcement of wing commander Abhinandan\u2019s release, misinformation on social media has been circulating at his expense. Alt News had earlier debunked false claims about his mother and wife.", "lang": "en"}
