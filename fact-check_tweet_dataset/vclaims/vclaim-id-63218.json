A recent viral post (posted on March 28) on social media claims that the military is going to be deployed in Telangana starting midnight or tomorrow morning. It further claims that nobody will be allowed to go out of their homes as the army will be in full action. Also, the names of different reasons were mentioned where the army will be positioned. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nThe viral post on social media shared by a user named Prakash Kulkarni reads: \u201cMilitary going to take position in telangana from midnight or tomorrow morning .

He said: \u201cThis is completely fake. This is a rumour getting viral in the name of Telangana and its regions. People should not spread misinformation in the name of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVishvas News further searched and found a tweet by Indian Army\u2019s official twitter handle. The tweet mentions that, \u201cFake and malicious messages are circulating on social media about likely declaration of emergency in mid-April and employment of #IndianArmy, #Veterans, NCC and NSS to assist the civil administration. It is clarified that this is absolutely FAKE.\u201d\n\nAs per the data of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as for April 1, 2020, 09:00 GMT+5:30, there are 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 1 recovered case, and 3 deaths.\n\nVishvas News performed the social scanning on the Facebook user who shared the viral post.
