On a regulatory front, the RBI has permitted banks to extend the loan repayment moratorium by another three months.\n\n\"Given all these [lockdown and social distancing] uncertainties, GDP growth in 20-21 is estimated to be in negative territory\", he said, stopping short of giving an estimate. \n\n\n\nThis is Das's third address to the press since the lockdown began on March 25. On March 27, the RBI undertook a cut in the repo rates (reverse repo to 4%, repo to 4,4%), the cash reserve ratio and introduced the moratorium for the first time. On April 17, the reverse repo rate was further cut by 25 bps to 3.75%.\n\nHis address comes five days after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the final tranche of the mega 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan' economic package aimed at reform to induct self-reliance in and to jump start the economy after the lockdown.\n\nAlso read: Aatmanirbhar Bharat Economic Package: How Much Will It Really Cost?\n\nBOOM lists all you need to know about the these latest announcements\n\nThe RBI's monetary policy committee voted unanimously to cut the policy repurchase (repo) rate in an off-cyclical meeting. The MPC also voted 5 to 1 to cut the repo rate by 40 basis points (bps): from 4.4% to 4%. The dissenter, Dr. Chetan Ghate on the MPC, voted for a 25 bps cut. A hundred bps is equal to one percentage point.\n\u2022 The marginal standing facility and bank rate were reduced from 4.65% to 4.25%\n\u2022 The reverse repo rate was reduced from 3.75% to 3.35%\n\nThe repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks on a short term basis. The reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks lend to the RBI, again on a short term basis.\n\n\n\n2. An extension of the repayment moratorium\n\nOn March 27, the governor permitted banks to extend a loan repayment moratorium facility to its borrowers across their entire credit product portfolio. Under this, borrowers whose cashflows had been hit due to the lockdown could defer payments on installments falling in three months (March, April and May) without these missed payments adversely affecting their credit standing. This moratorium has been extended for another three months, up to August.\n\nAlso Read: Why RBI's Loan Repayment Moratorium Is Not A Relief For Borrowers\n\nThe criteria for withdrawal from the Consolidated Sinking Fund has been relaxed, and it will be ensured that the withdrawal of funds from here are done judiciously.
