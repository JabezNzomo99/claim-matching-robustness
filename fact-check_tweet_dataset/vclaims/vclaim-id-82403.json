Then, per The Guardian, which said it obtained a full copy of the book and was cited by Fox News, Sanders wrote of the meeting with Kim:\n\nLater, she reportedly told Trump and his chief of staff at the time, John Kelly, about what had happened while they were in the presidential limousine, on their way back to Air Force One. And, according to her story reported by The Guardian, that conversation including the commander-in-chief went like this:\n\n\u2018Kim Jong-un hit on you!\u2019 Trump said. \u2018He did! He fucking hit on you!\u2019 Sanders, a devout Christian who discusses her faith throughout her book, does not spell out the presidential expletive. But she does write that she told Trump that was not what she meant, and said: \u201cSir, please stop.\u201d Kelly backed up the president and Trump joked: \u201cWell, Sarah, that settles it. You\u2019re going to North Korea and taking one for the team! Your husband and kids will miss you, but you\u2019ll be a hero to your country!\u201d Trump and Kelly, Sanders writes, \u201chowled with laughter\u201d as the car drove on.\n\nGiven that play-by-play based on excerpts of Sanders\u2019 book, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution\u201d \u2014 she did indeed say Trump told her to take \u201cone for the team\u201d after the leader of North Korea apparently winked at her.", "lang": "en"}
