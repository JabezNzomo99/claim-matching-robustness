(If you are a man and you receive this message please help forward it to the women around you),\n\nIf a woman is seeing her menstrual period then please do not do these 4 things;\n\n1. Do not drink ice water, soda water, or eat coconut during menstruation.\n\u2022 None Do not apply shampoo on your head because the pores of the head are open during menstruation and it can cause headache (hit the wind head), it is very dangerous and this effect can be felt when young and later when aged .\n\u2022 None Do not eat cucumber during menstruation because the sap present in the cucumber can block some menstruation (blood waste) in the uterine wall and it can cause Barrenness!\n\u2022 None our body should not be knocked or hit by hard objects, especially the abdomen because it can cause vomiting blood, the uterus can be injured. And these are the \u201cORIGIN OF UTERUS CANCER, CYSTS AND BARRENNESS\n\nResearch proves, drinking ice during menstruation can cause menstrual blood remaining in the uterine wall, after 5-10 years can cause \u201cUTERUS CANCER OR TUMOR\u201d.\n\nPlease this info is distributed to many women; mothers, wives, daughters, or girlfriends. Show concern for others. Love your woman. There is Beauty in Sharing \u2026 saving 1 woman, can get you an unexpected reward, this would be useful for women.\n\nUterus Cancer or Barrenness will not be your portion \u2026 Source: LPKI (Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute)\n\nBefore verifying the post, it is important to note that although the message claims that its information source is the Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute, a repeated internet search shows that an Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute does not, in fact, exist.\n\nAttributing medical advice during menstruation to medical authority such as a cancer institute to convince women to heed the advice is deceptive to say the least! What we found is that an Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute does not exist, what does exist is an Indonesian Cancer Foundation. The foundation has nothing to do with the information in this message. This is, therefore, fake news.\n\nCLAIM 1: THERE IS NO RESEARCH TO PROVE THIS!\n\nNot only is this message fake news but it is also medically inaccurate. The message conflates two bodily systems \u2013 the reproductive and digestive system.\n\nWhen one drinks ice water or soda water or eats coconuts, as the post suggests, it is not physiologically possible for ice water or soda water and coconut ingested to make its way to the uterus.\n\nMore, the message states \u201cresearch proves, drinking ice during menstruation can cause menstrual blood remaining in the uterine wall, after 5-10 years can cause uterus cancer and tumor\u201d, without even pointing out the stated research. However, there is no evidence from research which shows that drinking ice during menstruation is a cause of uterine cancer or a tumour and indeed ice water does not remain in the uterine wall 5 -10 years after being drunk.\n\nCLAIM 2: YOU CAN APPLY SHAMPOO ON YOUR HEAD DURING MENSTRUATION BUT BE CAREFUL!\n\nPores are small openings on the surface of the skin that extends through the skin\u2019s layers; the epidermis and dermis, the outer and inner layer, respectively. Some pores are openings for hair follicles to pass through as well. Hence for every hair on an individual\u2019s body is a skin pore that houses the millions of body hair. The other pores produce sebum.\n\nA change to the pores of a woman during an average menstrual cycle is typical. These changes in the skin are attributed to hormones. According to a study, \u201cmenstruation is governed by tightly orchestrated changes in the levels of ovarian estrogen and progesterone, which produce varying responses in diverse tissues and organs\u201d.\n\nWhile the influx of hormones may cause the pores to become clogged with sebum, resulting in the appearance of larger pores, this does not imply that the pores actually become larger as the claim makes out.\n\nMore over, the skin can actually absorb external substances and this does not only occur during menstruation. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that although some chemicals like the ones contained in shampoos \u201ccan be significantly metabolized during dermal absorption\u2026\u201d.\n\nIt is therefore important to examine the constituents of shampoo for their dermal toxicity levels but since most shampoos come in contact with the scalp for approximately 5 to 10 minutes during washing, the likelihood of dermal absorption is reduced.\n\nCLAIM 3: IN FACT, EAT CUCUMBER IF YOU CAN!\n\nBarrenness or infertility is defined as the inability to get pregnant after a year of trying or 6 months in a woman over the age of 35. This can also apply to the inability to stay pregnant for various reasons. A study found that 31% of Nigerian couples fail to conceive a child 12 months after trying. Infertility in Nigerian women can be attributed to complications from sexually transmitted diseases, exposure to infections during previous deliveries or abortion and also infertile male partners.\n\nCucumbers are vegetables rich in nutritional value. Cucumbers contain potassium, fibre and vitamin C and are naturally low in their calorie, carbohydrate, sodium, fat and cholesterol content. In addition, cucumbers are 95% water-based making them the ideal part of a healthy diet. This makes cucumbers especially great to counter the skin problems that accompany periods. According to the Cleveland Clinic, an American academic medical center, cucumbers have an anti-inflammatory compound that in fact, removes waste from the body and are not bad for women during menstruation.\n\nCLAIM 4: YOU SHOULD NEVER BE HIT WITH HARD OBJECTS AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE!\n\nBeing hit with hit hard objects can obviously cause vomiting of blood and injury but to cause cancer and cysts, that\u2019s quite an overstretch. The American Cancer Society and several other medical authorities have even labelled this a common myth.\n\nIn general, it is not advised that one takes a blow to the stomach, under any condition; menstruating woman or not.\n\nMany of the claims here are false. A woman\u2019s diet should remain the same regardless of if she is on her period or not. The only recommendation given to women regarding their diet as a result of menstruation is to increase their iron intake with iron-rich foods such as spinach. This is because women who have heavy blood flow can become anaemic (when the body does not have enough red blood cells.).", "lang": "en"}
