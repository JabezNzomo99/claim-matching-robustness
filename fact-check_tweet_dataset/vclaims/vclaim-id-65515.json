The person recording the video can be heard making this claim.\n\nThe video is also floating on Twitter.\n\nIt has also been shared with a Hindi caption \u2014 \u201cIn Karol Bagh, Gaffar market, a terrorist was caught. Salute to Karol Bagh SHO and all staff.

However, the same has not been reported in the media. This suggested that the video must represent a mock drill conducted by the police.\n\nOn July 29, journalist Tarun Sharma tweeted the clip and wrote in Hindi, \u201cToday, Delhi police conducted a mock drill in Delhi\u2019s Karol Bagh market. Such mock drills are often conducted before August 15. In this mock drill, police are taking three dummy terrorists into custody. This was conducted so that the police remains prepared in case of an emergency.\u201d This was retweeted by DCP Central Delhi.\n\nTherefore, the claim that a terrorist was apprehended by the police in Delhi is false. Mock drill videos are often circulated as real incidents. Several such videos debunked by Alt News can be viewed here.", "lang": "en"}
