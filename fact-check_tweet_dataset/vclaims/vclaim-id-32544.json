Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: UP government\u2019s budget for the \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event at Ayodhya was Rs. 133 crores. Fact: The UP government has estimated the cost of the \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event to be around Rs. 1.33 crores, not Rs. 133 crores. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the issue on Google, it was found that even reputed news agencies [Times of India \u2013 Times Travel (Archived), Firstpost (Archived), Indian Express (Archived), The Quint (Archived), ABP News (Archived) and Live Hindustan (Archived)] have published the same news. \n\n\n\nBut, a journalist has tweeted that the Uttar Pradesh has approximately spent only 1.33 crore for the Ayodhya \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event and also, posted the photo of the press release. \n\n\n\nSo, when searched for the press release on the Uttar Pradesh government\u2019s official website, it was found that the details of the funds estimated for the \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event were in the 22nd October press release. According to the press release, the Uttar Pradesh has estimated the cost of the \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event to be around Rs. 132.70 lakhs (approximately Rs. 1.33 crores), not Rs. 133 crores.\n\nAlso, in this year\u2019s UP budget, in the Tourism Department section, it can be found that the government has estimated the cost of the previous year\u2019s \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event to be Rs. 50 lakhs but later revised it to Rs. 46 lakhs. In this year\u2019s budget, it can also be found that the government has estimated the cost to be around Rs. 100 lakhs (Rs. 1 crore) for this year\u2019s \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event.\n\nTo sum it up, Ayodhya \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 event\u2019s cost was estimated to be around Rs. 1.33 crores, not Rs. 133 crores.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
