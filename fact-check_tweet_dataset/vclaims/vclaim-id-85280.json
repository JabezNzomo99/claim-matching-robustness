According to Daily Mail, he was gunned down in March 2018. He was laid to rest in a gold casket with his wealth \u2013 gold pendants and jewellery.\n\nAccording to Metro, the jewellery was worth $100,000.\n\nFurthermore, according to a March 5, 2019 article in Forbes, the richest man in Kuwait is Kutayba Alghanim, the chairman of Alghanim Industries. His world ranking is 1,605.\n\nThe image of a car lowered into a grave is from 2013 when it was reported that a Brazillian businessman, inspired by the Pharaohs of Egypt, decided to bury his Bentley Continental. However, it was later claimed that this was a stunt to promote organ donation. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to bury something much more valuable than a Bentley: your organs,\u201d the businessman was reported stating.\n\nThis is an image of Mercedes-Benz vehicle decorated with Swarovski crystals displayed at the annual Tokyo Auto Salon.\n\nThese are stacks of gold in the Bank of England vault.\n\nAccording to a 2013 website, this is a gipsy funeral.\n\nWhile we were unable to establish the origin of this photograph, the bed is available for sale on a website for about Rs 8 lakh.\n\nFrom what it seems, this is a luxury yacht \u2018Khalilah\u2019 at Palmer-Johnson shipyard in Wisconsin.\n\nWhile there are several other pictures shared with the image of a man laid to rest with gold jewellery, it is evident that the accompanying claim is false. The man was not the richest man in Kuwait but a millionaire who was shot dead in the dual-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago.", "lang": "en"}
