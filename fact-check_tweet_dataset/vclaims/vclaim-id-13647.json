The first half of the expression was popularized by author Henry David Thoreau, although its earliest known appearance dates back to the 1830s, when it became the motto for a U.S. magazine.\n\nTurning Point isn\u2019t the first group to attribute the quote to Jefferson, the country\u2019s third president. In fact, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation debunked the quote in a 2008 entry, labeling it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson\u2019s opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson\u2019s,\u201d Research Librarian Anna Berkes wrote. \u201cHowever, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republican party for a very long time \u2026 and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him.\u201d\n\nThe first known record of the expression dates back to the 1830s when it became the motto for The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which printed on its cover the phrase, \u201cThe best government is that which governs least.\u201d\n\nThe magazine was founded in 1837; Jefferson died in 1826.\n\nThe motto was then repeated in the opening lines of Thoreau\u2019s famous essay \u201cCivil Disobedience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heartily accept the motto, \u2018That government is best which governs least;\u2019 and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically,\u201d Thoreau wrote in the 1849 publication.", "lang": "en"}
