When David Muir of ABC News noted the study\u2019s author said he found no evidence of voter fraud, Trump said: \u201cExcuse me, then why did he write the report?\u201d\n\nThe report, instead, found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state (which could happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without telling the former state) and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls. Trump did reference these other findings correctly in the interview \u2014 but then claimed these findings are evidence of fraud.\n\nQ. Are these problems leading either to fraud or to efforts to keep eligible people from voting?\n\n A. We have not seen evidence of that. These problems really are the result of an antiquated system \u2014 one that relies almost exclusively on 19th and 20th century technologies (paper and mail) to serve a 21st century, highly mobile society. About one in eight Americans moved during each of the 2008 and 2010 election years. Some Americans \u2014 including those serving in the military, young people and those living in communities affected by the economic downturn \u2014 are even more mobile. One in four voters assumes that election officials or the U.S. Postal Service updates registrations automatically with each move, even though that is almost never the case, and about half of all voters don\u2019t know they can update their registration at a motor vehicles office. Election offices often are flooded with millions of paper registration applications from third-party voter registration drives right before Election Day, at a time when their resources are stretched the most.\n\u2022 None Even though the inaccuracies impact one in eight registrations, researchers at the Pew Center on the States said they don\u2019t see it as an indicator of widespread fraud. Rather, they believe outdated systems are failing to keep pace with the most basic changes in people\u2019s lives, feeding perceptions that U.S. elections are not as airtight as they could be. ( Associated Press, Feb. 13, 2012\n\u2022 None Mr. Becker warned that poor record-keeping at the registration stage is not evidence of fraud at polling places. \u201cThese bad records are not leading to fraud but could lead to the perception of fraud,\u201d he said. ( New York Times, Feb. 14, 2012\n\u2022 None Experts say there\u2019s no evidence that the errors led to fraud on Election Day. \u201cThe perception of the possibility of fraud drives hyper-partisan policymaking,\u201d said David Becker, director of Pew\u2019s election initiatives. But inactive voters do cost money. Inaccurate lists mean wasted money on mailings and extra paper ballots. ( USA Today, Feb. 14, 2012\n\u2022 None Election Initiatives, said that the center\u2019s findings did not suggest any kind of voter fraud or voter suppression from these problems but noted they do \u201cunderscore the need for an improved system.\u201d ( Still, David Becker, director of PElection Initiatives, said that the center\u2019s findings did not suggest any kind of voter fraud or voter suppression from these problems but noted they do \u201cunderscore the need for an improved system.\u201d ( Politico, Feb. 14, 2012\n\u2022 None There\u2019s little evidence that this has led to widespread voter fraud, but it has raised concerns that the system is vulnerable. ( NPR, Feb. 14, 2012\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a five-year-old report,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many election officials from across the aisle and around the country have worked to leverage technology and data to make sure the voter lists are serving the voters. I don\u2019t know that I would feel comfortable saying the estimates we reached in February of 2012 would be the same estimates that we would reach today, given the substantial improvements that have occurred in the last five years.\u201d\n\nIt is remarkable that the president of the United States continues makes a false claim with no support, then finds a five-year-old report that doesn\u2019t support his claim, then attacks the researcher of the study when confronted with the fact that the report does not support his false claim.\n\nTrump says Becker was \u201cgroveling\u201d when he claimed his 2012 Pew study did not find evidence of voter fraud. Yet since the report was first released, and in contemporaneous news coverage, it is clear that Becker has consistently said his research did not find evidence of voter fraud.", "lang": "en"}
