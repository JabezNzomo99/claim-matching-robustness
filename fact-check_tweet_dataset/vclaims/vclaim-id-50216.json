The remarks have been misattributed to Henry. Her office asked social media users to stop sharing the post and instead refer to the province's official guidance on the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWisdom from Dr Henry,\u201d says one version of the post, while another calls it \u201cwonderful advice.\u201d. Variations of the post have been shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook since July 13, 2020.\n\nAll the posts share a list of 16 points running from correct advice like \u201cwashing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection\u201d to false claims like \u201cwearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was not developed by Dr Henry or anyone in her office,\u201d a spokesperson for British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Health told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cShe would discourage British Columbians from further circulating it among their networks. Instead, she recommends referring to the excellent guidance found on the BC Centre for Disease Control\u2019s website,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nA keyword search revealed that a similar version of the advice was shared as early as May 14, 2020 by this Pakistani website which attributed the text to Dr Faheem Younus, Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. He also disowned the advice, saying \u201cthese are not my words.\u201d\n\nSome of the advice in the post is legitimate. Rejecting fake cures like ginger and vinegar, and stating that the virus is unlikely to be carried on shoes, have been verified by AFP here and here.\n\nHowever, claiming that \u201cwearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels\u201d is false, as shown by AFP here and here.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
