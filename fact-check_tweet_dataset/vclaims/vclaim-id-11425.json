We will update this report should he do so.\n\nNigeria\u2019s official trade data is released every three months by the\n\nfor the first quarter of 2018 showed Nigeria earned N4.69 trillion ($15.3 billion) from all exports from January to March.\n\nThis was made up of:\n\u2022 None Crude oil exports: N3.6 trillion or three quarters of the total (76.3%)\n\u2022 None Other oil products such as liquefied natural gas and bitumen: N535.8 billion (11.4%) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKeyamo\u2019s figure correct only for all non-oil exports\n\n($239.3 million) from agricultural exports in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nKeyamo would only be correct if he were referring to\n\nnon-oil exports in this period, which totalled N577.6 billion (US$1.89 billion) - his exact claim.\n\nmanufactured goods, as well as agricultural products, solid minerals, raw materials and energy goods like hardwood, charcoal and coniferous wood.\n\nNigeria\u2019s current growth in agriculture was not as strong as it was before the country\u2019s\n\n, according to Dr Victor Oriavwote, a lecturer in the department of social sciences, economics and development studies at the\n\n\u201cIf we are producing and exporting more today, why is agriculture not contributing more to our GDP and foreign exchange earnings? I don\u2019t agree that Nigeria\u2019s agric production and export has improved significantly,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cIf that was the case, unemployment figures would have reduced.\u201d Unemployment was\n\nin the third quarter of 2017, from 8.2% in the third quarter of 2017.\n\nof Nigeria's labour force of 85 million are employed in the agriculture sector.\n\nHe said that while Nigeria had good farmland, the right climate and enough labour, official policies had not strengthened the \u201cthe real farmer in rural areas\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Nigeria earned N73bn, not N577bn, from agricultural goods in Q1 2018\n\nBoosting agriculture to create jobs is a key policy for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the run-up to the 2019 elections. Festus Keyamo, the media director of his re-election campaign, claimed that the country earned N577 billion from agricultural exports from January to March 2018.\n\nBut agricultural products only brought in N73.24 billion in this period, official data shows. Keyamo\u2019s figure is the same as the N577.6 billion earned by\n\nnon-oil exports in the first quarter.\n\nWe therefore rate his claim as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
