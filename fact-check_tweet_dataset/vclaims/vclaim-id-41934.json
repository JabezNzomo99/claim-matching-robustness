Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Police shooting at the protestors in Assam. Fact: The video is related to a mock drill conducted by the Police in the state of Jharkhand. The Police in the video are not the Assam Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the same video was previously shared as \u2018Police firing on Muslims in Jammu & Kashmir\u2019, FACTLY debunked the same. During the fact-checking process, it was found that the video shows a mock drill activity conducted by the Jharkhand Police. On comparing the surrounding buildings in the video with the building photos on Google Maps, it was confirmed that the drill was conducted in Jharkhand. The detailed fact-check article by FACTLY can be read here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, in the video, the Police were not shooting at the protestors in Assam. It\u2019s a mock drill in Jharkhand. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
