Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the post.\n\nClaim: V Mitchell has written a beautiful article on India in the New York Times. Fact: No, that is not an article published by the New York Times. It was just a comment by V Mitchell in the comment section under a different New York Times article, in the year 2009. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE..\n\nWhen searched for the article on Google with keywords from the post, a link to the New York Times article can be found in the search results. The article was titled \u2018As Elections Near, Tightrope Awaits in India\u2019; written by Somini Sengupta and published on April 14, 2009. The author commented on Indian elections but nothing related to the information given in the post. But, the same words from the post can be found in the comment section of the article. The man who commented was V Mitchell. So, a man who commented on an article in the New York Times is being portrayed as the author of the New York Times article in the post.\n\nNot only Facebook users but also the Ministry of External Affairs on its website placed the comment of V Mitchell in the \u2018Articles in Foreign Media\u2019 section.\n\nTo sum it up, a comment on the New York Times article is being portrayed as an article in the newspaper.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
