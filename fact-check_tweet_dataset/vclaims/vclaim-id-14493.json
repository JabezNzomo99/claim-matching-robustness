International military forces were responsible for 5 percent of total civilian casualties, although an exact figure was not provided.\n\nAs the UNAMA report noted, the majority of civilian casualties caused by pro-government forces resulted from ground engagements, although the total number of ground engagement casualties dropped 17 percent year-on-year.\n\nBy contrast, the next leading cause of pro-government civilian casualties, aerial attacks, had registered a record 39% year-on-year increase in related casualties.\n\nAs UNAMA noted: \u201cThe 649 civilian casualties recorded between 1 January and 30 September 2018 is more than the number of civilian casualties from aerial operations recorded over every entire year since UNAMA began systematic civilian casualty documentation in 2009.\u201d\n\nThat increase accompanied the latest U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, which, in the words of Randall Schriver, Assistant Secretary of Defense, Asian & Pacific Security Affairs, entails doing \u201ceverything we can to support the ANDSF [the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces] fight against the Taliban in order to drive them to the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nThat approach has resulted in a surge in airstrikes.\n\nSpeaking in October 2017, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that restrictions on air power had been lifted, with no \u201cproximity\u201d requirement needed to provide close air support.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Air Force Central Command, in October 2018, CFACC-assigned aircraft flew 765 strike sorties in Afghanistan, releasing 769 weapons in support of Operation Freedom\u2019s Sentinel.\n\nFrom January to October 2018, U.S. led forces dropped 5,982 munitions on Afghanistan.\n\nAs reported by American military newspaper Stars and Stripes, the U.S. \u201cdropped more bombs and other munitions in Afghanistan during the first ten months of 2018 than in any other full year since documentation began.\u201d The newspaper cited U.S. Air Forces Central Command statistics dating back to 2006, which showed more bombs dropped in 2018 than even during the \u201ctroop surge\u201d of 2011.\n\nUltimately, it remains unclear if the Russian MFA\u2019s claim that the actions of foreign troops is leading to an overall uptick in civilian casualties is accurate.\n\nFor 2017, UNAMA reported 10,453 civilian casualties \u2013 3,438 people killed and 7,015 injured \u2013 in Afghanistan, 65% of which were attributed to anti-government elements and only 2% to international military forces.\n\nThat was \u201can overall decrease of nine percent compared to 2016 and the first year-on-year decrease recorded by UNAMA since 2012.\u201d\n\nIn short, while there has been a quantifiable uptick in airstrike-related deaths in Afghanistan in 2018, there are no exact figures pointing to an overall rise in civilian casualties resulting from international forces.\n\nTherefore, Polygraph.info finds the Russian Foreign Ministry statement to be unclear.", "lang": "en"}
