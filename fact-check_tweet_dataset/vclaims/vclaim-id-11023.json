Russia-24 state television posted a report on YouTube headlined \u201cBREAKING! OSCE Finally Speaks Up: No Russian Military Presence in Donbass; Kiev Lied!\u201d In it, Correspondent Andrey Rudenko played up Hug\u2019s statement, using it to back the Kremlin\u2019s well-established narrative about eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAlexander Hug is well informed. For four years he\u2019s been working in the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, and in Ukraine as the head [SIC] of the OSCE mission. They basically have open access to any place in the country. I\u2019m not sure about western Ukraine, but here they have free access. They are fully informed. The statement he voiced today is confirmation of what we\u2019ve been broadcasting from here for four years. The armed people here are the locals.\u201d\n\nRudenko noted the presence of volunteers from Russia, Belarus, Italy, Poland and the U.S. in eastern Ukraine \u2013 who, he said, account for 10% of the fighters, although those countries are not themselves viewed as parties to the conflict.\n\n\u201cBut Kyiv naturally began screaming that it had been betrayed. The OSCE destroyed the fairytale that Ukrainian television has been broadcasting,\u201d Rudenko said.\n\nOn October 27, Hug told the Ukraine Crisis Media Center in an interview that the text published by Foreign Policy of his interview \u201cwas misleading and did not reflect his opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, we do not conclude on the facts we establish and we do not provide evidence. Estimates, facts speak for themselves,\u201d Hug said.\n\nWhen pressed on his original comments regarding whether or not he had seen evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Hug reiterated that the monitoring mission does not draw conclusions from the evidence it gathers.\n\nForeign Policy has since offered the following correction and clarification:\n\n\u201cCorrection, October 25, 2018: Alexander Hug is the deputy head of the OSCE\u2019s observer mission in Ukraine. An earlier version described him as the head. Clarification, October 25, 2018: In an earlier version, Hug stated that OSCE had not seen direct evidence of Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine. We have removed this remark, as it did not convey his intended view. He goes on to cite facts and observations that his monitors have recorded.\u201d\n\nIn the most up-to-date version of the Foreign Policy article, Hug stated regarding the situation in eastern Ukraine:\n\n\u201cIf the question is what we have seen on the ground \u2026 we have seen convoys leaving and entering Ukraine on dirt roads in the middle of the night, in areas where there is no official crossing. In one border area, we\u2019ve also made this public, including some footage we have put out. We have seen specific types of weapons that we have described in detail, including electronic warfare equipment. We have spoken to prisoners taken by the Ukrainian forces who claim to be members of the Russian armed forces fighting on rotation in Ukraine. We have seen men with the insignia of the Russian Federation, but you can buy this jacket anywhere. We have also seen the insignia of Germany, Spain, and others\u2014but also of the Russians.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Russia has long denied its role in fomenting the current war in eastern Ukraine. Responding to a U.S. State Department statement condemning provocations against international monitors in Ukraine, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last year:\n\n\"We can only - for the hundredth time - repeat that Russia is in no shape or form a party of the conflict\u201d in Ukraine, he said.\n\nAs Polygraph.info noted at the time, there is abundant verifiable evidence of the presence of Russian military hardware, troops, intelligence agents, and economic aid from Russia in the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin himself once admitted to having some military personnel in the Donbas.\n\nOn October 27, the OSCE reported an SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) had \u201cspotted a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) and a fuel truck east of Nyzhnokrynske (non-government-controlled, 66km east of Donetsk).\u201d\n\nThat UAV, which experienced signal interference that the monitoring mission \u201cassessed as jamming,\u201d is \u201cnow considered lost,\u201d the OSCE said.\n\nIn August, the OSCE posted UAV footage showing a convoy of trucks entering and exiting Ukraine (via Russia) in the middle of the night on a dirt track where there are no border crossing facilities.\n\nAs previously reported by Polygraph.info, Russia has failed to come up with a verifiable explanation as to where the \u201cseparatists\u201d continue obtaining advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them. These include T-90A main battle tanks, which the Ukrainian armed forces have neither purchased nor produced.\n\nAs early as August 2014, NATO released satellite imagery which it said showed \u201cthat Russian combat soldiers, equipped with sophisticated heavy weaponry, are operating inside Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory.\u201d\n\nThe following year, VICE News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky tracked one Russian soldier via social media in a groundbreaking report that proved Russian military involvement in Ukraine.\n\nSo, regardless of the initial comment by Hug to Foreign Policy, there is plenty of verifiable evidence that shows Russia\u2019s direct, if covert, involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, And so, we judge Russia-24\u2019s assertion denying Russia\u2019 presence in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region to be false.", "lang": "en"}
