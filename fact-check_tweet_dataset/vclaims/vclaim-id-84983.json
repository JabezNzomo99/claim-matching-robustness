This video was also shared by Telangana Today and Siasat Daily websites.\n\nThe video is currently viral on Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.\n\nIs the video really that of Major Prafulla? It cannot be because this video has been around on YouTube for over 7 years. In January 2017, CRPF posted this video on their verified Twitter account and identified the soldier as Assistant Commandant Satwant Singh.\n\nSometime back, when 2 Indian army soldiers were beheaded by Pakistani army, a video of a Brazilian bank robber\u2019s beheading was made viral claiming that it is Indian soldiers being beheaded. Such fake videos are often made viral after tragic events. Kindly, be careful and do not fall for such videos. We don\u2019t need fake videos to be proud of the heroics of our armed forces.", "lang": "en"}
