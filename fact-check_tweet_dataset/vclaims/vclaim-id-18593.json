It is a religion,\u2019 winning many hearts online.\n\nHowever, its stance has divided social media with a large section of conservative Hindus accusing Zomato of having double standards when it comes to accommodating requests of Muslim customers with regards to Halal meat.\n\nHashtags such as 'IStandWithAmit' 'BoycottZomato' 'ZomatoUninstalled' have also been trending on Twitter.\n\nThe company is now being targeted with fake news.\n\nThe text of the misleading post translates to.\n\n'Zomato's owner Deepindra Goyal said, \"We don't want business from Hindu customers who don't want to take food delivered by Muslim delivery boys.
