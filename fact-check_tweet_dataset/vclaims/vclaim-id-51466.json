The RSPCA told Full Fact they agree with this.\n\nIt told us: \u201cA very small number of animals have been reported to have tested positive for, or shown symptoms of, COVID-19. Some of these animals were deliberately exposed to the disease in an artificial setting which did not represent real life. The others were cases where the virus has reportedly been passed from a person to an animal. Importantly, to date, there is no known evidence of the virus passing from pets to humans.\u201d\n\nThe claims that people have dumped animals due to Covid-19 seems broadly incorrect. While some animals have been dumped, the RSPCA stated in a July press release that there were actually lower numbers of abandoned animals during the first three months of lockdown.\n\nSummer usually sees a rise in abandoned pets, however, the RSPCA said that they fear that due to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, there would be an even greater rise in families giving up their pets.\n\n\u201cDuring lockdown we\u2019ve seen pets become a source of comfort and support for people and it appears many people have taken on new animals. Fortunately during this time we\u2019ve dealt with fewer abandoned pets however we are worried that as lockdown eases, people return to work, go on holidays or struggle financially we will be facing a massive surge of animal abandonments.\u201d\n\nSo while there may be an increase in the coming months of pets left by owners, this is more likely to be due to a shift out of lockdown not due to fears of transmission.", "lang": "en"}
