And we will get to those in the narrative lower in this article. We thought it would be helpful to break down the claims and counterclaims involving the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty before directly addressing the details that lead to the Polygraph.info verdict:\n\nWhat the US Claims\n\nU.S. Government: The U.S. has said since 2014 that Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty, though very few of the details have been made publicly available. In 2017, the State Department did reveal the missile in question -- the 9M729. In 2018, the U.S. ambassador to Russia said the U.S. had provided \u201cgeographic coordinates\u201d and the dates of tests showing the violations.\u200b\n\nThird Party: The director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, an independent academic research project, insists the U.S. could have only \u201cindirect\u201d evidence -- that the rocket had not been tested to distances that would verify a violation. The indirect evidence could include \u201cdetailed blueprints of the missile and all its technical characteristics.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch government says it has verified, based on its own independent intelligence, that Russia is developing a cruise missile in violation of the treaty.\n\nThe Russian Government: The government says the U.S. the Aegis Ashore missile defense system and a vertical launcher deployed in Romania could be used for offensive missiles.\n\nThe U.S. Government: The Aegis was developed as a purely defensive system to protect U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. claims the newer, land-based Aegis also is defensive.\n\nThird Party: The Arms Control Association\u2019s executive director says the Aegis system can be equipped with offensive weapons, though he adds these \"are not equivalent problems.\"\n\nWe find President Putin\u2019s words to be misleading. The 9M729 missile that is already deployed in European Russia is a threat to a number of European countries, whatever claims to its are accurate -- the Russian or the U.S.\n\nDuring a February 2 televised working meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, that day\u2019s decision by the Trump administration to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on February 2 was the chief topic.\n\nLavrov said Moscow had done \u201ceverything\u201d to save the INF Treaty, given its \u201cimportance in terms of sustaining strategic stability in Europe, as well as globally.\u201d Shoigu said the country would develop new types of weapons, including a ground-based long-range hypersonic missile system.\n\nDespite placing all of the blame on the U.S., Putin said Moscow would not place short- or medium-ranged weapons \u201cin Europe or in other regions of the world\u201d if analogous U.S. weapons were not deployed in corresponding regions.\n\n\"For many years, we have repeatedly raised the issue of substantive negotiations on disarmament issues, in almost all its aspects. And in recent years, we see that our partners do not support our initiatives. On the contrary, all the time pretexts are sought out for dismantling the already established system of international security,\u201d Putin said.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told Polygraph.info that President Putin\u2019s proposal is \u201cthe start of a conversation,\u201d but ultimately Moscow would be required to remove \u201cthose missiles that it has already deployed to locations further in the east so they cannot hit targets in Europe.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat would calm the waters in the absence of the INF Treaty. It\u2019s not an ideal solution but it\u2019s one way to avoid each side from rushing to develop and deploy prohibited missiles.\u201d\n\nKimball\u2019s assertion that Russia will \u201cultimately\u201d need to move the missiles reflects the State Department\u2019s 2014 assessment that Russia was in violation, despite a later congressional assessment the U.S. \u201cdid not offer any details.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of State Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Bureau, in an unclassified April 2018 report, \u201cdetermined\u201d that Russia \u201ccontinued to be in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 kilometers to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.\u201d\n\nIt identified the Russian missile as the SSC-8 (Novator 9M729), and added details that covert development began in the mid-2000s, testing soon afterward. An independent report indicated the Novator had not been tested beyond INF limits even as late as 2015.\n\u2022 The GLCM has a range capability between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, a treaty violation;\n\u2022 It is distinct from an earlier version; and,\n\u2022 The missile is distinct, with the Russian designation as the 9M729.\n\nA January 2019 Congressional Research Service report noted that Russian diplomats had proposed that Russia display the 9M729 \u201cand demonstrate that it could not fly to INF range\u2026\u201d The U.S. rejected this proposal, arguing inspection was not enough to verify and demanding Russia destroy the missile.\u201d\n\nAfter U.S. National Security Council official Christopher Ford revealed the the 9M729 in a November 29, 2017 speech, Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, an independent scientific analysis organization, said the designation, alone, did not mean much.\n\nIn December 5, 2017 blog post, Podvig said he had earlier suspected the missile in question had \u201cnot been tested to the INF range from a mobile ground-based launcher,\u201d adding he was certain that suspicion was correct.\n\n\u201cThis means that the evidence of a violation is indirect,\u201d he said.\n\nPodvig noted that under the INF Treaty, actual testing is not required if it can be proven a missile\u2019s capabilities exceed the range. He posited that either U.S. intelligence \u201chas detailed blueprints\u201d or, more likely, the missile is \u201calmost identical\u201d to another that was tested, the sea-launched Kalibr.\u201d\n\nBy February 4, 2019, the U.S. claimed it knew Russia had flight tested the 9M729 to distances well over 500 kilometers.\n\n\u201cThe United States has provided Moscow with substantial information about this system\u2019s violations, including geographic coordinates and dates for the tests, but Russia continues to deny any wrongdoing,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Huntsman wrote.\n\nLikewise, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok and Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld wrote a letter last November stating that \u201cbased on intelligence \u2026The Netherlands can independently confirm that Russia has developed and is currently introducing a ground-based cruise weapon.\u201d\n\nNATO foreign ministers released a statement supporting the U.S. position regarding the alleged Russian violation, following a meeting December 4.\n\nAsked why the U.S. had not disclosed related information to publically bolster its case, Kimball said U.S. intelligence likely \u201cdid not want to compromise its sources or methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cMethods by which the U.S. has gathered the information are very sensitive and parts of the U.S. government, the intelligence community in particular, are reluctant to provide that information,\u201d he told Polygraph.info.\n\nBut Kimball added that if Russia is in the wrong, \u201cwe need to show that Russia is in the wrong\u201d by providing \u201cinformation that third parties can see that undergirds the U.S. case.\u201d\n\nRussian Claims on the Missle Are Inconsistent\n\nMeanwhile, the CRS report quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergey Ryabkov calling the U.S. claims \u201cfabrications\u201d that are \u201cinconsistent with reality.\u201d\n\nRyabkov claimed the 9M729 is an \u201cupgraded\u201d version of the Iskander-M system missile whose maximum range was demonstrated at the Kapustin Yar testing ground in Astrakhan, southern Russia, as less than 480 kilometers, not an INF violation.\n\nAs Polygraph.info has reported recently, the Russian Defense Ministry displayed the 9M729 missile at an expo center in Moscow in January, and said more than 100 missile launches were conducted over the six years from 2008 to 2014 at the Kapustin Yar missile range in southern Russia.\n\nBut Zvezda, the Defense Ministry\u2019s official TV channel, quoted the commander of the Russian military\u2019s missile and artillery forces, as indicating that some of these launches in fact exceeded the INF Treaty\u2019s 500-kilometer range limit.\n\n\u201cRather than addressing U.S. concerns, Russia chose to claim that U.S. ballistic missile defense targets, Aegis Ashore missile defense systems in Poland and Romania, and armed UAVs violate the treaty,\u201d the U.S. ambassador, Huntsman wrote. \u201cIn contrast, the United States has responded in detail to these false Russian claims, demonstrating that we diligently comply with our treaty obligations in full.\u201d\n\nBut Kimball said that while some of Russia\u2019s claims are \u201can attempt to create a counter-narrative,\u201d others \u201cshould be responded to in a much more serious way.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Russia has a legitimate concern that the Aegis Ashore missile-defense systems and the Mk-41 Vertical Launching systems deployed in Romania can be used for offensive missiles.\n\n\u201cRussia modifying the 9M729 or getting rid of it [in exchange for] the U.S. agreeing to measures that we won\u2019t use Aegis Ashore and that we won\u2019t launch missiles into their territory [are options on the table],\u201d Kimball told Polygraph.info. \u201cThese are not equivalent problems \u2013 they are not both violations \u2013 but there is obvious trade space,\u201d he added, should the two countries chose to continue negotiating.\n\nBut he added neither the Trump administration nor Moscow are as \u201cinterested in solving this problem as they should be.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the Wall Street Journal that Russia has already deployed four battalions of the 9M729 further chips away at Putin\u2019s claim of compliance.\n\nWith Russia\u2019s recent admission of test violations, and reports the missile is deployed, Putin\u2019s claim that Russia will not place short- and medium-range weapons in Europe is moot and Polygraph.info finds Putin\u2019s statement is misleading at best.", "lang": "en"}
