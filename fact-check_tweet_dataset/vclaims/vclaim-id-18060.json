It\u2019s not backwoods graffiti, it means no trespassing. \u201cIt holds the same weight and the same law violations apply,\u201d said Prairie View A&M Extension Agent Ashley Pellerin. \u201cIt\u2019s no trespassing period.\u201d\n\nEnacted in 1997, the law states that the application of purple paint (typically in a shade known as \u201cNo Hunting Purple\u201d) to property features such as trees and fence posts in a specified manner is the legal equivalent of posting \u201cNo Tresspassing\u201d signs:\n\n\u201cNotice\u201d means: an oral or written communication by the owner or someone with apparent authority to act for the owner; or fencing or other enclosure obviously designed to exclude intruders or to contain livestock; or a sign or signs posted on the property reasonably likely to come to the attention of intruders, indicating that entry is forbidden; or the placement of identifying purple paint marks on trees or posts on the property. If purple paint is used, then the purple paint must be vertical lines of not less than eight inches in length and not less than one inch in width; placed so that the bottom of the mark is not less than three feet from the ground or more than five feet from the ground; and placed at locations that are readily visible to any person approaching the property and no more than: 100 feet apart on forest land or 1,000 feet apart on land other than forest land.\n\nThat law spares landowners, particularly in rural areas, from having to continually replace printed signs that often end up being stolen or eradicated by the elements.\n\nAlthough purple paint can be used in place of \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs in the state of Texas (if its application meets the requirements listed above), this information has been circulated online under misleading clickbait titles such as \u201cIf You See Purple Paint on a Fence Post, Pay Attention! It Could Save Your Life,\u201d leaving readers with the mistaken impression that such markings indicate imminent danger.\n\nAlthough a person who willfully enters an area marked with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d warnings (either in the form of signs or paint) might be subject to criminal or civil penalties, such warnings do not in themselves indicate any significant level of danger, much less an imminent threat to life. In general, landowners may not use deadly force to protect property; they may only employ reasonable measures to repel trespassers (unless they believe those intruders pose a threat of great bodily harm or death).\n\nOnly a few states, including Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas, have so far enacted formal laws establishing purple paint markings as the legal equivalent of \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs.", "lang": "en"}
