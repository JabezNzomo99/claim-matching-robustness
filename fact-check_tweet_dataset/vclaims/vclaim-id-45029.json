The image shows four members hanging from an iron pipe. FACTLY has found the same image in a forensic research article published in October 2019. In the article, it was mentioned that the Police interrogation revealed poverty and inability to pay their debts as the reason for suicide. Some users have posted the same photo on Twitter with the claim that it shows the plight of Hindus in Pakistan. But, in the article, it can be read that incident is related to India.
