Make love, not war.\u201d In that post, we shared a video by a Facebook user which was that of a party at Valentine\u2019s Day Celebration at BJP Office in Mira Bhayandar.

The video can be seen below:\n\nHowever, instead of Bajrang Dal taking inspiration, it seems BJP has taken offence to its own cadre having some fun. According to a report by Hindustan Times, 8 of the people seen in the above video were asked to resign.
