Rahul is not even among the three leaders to have won with the highest margin in this election.\n\nOn Friday (May 24), I.T & Social Media Cell Congress posted the picture of Rahul along with the claim in Hindi that reads, \"Congress President Rahul Gandhi Ji has won with record number of 8 lakh 54 thousand 297 votes. Biggest win among 542 seats.\"\n\nHowever, this is not the official page of the Congress IT Cell.\n\nHere is the archived version of the post.\n\nThe post was widely shared on Facebook. Another user Pranav Mahajan also shared the same post.\n\nFrom the Wayanad seat, Rahul got 7,06,367 votes to defeat his nearest rival\n\nPP Suneer of the Communist Party of India, who secured 2,74,597 votes. Evidently, Rahul's victory margin stands at 4,31,770 votes. This result has been declared on the Election Commission's website.\n\nAs per the official results of the EC, not Rahul but BJP's CR Patil from Navsari in Gujarat registered the highest victory margin in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Patil defeated his nearest rival Dharmesh Bhai Bheembhai Patel by 6.89 lakh votes. He also tops in terms of vote share which is 74.37 per cent.\n\nBJP's Sanjay Bhatia from Karnal in Haryana has the second highest victory margin of 6.56 lakh votes. He stands second in terms of vote share as well which is 70.08 per cent.\n\nKrishan Pal, BJP candidate from Faridabad in Haryana, secured the third highest victory margin of 6.38 lakh votes and got a vote share of 68.8 per cent.", "lang": "en"}
