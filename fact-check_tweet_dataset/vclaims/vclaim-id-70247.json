But the story is based on a picture of a Cameroonian helicopter displayed on the Wikipedia page of the country\u2019s air force.\n\nAn article with the headline \u201cCameroon\u2019s army intercepts a French helicopter delivering weapons to Boko Haram\u201d published on the Africa24.info website on December 31, 2015 has been shared online nearly 10,000 times, according to the social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle.\n\nThe article claimed that a French helicopter carrying \u201cweapons, ammunition and dollars\u201d bound for Boko Haram was intercepted in the country\u2019s north.\n\nIt also said that two \u201cFrench terrorists\u201d with explosives were arrested in Cameroon\u2019s capital Yaounde.\n\nThe story has since been reproduced by dozens of websites in Cameroon and throughout francophone Africa, including Chad, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt has also been published on several Cameroonian blogs in English, like here and here.\n\nThe story was illustrated with a picture of what was claimed to be the French helicopter. But looking closely at the image, the letters \u201cTJ\u201d can be seen on the helicopter\u2019s tail -- TJ is Cameroon\u2019s nationality mark according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nA reverse image search on Russia\u2019s Yandex search engine revealed that the picture is on the English Wikipedia page of Cameroon\u2019s Air Force.\n\nThe Wikipedia page said the photo was taken during a joint training exercise between US and Cameroon troops on March 18, 2014.\n\nThe original picture can be seen on the website of the US army\u2019s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), which said it was taken in Cameroon\u2019s northwestern Koutaba area. The US army has confirmed the context in which the photo was taken.\n\nSearching for the words \u201chelicopter interception Boko Haram\u201d in all Facebook posts from January 1 to December 1, 2015 using the WhoPostedWhat tool, the first reference to the rumour is on the Africa Media page on July 26, 2015.\n\nNearly half a million Facebook users follow the Africa Media page, which has published posts linking vaccines to autism -- which has been thoroughly debunked by fact-checking sites -- as well as a hoax about the Catholic Church and sexist memes.\n\nThe 2015 post said that \u201ctwo French terrorists\u201d equipped with explosives were arrested in the predominantly Muslim neighbourhood of Briqueterie in Yaounde.\n\nSeveral Cameroon media outlets, including Camer.be, reported that two suspected \u201cWestern-type terrorists\u201d were arrested in Briqueterie on July 25, 2015 -- the day before the Africa Media post.\n\nHowever on July 26, numerous Cameroon media outlets reported that in fact a single Western journalist had been \u201cspotted by residents with a very strong Muslim faith while taking photos and reported him to the police\u201d.\n\nAccording to Camernews.com, the journalist was taking photos for a documentary before his arrest. After a \u201cthorough search followed by an interrogation\u201d he was released.", "lang": "en"}
