No, that's not true: the story and the composition of the bonus was made up by a French satire website.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Science Info on December 27, 2018 titled \"La prime de No\u00ebl des s\u00e9nateurs sera plafonn\u00e9e cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 17 580 euros seulement\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the movement of \"yellow vests\": more and more voices are raised to denounce the benefits enjoyed by senators. And this protest movement comes at the worst time for our dynamical parliamentarians because the month of December is the time when their Christmas bonus is paid. The bonus comes to a lump sum equal to twice the senatorial allowance (2 x 7209 euros), added to the latter are various bonuses such as additional Christmas bonus for children (5 000 euros per child), the premium for small children (2,500 per small child), one for Madame (8,000 euros), the coal premium (2,000 euros) and for the fir (800 euros).\n\nThe story mentions this year's amount will be capped with the remainder being put into a fund that will be distributed among senators as soon as the popular anger has subsided.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHowever Scienceinfo.fr carries following text on its \"about\" page:\n\nThis is basically the same text which can be found on the \"about\" page of scienceinfo.news, the English version of the site:\n\nThis ScienceInfo.news website is the English version of the French ScienceInfo.fr scientific information website.
