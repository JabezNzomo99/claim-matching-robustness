Jordan and Issa shortly after Issa chaired a hearing that focused in part on a memo that had not been seen by Henry Chao, the chief digital architect for the Affordable Care Act health-care exchanges. The memo had been the focus of a news release sent out on Monday evening by committee Republicans, two days before the hearing, generating news reports by CBS News and The New York Times. These remarks were prompted by Sean Hannity\u2019s questions about the memo, apparently based on that earlier reporting.\n\nThe committee\u2019s news release asserted that a Sept. 3, 2013, memo outlined \u201cserious security vulnerabilities\u201d in the exchange and quoted Chao, who had not seen it before being shown it by committee staff, as saying it \u201cpresented a significant risk to the system.\u201d But it turned out that, upon close examination of the memo, it had nothing to do with the parts of the Web site that launched on Oct. 1. Instead, the memo dealt with modules of the Web site that would not be operational until spring of 2014 \u2014 and even when these modules go online, they will not submit or share personally identifiable information.\n\nHANNITY: Yes. All right, let\u2019s go to some of the risk issues because the fact that they launched this with navigators that had no criminal background check \u2014 we learned from Mr. Chao yesterday that there was a memo issued, and they found prior to the launch of this two high-risk issues, and the memo said, quote, \u201cThe risk \u2014 the threat and risk potential to the system is limitless.\u201d Limitless? And he never saw this memo? How \u2014 he\u2019s the chief project manager for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services? Congressman Jordan, how is that possible? JORDAN: Well, I think what\u2019s even more scary is, Sean, someone did see it. Someone knew this system wasn\u2019t ready. And yet for political reasons, as the chairman said, they went ahead and launched it and put millions of Americans\u2019 personal information at risk. And do you know why they wouldn\u2019t delay it? For political reasons. They couldn\u2019t admit that Republicans were right, that this thing needed to be delayed. This law wasn\u2019t ready. It should be delayed. Frankly, it should be repealed. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they were willing to put Americans\u2019 personal information at risk because they couldn\u2019t admit \u2014 this administration couldn\u2019t admit that Republicans were right, and frankly, most of America is right when they don\u2019t like this law and they want it changed. HANNITY: You know, Congressman Issa, I actually looked \u2014 they actually in the memo said the risk to the system is limitless. That was in the memo that Mr. Chao, who should have seen this, didn\u2019t see. Federal guidelines actually define what high risk means, and they say the vulnerability could be expected to have severe or catastrophic adverse effects of organizational operations, assets or individuals. Who then bypassed the people that were supposed to know these things? Do you know the answer yet? ISSA: Well, what we know is that the people who knew or should have known, in fact, just simply ignored it.\n\nFrederick R. Hill , the committee\u2019s deputy staff director for communications and strategy, conceded that lawmakers\u2019 comments did not reflect the information obtained at the hearing. \u201cIt is fair to point out that Congressman Connolly was effective in getting Mr. Chao to state his position that the Sept. 3 memo was not about something that launched on Oct. 1,\u201d he said. In their remarks, he said Issa and Jordan \u201ctransitioned to a broader thing about the readiness of the site for security purposes.\u201d\n\nHill pointed out that Chao, in a July e-mail, had noted that he had testified under oath to Congress that the now-troubled Web site would be launched on Oct. 1. He also noted that Democrats on the committee, in a memo, have said \u201cthe deployment of the Healthcare.gov website was not adequately tested or implemented.\u201d (Note: that specific section has to do with performance testing, not security of personal information.)\n\n\u201cI think this is a firm factual foundation for the members to express the view that Americans face risks due to incomplete testing omitted in a rush to meet a politically committed deadline of October 1,\u201d he said. He also noted that Chao has not stepped away from his claim in the interview that he should have been informed about the memo. (He was not specifically asked this question at the hearing.)\n\nChao was at the center of the committee\u2019s original news release. And he testified that the memo in question did not relate to a part of the Web site that went active on Oct. 1 and did not relate to a part of the system that handles personal information. Issa and Jordan certainly have the right to express opinions, but they can\u2019t tie their opinions to information that has already been disproved.", "lang": "en"}
