Pramod Muthalik is not a member of BJP. I condemn Muthalik\u2019s statement comparing Dogs to Gauri Lankesh. He has insulted the Dogs which are more faithful to their Masters than venomous UrbanNaxals.\u201d tweeted C.T Ravi, BJP MLA from Chikmagalur, Karnataka referring to a tweet by Jignesh Mevani condemning the statement of Pramod Muthalik. Muthalik made a comparison of the death of a dog to the murder of Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead on September 5, 2017. C.T Ravi has more than 117000 followers on Twitter including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The tweet sarcastically condemns the statement of Muthalik with yet another disreputable comment stating that it is an insult to dogs.\n\n\u201cI strongly object to Pramod Muthlik for Insulting Dogs by comparing them to Gauri Lankesh Please Respect Dogs\u201d, tweeted Roop Darak(@roopnayandarak), who is followed by BJP President Amit Shah, in a response to a tweet from Shakhnaad.\n\nDarak has pictures of himself with MLA C.T. Ravi, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. A day before the above tweet, he had tweeted, \u201cPramod Muthalik insulted Dogs, Shame on him\u201c.\n\nMoreover, the tweet from Roop Darak(@roopnayandarak) was supported by a right-wing handle @NikunjSahu who is followed by both the official handles of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His bio states, \u201cNation First, Business Next, Self Last | Member of BJP IT Cell | Proudly followed by PM Narendra Modi Ji | (Tweets & Abuses are extremely personal)\u201d.\n\nRoop Darak was referring to a comment made by Pramod Muthalik, chief of Sri Rama Sene at a public meeting in defence of PM Modi\u2019s silence on the sensational murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh. Muthalik questioned the people, \u201cWhy should the prime minister react if some dog dies in Karnataka?\u201d. The Special Investigation Team probing the murder of Gauri Lankesh has arrested a 26-year-old Parashuram Waghmore, who is said to have pulled the trigger. Waghmore is allegedly a Sri Ram Sene activist. A photo of Parashuram Waghmore and Pramod Muthalik was also viral on social media before he made the public statement.\n\nAlt News had reported how many right-wing accounts had been spewing abuses on social media against journalist Gauri Lankesh when she was murdered. Nikhil Dadhich\u2019s tweet was the most horrendous, comparing those condemning the act with puppies crying out for their dead mother. The tweet created an outrage against PM Modi for following such abusers on social media.\n\n\u201c\u090f\u0915 \u0915\u0941\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u094c\u0924 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0938\u0941\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u093f\u0932\u092c\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c \u0905\u092c \u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0915\u0939 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f \u0928\u0947 \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 #GauriLankesh \u0915\u094b \u0935\u0939\u0940 \u0926\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0936\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092e\u092a\u0902\u0925\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948? (Translation: A bitch died a dog\u2019s death and all of her litter is crying in the same voice)\u201d tweeted Nikhil Dadhich(@nikhildadhich) on 5th September after news of Gauri Lankesh\u2019s murder broke out. Dadhich now has a verified Twitter account with more than 42000 followers. Along with Dadhich, two more Twitter accounts Rita(@RitaG74), with more than 58000 followers and Ashish Mishra pune(@aashish81us) with more than 17000 followers had hurled abuses on Lankesh. It may be noted that all the abuser mentioned in the article till date are followed by the Prime Minister.\n\nWhy is the PM still following them?\n\nIn a public statement issued on 7th September 2017, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya stated that the Prime minister is a believer of freedom of speech and expression and has never blocked or unfollowed anyone on Twitter. He further stated that PM following someone is not a character certificate of a person. This was in response to the question raised against PM Modi following trolls and accounts who regularly abuse people disagreeing with the BJP.\n\nThe argument of freedom of speech and expression that is touted in defense of following such serial abusers on social media defies logic. Unfollowing a person does not restrict that person\u2019s freedom of speech and expression as the person can continue to post according to Twitter\u2019s policies. However, the failure to unfollow such abusers reflects poorly on the Prime Minister and his office.", "lang": "en"}
