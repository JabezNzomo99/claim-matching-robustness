Aguilar.\n\nAnak Bayan is not included in the petition -- the group is not running in this election, according to Comelec\u2019s tentative and certified list of candidates.\n\nAguilar's petition claimed that these party-list groups and senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares are linked with the CPP-NPA. Aguilar claims to be a former member of the New People's Army (NPA), the armed unit of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). He also claims to be a member of the Kilusan at Alyansa ng mga Dating Rebelde (KADRE) and ACT member.\n\nSiegfred Deduro, vice chairman of Makabayan in the Visayas, said in a statement to the Iloilo media that the disqualification claim is not true.\n\nBayan Muna chairperson and Senatorial bet Neri Colmenares also dismissed the claim on a Twitter video and urged the Comelec to take action against it.\n\nAct Teachers said the claim is \u201cfake news\u201d while Kabataan called it a \u201cdesperate attack of the Duterte regime.\u201d Gabriela called on their followers to fight the lies and fight for the truth.\n\nBayan Muna, which is among the top partylist groups in Pulse Asia's latest pre-election survey, urged the public not to believe the claim.\n\nUnder Article XXII, Sec. 261.i of the Omnibus Election Code, the intervention of public officers or employees may be considered as an election offense:\n\n\u2026 any officer, employee, or member or the Armed Forces of the Philippines, or any police force, special forces, home defense forces, barangay self-defense units and all other para-military units that now exist or which may hereafter be organized who, directly or indirectly, intervenes in any election campaign or engages in any partisan political activity, except to vote or to preserve public order, if he is a peace officer.\n\nThe post is no longer accessible at Diego Pagbabago and the police and reservists\u2019 accounts. But the same image was posted hours after by and is still available as of this writing on the pro-Duterte Facebook page Blessed Be Philippines.\n\nCreated on Nov. 23, 2016, Blessed Be Philippines has changed its name six times. It was previously called Jose Panganiban CN Duterte Supporters, Jose Panganiban CN Beautiful Places, Pinoy Opinion Political, Ipapapsa Compilation and Blessed Be. As of writing time, the Blessed Be Philippines post earned 379 reactions and 158 shares.\n\nDifferent versions of the same false claim also received a lot of interactions on Facebook. For one, the Pinoy Expose post received 546 reactions and 149 shares as of writing time.\n\nRead the reports of VERA Files, Rappler and The Philippine Star.\n\nThe views and information in \u2018Tsek.ph\u2019 are those of their respective authors and owners and do not reflect the official policy or position of the media and academic partners of Tsek.ph.", "lang": "en"}
