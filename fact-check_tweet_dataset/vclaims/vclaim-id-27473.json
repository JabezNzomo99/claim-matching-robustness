For example, in 2011, the feminist blog Jezebel reported:\n\nThe sole purpose of the \u201cAPPARATUS FOR FACILITATING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD BY CENTRIGUGAL FORCE\u201d (AFFTBOACBCF, perhaps, for short?) is as such: \u201cto provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts.\u201d GENTLE?! That contraption looks anything but gentle. And who might this machine be meant for? \u201cIn the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, as is common with all more primitive peoples, nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case, however, with more civilized women who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement.\u201d\n\nThe patent for the machine does in fact exist and can be found by searching the website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A patent for the so-called \u201cApparatus for Facilitating the Birth of a Child By Centrifugal Force\u201d was granted to New York residents George and Charlotte Blonsky on Nov. 9, 1965. The purpose of the device was to provide \u201cgentle\u201d aid to a woman in giving birth by swirling her around fast enough to create enough force to help propel the baby out.\n\nA rather not-gentle-looking sketch of a nude woman strapped spread-legged into a large piece of machinery accompanied the patent.\n\n\n\n However, we found no evidence that this contraption was ever built or put to use.", "lang": "en"}
