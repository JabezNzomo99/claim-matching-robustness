The minister's statement was made in defence of Centrelink's automated debt recovery system - described by critics as robo-debt - after it was revealed the agency had pursued a debt in May 2019 from the mother of a disability pensioner, who had been dead for six months. [1] [2]\n\nFederal Labor leader Anthony Albanese asked Mr Robert in parliament if the government\u2019s robo-debt system had issued debt notices to \u201cvictims of the Townsville flood\u201d which hit the town in February 2019. The flood left three people dead and damaged more than 3000 homes. The minister replied \u201cat present no victims in the four postcodes around Townsville\u201d received a notice. [1] [3]\n\nOn July 17, the Guardian Australia reported that Centrelink staff had resumed welfare debt compliance in Townsville. The report quoted Townsville Community Legal Service lawyer Michael Murray, who said there had \u201cbeen an increase in clients coming in to get advice about robodebts\u201d. Townsville mayor Jenny Hill said resuming welfare debt compliance operations would only make matters worse in a town was still recovering from the floods .[3]\n\nOn July 29, Labor\u2019s government services spokesman Bill Shorten tweeted the story about Centrelink pursuing a $6,744 debt from Anastasia McCardel's son, a deceased disability pensioner. \u201cThis is why we in Labor say: #ScrapRobodebt\u201d Mr Shorten tweeted. He also issued a media statement, dated and sent to AAP on July 29, titled, \u2018Government Must Scrap Robodebt\u2019, which listed another case of a 79-year-old man who received a Centrelink letter about a $67.55 debt from 1998. [4] [5]\n\nMr Robert in turn issued a media release on July 30, titled \u2018Bill Shorten Wrong on Townsville Centrelink Debt Claims\u2019. \u201cThe last thing people in the Townsville region need are false rumours of debt notices for income compliance being issued,\u201d Mr Robert said. \u201cI want to reassure people in the Townsville region that debt recovery for income compliance recovery has not recommenced and it will not be commencing in the foreseeable future.\u201d [6]\n\nOn July 31 Mr Shorten tweeted a redacted debt notice issued by Centrelink on July 8 headed \u201cAccount Payable\u201d and \u201cWhy you owe money\u201d. The notice was addressed to a Townsville postcode (4812) with a payment due on August 6. \u201cRobodebt Minister Stuart Robert told the Parliament no debt recovery was occurring in flood-ravaged Townsville. What's this?\u201d Mr Shorten tweeted. [7]\n\nOn July 31 Mr Shorten asked the minister in parliament why he\u2019d given an \u201cabsolute assurance\u201d that victims of the Townsville floods hadn\u2019t received debt recovery notices when some received letters as recently as July 8. Mr Robert replied: \u201cDuring natural disasters - such as cyclones, bushfires or floods - it is routine practice of the Department of Human Services to temporarily suspend all complaints activities within an affected local area. As a general rule this suspension is in place for six months unless extended. I have asked the department to extend the absence of debt recovery in northern Queensland for the foreseeable future until I\u2019m satisfied the region has recovered.\u201d [8]\n\nWhen asked by AAP FactCheck for a response to Mr Shorten\u2019s copy of a debt notice, Mr Robert\u2019s office emailed a transcript of a Sky News interview with the minister dated July 31. [9]\n\nThe same interview is available on Sky News Twitter [10]. In the interview Mr Robert was asked about the July 8 debt notice Mr Shorten tweeted. He replied \u201cThe department has said no debt work or recovery has commenced.\u201d But went on to admit the Department of Human Services had commenced compliance work \u201cof their own volition\u201d. \u201cThey commenced compliance work, though, on the 2nd of July. I was informed on 22 July the department of their own volition had commenced. It was my wife's birthday. I remember it well. And immediately said, no, I don't want compliance to continue either. So debt halt had gone right the way through from 1 February to today. It's still in place, and I put a hold on any compliance work on 22 July as well.\u201d [9] [10]\n\nBased on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Robert\u2019s statement on July 30 was ambiguous. It was not possible to establish the veracity of the minister\u2019s statement.", "lang": "en"}
