Thank you, Modi Ji, for opening the liquor shops (translated from Hindi),\" reads the caption.\n\nThe third phase of lockdown began on May 4, with certain relaxations. The Centre had allowed the sale of liquor albeit with \"certain conditions\" in all zones, barring containment area, in standalone shops.\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs had allowed the liquor and tobacco shops to reopen in green and orange zones and even in red zones but not outside containment areas or hotspots. With liquor stores finally opening after 40 days, videos of long, winding queues from different parts of the country surfaced on social media, which showed that social distancing was completely ignored. The viral photos are recent, taken after May 4. Both the claims are false. On doing a reverse image search, it was found that the images were available on the internet since 2019.\n\nThe Logical Indian could not ascertain the exact source of these photos, however, it is evident that the claims along with the photos are out of context.
