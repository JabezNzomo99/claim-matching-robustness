The industry statement mentioned in the poster comes from a letter sent to Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) by a group of energy industry associations. \u201cMethane emissions from oil and natural gas production have declined by 15% since 1990 without federal regulation, even as natural gas production has increased by 47%,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe problem is the insertion of the word \u201coil.\u201d Methane emissions from natural gas production and use have declined by 15 percent between 1990 and 2014, as noted in a 2016 report by the Natural Gas Council and in the Environmental Protection Agency data cited in a footnote in the industry letter. But if you add in oil production, methane emissions are basically flat since 1990.\n\nThe committee chart gilds the lily by breaking up the data on natural gas use into four parts, thereby making it difficult to see that there was some logic in the use of the 15 percent figure.\n\nWhy did the industry letter include the word \u201coil\u201d in the figure? We\u2019re not sure, as an industry spokesman did not return a call for comment.\n\nUpdate: The Committee\u2019s minority staff said they focused on production because that is what is covered by the rule. However, staff for the American Petroleum Institute dispute that, pointing to language concerning emissions through transmission and storage. API argues that it is more appropriate to refer to absolute emissions. Complicating matters, a draft EPA report taking the data to 2015, has completely new figures that indicate methane emissions from oil production actually have declined since 1990 (See Table 3-37). That report, showing a decrease in emissions of 27 percent instead of an increase of 76 percent, was released two weeks after the industry letter was sent.\n\nWe appreciate the outright apology from Lowenthal and the committee minority staff, and thus we will not award Pinocchios. Members of Congress always are free to cite our fact checks if they do so accurately. But remember \u2014 only The Washington Post awards the Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
