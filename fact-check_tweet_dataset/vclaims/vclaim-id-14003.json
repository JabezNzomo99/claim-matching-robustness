If Sadhvi had made any such controversial statement publicly, it would have been covered by media houses and BJP rivals.\n\nWe only found the statement in an article by a website called IndiaScoops. (https://indiascoops.com/will-totally-ban-beef-in-states-like-goa-north-east-if-bjp-comes-to-power-at-the-centre-sadhvi-pragya/). On April 26, the website published an article titled - \"Will Totally Ban Beef in States like Goa, North-East, If BJP Comes to Power at the Centre: Sadhvi Pragya\".\n\nAccording to the article, Sadhvi Pragya made these comments during an election campaign in Madhya Pradesh's Sehore.\n\nImmediately in the next sentence, the article mentioned that \"these comments were not made before the media, or at a public gathering but in front of a group of followers\". There is also an 'Editor's Note' in the article, elaborating on this particular point.\n\nIndia Today also reached out to Sadhvi Pragya's sister, Upma Singh. She clearly said the viral statement is \"baseless\". It has been falsely attributed to Sadhvi, she added.\n\nSadhvi Pragya, an accused in the Malegaon blast case, was in jail for almost nine years from October, 2008, to April, 2017.\n\nShe had recently sparked controversy over her remarks on Mumbai Anti-Terrorist Squad chief Hemant Karkare. She boasted that 26/11 hero Karkare died because she had \"cursed\" him.", "lang": "en"}
