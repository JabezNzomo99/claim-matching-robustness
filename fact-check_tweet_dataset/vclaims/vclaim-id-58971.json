They said the CDC labels an outbreak as an epidemic if: \u201c\u2026 the number of deaths attributable to the disease exceeds a certain percentage of total deaths per week.\u201d\n\nBut this is not entirely correct.\n\nFirst, it should be noted that as of this writing (in mid-July 2020), the CDC has made no announcements about COVID-19\u2019s epidemic classification. Second, the prevalence of the disease, not the number of deaths, is considered to be the main indicator of its epidemic status, according to the CDC: \u201cEpidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\u201d\n\nCDC data indicate that deaths from [pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19] began skyrocketing in the country around the second week of March, hitting a peak around early May and then plummeting quickly after that. The latest data show that the percentage of deaths in the country attributable to those factors had as of the last week in June reached its lowest point since the end of last year, becoming \u201cequal to the [current] epidemic threshold of 5.9%,\u201d the CDC said. The agency notes that the official tally of deaths \u201cwill likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks.\u201d Yet the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, pneumonia and influenza have been declining for 10 straight weeks, the agency said on its website, suggesting COVID-19 may cease to qualify as an epidemic in the next few weeks.\n\nThe CDC data for the week ending July 4 did indeed state that the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 \u2014 also known as PIC \u2014 based on current death certificate data, \u201cdecreased from 6.9% during week 26 to 5.5% during week 27, representing the eleventh week of a declining percentage of deaths.\u201d\n\nSnopes asked the CDC what they meant by an \u201cepidemic threshold,\u201d and if this data was accurate. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told us:\n\nThe \u201cepidemic threshold\u201d refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza, and now COVID-related mortality. This \u201cepidemic threshold\u201d wording only refers to deaths related to COVID-19, which are a lagging indicator of disease activity. The death data is also something that gets filled in as more data \u2013 in this case death certificates \u2013 are added. This one piece of data doesn\u2019t have bearing on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic.\n\nIn summary, the current death data was not completely reliable, nor did it determine COVID-19\u2019s classification as an epidemic.\n\nNordlund emphasized to Snopes that death data lagged behind data for testing and cases, and was incomplete for recent weeks. The number of deaths would likely increase once more data was collected.\n\nWhile Just the News acknowledged that the data could change, they ignored that in the same report where the CDC stated: \u201cMortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week and is currently at the epidemic threshold but will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed.\u201d\n\nEven though these claims cite CDC data, they fail to acknowledge the CDC\u2019s own caveat that this data is incomplete. Furthermore, this data alone has no bearing on whether COVID-19 is classified as an epidemic. We therefore rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
