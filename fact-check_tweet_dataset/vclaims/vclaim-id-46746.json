The claim is false; the image has been doctored to include manipulated placards; the original image previously circulated in media reports about a November 2019 protest which saw police clash with a group of lawyers over a parking space in Delhi.\n\nThe image was published in this Facebook post on December 20, 2019.\n\nThe image shows several uniformed police officers holding placards that read: \u201cNo NRC / No CAB\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nNRC is an acronym for the National Register of Citizens, an official record of all Indian citizens which was implemented in India\u2019s northeastern state of Assam. It recently came under scrutiny after almost two million people were excluded from the list released on August 31, 2019, which critics claimed was an attempt to marginalise the state's large minority of Muslims, as reported by AFP here on September 2, 2019.\n\nCAB is an acronym for the Citizenship Amendment Bill, now referred to as the Citizenship Amendment Act after India passed the bill on December 11, 2019. The new law granted citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. It was labeled anti-Muslim by critics, and resulted in widespread violent protests across the country, as reported by AFP here on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption in the misleading Facebook post translates in English to: \u201cPolice personnel are also with us in saving the constitution\u201d.\n\nThe same image was also shared here, here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the image has been doctored to include manipulated placards.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original photo published here in a report by Chennai-based newspaper The Hindu on November 5, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by The Hindu:\n\nThe photo caption reads: \u201cDelhi Police officers holding posters during a protest demonstration against the recent attack by lawyers outside the Police Headquarters, New Delhi on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nSome of the placards read: \u201cWe want equality in justice\u201d; \u201cSave the savers / We want equal justice\u201d; \u201c#save_police\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the photo published by The Hindu (R):\n\nThe same protest was also covered by local Indian media, including here by English-language newspaper Hindustan Times and here by Indian English-language television channel NDTV.", "lang": "en"}
