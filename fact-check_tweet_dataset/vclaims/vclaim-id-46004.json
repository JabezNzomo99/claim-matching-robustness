Several users have expressed distress that Muslim or Christian places of worship haven\u2019t been transformed into quarantine centres for coronavirus patients but a temple has been used for the purpose.\n\nThe clip has also been shared with the same claim in English.\n\nA close look at the video reveals a banner that reads \u2018Ganesh Sadan\u2019.\n\nA subsequent keyword search \u2013 \u2018Ganesh Sadan Andhra Pardesh\u2019 \u2013 throws up results of an indoor lodging \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019 in Chittoor. This has been transformed into a temporary quarantine centre by the state government. This was earlier fact-checked by Factly.\n\nPhotographs of the residential complex on Google maps (top) match with the visuals of the building seen in the video (bottom).\n\nFrom what it seems, the place provides lodging, especially to pilgrims. It is situated less than a kilometre away from the Vinayaka Temple. A Google image that shows the insides of the premises reveals a banner listing the dress code for pilgrims.\n\nBelow is an image of Vinayaka Temple, Kanipakam.\n\nTherefore, a video of Muslim patients exiting a COVID-19 quarantine centre set up in a residential lodging was shared with the false claim that Vinayaka Ganesh temple was used for the purpose.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 5,000 and more than 150 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 14 lakh confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.
