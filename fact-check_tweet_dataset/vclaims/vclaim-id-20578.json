This must come in the form of an executive order signed by Nevada\u2019s governor, secretary of state and deputy secretary of state, and its implementation concerns practically every branch of the government and the public.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement of emergency in question, which was issued by the Department of Taxation, concerns only the urgent need amending state regulations regarding the procedure for licensing retailers involved in distributing marijuana. According to the statement, the current regulations are too strict and present an obstacle to satisfying public demand for the product.\n\nAll of the executive orders issued by the governor declaring a state of emergency are displayed for public viewing on the official state of Nevada website. As of July 2017, Gov. Brian Sandoval had issued three emergency orders, all of them concerning weather conditions. No state of emergency has been declared over the shortage of marijuana supplies.", "lang": "en"}
