The report is misleading.\n\nThe newspaper story bore the headline, \u201cWarnings of virus in 1981,\u201d and claimed that two novels \u201cappeared to have predicted\u201d the COVID-19 outbreak: Dean Koontz\u2019s The Eyes of Darkness published in 1981 about a man-made virus in China and Sylvia Browne\u2019s 2008 book End of Days about a pneumonia-like illness spreading across the globe in 2020.\n\nFrom March 13 to 24, at least four netizens published on Facebook (FB) the same image: a screengrab of a yellowed newspaper clipping uploaded on FB, captioned, \u201cluma na dyaryo (old newspaper)...nahulaan talaga (it was really predicted)\u2026God save us.\u201d\n\nThe circulating clipping came from a Feb. 20 issue of British tabloid The Daily Star. It circulated online as early as March 2.\n\nThe story dubiously points out alleged similarities between COVID-19 and the viruses described in the books. The virus which Koontz called Wuhan-400 in his fiction novel was described as a biochemical weapon made in a lab.\n\nIn a Feb. 18 statement in the medical journal The Lancet, public health scientists strongly condemned \u201cconspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,\u201d saying multiple studies in different countries \u201coverwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.\u201d\n\nIt is the same conspiratorial claim that was made into a video that Senate President Vicente Sotto III showed during a Senate hearing in February.\n\nThis month reports have been published about a Chinese research paper proposing that the virus likely came from a lab in Wuhan -- the city where COVID-19 was first detected. But Chinese authorities have clamped down on its publication.\n\nKoontz, in his novel, describes the virus to have a 100% kill rate, and that one becomes an infectious carrier after four hours of exposure. This is not true for COVID-19. Currently, the disease has about 3 to 4% mortality rate, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAs for its incubation period, the Department of Health, citing WHO, says the time from when a person first becomes exposed to COVID-19 to when he/she first exhibits symptoms may take between one and 12.5 days. WHO ultimately recommends monitoring up to 14 days.\n\nOn the other hand, Browne said in her 2008 book that a \u201csevere pneumonia-like pandemic\u201d will hit the world in 2020. This is inaccurate, as not all cases of COVID-19 infections reach pneumonia-level sickness. A March 6 situation report from WHO says data to date suggest that \u201c80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nThe misleading FB posts were published amid the rising rate of COVID-19 infections in different parts of the world, which originally started in Wuhan City, China. Over 21,000 people have shared the inaccurate posts.", "lang": "en"}
