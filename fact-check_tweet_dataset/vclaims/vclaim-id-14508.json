The latest is\n\nclaim that China could seize Kenya\u2019s assets over debt.\n\nThis interest comes from increased trade between the two countries. In November 2018 President Uhuru Kenyatta\n\ntrade with China had grown \u201cmore than eighty-fold\u201d between 2007 and 2017.\n\nKenyatta was speaking at the opening of the first\n\n\u201cChina now ranks as the number one trading partner with Kenya, accounting for 17.2% of Kenya\u2019s total trade with the world,\u201d Kenyatta\n\nDoes Kenya do most of its international trade with China?\n\ngives the most recent value of Kenya\u2019s exports and imports.\n\ngoods such as hides, skins, coffee, tea, titanium ores and plastics. From China\n\nmainly leather, rubber, machinery and transport equipment and chemicals.\n\nWhen exports and imports are added together, China is Kenya\u2019s largest trading partner. Overall,\n\nis larger than with China, but this is with 54 countries.\n\nTrade numbers well in favour of China\n\nBut much of the trade was \u201cheavily skewed\u201d in favour of China, Kenyatta said. He said Kenya\u2019s exports to China in 2017 were valued at $96.88 million, while it imported $3.79\n\n\u201cIt is important to correct the existing trade imbalance to enable a fairer share of the benefits of trade,\u201d he said.\n\nTowards this, he offered some suggestions to China:\n\u2022 None China should reduce or remove tariffs on the African goods it imports to give the countries better access to its market.\n\u2022 None Help African goods overcome barriers such as Chinese standards.\n\u2022 None Encourage Chinese firms to manufacture goods in Africa, to sell to the world.\n\u2022 None Establish more joint ventures, and so help grow African industries. \n\n\n\nKenya shouldn\u2019t be \u2018too dependent\u2019 on one country or region\n\n, gave two ways that Kenya could improve its trade.\n\nOne is to deepen its existing markets \u201c\n\nto ensure that trade goes beyond exporting raw commodities and importing finished products\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlso it should diversify the portfolio of trading partners by opening up new markets so as not to be too dependent on one country or region.\u201d\n\nAt a trade expo in China, President Uhuru Kenyatta said China was Kenya\u2019s number one trading partner.\n\nOfficial statistics show that in 2017, exports to and imports from China made up the largest share \u2013 17.3% \u2013 of Kenya\u2019s total international trade.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as correct.", "lang": "en"}
