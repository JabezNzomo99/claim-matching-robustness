There is no evidence that the Orwell statute will soon be removed from BBC headquarters.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 450 times, purportedly contains a screen grab of a Guardian article that puts up the headline \u201cGeorge Orwell statue outside BBC HQ \u2018To be removed.'\u201d The statue was first unveiled in 2017, according to BBC News.\n\n\u201cSculpture of famous author to be taken down after BBC staff complained his themes \u2018made them feel uncomfortable,'\u201d reads the alleged subheadline. (RELATED: Did George Orwell Say This Quote About \u2018Rough Men\u2019?)\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that The Guardian ever published the article shown in the Facebook post. A search of the British outlet\u2019s website and social media turned up no articles to this effect. The article, despite mimicking the look of real content from The Guardian, is fabricated.\n\nThe fake screen grab was first posted on Twitter, and thousands of users retweeted it, according to Mediaite. Twitter user @MechEngineerB later clarified that he \u201cfaked it\u201d in a June 15 tweet.\n\n\u201cCan everyone stop telling me that this is a fake, please?\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cI know it\u2019s a fake. I faked it!\u201d\n\nThe fake article\u2019s claim that the Orwell statue outside BBC headquarters will be removed doesn\u2019t appear to hold up either. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about it being taken down, and the BBC hasn\u2019t put out a press release announcing such a move.\n\nOrwell worked for the BBC from August 1941 to November 1943, according to BBC News.", "lang": "en"}
