We wanted to know more, partly because the ranking means Ohio would trail less populous states.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Development said in its latest report on state exports that Ohio was the 9th largest exporting state, confirming what he said.\n\nThe Development Department is an affiliate of the U.S. Census Bureau. With the U.S. Commerce Department, it is the official source for U.S. export and import statistics. We followed our curiosity further into its data from 2011, the most recent available:\n\nIn global exports, Ohio trails Texas, California, New York, Washington, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana and Michigan.\n\nThe state's largest export market is Canada, followed by Mexico, China, France and Brazil.\n\nAnd export-supported jobs linked to manufacturing account for an estimated 7.1 percent of Ohio's total private-sector employment.", "lang": "en"}
