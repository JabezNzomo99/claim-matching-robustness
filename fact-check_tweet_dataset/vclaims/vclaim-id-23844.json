The two most prominent ones being \u2013 \u201cskeleton of Ghatotkach\u201d and \u201cskeleton of Goliath\u201c.\n\nThe skeleton in the picture is a 28-metre long sculpture, Calamita Cosmica, made by an Italian artist Gino de Dominicis. A website called My Modern Met wrote an article, The Giant Travelling Skeleton, on the sculpture in 2012. According to the travelling website Atlas Obscura, \u201cCreated by Gino De Dominicis, this giant skeleton sculpture was displayed in Milan\u2019s Palazzo Reale in 2007. Named \u201cCalamita Cosmica,\u201d or \u201cCosmic Magnet,\u201d the sculpture is 28 meters long and weighs about eight tons, or 16,000 pounds. The artist completed this work shortly before his death.\u201d Dominicis died in 1998.\n\nAtlas Obscura updated its article in 2018 to inform that the sculpture has been relocated to \u201cChiesa della Santissima Trinit\u00e0 in Annunziata in Foligno, in the Umbria region\u201d.\n\nAmerican fact-checking website Snopeshad earlier fact-checked the image when it was circulated in 2018 as the skeleton of the biblical giant Goliath. According to Snopes, the image of the sculpture was shot by a Flikr user Mauro in 2007.\n\nThe skeleton\u2019s long, pointy nose is a feature that can be seen in much of De Dominicis\u2019 work, according to Atlas Obscura.\n\nTo find the truth behind the other pictures circulated along with Calamita Cosmica, Alt News performed multiple Google reverse image searches and found that they were all digital artwork posted on a website called Design Crowd and credited to different artists.\n\nThe photo of the gigantic skeleton circulating on social media, claiming that it is Ghatotkach\u2019s skeleton found during an excavation in Kurukshetra, is actually the sculpture Calamita Cosmica made by Italian artist Gino de Dominicis in 1998.", "lang": "en"}
