A UAE government source also confirmed to AFP that rumours of a ban on Nigerian three-month visas were \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday night, the UAE embassy in Abuja further announced that reports of visa restrictions were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and advised people of \u201cthe importance of sourcing news from its official channel\u201d.\n\nDubai is a popular vacation destination for Nigerians, drawn by luxury hotels and shopping opportunities, good weather and strong transport links.", "lang": "en"}
