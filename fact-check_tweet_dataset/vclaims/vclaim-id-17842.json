As previously reported, there is no evidence that Butina is facing extraordinary conditions by the standards of the U.S. criminal justice system, nor has evidence been provided that she has been mistreated while in prison.\n\nWhen asked by the judge, \u201cAre you pleading guilty not for any other reason but because you are guilty?\u201d Butina answered, \u201cYes, guilty.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the attempt by Russia\u2019s embassy in Canada to tie Butina\u2019s case to the Me Too movement, which focuses on sexual assault and harassment, or use it to attack the \u201cbias and hypocrisy of the feminist agenda,\u201d is specious.\n\nIn July, U.S. prosecutors alleged that Butina had offered \"sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.\"\n\nBut in September, they were forced to admit they had been \u201cmistaken\u201d when analyzing text messages between Butina and the man mentioned in her indictment as the \u201cU.S. Person 1.\u201d The latter was subsequently identified by media as her boyfriend Paul Erickson, a conservative political operative who had helped introduce Butina to influential figures in the U.S. to advance Russia\u2019s interests.\n\n\"The impact of this inflammatory allegation, which painted Ms. Butina as some type of Kremlin-trained seductress, or spy-novel honeypot character, trading sex for access and power, cannot be overstated,\" Robert Driscoll, Butina's attorney, wrote at the time.\n\nHe would later comment that the U.S. government\u2019s focus on Butina\u2019s sex life has \u201cgone too far and transformed into an irrelevant obsession.\u201d\n\nDespite the sexually-charged and ultimately \u201cerroneous\u201d allegations leveled at Butina, none of the charges she faced, nor those she pleaded to, were connected to trading sex for access. Butina herself has never claimed to be the victim of sexual harassment or assault.\n\nShe was ultimately charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without prior notification to the Attorney General, and conspiracy to commit an offense against the U.S.\n\nIn her plea deal, Butina admitted to conspiring with a Russian official and two Americans to infiltrate the National Rifle Association to create unofficial lines of communication among U.S. conservatives with the expressed goal of advancing Russia\u2019s interests. As part of her plea deal, one count of acting as a covert foreign agent was dropped.\n\nButina has also agreed to cooperate in \u201can ongoing federal investigation.\u201d\n\nWhile the issues of how Butina\u2019s gender played into media portrayals of her case and prosecutors alleged efforts to paint her as a \u201cKremlin-trained seductress\u201d can be debated, there appear to be no grounds to argue that her decision to plead guilty to conspiracy somehow exposes the \u201cbias and hypocrisy\u201d of the feminist agenda.\n\nIronically, as reported by Julia Davis in The Daily Beast, Russian television presenter Andrey Malakhov consciously played up the sex angle on Russian state television.\n\n\u201cWhat if [Butina\u2019s] aims were purely sexual? ... Some people like to sleep with famous athletes and some with politicians. She went there and wanted to meet them, that\u2019s all,\u201d Malakhov said during an interview with Butina\u2019s father before a live studio audience.\n\nUltimately, Butina\u2019s case and guilty plea had no connection to the Me Too movement.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds the latest claim by the Russian Embassy in Canada to be false.", "lang": "en"}
