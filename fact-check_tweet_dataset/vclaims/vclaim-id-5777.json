In the post, the user praises Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab for a \u201cfantastic effort\u201d working at a food bank. It goes on to say that food banks are providing a \u201cvital service\u201d for millions of people in the UK, with \u201cmillions more projected to use them in the coming years\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have made food banks exempt from face masks for those who cannot afford both masks & food,\u201d the post adds. Included underneath is a selfie of Raab at a facility in Surrey.\n\nThis screenshot has since been widely shared on Facebook and Twitter by people criticising Hancock for \u201cgloating\u201d over the number of people being forced to rely on charities for basic food supplies ( here , here , here , here , here ).\n\nWhile the selfie of Raab at a food bank is an authentic picture from July 24 ( here ), the Hancock tweet alongside it is not. The tweet was posted from a parody account, and not from the health secretary himself.\n\nThe tweet appears to have originated from an account with the handle @MattHannot, to which a number of the replies in a July 24 thread ( here ) are addressed. That Twitter account is no longer active.\n\nFalse. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock did not tweet to say millions more people would be using food banks in the coming years, nor that food bank users would be exempt from wearing masks.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
