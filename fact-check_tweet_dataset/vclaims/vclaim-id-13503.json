In March 2009 the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health published some research for the NHS and found 328 under 18s in England had type 2 diabetes. 134 were under the age of 15, and 6 of those were under the age of 10.\n\nThe research said it was unlikely to have identified all children with type 2 diabetes in England, but it\u2019s definitely wrong to say there were none.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about reporting on the number of children with diabetes in our blog here.\n\nThe Express has since removed the line from their piece.", "lang": "en"}
