DK Shivkumar Congress and Revanna JDS (Deve Gowda\u2019s elder son) are in conversation. At this rate, I fear Congress-JDS days are numbered. God save Karnataka!\u201d The tweet with a video of an altercation was shared by many including Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi foundation. The video is currently viral on all forms of social media including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Raised voices, flying tempers, finger pointing\u2026the video has everything that BJP supporters are looking for to vindicate their stand about the Karnataka coalition government. The only problem is that it is an old video and passing it off as an altercation right after Yeddiruppa\u2019s resignation is fake news.\n\nThe video is from 2016 and was posted on YouTube by \u201cKannada News\u201d with the caption \u201cRevanna v/s DK Shivakumar fight in Vidhan Sabha\u201d on June 11, 2016.\n\nWhile Kumar had the grace to retract his tweet after it was pointed out to him that this is fake news, the video continues to be shared widely on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA page called \u2018Presstitutes\u2019 which ironically claims to expose the mass media manipulation has shared the fake news.\n\nAfter the initial lull following the shock of yeddyurappa\u2019s resignation before the floor test, the fake news brigade is back in full swing. In the coming days expect more fake news from the usual quarters targeting the alliance and the key players. Social media users beware!", "lang": "en"}
