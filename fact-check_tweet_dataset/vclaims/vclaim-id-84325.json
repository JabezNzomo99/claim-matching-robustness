The claim is false; the government agency responsible for Philippine migrant workers overseas denied the scheme exists; government regulations allow returning migrant workers to apply for grants to help with reintegration, but they must present a business plan and the assistance is not provided as cash at the airport.\n\n\n\nThe false post was published here on May 2, 2019, where it has been shared 35,000 times.\n\nThe post claims that Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) returning to the Philippines who plan to return to work abroad can claim 25,000 Philippine pesos ($487) from the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) at airports in the Philippines, under a plan implemented by President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe post also claims that returning migrant workers who do not intend to return abroad can claim up to 12,000 Philippine pesos (US$233).\n\nThe post later states only OFWs returning from the Middle East can claim the money.\n\nOWWA is the government agency tasked to develop and oversee welfare programs for OFWs.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the false post:\n\n\n\nThe lengthy Tagalog language post translates to English in part as: \"I will just share this I gathered news that will definitely be of help to us especially those who will go home to the Philippines\u2026those who are about to go home and those who plan to go back to their employers will get 25,000 pesos for returning employees for those who will go home and will not go back anymore you will receive 12,000 pesos\u2026 if you're already at the airport in the Philippines don't go out look for OWWA get in the queue you will get cash from them that's for sure\u2026someone I know when she went home she did not expect that she will get money at the airport especially to those who will still return to their employers in 2 years you will get 25,000 pesos to those returning employees you will even get additional money depending on the number of years you've worked abroad\u2026 do not go out of the airport until you see the OWWA there so you can claim your money\u2026 that's big help this was implemented by President Duterte it's already been proven.\n\n\u201cAlso another thing only those from the middle east will get money\u2026thanks and good luck to us OFWs.\u201d\n\nAn almost identical post was also shared here on Facebook.\n\nHowever, OWWA said the scheme does not exist in this Facebook post published on its official page on May 6, 2019.\n\nThe Tagalog language post translates to English in part as: \u201cFake News: \"The post on Facebook about OWWA's giving of money at the airport is not true.\n\n\u201cOwwa doesn't have a program or service like that.\n\n\u201cTo know Owwa programs and services, visit https://www.owwa.gov.ph, contact the OWWAOFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGE OR CALL HOTLINE 1348.\"\n\nThe agency published an identical statement on its official website here on May 6, 2019.\n\nOverseas Filipino workers who lose their jobs or chose to return to the Philippines can apply for a 20,000 peso grant from the OWWA under the agency's reintegration program called \"Balik Pinas, Balik Hanapbuhay\" (Back to the Philippines, Back to Livelihood).\n\nBut the assistance is not handed out as cash at the airport and applicants must present a business plan before they can receive any financial assistance, according to reports on the scheme.\n\nA Philippine nongovernment organization which also works on labour and migrant issues told AFP that no such initiative as mentioned in the misleading post exists.\n\n\"No, OWWA is not giving money at the airport\", Susan Ople, founder of the Blas F. Ople Policy Center and Training Institute told AFP in a phone interview on June 26.\n\n\"Whoever posted that may want to give the OFWs hope, but because the information is wrong, it could lead to bigger frustrations\".", "lang": "en"}
