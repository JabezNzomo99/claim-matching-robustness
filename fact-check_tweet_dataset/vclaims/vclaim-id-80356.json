A disturbing video that has no connection to India is being shared as RSS men rip out Muslim man's heart.", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2017-12-08T18:38:19+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-80356", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/gory-mexican-cartel-video-shared-as-rss-men-rip-out-muslim-mans-heart/", "vclaim": "A horrific video showing members of a drug cartel ripping out a man's entrails while he is still alive is being shared on social media with a fake narrative of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) men ripping out a Muslim man's heart in the name of 'Love-Jihad'.\n\nThe video where at least three men can be seen pinning down a man and removing organs from his abdominal cavity is being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook with text in Kannada. The text translates as 'In the name of Love Jihad, RSS men rip Muslim brother's heart.'\n\nThe video was shared by Facebook page 'Muslim Defence Force'. The time of writing this story the video had about 974 views and 23 shares. BOOM has decided to not share the video in question due to its sensitive nature.\n\nIn the video the men seem to be speaking in what sounds like Spanish.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search of the frames of the video and found that the video is not from India. It has existed on the Internet since October this year.\n\nThe video is available on several seedy sites on the Internet where it has been uploaded as a video showing members of the notorious Mexican drug cartel the Jalisco New Generation Cartel torturing a rival gang member.\n\nBOOM has not verified the authenticity of the what these sites are claiming as they are not news websites and cannot be entirely trusted.\n\nHowever, the fact that this video is at least 2 months old and based on the audio we can say with some surety this did not take place in India, nor does it have anything to do with Muslims or the RSS. We will update our story upon verifying more details of the video.\n\n'Love-jihad' is a crude term to describe a sinister conspiracy to lure Hindu girls in order to alter the demographic balance of the country. While it's origin is fuzzy it is often attributed to fringe Hindutva groups.\n\nOn Thursday, a barbaric video of a Hindu man killing a Muslim labourer and setting his corpse on fire in Rajasthan, shocked the country.", "lang": "en"}
