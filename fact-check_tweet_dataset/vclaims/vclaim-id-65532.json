The post claims that bullets from another country cannot enter our country and Defence Minister has been compared to Lord Hanuman and how he helped Karn in Mahabharata.\n\nThe post also claims that one day these superstitions will ruin our country.\n\nWe found the same picture on as well. Other posts with the same picture can be seen , and .\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nOn putting the picture through Google Reverse Image Search, we found the original picture of the Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh in an article by dated October 9, 2019.\n\nThe picture caption read, \u201cIndian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh writes onto a Rafale jet fighter as a ritual gesture during a handover ceremony at the Dassault Aviation plant in Merignac, near Bordeaux, southwestern France.\u201d\n\nFurther, we found this picture in another article on The Siasat Daily, dated October 9, 2019, claiming that Rajnath Singh performs Shastra Puja in Paris after receiving first Rafael Fighter Jet.\n\nHence, the above information clearly states that the picture Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is morphed and claims of putting \u2018Nimbu Mirchi\u2019 on the borders are FALSE.
