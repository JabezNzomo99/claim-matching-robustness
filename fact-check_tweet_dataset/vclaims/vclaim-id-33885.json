The original picture is of policemen protesting outside the Delhi Police headquarters after a clash with lawyers recently.\n\nFacebook user \"Moizuddin Khaja\" posted the picture along with a caption in Hindi which translates to, \"A little more... it's just a step away... Inshallah... revolution will come.\"\n\nThe viral post shows policemen holding posters saying, \"No NRC, No CAA.\"\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post was shared more than 2,700 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nTo verify the claim, we reverse-searched the viral photo and found an article published by \"The Week\" on November 5 this year.\n\nThe article carries the picture of policemen protesting as seen in the viral post. However, here, one poster reads \"Policemen are also humans\" and another demands the arrest of one Kapil Tanwar.\n\nAccording to the article, on November 2, 2019, there was a dispute between police and lawyers at Delhi's Tis Hazari court over parking, which later turned violent. Two days later, a group of lawyers assaulted a policeman outside Saket court.", "lang": "en"}
