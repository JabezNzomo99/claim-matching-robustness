Questioned on this by the BBC this morning, the energy secretary conceded this was an uncertain figure.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014the economists who produced it said that the cost to the energy sector of leaving the EU\u2019s internal energy market could be \u201cup to\u201d \u00a3500 million. These costs would ultimately be passed on to energy suppliers and their consumers. But Brexit doesn\u2019t need to mean leaving the EU\u2019s energy market\u2014Norway is part of it despite not being an EU member.\n\nAnd it\u2019s wrong to portray the \u00a3500 million as their estimate of the impact on energy bills from Brexit. Access to the energy market isn\u2019t the only way the referendum outcome could impact bills in either direction, and the report doesn\u2019t try to put a figure on what might happen to bills.\n\nThe economists thought the bigger impact of Brexit would be to damage the confidence of energy investors, which could further raise costs. It didn\u2019t put a price on this.\n\nOn the other hand, members of the Leave campaign have argued that leaving the EU could allow the UK to drop some of its green targets, and that this could lower bills.\n\n\u00a3500 million is the forecast cost from leaving the internal energy market\n\nThe EU\u2019s \u201cinternal energy market\u201d is used to, among other things, trade energy across borders.\n\nIn November Vivid Economics, which was commissioned by the electricity and gas system operator National Grid to assess the impact of Brexit on the energy sector, said:\n\n\u201cThe impact of the UK being excluded from the IEM could be up to \u00a30.5 bn per annum in the 2020s. Most of these impacts could be effectively mitigated if the UK is allowed to remain in the IEM, although there would be a loss of influence over policy design which has not been quantified in this analysis.\u201d\n\nMost of that potential \u00a3500 million cost was to the electricity system, rather than gas. It said not being part of the internal market could reduce trading across borders and reduce investment in \u2018interconnectors\u2019, which allow the UK to access energy generated in other parts of Europe.\n\nIt was a tentative estimate, put together based on existing research. The economists said they hadn\u2019t seen the underlying data behind all the estimates used.\n\nA complicated business: the EU\u2019s impact on bills is wider than the IEM\n\nVivid Economics doesn\u2019t think Brexit\u2019s biggest effect on the energy sector would be that estimated \u00a3500 million cost.\n\nIn a report released yesterday it said that higher investment costs are \u201cthe most significant Brexit risk to the energy sector.\u201d\n\nIt said it thought energy investors might react to uncertainty around the UK\u2019s position if the UK votes to leave by demanding higher returns on their investments. In other words, they\u2019d want to be sure the energy could be sold at higher prices in order to offset their greater risks.\n\nThe report also said that changes to the exchange rate following an exit could push up prices\u2014for example if the pound falls in value that would make importing equipment from overseas more expensive.\n\nThe Leave camp has said that bills could go down after a Brexit. One reason given is that freeing the UK from EU green energy targets would allow the UK to invest in cheaper fuel sources, reducing bills.\n\nLeaving the EU wouldn\u2019t automatically remove all of those targets. The UK has its own domestic targets on carbon emissions, for instance, which would still be in place unless MPs decided to abolish them.\n\nThe House of Commons Library has said that leaving the EU could affect the UK\u2019s international climate commitments, which it currently negotiates as part of the EU.", "lang": "en"}
