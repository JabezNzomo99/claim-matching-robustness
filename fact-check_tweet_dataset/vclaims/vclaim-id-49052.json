Although Trump did at one point tap U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to help craft health care reform efforts, the news about it was a year old as of May 2020.\n\nIn April 2019, Scott, who was governor of Florida until January 2019, was the subject of a spate of news stories after Trump selected him to help lead efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as \u201cObamacare\u201d). At the time, the Tampa Bay Times reported on April 3, 2020, that Trump\u2019s selection had elevated an old scandal to the spotlight:\n\nBut in naming Scott, Trump inadvertently returned the national spotlight to a scandal that has dogged the former health care executive\u2019s entire political career. Scott resigned in 1997 as CEO of Columbia/HCA, one of the country\u2019s largest hospital networks, amid a federal investigation. Later, the company he helped found was fined $1.7 billion by the Department of Justice for defrauding Medicare and other government health care programs. At the time, it was the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history. While the investigation\u2019s findings covered Scott\u2019s time at the company, he was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s unclear whether Scott\u2019s efforts to reform health care are ongoing as of this writing. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Scott on the matter were unsuccessful. We do know that in June 2019, the Florida Phoenix reported that Scott appeared to be \u201cdistancing\u201d himself from the national reform effort, stating he was instead focused on crafting legislation in the Senate aimed at keeping health care costs down.\n\nScott did indeed plead the Fifth Amendment, which protects defendants from self-incrimination, some 75 times during court proceedings related to his tenure with Columbia/HCA on the advice of his attorney. But as Politifact and the Tampa Bay Times noted, that occurred in a civil case separate from the one initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIt is also true, according to the Miami Herald, that Scott, along with other Republican legislators in Florida, refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare when he was the governor of that state.\n\nIn short, because the claim that Scott was tapped to help lead an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was, as of the time of its recirculation on social media in 2020, a year-old news event, and because he appears to have distanced himself from that effort, we rate this claim \u201cOutdated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
