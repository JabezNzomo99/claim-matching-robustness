After rummaging multiple reverse image search results, we found a 2018 report by the news website Middle East Eye. The report includes a high-resolution image that shows an identical scene where a man in a Trump costume is leading two men dressed in thawbs. As per the report, the photograph is from an anti-Trump rally in London from two years ago. \u201cKhaled Bassoum, an Iraqi student-activist in London, came to the protest dressed as powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. He accused Trump of backing Bin Salman in killing innocent civilians in Yemen and across the Middle East, as he handed fake dollars to another man dressed in a Trump costume,\u201d reads the report. A video of an anti-Trump protest held in London in 2018 ahead of the US President\u2019s visit was falsely shared on social media with the claim that Americans are celebrating the \u2018enslavement\u2019 of Arabs.", "lang": "en"}
