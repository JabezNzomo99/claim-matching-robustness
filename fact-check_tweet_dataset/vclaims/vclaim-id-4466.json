The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900\u2019s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution. During the court case, new elements were brought to light as several Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churward.\n\nA number of factors in the first two paragraphs of the claim conflict with the standard template for junk news, but the article also follows that formula in several ways. On the latter score, searches for the \u201cAmerican Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA)\u201d point back either to the article itself or other pages referencing it, a strong indicator that organization does not exist.\n\nFurthermore, the claim regarding the Smithsonian guarding classified documents is unusual: The earliest technically classified documents in the United States go back only as far as World War I (which America entered in 1917), whereas the discovery of giant skeletons is dated vaguely as occurring in the early 1900s. Prior to the first World War, the need to classify documents as we would today had not yet come to issue (due to America\u2019s relative then-isolated status), and such a measure would be even less likely to apply to a archaeological discovery.\n\nAn image World News Daily Report claimed was taken in Ohio in 2011 has existed on the internet since 2008, and prior references identify the location of the picture as Turkey, not Ohio. The date initially claimed of the image back then was that it was taken in the 1990s. Another image of \u201cgiant skulls\u201d included with the article dated to a 2008 claim made on the web site of the Coast to Coast radio program. (Misattributed images attached to news articles are almost always red flags the claims made in those articles are shaky.)\n\nYet another image frequently attached to other versions of the claim depict Edouard Beaupre, a French-Canadian man afflicted with gigantism who died in 1904. A sideshow celebrity at the time, Beaupre\u2019s existence was hardly a secret and certainly not classified by the Smithsonian Institution. Finally, no such \u201cSupreme Court\u201d decision exists; and if it did, it would have been a matter of public record and widely reported in mainstream publications due to its notability.\n\nUnlike most fake news stories, this giant skeleton claim is an extant long-running rumor that refuses to stay dead rather than a recently invented falsehood. National Geographic has been battling the hoax since at least 2002, and stated in 2007 that:\n\nThe National Geographic Society has not discovered ancient giant humans, despite rampant reports and pictures. The hoax began with a doctored photo and later found a receptive online audience \u2014 thanks perhaps to the image\u2019s unintended religious connotations. A digitally altered photograph created in 2002 shows a reclining giant surrounded by a wooden platform \u2014 with a shovel-wielding archaeologist thrown in for scale. By 2004 the \u201cdiscovery\u201d was being blogged and emailed all over the world \u2014 \u201cGiant Skeleton Unearthed!\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s been enjoying a revival in 2007.\n\nThis version of the tale is certainly fake, as it incorporates elements of existing urban legends and hoaxes (obscuring the nature of the source), and World News Daily Report\u2018s disclaimer page explicitly states its content is fictional in nature:\n\nWorld News Daily Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to politicians and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction.", "lang": "en"}
