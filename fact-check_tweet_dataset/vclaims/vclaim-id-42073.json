This is the message with which the photograph has been posted.\n\nThe above post is on a Facebook page Voice of Muslims. It has been shared over 11,000 times so far. The image has also been shared with the claim that this gathering was at Mohammed Ali road in Mumbai. \u201cProtest Against CAB at Mohammed Ali road Mumbai\u201d, reads the message.\n\nUsers of the official Alt News app have requested verification of this image and the accompanying claim.\n\nAlt News found that the photograph is being shared with a false narrative. It is not from India and is not related to the Citizenship Amendment Act.\n\nUpon reverse-searching the photograph on Yandex, we found several results, according to which the image is from Chittagong, Bangladesh.\n\nAlt News found a video uploaded on YouTube on November 10, 2019, titled, \u2018\u0986\u09b2\u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09a6\u09c1\u09b2\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2\u09be\u09b9 \u09b2\u09be\u0996\u09cb \u0986\u09b6\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09b0\u09be\u09b8\u09c1\u09b2\u0997\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a2\u09b2,jasne julus..chittagong\u2019. The place seen in the video is the same as that shown in the image shared on social media. We also found several videos of the event, posted on YouTube.\n\nJashn-e-Julus refers to a festive gathering of Muslim devotees. According to the description, this video of November 10 is from the city of Chittagong in Bangladesh. It may be noted that November 10, 2019 was celebrated as Eid Milad Un Nabi. We found visual clues from the above video which correspond with the image. These visual clues have been compared in the below-juxtaposed images.\n\nThus, the image shared widely as a massive gathering in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, is actually from Chittagong, Bangladesh and pertains to a religious gathering in November 2019.
