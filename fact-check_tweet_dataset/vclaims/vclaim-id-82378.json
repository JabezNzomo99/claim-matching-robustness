(This proof of Balakot attack is for the ha**** ministers so that you traitors hit your faces with slippers and keep your mouths shut instead of making fun of our forces.),\u201d is the commonly used caption accompanying the photographs. Another caption that is being used to share the images is \u2013 \u201c\u092f\u0939 \u0939\u0948 \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u091a\u0936\u092e\u093e \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u093f\u091c\u093f\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e \u091c\u0940\u0964 (This is the proof. See properly with spectacles on.)\u201c\n\nAn image in the set of photographs shows shrouded dead bodies placed in what looks like a tunnel dug for mass graves.\n\nWe found the original photograph on Getty Images, which described the pictures as, \u201cPakistani Edhi charity volunteers bury the bodies of unclaimed heatwave victims at a graveyard in Karachi on June 26, 2015. Pakistani welfare volunteers on June 26 held a mass funeral for 50 victims of Karachi\u2019s worst heatwave in decades, whose bodies had gone unclaimed.\u201d\n\nAnother viral image shows a room where a man is covering several dead bodies covered with white cloth.\n\nReverse-searching this photograph on Google led us to the original photo on Getty Images. This photograph also depicted the 2015 heatwave in Pakistan which caused hundreds of deaths. The dead bodies in the photograph were the unclaimed ones and the man was putting identification papers on their shrouds.\n\nTwo other similar images of shrouded bodies are being shared on social media, claiming that these are the Pakistani casualties of the Balakot airstrike.\n\nThese images are also of the 2015 heatwave in Pakistan. While the image on the left was found on TIMEmagazine, the one on the right was traced back to Getty Images.\n\nThe last photograph shows people burying the dead in mass graves.\n\nThis image has already been debunked by Alt News. While we were unable to trace its origin, we found that it has existed on the internet since at least 2016.\n\nGoogle reverse-image search also threw up a 2013 New York Timesarticle carrying a similar image. The photograph was sourced to Associated Press, which described it as, \u201cPakistani men prepare the graves of Saturday\u2019s bombing victims in Quetta, Pakistan, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013.\u201d This photograph seemed to be of the same location as the viral image but taken from a different angle.\n\nMisinformation on social media related to the Balakot airstrike has increased manifold, especially after reports of no casualties in the attack. In the past, we have debunked 2005 Kashmir earthquake images being circulated as the devastation caused by the Indian Air Force\u2019s airstrike on JeM camps.", "lang": "en"}
