That\u2019s because the U.S. economy is complex, and the decisions of companies and consumers often loom larger than the acts of government officials. The economy is doing well, and, as we\u2019ve previously reported, many of the positive trends started before Trump took office.\n\nPresident Trump claimed the poverty rate for African Americans has \u201creached its lowest rate ever,\u201d and for Hispanics, it \u201chas reached an all-time low.\u201d At first look, Trump\u2019s statements are correct, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The official poverty rate for African Americans fell to 21.2 percent in 2017. For Hispanics, it dropped to 18.3 percent.\n\nBut, as we\u2019ve noted before, scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is somewhat misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments \u2014 such as the earned-income tax credit or food stamps \u2014 are not recorded as income, so their impact isn\u2019t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 \u2014 the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). (This also has critics.)\n\nThe overall SPM is declining at a slower rate than the official poverty rate, dropping only 2.2 points since its peak. For African Americans, its lowest point was in 2016 with a slight uptick in 2017. Hispanic Americans, however, did see the lowest rate ever in 2017.\n\nDespite the data, experts are hesitant to credit the president with success. Gregory Acs, vice president for income and benefits policy at the Urban Institute, said the economy is still largely a \u201creflection of the policy environment that was in place for the last several years\u201d before Trump took office. Plus, he noted that the effects of the Trump tax cut, the president\u2019s signature economic achievement, were not reflected in 2017 data.\n\nTrump touted his impact on minority homeownership rates, telling audiences that Hispanics now own homes at the \u201chighest rate in much more than a decade.\u201d He boasted that homeownership among African Americans is \u201cway up,\u201d and they are \u201cdoing better than they did with the past administration or the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHomeownership rates have declined across the board since the recession. But the housing crisis hit the African American community particularly hard. In 2004, almost half of African Americans owned homes. In 2017, African American homeownership dropped 6.6 percentage points. Jonathan Spader, a senior research associate at Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies, said part of the steep decline was due to the type of loans African American households had used to finance their homes.\n\nHomeownership rates for both demographics have started to recover in recent years \u2014 2015 for Hispanics and 2016 for African Americans. The market started to stabilize, Spader explained, and once the foreclosure backlog cleared, the overall economy improved, and real wages started to increase again. And so, the recent uptick in homeownership, he says, has more to do with overall trends than any new federal housing policy.\n\nAlthough growth has been sluggish over the past several decades, generally speaking, incomes have been rising. Median income for Hispanics has reached an all-time high. But African American median income, which was $40,258 in 2017, still lags more than $2,100 behind its level in 2000. Plus, after gains over $1,000 in 2015 and 2016, median income for African Americans fell in 2017.\n\nThe president cited six statistics: median income, homeownership rates and poverty rate for both African Americans and Hispanics. In each case, he claimed there had been marked improvement since he took office. Only three of those statistics were numerically accurate. And in each of those cases \u2014 Hispanic American median income and the poverty rate for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans \u2014 the underlying economic trends started well before Trump took office. Plus, experts say his tax cut had yet to filter into available data.", "lang": "en"}
