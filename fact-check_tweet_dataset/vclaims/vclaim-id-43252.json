You have death. Probably \u2014 and I mean definitely \u2014 would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we\u2019re talking about with regard to the virus.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at a news conference on Monday \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.\u201d\n\n\u2014 during a virtual town hall on Fox News on Tuesday This lacks evidence. Though the question of the overall impact of recessions on mortality remains unsettled, experts disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that an economic downturn would be more deadly than a pandemic. (The White House did not respond when asked for the source of the president\u2019s conjecture.)\n\nMoreover, it is not inevitable that a recession would lead to excess suicides. In countries and American states with adequate social programs in place, the impact of economic downturns can be reduced. \u201cThere are some choices that governments have about how you potentially offset the consequences of recessions that may come,\u201d Mr. Reeves said, pointing to the $2 trillion economic package passed by the Senate. \u201cTrump could put in place more to protect those people if he\u2019s worried about suicides.\u201d Experts also warned that the argument about whether to stave off a recession or contain the coronavirus was a somewhat false choice. If efforts to mitigate the coronavirus abate and cases and deaths spiral out of control, the economy would also be affected by self-imposed lockdowns. The mental health effects of high levels of unemployment during a recession, too, would have its parallels if the United States suffered colossal loss of lives. That would bring about \u201ccommunal bereavement,\u201d where there is widespread distress and feelings of loss even among those who do not know the deceased, and its associated health risks, said Ralph Catalano, a professor of public health at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cI\u2019d rather contain the epidemic first and then take my chances with the recession,\u201d Mr. Catalano said. \u201cHumans control recessions; mindless nature controls epidemics. It\u2019s just bad medicine to mix epidemiology and economics right now.\u201d Curious about the accuracy of a claim? Email factcheck@nytimes.com.", "lang": "en"}
