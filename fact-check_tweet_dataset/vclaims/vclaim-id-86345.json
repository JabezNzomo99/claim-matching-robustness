Experts warn about the dangerous consequences of over-promoting a drug with unknown efficacy: Shortages of hydroxychloroquine have already occurred, depriving lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients of access to it. Doctors say some patients could die of side effects. Other potential treatments for covid-19 could get overlooked with so much concentration on one option.\n\nConversation around hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for covid-19 started in China in late January. According to Kate Starbird of the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public, tweets from media organizations \u2014 including Chinese state outlets \u2014 and investors highlighted past studies in which the medications were tested as cures for severe acute respiratory syndrome. (The 2005 tests never made it to human trials.) They also pointed to statements from the coronavirus research center in Wuhan, China, suggesting the drugs could be used to fight covid-19.\n\nAccording to Starbird, the first viral tweets were posted by Paul Sperry, a staunchly conservative author, on March 9 and 11. A blockchain investor, James Todaro, then tweeted a link to a Google document he co-wrote with Gregory Rigano about the potential cure on March 13. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk retweeted that Google doc on March 16, writing, \u201cMaybe worth considering chloroquine for C19.\u201d The faulty research then appeared in the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart and the Blaze. It ultimately made its way to Fox News, first appearing on Laura Ingraham\u2019s program on March 16. Fox News shows hosted by Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson went on to promote the drugs and continue to do so.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted tests on the drugs in treating SARS in 2005. Results showed the drugs had anti-viral effects on cell cultures. However, it did not work in studies on mice. According to David Boulware, professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, that \u201cis a little bit of a red flag.\u201d Moreover, it was \u201cnot a clinical trial and did not look at the effect of chloroquine on humans,\u201d according to a CDC spokesman.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our goal, to really rapidly identify as quickly as possible, does this actually work or not? Because there\u2019s a lot of hubbub about it now,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cBut there\u2019s very little evidence that we actually have that this has a clinical benefit, which is kind of bad for something that\u2019s being very heavily promoted. We should probably have some data and some science behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the evaluation of the criteria under which to issue an EUA, it was determined, based on the scientific evidence available, that it is reasonable to believe that the specific drugs may be effective in treating COVID-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus outweigh the known and potential risks when used under the conditions described in the EUA,\u201d an FDA spokesman told the Fact Checker in an email.", "lang": "en"}
