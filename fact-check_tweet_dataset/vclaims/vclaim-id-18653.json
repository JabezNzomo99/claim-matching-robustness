Thank you to everyone who sent us quotes for checking via Twitter using hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA, on Facebook or by email.\n\nSenator Jacqui Lambie told Q&A that a third of Australian age pensioners are living below the poverty line and that this is expected to rise to two-thirds within five years.\n\nIs that right?\n\nWhen asked for sources to support her statement, Jacqui Lambie told The Conversation:\n\nLambie also referred to research by the Australian Council of Social Service. You can read her full response here.\n\nAre one-third of Australian age pensioners living under the poverty line?\n\nIt\u2019s true that a 2015 OECD report (which uses data from 2012) shows that about one-third of older Australians are living below the poverty line. The report says:\n\nIt\u2019s important to highlight that the figure of 34% is based on the income of every Australian over the age of 65 \u2013 not just recipients of the age pension.\n\nThe OECD has updated its database to show that, based on its methodology, poverty levels for all people over 65 dropped from 34% in 2012 to 26% in 2014.\n\nThose who qualify for the age pension generally have a lower income than those who don\u2019t qualify, so the poverty rate of pensioners would in fact be higher than the overall rate of people aged over 65.\n\nA 2014 report by the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) found that between 15 and 39% of age pensioners were living in poverty in 2012, depending on which definition of the poverty line is used.\n\nSo Jacqui Lambie\u2019s statement that one-third of Australian age pensioners are living under the poverty line is broadly supported by the evidence \u2013 although between 2012 and 2014 the poverty levels among people aged over 65 reported by the OECD declined.\n\nThe definition of the poverty line and household income has an impact on the number of people considered to be living in poverty. For example, the OECD draws the poverty line at 50% of the disposable household income of the median Australian. Furthermore, it assesses household disposable income by deducting taxes but not the cost of housing.\n\nBy doing so, its calculations ignore the benefit that many older households gain from owning their own home compared to working-age people, who tend to pay a mortgage or rent. When housing costs are taken into account, pensioner poverty rates are lower: this is the basis of the lower-end ACOSS figure.\n\nThe figure can also differ when the poverty line is drawn at, say, 60% of the disposable household income of the median Australian, instead of 50%. This is the basis of the ACOSS figure of 39%.\n\nThe poverty numbers differ despite the fact that both ACOSS and the OECD make use of the same dataset \u2013 the Survey of Income and Housing, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics every two years.\n\nWill two-thirds of age pensioners be living under the poverty line in the next three to five years?\n\nIt\u2019s beyond the scope of a FactCheck to say with any certainty what will or won\u2019t happen in future.\n\nHowever, there is insufficient evidence to support Lambie\u2019s statement that two-thirds of age pensioners will be living under the poverty line in the next three to five years.\n\nProjecting poverty rates requires robust estimates of what might happen to median incomes (which guide the poverty line) as well as the incomes of pensioners. These estimates can be made using micro-simulation models, such as those developed at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\n\nA recent NATSEM report showed that pensioner incomes, which tend to increase in line with wage growth, are expected to rise in real terms. But, according to NATSEM, they are not projected to rise as quickly as the income of households that don\u2019t receive benefits, which are more representative of median incomes.\n\nIf pensioner incomes don\u2019t rise as quickly as the median income, the result could be an increase in some measures of poverty. But based on current modelling, it appears unlikely that the rate would double to two-thirds of pensioners living under the poverty line.\n\nJacqui Lambie was broadly correct to say that one-third of Australian age pensioners are living below the poverty line.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to suggest the poverty rate for age pensioners will double in the near future. \u2013 Rafal Chomik\n\nThis FactCheck correctly points out that Jacqui Lambie is broadly correct that around one in three pensioners live below the poverty line. The author also sensibly discusses the limitations and differences between various poverty measures based on arbitrary percentages of median income. I would further add that the one-third estimate is towards the upper end of estimates from the various measures estimated by ACOSS.\n\nI would also agree with this FactCheck that it is difficult to forecast the percentage of pensioners who will be in poverty in the near future. The pension is linked to the greater of movements in wages and the consumer price index so it is very unlikely that, in the short to medium term, pensioner poverty numbers would increase (or decrease) relative to current rates by such a significant degree.\n\nThe tightening of the assets test for pensioners which is legislated for January 1, 2017 may add a small number of (relatively) higher wealth pensioners into poverty, but the number of pensioners impacted will not be numerically enough to lead to a doubling of the age pension poverty rate. \u2013 Ben Phillips\n\nHave you ever seen a \u201cfact\u201d worth checking?
