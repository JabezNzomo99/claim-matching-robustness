John Edwards.\n\nIn 2011, a grand jury indicted two-time Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards on allegations that money paid to hide his extramarital affair amounted to illegal campaign contributions.\n\nTotaling nearly $1 million, federal prosecutors said, the payments represented unlawful contributions to the former senator\u2019s 2008 presidential bid because they violated the $2,300 limit that individuals could make to candidates during that primary election. They argued the payments should have been reported in campaign finance reports because they were part of an effort to limit damage to Edwards\u2019 candidacy.\n\nThat case has now garnered renewed attention for its similarities to a case involving President Donald Trump. The president\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has admitted to breaking campaign finance law in the 2016 election by making payments to conceal the stories of two women who say they had affairs with Trump. Cohen was sentenced last week to three years in prison for those and other offenses.\n\nBut a popular meme on Facebook that implicitly contrasts the two cases wrongly accuses the U.S. Department of Justice of \u201cdouble standards\u201d and misleads social media users by leaving out core details of the Edwards matter.\n\n\u201cRemember when Democrat John Edwards diverted a million dollars in actual campaign funds to hush up his baby momma mistress \u2013 whom he was having an affair with while his wife was dying of cancer?\u201d it reads. \u201cThe DOJ dropped the charges and Edwards was never hit with FEC violations. Double standards. That\u2019s how the Deep State rolls.\u201d\n\nAbsent from that summary are some critical facts.\n\nFor starters, the meme makes no mention of the fact that the Justice Department actually brought Edwards to trial. In 2012, a jury deadlocked on five of the six felony counts against Edwards; it acquitted him of one. It was only then that the department decided to not retry the case.\n\nThough the meme claims the money came from \u201cactual campaign funds,\u201d prosecutors said the money did not actually pass through campaign coffers. The money, the government argued, was spent by Edwards\u2019 two wealthy donors, one of whom was his campaign finance chair, on things such as rent, living expenses, medical care and travel for Edwards\u2019 pregnant mistress, Rielle Hunter.\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that the FEC \u2014 the Federal Election Commission \u2014 did not rule that those payments were campaign finance violations. Lora Haggard, chief financial officer of the Edwards campaign, testified during trial that even after the indictment was revealed, the FEC approved the campaign\u2019s filings following an audit.\n\n\u201cWhen the Federal Election Commission, which was well aware of the money and the indictment, approved her reports last month, she took it to mean her assessment was correct,\u201d the New York Times reported on her testimony.\n\nA prosecutor in the case, Jeffrey Tsai, reportedly said at the time: \u201cWhatever the F.E.C. determined is not relevant to the criminal charges.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the FEC hasn\u2019t issued any decisions regarding complaints filed with the agency over the payments to the two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who allege they had affairs with Trump.\n\nIn pleading guilty, Cohen admitted responsibility for his role in arranging a $150,000 payment by American Media Inc. (the parent company to the National Enquirer) to McDougal. He also admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels through an LLC he set up for the payment. Trump later reimbursed Cohen for the latter in what prosecutors described as \u201cmonthly installments disguised as payments for legal services performed pursuant to a retainer, when in fact no such retainer existed.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, which oversaw the investigation into those payments, has said they were made to \u201censure\u201d the women \u201cdid not publicly disclose their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate in advance of the election.\u201d\n\nTrump has rejected the notion that the payments were campaign contributions \u2014 and has said they were not crimes. Rudy Giuliani, now Trump\u2019s personal attorney, recently cited the Edwards case to support that argument.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cMichael Cohen Sentenced To 3 Years In Prison.\u201d Press release, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. 12 Dec 2018.\n\n\u201cMichael Cohen Pleads Guilty In Manhattan Federal Court To Eight Counts, Including Criminal Tax Evasion And Campaign Finance Violations.\u201d Press release, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. 21 Aug 2018.\n\nSeverson, Kim. \u201cJudge Blocks Testimony for Edwards on Finance Law.\u201d The New York Times. 15 May 2012.\n\nTrump, Donald (@realDonaldTrump). \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey\u2019s testimony.
