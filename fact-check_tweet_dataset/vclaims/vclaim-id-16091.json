The farmers who had been agitating under the aegis of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) were stopped at the Delhi-U.P border, with teargas shells and water cannons deployed to halt their march. In the midst of the uproar over this development, several prominent social media users shared a photograph which showed a policeman brandishing a hand gun in front of a peasant.\n\nThe above tweet by Kavita Krishnan, activist and politburo member of CPI (ML), drawing parallels between protesting farmers and Kashmiri stone-pelters was retweeted over 2400 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 5400 times. Krishnan later issued a clarification. Among those who shared it was the Twitter account @zoo_bear.\n\nOn Facebook too, this image has been shared widely with the claim that it was clicked during the farmers\u2019 agitation.\n\nThrough a Google reverse image search, Alt News found that the photograph in question is NOT of the recent agitation. It was taken in 2013 and was clicked in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. An article by The Pioneer dated September 30, 2013 had carried this photograph. The same photo was also published by Indian Express on the same day, credited to PTI and also by The Hindu.\n\nThe context of this photograph was the defiance of imposition of section 144 of the CrPC (prohibition of unlawful assembly) after the National Security Act was slapped on BJP leader Sangeet Som, one of the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013. The photograph was taken when police tried to prevent villagers from gathering for a mahapanchayat that had been banned by the administration fearing an upsurge in communal tension.\n\nAn unrelated image from 2013 was used to portray administrative apathy and heavy-handedness in the wake of the recent farmers\u2019 march. While there is little doubt of violent confrontation between police and agitating farmers, sharing an old image from another incident not only ended up misleading social media users but was representative of confirmation bias.", "lang": "en"}
