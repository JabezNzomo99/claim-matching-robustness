Given the animosity of the election, it\u2019s fair to say that Hillary Clinton voters were not motivated to attend his inauguration. Further, the political leanings of the surrounding area help explain why the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday drew a substantially larger crowd.\n\nMarcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, analyzed photographs and video taken of the Mall and its vicinity for the New York Times and concluded that about 160,000 people were in those areas in the hour before Trump\u2019s speech. By contrast, they said, at least 470,000 people were in those areas for the Women\u2019s March as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, the time of the march\u2019s peak density.\n\nFrom Trump\u2019s perspective at the Capitol, the crowd must have looked massive. But other images, extending over the Mall to the Capitol, clearly show fewer people than at Obama\u2019s inaugurations. In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people attended Obama\u2019s first inauguration. In 2013, the number attending Obama\u2019s second was estimated at 1 million, making that the third largest. About 1.2 million people are believed to have attended the swearing-in of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.\n\nThis is also false. The actual numbers are 783,000 trips for Obama in 2013 \u2014 more than double Spicer\u2019s figure \u2014 and 571,000 for Trump in 2017. There were 1.1 million trips for Obama in 2009, the biggest day in Metro\u2019s history. The number for Trump is actually lower than the average weekday ridership of 639,000 trips.\n\nBut there is no explanation for why he believes the audience was the largest ever around the globe. We have not seen global data, but in terms of U.S. television viewers, Trump already falls short. According to the preliminary data from Nielsen for inauguration coverage, 30.6 million television viewers in the United States watched Trump\u2019s swearing-in, 19 percent below the audience of 37.8 million for Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 23: At a news briefing, Spicer tried to claim that he was speaking about the largest audience worldwide, even though virtually all of his presentation on Jan. 21 was about in-person attendance. He claimed that \u201ctens of million of people\u201d watched the event online, though he provided no evidence that was the case. Streaming data is not apples to apples with TV viewership, as it could reflect how many times someone tried to connect. (Ten attempts does not equal ten people.)\n\nThis is an appalling performance by the new press secretary. He managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue. Presumably he was ordered to do this by Trump, who conjured up fantastic numbers in his own mind, but part of a flack\u2019s job is to tell the boss when lies are necessary \u2014 and when they are not.", "lang": "en"}
