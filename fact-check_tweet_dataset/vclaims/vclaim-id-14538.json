When the chief minister of a state is saying this, then she has accepted defeat.'\n\nSurjewala made those remarks during an event held by news channel Aaj Tak in Jaipur. His tweet got more than 600 retweets and 1,600 likes.\n\nHowever, BOOM found that the statement Surjewala made during the event and his subsequent tweeted were misleading.\n\nWe found the full version of the Raje's speech on Bharatiya Janata Party's YouTube channel, uploaded on November 21, 2018 titled, ''Yuva Ri Baat Amit Shah Re Saath', Shri Amit Shah's interaction with Youth of Rajasthan.'\n\nAt 23 minutes into the video, Raje is seen saying, \"The Congress party has been chanting the slogan 'Gareebi Mitaao' (Eradicate poverty) for the last 50 years, but till today they haven't done any work to eradicate poverty. And when asked about the same they say poverty is not to be eradicated. The more there will be poverty, the more it will benefit us and get us more votes because people won't get the time to ask us why didn't we get any work, why didn't we get water, why weren't the roads built?, as they will be immersed in their pain.", "lang": "en"}
