Let that sink in folks and share the heck out of this.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere is no evidence that Schultz ever said he would hire immigrants over veterans, and his actions toward veterans and their families also prove otherwise. This claim is a twist on Starbucks\u2019 2017 pledge to hire 10,000 refugees in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban from Muslim-majority countries. Unlike immigrants who are in the country illegally, refugees go through an application and screening process through the U.S. State Department\u2019s refugee admission program.\n\nStarbucks did receive some backlash for the decision, with people calling for boycotts and for the company to hire veterans instead. But Starbucks was already in the process of doing that. In 2013, the company announced it would hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by 2018.\n\nThe Starbucks Armed Forces Network (AFN), an internal veteran group that provides support for its current and former military employees and their partners, responded to critics in an open letter.\n\nThe group wrote that Schultz helped lead the veteran-hiring initiative, contributed personal finances and visited military bases as the company helped establish \"military family stores at over 30 bases around the country\" and said that \"less than four years into the commitment, Starbucks has hired over 8,800 veterans and spouses and counting.\"\n\nBy late March 2017, the company announced it had hit its goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and active-duty spouses a year early and set a new goal of reaching a total of 25,000 veterans and spouses by 2025.\n\nA post shared on social media claims that in 2017 Schultz said he would rather hire \"an illegal immigrant\" over a U.S. veteran.\n\nWe found no record of Schultz saying that. The rumor is a misunderstanding of a Starbucks pledge to hire 10,000 refugees.\n\nThe company has an internal veterans group and announced it had reached its previous goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and their spouses in March 2017, and it pledged to expand that number.", "lang": "en"}
