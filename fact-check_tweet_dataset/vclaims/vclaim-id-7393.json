Interacting with the media, he said \u2018Allah Hu Akbar\u2019 instead of his usual \u2018Thoko Taali\u2019 (translation)\u201d. These words along with a photograph of Navjot Singh Siddhu in which he is seen wearing a green coloured turban has gone viral on social media. It has been shared by multiple individual users on Facebook.\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE MESSAGE\n\nThis was first presented as a report by a Twitter account \u2018Times Wow\u2018 which is a parody handle of Times Now.\n\nIt was posted by the Twitter handle \u2018@TimesWow\u2018 at 5:26 pm on August 19, and at the time of writing this article, it had been retweeted over 1,000 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 2,300 times.\n\nIn the above image, we have shown the difference between the Twitter handles of Times Wow and Times Now. As can be seen, the parody handle has a logo almost identical to that of Times Now. It has replaced \u2018N\u2018 with \u2018W\u2018 and clearly mentions that it is a parody account for entertainment purposes. The Times Now account has a blue tick which indicates that this is the official account of the channel. However, social media users tend to be deceived and are unable to spot the difference.\n\nThe photograph of Sidhu wearing a green turban has a watermark of ANI, which indicates that the photograph has been taken by the news agency. Alt News found that this photo had been posted by ANI at 3:26 pm on August 19 with the message, \u201cIf someone (Pak Army Chief General Bajwa) comes to me&says that we belong to the same culture & we\u2019ll open Kartarpur border on Guru Nanak Dev\u2019s 550th Prakash Parv, what else I could do? Navjot Singh Sidhu on hugging Bajwa at Pak PM Imran Khan\u2019s oath-taking ceremony in Islamabad.\u201d\n\nNavjot Singh Sidhu was present at the oath taking ceremony of Imran Khan on August 18. Sidhu\u2019s act of hugging the Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa has already created a huge controversy. On returning from Pakistan and speaking to reporters, Sidhu had said what has been reported by ANI.\n\nSpreading disinformation in the garb of news through parody accounts of Times Now has happened earlier as well. There is another parody handle of Times Now called Times How which often posts false information. Many social media users have believed Times HOW\u2018s posts as real news.\n\nWe have seen on numerous occasions how tweets by parody accounts of news channels are presented as actual news and how social media users are foxed.\n\nThere are a number of examples whereby tweets by Times HOW were construed as real and shared by social media users. Some months back, a parody account of ANI was spreading disinformation on social media. The account was suspended by Twitter after it was reported by ANI editor Smita Prakash.\n\nTherefore, it is perplexing as to why Times Now hasn\u2019t taken any action against these parody handles who are putting out misinformation by impersonating their brand. Times HOW has managed to hoodwink even sections of mainstream media. News channels are at the very least expected to complain against parody accounts posting fake news in their name.", "lang": "en"}
