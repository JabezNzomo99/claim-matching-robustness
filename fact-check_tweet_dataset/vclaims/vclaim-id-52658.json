Performances by military bands at major hospitals and lighting up of warships, were also some other highlights.\n\nSoon after, a picture post started doing the rounds on different social media platforms, that showed a chopper showering flower petals on migrant workers.\n\nThe caption of the post read: \u201cThey say a picture is worth a thousand words. This one is worth a million. I don\u2018t know who clicked it (someone posted it on FB) but the photographer deserves a prize for capturing every aspect of 2020 in one frame. History is made of pictures like these\u201d\n\nWhen the team at NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, we found the picture to be morphed.\n\nWhen we put the picture through Reverse Image Search, we came across the original image of the helicopter on the official website of AP images, dated January 26, 2020.\n\nAccording to the caption, the helicopter was spraying flower petals during the Republic Day parade in Guwahati in 2018.\n\nFurther, when we cropped the picture of the migrant labourers and put it through Reverse Image Search, we came across a report by British public service broadcaster, BBC dated April, 24, 2020, which featured the picture.\n\nThe picture was taken during the mass exodus that occurred due to the lockdown that was imposed in India, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is no helicopter in the original picture.\n\nThe above information proves that the picture in question is fake as two other pictures have been combined to create it.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
