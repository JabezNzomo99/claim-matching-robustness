The claim was originally intended as satire, but some users are taking it seriously.\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nThe posts either show, or link to, a screenshot of an alleged \u201cfact-check\u201d article on FreedomFictions.com, a satirical website that is part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d news parody network. The website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page reads, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.\u201d\n\nThe article itself, available here , is written as satire. The first paragraph states: \u201cSure, the picture is photoshopped. That\u2019s because the facts aren\u2019t exactly clear on this, but one thing is certain: Obama definitely awarded Epstein the Medal of Freedom in 2007. We rate this claim true.\u201d\n\nThe photoshopped image in the thumbnail shows Epstein\u2019s head edited onto former President Bill Clinton\u2019s body. The real photo, which has been mirrored, can be found here . It was taken when President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the medal in 2013. The photo of Epstein, taken in 2004, can be found here .\n\nObama was elected president in 2008 ( here ) and inaugurated in 2009 ( here ). In 2007, the president of the U.S. was still George W. Bush ( here ).\n\nThe full list of Presidential Medal of Honor recipients awarded by President Obama can be found here . It does not include Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDespite the article\u2019s satirical intent, many Facebook users seem to be taking the claim seriously. On one post ( here ), comments include, \u201cMedal of freedom to screw young girls way to go Mr. President,\u201d \u201cpandering to a big donor, no matter his credibility, just gimme the money,\u201d and \u201cAND PEOPLE DIDN\u2019T LIKE TRUMP GIVING RUSH LIMBAUGH THIS MEDAL \u2013 TOO FRICKIN\u2019 BAD!!!!!!\u201d\n\nSatire. Posts claiming that President Obama awarded Jeffrey Epstein the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, are intended as satire.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
