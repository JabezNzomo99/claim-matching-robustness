Santorum offers a pretty succinct definition in his statement, though, by noting that other candidates would \"allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another.\"\n\nIn a follow-up email, a campaign staffer said Santorum defines amnesty as \"providing legal status to illegal immigrants.\"\n\nFellow presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made similar statements, which we\u2019ve previously found to be Mostly True. Santorum\u2019s statement differs in important ways, however. In August and again in September, Cruz said \"a majority\" of GOP candidates have supported amnesty \u2014 wording that acknowledges some candidates\u2019 views may have shifted over time.\n\nSantorum, by contrast, asserts that every other candidate currently supports an immigration policy that could be defined as amnesty. That\u2019s a much higher standard \u2014 and a harder one to support.\n\nLet\u2019s review each candidate individually, starting with those who have clearly indicated support for citizenship or legal status that meets Santorum\u2019s definition of amnesty:\n\nJeb Bush: The former Florida governor has made clear that he supports immigration reform that would provide legal status to the millions of undocumented people currently living in the U.S.\n\nMarco Rubio: The Florida senator was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight who pursued comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship. He has since taken more hardline views on immigration but still supports legal status for undocumented people currently living in the U.S.\n\nLindsey Graham: The senator from South Carolina was also a member of the \"Gang of Eight\" who led efforts to pass immigration reform in 2013, and supports a pathway to citizenship.\n\nCarly Fiorina: The former Hewlett-Packard CEO said in June that she was open to legal status for the undocumented.\n\nJohn Kasich: The Ohio governor has said he \"doesn\u2019t like the idea of citizenship\" but believes it may be necessary.\n\nGeorge Pataki: The former New York governor supports legal-resident status for undocumented immigrants who have no criminal history and agree to 200 hours of community service.\n\nJim Gilmore: The former Virginia governor supports legal status allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States, but opposes a pathway to citizenship.\n\nOther candidates supported citizenship or legal status in the past, but have tempered or reversed their views since entering the presidential race:\n\nRand Paul: In 2013, the Kentucky senator told undocumented immigrants in a speech that \"We will find a place for you\" and implied (according to the New York Times) that he supported a pathway to citizenship. In more recent presidential campaign materials, though, Paul states that he \"opposes amnesty\" and believes the U.S.-Mexico border must be \"secured\" before \"issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process.\"\n\nMike Huckabee: The former Arkansas governor has indicated support for a pathway to citizenship in the past, but used much tougher rhetoric this year, stating that he opposes \"amnesty\" and is unwilling discuss legal status until the border is secure.\n\nChris Christie: In 2010, the New Jersey governor plainly said he supported a path to citizenship. Last May, however, he said he opposed a pathway to legal status.\n\nDonald Trump: Trump\u2019s views on immigration have evolved over time, but his position now is among the toughest in the GOP field. He reportedly was supportive of the DREAM Act in a 2013 meeting with immigration activists and said just last July that he could support a \"merit-based\" system for allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. Since then, though, he\u2019s advocated for deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the country.\n\nFinally, in direct contradiction to Santorum\u2019s claim, some candidates have simply never supported amnesty as his campaign defines it.\n\nBen Carson: In a 2014 op-ed in National Review, the retired neurosurgeon proposed a guest-worker program for immigrants, but said all participants would have to apply from outside the United States \u2014 meaning undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. would have to leave and apply to re-enter.\n\nBobby Jindal: Despite an op-ed endorsing legal status in 2013, the Louisiana governor has repeatedly refused to take a position on the millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S since becoming a presidential candidate. He argues that the border must be secured before devising a policy to address those already living here.\n\nTed Cruz. He has repeatedly stated that he\u2019s the only candidate in the race who has never supported amnesty \u2013 statements that have been found to be Mostly True. Cruz voted against the 2013 Senate immigration bill and opposed a 2014 House proposal to grant more limited legal status to undocumented immigrants.\n\nCorrespondence with Santorum\u2019s campaign team makes clear his statement was aimed at drawing a contrast with Cruz, who\u2019s lately been gaining momentum in the GOP race. A Santorum aide pointed to a series of amendments Cruz offered to the 2013 reform bill, which laid out additional conditions for granting legal status to those who are undocumented. Among other measures, those amendments removed the bill\u2019s pathway to citizenship and made it more challenging for undocumented residents to receive legal status. Santorum\u2019s campaign says those amendments amount to support for amnesty, but they could just as easily be read as efforts to weaken the bill and undermine the amnesty measures it contained.\n\nSantorum said, \"I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty. Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another.\"\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that seven of 15 GOP candidates currently support policies that meet Santorum\u2019s definition of \"amnesty,\" four candidates who once supported such policies no longer do, and two more have consistent records of opposition. The last, Jindal, hasn\u2019t outlined his position.", "lang": "en"}
