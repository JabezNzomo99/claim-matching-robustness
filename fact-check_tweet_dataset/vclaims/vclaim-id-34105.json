The cartoon shows the Marvel superhero Spiderman stopping a bus about to run over a child crossing a street. It has been shared with the caption, \u201cCartoon published in a newspaper in Europe. ..\u092a\u0930 \u0939\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u092d\u0940\u201d .\n\nAs can be seen, in the image, Spiderman is identified with PM Narendra Modi, and the child crossing the street is identified with India. The bus is marked as \u2018Congress, Mamta benerjee, China/Pakistan, Rohingya/Bangladeshi and ISIS/Khalistan\u2019. It may be noted that the caricature has been circulated in the context of the recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), claiming that a newspaper in Europe has published this cartoon which shows PM Narendra Modi in a positive light.\n\nAlt News has received several requests on the official app for verification of this information which claims that this cartoon had appeared in a newspaper in Europe.\n\nThe same has been posted on Facebook.\n\nThe accompanying claim is false. The image circulated on WhatsApp is a meme. It has been created on the basis of a popular template frequently used by meme-makers. Posted below is an image which shows how this meme has been used in various contexts.\n\nThe meme is available online and can be customised as per user needs.\n\nMoreover, Alt News could not find a single report in a European newspaper which had published this image. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s name is also spelt incorrectly as \u2013 \u2018Mamta Benerjee\u2019.\n\nThe claim circulated on WhatsApp and social media is false.", "lang": "en"}
