Lewis wrote a dialogue between Satan and Jesus, in which Satan said, \u201cI will cause economic turmoil.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Lewis writing the dialogue attributed to him in the post. It was actually written by a Facebook user earlier this year.\n\nFacebook users recently shared a short exchange between Jesus and Satan that they claim \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d author wrote in 1942. (RELATED: Did CS Lewis Once Write About How \u2018Many Souls\u2019 Can Be Brought To Hell By The \u2018Fear Of Getting Sick\u2019?)\n\nIn the dialogue, Satan says he will cause anxiety, fear and panic by shutting down \u201cbusiness, schools, places of worship and sports events.\u201d Jesus appears to respond by saying he will, among other things, bring \u201cdinner back to the dinner table\u201d and help \u201cpeople slow down their lives and appreciate what really matters.\u201d\n\nThe exchange is often attributed to Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Screwtape Letters,\u201d an epistolary novel that examines theological concepts through letters exchanged between two demons. However, it does not appear in that work or any of Lewis\u2019 other writings. William O\u2019Flaherty, author of \u201cThe Misquotable C.S. Lewis,\u201d debunked the attribution on his website and Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThis fairly recent fake Screwtape quote has been popular over the past 30 days on my site,\u201d O\u2019Flaherty wrote on Facebook. \u201cIf you have ever read The Screwtape Letters then you know this passage is not even in the same style.\u201d\n\nSnopes traced the viral exchange back to the Facebook user Heidi May, who published it on the social media platform on March 12. She later told Reuters that she wrote the exchange when she was \u201cfeeling overwhelmed,\u201d adding that \u201cJesus spoke these words to my heart.\u201d\n\nSocial media users often erroneously credit Lewis with viral quotes. Check Your Fact has debunked numerous quotes misattributed to the author, including one about people being led to Hell through their \u201cfear of getting sick.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
