Alms were distributed to 10,000 Buddhist monks who had come from nine nearby provinces. The image, along with several other images from the ceremony, was uploaded on dmc.tv, a religious channel on Buddhist teachings.\n\nScreenshot of dmctv featuring the same image\n\nWe also found a 2015 Facebook post from a verified account featuring the same image.\n\nAnother photo of the same street clearly shows that they are Buddhist monks and not BJP supporters.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi held a rally in Cooch Behar on April 7, 2019 which saw a large turnout.
