He voted in the 1992 Democratic primary. He switched to unaffiliated in 1994 and back to Democrat in 1998, but then voted in the 1998 Republican primary. Since then he has voted in seven primaries, always as a Republican.\n\nBlock's office sent us campaign finance data on Fung's contributions to the three Democrats, showing he donated to each candidate once. We confirmed the information on state and federal websites.\n\nBut Block\u2019s characterizations of Cicilline, Fox and Reid suggest the donations to them were recent. In fact, they weren\u2019t.\n\nFor example, the most recent of the three donations Block cited was Fung's $150 contribution to Fox. It was made in February 2008. Fox was House Majority Leader at the time, two years away from being elected speaker. The raid on his office was six years in the future. And even today, Fox has not been charged with any wrongdoing by state or federal authorities.\n\nThe donation to Harry Reid, for $250, came in June 2004. Reid was the Senate Minority Whip. Obamacare wasn't even a gleam in Reid's eye when he got the money.\n\nThe Cicilline donation for $250 is the oldest, made in March 2002. At the time, Cicilline was a state representative poised to run for mayor of Providence.\n\nWhen we asked Fung's campaign about the donations, spokesman Patrick Sweeney said the three donations of $650 should be compared to 113 donations Fung has made to Republicans totaling more than $25,000.\n\nKen Block said Allan Fung \"donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced [House] speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid.\"\n\nHis statement is true to the extent that Fung donated once to each of those politicians.\n\nBut his characterizations of the recipients were misleading.\n\nHe referred to Cicilline as a congressman, but Cicilline was a state representative when Fung gave him money.\n\nHe labeled Fox as the \"disgraced\" House speaker, but Fox was majority leader at the time of the Fung donation, and not under investigation.\n\nAnd the word \"Obamacare\" hadn\u2019t even been coined when Fung donated to Reid.\n\nBecause the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
