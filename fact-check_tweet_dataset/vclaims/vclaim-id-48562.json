UK in a Changing Europe said that GDP per person would grow by 7% less under Boris Johnson\u2019s deal after ten years compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU and maintains the status quo. It did not find that GDP would fall by 7% over the ten years.\n\nThat could well mean that the UK economy still grows over this period, but more slowly than if we remained in the EU. This isn\u2019t the first example of people wrongly assuming that forecasts of Brexit\u2019s negative impact on GDP equate to a fall in GDP compared to where it is now.\n\nUK in a Changing Europe wrote: \u201c[We do not] attempt to forecast how much the UK economy will grow over the next ten years.\n\n\u201cRather, we address the narrower question of the change in the UK\u2019s income per capita if the future relationship with the EU were based on Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that UK in a Changing Europe modelled numerous scenarios. A 7% fall in GDP per capita is under a system where the UK has a restrictive migration policy and productivity is affected.\n\nThe scenario in which GDP is least affected is where there is a liberal migration policy and productivity is not affected. This, UK in a Changing Europe estimates, would reduce GDP by 2.3% over a ten year period compared to remaining in the EU.", "lang": "en"}
