A WhatsApp message attributed to Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director of Medanta Hospital, is going viral. It claims that the Indian government is going to declare a national emergency, and suggests stocking up on essentials.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral message is a hoax. Dr Trehan's office has not issued any such message.\n\nWe also received the viral message on our WhatsApp helpline number (7370007000) that reads: \"Just got a news from Dr TREHAN\u2019s office through the PMO that India is going to declare a National Emergency in a day or two. Keep enough ration, medicines and enough cash.\"\n\nWe found a tweet from the official Twitter handle of Medanta Hospital, clarifying that the viral message is fake, and Dr Trehan has never made such a statement.\n\nIt is clear that the viral message attributed to Dr Trehan's office, urging people to stock up on essentials because the Indian government is going to declare a national emergency is a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
