It's also the unity it's going to take to beat Hillary Clinton. And my focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary.\"\n\nWe just looked at how Trump does against Clinton after conservative commentator Glenn Beck said on the April 10 edition of Meet the Press that polls show \"Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump.\" .\n\nFor this check, we wondered if Cruz was accurately portraying his standing in the national surveys.\n\nWe went back to RealClearPolitics.com and found that the Texas senator is off.\n\nOf the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one \u2014 a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nIn the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's margin exceeded the margin of error.\n\nCruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's margin greater than the margin of error.\n\nIf you use the most recent results from the various polling organizations since Feb. 4, Cruz wins in two, ties in two and loses in seven.\n\nWe contacted Cruz's spokeswoman to ask about the results but didn't hear back.\n\nSo when Cruz says he beats Clinton in poll after poll after poll, he's short a poll or two.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
