Agarwal was attacked by Naeem Khan, known as Guddu who was a family friend. Padukone shoulders the role of the protagonist - Malti.\n\nBOOM watched the film as it released on Friday (January 10, 2020) and found that the plot theories floating on social media were unfounded and false.\n\nBelow are the various false claims circulating on social media.\n\n\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nTheory 1: \"Rajesh who is shown wearing a Tilak, does acid attack on Malti (sic)\"\n\n\n\nIn the film, Rajesh (18) is the name of Malti's boyfriend in junior college and not the name of the accused. The acid attacker is named Basher Khan (30) aka Babbu.\n\nThe name \"Bashir Khan\" is taken six times in the movie aside from the name Babbu and and also during key scenes such as when the judge pronounces the verdict in court.\n\nRajesh is initially arrested by the police in the movie after Malti is attacked, but when she gains consciousness, she names Khan after which he is arrested and the case in the sessions court begins.\n\nAdditionally, the attacker in the movie is does not sport a tilak as claimed.\n\nTheory 2: \"Doctors say she has no hope of surviving but Malti's father pray in dargah & she survives (sic)\"\n\nIn the movie there is no such scene as mentioned. After Malti's attack her parents rush to the hospital on being informed and there is no scene where the doctor says that she has no hope of surviving.\n\nTheory 3: \"Her Hindu neighbors taunt her but she gets one Muslim friend who helps her to fight the case.\"\n\nNo 'Hindu' neighbors are shown taunting Malti in the movie as claimed and Malti is helped by her lawyer Archana Bajaj played by Madhurjeet Sarghi who helps her fight her case.", "lang": "en"}
