The Music Venues Taskforce that drew up the plan found there were 35% fewer grassroots venues in 2015 than in 2007.\n\nThe taskforce took a list of venues from 2007 and put them into categories. It asked around to find out about places which opened or closed between then and 2015, and counted how many were still open in April 2015. There were 136 grassroots venues in 2007 and 88 in 2015, so 35% fewer.\n\nThe Mayor\u2019s office told us that City Hall\u2019s culture team have kept the list up to date, and now 40% have closed.\n\nThe report defined \u2018grassroots venues\u2019 against a range of criteria, but in short they\u2019re focused on music events and thought of as part of the local community.\n\nThe claims about nightclubs nationwide come from a report commissioned by the business organisation Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) and shown to BBC Radio 1 last summer.\n\nThe report itself isn\u2019t publically available. But the authors, CGA Strategy, told us that it\u2019s kept a database of pubs, restaurants, nightclubs and so on for 25 years. The report said that there were 3,144 clubs in 2005 and 1,733 in 2015, so just over half as many.\n\nThis is across Great Britain, though. There\u2019s no specific figure for London so we don\u2019t know whether the city fared better or worse than Britain in general. We\u2019ve confirmed that the claim that half of nightclubs in London specifically have closed is actually based on this nationwide figure.\n\nWhatever the exact figures, the big picture seems clear. Industry consultants say the nightclub industry has been shrinking.", "lang": "en"}
