This follows year on year falls since 2004.\n\nOver the same time period the proportion of privately rented homes has risen from 12% to 20%.\n\nThe proportion of socially rented homes has fallen from 19% in 2003\u2014the earliest comparable figures\u2014 to 17% in 2017.\n\nHousing is a devolved area, and figures for 2017 aren\u2019t available for Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales, there was no change in the proportion of homes that were owner-occupied between the last two years.\n\nUsing another measure, which looks at the proportion of households owning their own home (which is slightly different) one survey estimates that the proportion of households owning their home increased in each UK nation from 2016 to 2017.\n\nThe data measures the number of homes owned by occupiers\n\nThis data comes from the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), and estimates the proportion of homes that are owned by the occupier, not the proportion of households who own their home.\n\nFor example, if the number of second homes owned was increasing, more homes would be owned by the occupier. But the number of households owning their own home would be the same.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about second home ownership here.\n\nMore households own their home according to other data\n\nHowever there are other data sources available that measure the proportion of households owning their own home, such as the English Housing Survey and the Labour Force Survey. The latter also covers the whole of the UK.\n\nFigures from the Labour Force Survey give a very similar picture, estimating that in the last quarter of 2017, 65% of UK households owned the property they lived in, up from 64% a year earlier. It shows a rise in ownership in each of the UK nations.\n\nThe English Housing Survey doesn\u2019t have quite as recent figures, and so doesn\u2019t report a rise in home ownership in England in 2016/17 compared to the year before. It found that the proportion of households owning their own home has been flat since 2012/13. Around 14 million households (or 63%) were owner occupiers in 2016/17.\n\nMHCLG told us that shared ownership schemes are included in the dwelling stock figures for owner-occupied households. This is where the occupier owns a portion of their home (e.g. 25%) and pays rent for the portion they don\u2019t own.\n\nHowever the Labour Force Survey counts these households separately and estimated almost no change in the proportion of households in England in shared-ownership homes from 2016 to 2017. There was no change at a UK-wide level.", "lang": "en"}
