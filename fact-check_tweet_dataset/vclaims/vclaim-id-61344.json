Nathan Deal was on radio recently to address allegations that two of his aides pressured the director of the state ethics commission to settle cases against his campaign.\n\nWSB radio\u2019s Erick Erickson asked the governor what he thought of Democratic opponent Jason Carter\u2019s call for an independent investigation.\n\nDeal said it wasn\u2019t surprising \"now that Carter has gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor.\"\n\nAxelrod, a longtime political strategist, is closely tied to President Barack Obama. He was campaign manager when Obama won the presidency in 2008 and followed Obama to Washington to serve as White House senior advisor. He left the administration in 2011 to become senior strategist for Obama\u2019s successful 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nDeal is hardly the first candidate in this year\u2019s elections to try to link an opponent to Obama, who has a low 42-percent job approval rating nationally, worse in Georgia.\n\nIn the state\u2019s GOP Senate race, for example, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston tried to tar opponent David Perdue by pointing out that a company with Perdue on its board of directors had accepted money from Obama\u2019s stimulus program. Perdue, meanwhile, attacked Kingston for voting to put money into president\u2019s Cash for Clunkers program.\n\nBut in this case, Deal got it wrong.\n\nAxelrod isn\u2019t working on Carter\u2019s campaign. He\u2019s running the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago.\n\nBut AKPD Message and Media, a political consulting firm that Axelrod founded and sold in 2009, is working for Carter, a two-term state senator and the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter who was born in Georgia but grew up outside of Chicago.\n\nAKPD is doing media consulting for Carter\u2019s campaign for governor and, as of the last disclosure reports, had been paid $67,908. The Chicago firm boasts of a successful track record for Democratic candidates.\n\nJen Talaber, spokeswoman for Deal\u2019s re-election bid, said the campaign wasn\u2019t aware Axelrod had sold the firm five years ago. It was an \"honest mistake,\" she said an email.\n\nBut Talaber said the governor\u2019s underlying point still stands.\n\n\"Carter\u2019s campaign team and consultants are Obama insiders, and his national fundraising list shows the Obama brain trust is in full force,\" she said.\n\nBryan Thomas, communications director for the Carter campaign, said Deal\u2019s claim about Axelrod \"was no slip of the tongue.\n\n\"Gov. Deal will do anything he can to distract from his ethical quagmire, including lie about his opponent,\" Thomas said. \"It's not surprising that a governor who plays it so loose with the laws is playing loose with truth, too.\"\n\nEarlier this month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained a memo in which Holly LaBerge, head of the state ethics commission, said she was threatened and pressured by Deal\u2019s office in 2012 to \"make (ethics) complaints\" against the governor \"go away.\"\n\nThe complaints included claims Deal improperly paid for use of a private aircraft for campaign travel and questioned his use of campaign funds to pay legal fees during his 2010 campaign.\n\nThe ethics commission wound up dismissing the major complaints against Deal. He agreed to pay $3,350 in fees for technical defects to his campaign disclosures.\n\nNow, the Deal campaign isn\u2019t the only one spreading word of an Axelrod connection.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party has a web page on \"Chicago liberals,\" with images of Carter, Axelrod and Obama.\n\nIt states: \"Sadly, Chicago-style politics have come to Georgia. Atlanta liberal Jason Carter has hired Barack Obama\u2019s trusted ally, David Axelrod.\"\n\nIt goes on to say: \"Liberals know they can\u2019t hit Gov. Deal on jobs, the economy, or education. So they\u2019ve resorted to attacking Gov. Deal\u2019s character \u2026 Tell Jason Carter, Barack Obama, and David Axelrod we don\u2019t need Chicago liberals running around Georgia attacking our conservative values.\n\nAKPD\u2019s website touts the firm\u2019s founding by Axelrod and has a quote from him on its homepage.\n\nWe reached out to firm executives just to ask point blank if Axelrod were in someway connected to them or the Carter campaign.\n\nWe heard back from Isaac Baker, a partner in the firm, who said Axelrod \"does not work for our firm\" and \"is not involved in any way in the Jason Carter campaign.\"\n\nTo summarize, David Axelrod is not working as a campaign advisor to Jason Carter. But the firm he founded and sold five years ago is.\n\nTalaber, Deal\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, said the governor made an \"honest mistake\" when he said in a radio interview that Axelrod was working for Carter. But she said the underlying point still stands -- that Carter\u2019s campaign team and consultants are \"Obama insiders.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that the governor was incorrect in saying that Jason Carter has \"gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor.\"", "lang": "en"}
