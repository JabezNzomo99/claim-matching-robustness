In essence, the number comes from a single anonymous insurance broker who participated in a survey by Morgan Stanley. By contrast, the New Hampshire Department of Insurance says it anticipated an 8-percent decrease in premiums after subsidies. Before subsidies, premiums on average increased 30 percent. (In general, \u201caverage\u201d figures on premiums provide little insight in individual experiences.)\n\nAfter all, the reason that provider choices were limited in New Hampshire is because Anthem wanted to try to keep costs low. Reducing the number of providers, while boosting premiums by 90 percent, would have been an odd result. Given how the 90-precent number was mocked in the New Hampshire media, one wonders why AFP would even include it. The 90-percent statistic is worthy of Three or even Four Pinocchios, but much of the rest of the ad is accurate, so overall it earns Two.\n\nThese two ads are basically cookie-cutter ads, with similar images and text, aimed either at incumbent Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) or at Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who is running to fill an open Senate seat. They also make vague allegations of people losing doctors or \u201cthousands\u201d of dollars in higher health-care premiums. (After complaints from parents of victims of the July 20, 2012, Aurora movie theater shooting, AFP removed an image in the ad of President Obama and Udall in Colorado after the shootings.)\n\nAs we have repeatedly noted, there are winners and losers under the health-care law\u2014and Americans for Prosperity is adept at focusing just on the losers. The numbers on cancellations are also a bit dated, because the Obama administration offered an administrative fix that allowed many plans to be extended for at least another year. Many plans also offered a renewal option with the letter that informed policy-holders that their old plan did not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. (Udall, for instance has stressed that 92 percent of people received a renewal option.)\n\n\u201cI did two tours in Iraq. Because of my service I was able to get a health care plan that worked for me. So I get a letter from my insurance company that said my insurance costs were going way up because of Obamacare. And oh, by the way, you should be happy about it.\u201d\n\nThis is the only new AFP ad that features an actual \u201cvictim\u201d\u2014Marine veteran Christopher Schiff. But at the moment, we do not have enough details to evaluate the accuracy of the ad. We tried to reach Schiff at his home and his office, and Russell said details would be forthcoming, but at the moment we only have a statement given to Fox News:\n\nIt is correct that Assurant plans were canceled in Louisiana\u2014and that the company decided not to extend the plans in the state, even after the Obama administration made that an option. The ad implies that Schiff may have gotten a special deal because he was a veteran, but that does not appear to be the case.\n\nIn the ad, Schiff said that his insurance costs were \u201cgoing way up\u201d but we need more detail to determine if that\u2019s accurate. \u201cWay up\u201d suggests something on the order of at least 50 percent. (Googling the phrase we found references to news reports using the phrase along with increases of 58 percent, 128 percent and 50 percent\u2014but obviously there is no dictionary definition.) The statement from AFP simply says his premiums \u201cincreased,\u201d which could be anything, and no details are provided on Schiff\u2019s overall out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLate last year, Chris received a letter from the insurer informing him his plan had been cancelled due to ObamaCare and that the replacement plan would carry much higher premiums\u2014$1,488 higher each year with the same high individual deductible of $3,500. Christopher is paying 71% more on a yearly basis for the new Obamacare-compliant Assurant policy he was offered. Even the cheapest plan offered on the ObamaCare exchange is more expensive than his old plan, has a higher deductible, and doesn\u2019t provide any coverage at all for vision or dental.\n\nDoing the math, that sounds like his old monthly premium was about $173, and it now is $299. We are continuing to try to reach Schiff, but he gave an interview Wednesday night to Fox News in which he said his old premium was $126 a month and now it is $295. That would be an increase of 134 percent, but Russell says Schiff got the figures mixed up; the monthly increase is about $126 a month.", "lang": "en"}
