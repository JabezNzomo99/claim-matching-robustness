The Green Party has responded by saying that, unlike in Westminster elections, this will be a proportional representation election, and so these kinds of alliances aren\u2019t necessary.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the system used is more \u201cproportional\u201d than Westminster elections, it is not perfectly proportional, it\u2019s not true that every vote carries equal weight. The voting system tends to favour bigger, more unified voting blocs as opposed to smaller, dispersed ones. So in theory, tactical co-operation between parties could potentially change the outcome of the election.\n\nTo show why, we\u2019ll explain more about how the voting system works \u2013 and even give you a tool to download that lets you simulate how it works for yourself.\n\nHow do elections to the European Parliament work?\n\nThere are two different voting systems: one for Great Britain and one for Northern Ireland.\n\nFor Great Britain, unlike in a Westminster election, you\u2019ll normally choose a party, rather than a particular individual (although individuals can stand as independents as well). Your ballot paper will list a set of parties to choose from.\n\nYour \u201cconstituency\u201d is your region\u2014so the North West is a whole region, as are London, Scotland, and the South East, for example. Each of the 12 regions elect multiple MEPs, according to their population (a total of 70 across Great Britain and three in Northern Ireland).\n\nA region\u2019s MEPs can come from different parties: each party submits a list of candidates, ranked in order, and depending on how many seats a party wins in that region, candidates are elected starting with the top of a party\u2019s list, working down.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, we use something called the single transferrable vote \u2013 that\u2019s where you rank individual candidates by preference.\n\nYes and no. Proportional representation describes electoral systems where parties gain seats in proportion to the number of votes cast for them. So, in a perfectly proportional system, a party that wins 30% of votes would win 30% of the seats.\n\nBut there are many different types of \u201cproportional\u201d voting system, and some more closely match the vote share with the seat share than others.\n\nIn Great Britain, the European Parliament voting system is designed to be broadly proportional.\n\nBut because the country is split into regions with a handful of seats in each, there often aren\u2019t enough seats available to deliver a particularly proportional outcome.\n\nTake the North East of England, for example. It\u2019s a relatively small region by population, and elects three MEPs. With only three seats available, the party you vote for could potentially get 20% of the vote and 0% of the seats.\n\nBy contrast, the South East of England elects 10 MEPs, so your party is guaranteed a seat with just a little over 9% of the vote.\n\nSo the voting system is likely to be more proportional in regions with more MEPs and less proportional in regions with fewer MEPs.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the system is different, but it has a similar effect: there are just three seats available in Northern Ireland, and four or five parties tend to dominate at the polls. So it\u2019s very difficult to get a proportional outcome there as well.\n\nTechnically speaking, votes in all elections have equal weight. Each eligible person gets one vote and no-one\u2019s vote counts for more than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nBut in practice, the effective \u2018influence\u2019 your vote has can depend on where you live and what voting system is used.\n\nSome regions of the UK get more MEPs per eligible voter than others. In Northern Ireland in 2014, there were 1.2 million eligible voters electing three MEPs (410,000 per MEP) while in London around 5.5 million eligible voters chose eight MEPs (690,000 per MEP).\n\nOn the flipside, as it happened only 60% of voters in Northern Ireland ending up getting an MEP from the party they supported. By contrast, 85% of voters in London did.\n\nIn a perfectly proportional system with enough seats for every party, every vote could have \u2018weight\u2019 in the sense that every voter\u2019s choice can end up being represented. But under these systems, it is still possible that your vote for a party might not result in it gaining any representation.\n\nThe final claim is that small parties don\u2019t need to form alliances to win seats at the European parliament elections.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely up to parties what alliances they want to form in an election. But because of the way the voting system works, it\u2019s possible for several small parties to get no seats in a region, whereas if their votes had been combined, they could have earned one collectively.\n\nThe voting system used in Great Britain for European Parliament elections uses something called the D\u2019Hondt method, which works like this.\n\nImagine five parties are competing for a region with six available seats. When the votes are counted, the party with the most votes takes the first seat. Then their vote is halved, and the party with the most votes after this stage gets the second seat. This process repeats until all seats are filled.\n\nEach party\u2019s vote share is reduced by a different amount depending on how many seats they\u2019ve already won in the region. After their first seat their vote is halved. After their second their vote goes down to a third of the original. After the third, it goes down to a quarter. And so on.\n\nThat can leave the situation where two or more parties with quite small vote shares get no seats, whereas if they had combined votes they may have won a seat.\n\nFor example, in the 2014 European Parliament election the Liberal Democrats got 6.9% of the votes but just 1.4% of the seats. That\u2019s because they tended to have too small a share of the votes in each region across Great Britain to earn any of the limited set of seats available.\n\nYou can try out different combinations of parties to see how the system works with our election simulator, which you can download here.", "lang": "en"}
