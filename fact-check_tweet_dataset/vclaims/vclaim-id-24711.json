That contradicts President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the tariffs have boosted the GDP.\n\nAs the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put it in February, the \u201cconsensus among most economists is that the tariffs are likely to have a negative effect on the U.S. economy overall.\u201d\n\nAs the trade war between China and the U.S. intensified, Trump insisted on May 13 that tariffs imposed so far by the U.S. have increased revenues to the Treasury and improved the economy.\n\nThe president said in a tweet that the 3.2 percent GDP growth for the first quarter \u201cwas greatly helped by Tariffs from China.\u201d Trump repeated the claim in a press conference before his meeting with Hungary\u2019s prime minister later in the day. After boasting about the \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d coming to the U.S. via tariffs imposed last year on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, as well as what will be coming from the latest round of tariffs imposed last week, he turned to the GDP.\n\n\u201cIf you looked at the first quarter \u2014 which is always, historically, the worst quarter \u2014 we were at 3.2 percent [GDP growth],\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople were very surprised. Well, a lot of that was the tariffs that we were taking in from China. So we\u2019re in a very good position and I think it\u2019s only going to get better.\u201d\n\nLast summer, after the Trump administration raised tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods. On May 10, Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent. China retaliated with an announcement that it would raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of American products. Trump responded by threatening to expand U.S. tariffs to cover all $540 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nThe tariffs imposed last July have brought in more revenue \u2014 the Treasury Department has collected nearly $40 billion in customs duties over the first seven months of the current fiscal year, roughly $18 billion more than in the same period last year (see Table 3) \u2014 but that\u2019s a tiny fraction of the more than $2 trillion in government revenues taken in so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. While it\u2019s difficult to determine how the president\u2019s tariffs may have affected the higher-than-expected growth in that particular quarter, most economists agree the tariffs generally have a slightly negative impact on the GDP, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe Feb. 22 report on Trump\u2019s tariffs at that time noted that the \u201cconsensus among most economists is that the tariffs are likely to have a negative effect on the U.S. economy overall. \u2026 Economic analyses of the tariff actions estimate a range of potential effects, but generally suggest a 0.1%- 0.2% reduction in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth annually owing to the actions to date.\u201d\n\nAlthough different markets may be affected differently, the report states, \u201cImport tariffs are effectively a tax on domestic consumption and thus increase costs for U.S. consumers and downstream industries that use products subject to tariffs. Retaliatory tariffs create disadvantages for U.S. exports in foreign markets, and can lead to fewer sales of U.S. products abroad and depressed prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, studies by the U.S. government, international institutions, think tanks and consulting groups \u201chave produced a range of estimates, but generally suggest a moderately negative impact.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office, for example, estimated a 0.1 percent decline in the annual U.S. GDP growth rate as a result of the tariffs in place before May 10, and the International Monetary Fund put the decline at 0.2 percent, the report says. The report warns that the negative effects \u201ccould grow if U.S. tariff actions and retaliation escalates,\u201d as they have now.\n\nKent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, told us: \u201cOverall, the trade deficit has actually increased since 2017, thereby not consistent with higher GDP. The trade deficit with China is slightly smaller but well within normal range and not statistically significantly different than previous years. I estimate that the new tariffs imposed under Trump will cost the average American family between $500 and $550 in 2019. As a result, the tariffs will have a slight drag on GDP growth.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the Rhodium Group, commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, concluded the GDP \u2014 which was $20.5 trillion in 2018 \u2014 \u201cwould face $1 trillion in cumulative losses within ten years across all tariff escalation scenarios. The costs of such action are unambiguous: bilateral tariffs result in lower GDP, employment, investment, and trade for the US.\u201d According to the report\u2019s estimates, in the five years after implementation of tariffs, the GDP would be 1.5 percent to 2.2 percent lower, cumulatively.\n\n\u201cTariffs do not help GDP in the short term,\u201d Daniel Rosen, a founding partner of Rhodium Group and one of the report\u2019s authors, told us via email. \u201cAt best, they might create space for a domestic industry to develop for the future. Trump\u2019s theory is that tariff receipts are somehow additive to GDP. They are not. They are paid by Americans. Or in part by foreign firms sacrificing profit margin to protect market share, but that doesn\u2019t add to GDP, just redistributes a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe run a lot of simulations looking at the impact of tariffs, and generally they are negative for growth,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, told us in a phone interview.\n\nIn the short run, he said, there can be periods when tariffs are positive from a GDP perspective, such as when companies front-load purchases in anticipation of tariffs. The first quarter of this year, for example, saw a rebound in the purchase of agricultural products from the U.S., particularly soybeans, he said. But it came after two months in which tariffs severely depressed soybean exports.\n\nThose kinds of changes are superficial. Ultimately, Daco said, \u201call tariffs are a drag on GDP.\u201d\n\nDaco told CNBC that the tariffs in place since last year depressed U.S. gross domestic product growth by about 0.1 percentage point this year. And he estimated that the additional tariffs imposed by Trump on May 10 will reduce GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point next year.\n\nA study released in February by the Trade Partnership Worldwide, a nonpartisan group that supports free trade, warned that if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff on all remaining imports from China it would reduce GDP by 1.01 percent annually.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and National Economic Council believes that forecast is \u201cpretty wildly exaggerated.\u201d But he acknowledged that the White House estimates that increased tariffs on all Chinese goods would amount to \u201cabout two tenths of 1 percent of GDP, so it\u2019s a very modest number. We have a $20 trillion GDP.\u201d\n\nKudlow argued that is \u201ca risk we should and can take without damaging our economy in any appreciable way\u201d in order \u201cto correct 20 years plus of unfair trading practices with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had unfair trading practices all these years, and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of opinion whether a short-term, modest hit to the GDP is necessary in order to negotiate a better long-term trade agreement with China or other countries, but economists say the president is wrong to claim that the tariffs are boosting the GDP in the short run.", "lang": "en"}
