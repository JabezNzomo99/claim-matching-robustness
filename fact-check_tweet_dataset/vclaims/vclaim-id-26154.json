A photoshopped screengrab of ABP News has been circulating on social media which claims that Girija Tripathi, an accused in the Deoria shelter home case is the sister of BJP MP Kalraj Mishra. A Facebook user, Naween Kumar Sah has shared a screengrab of the news channel with a caption \u201c\u0905\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u0941\u0928\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0940 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0932\u093e\u092f\u0930 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u093f\u091c\u093e \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0926 \u0915\u0932\u0930\u093e\u091c \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0939\u0948\u201d (Hey listen, Deoria\u2019s girl supplier, Girija Tripathi is sister of BJP MP Kalraj Mishra \u2013 translated).\n\nMany users have shared the same claim on Twitter and Facebook. A Twitter account named \u0905\u0928\u0941 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935 (Anu Yadav) has also shared the same screengrab tweeting, \u201c\u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u0928 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0940,\u0915\u093f \u091c\u0941\u0932\u092e\u0940 \u0915\u092c-\u0924\u0915 \u091c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0917\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947.. #savewomen\u201d (Heard too much, how long will the oppressor commit crime from the corridors of power -translated). It may be noted that the veracity of the other screengrab which has been shared by this user hasn\u2019t been subjected to question.\n\nAccording to a keyword search on Facebook, a post shared by Ahem Khan in a group called \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0901 (caravan) was one of the earliest that Alt News could find. Times Now also referred to this claim on the basis of a sting operation that the channel had carried out as part of its reportage on the incident. In the sting operation, SK Yadav, chairman of Child Welfare claimed that he was informed, \u201cGirija Tripathi is the sister of Kalraj Mishra\u201d. Although, later the claim was rubbished by Anila Singh, BJP Spokesperson who unequivocally denied of Kalraj Mishra having any relation with Girija Tripathi. According to a report published by The Lallantop, Kalraj Mishra has clarified, \u201cI had three brothers and two sisters. All the siblings are now dead. One sister was married in Mirzapur and the other in Azamgarh. Both died almost 20 years ago. I have no relation with Girija Tripathi. I have no kinship with Girija Tripathi. My opponents are spreading such rumors. The police are taking action against the incident in my parliamentary constituency (translated)\u201d. Meanwhile, a police complaint has also been registered for spreading rumours against the legislator and a tweet regarding the same has attached a screenshot of a tweet by Ankit Lal who is associated with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The tweet had the same screengrab of ABP News. Ankit Lal later clarified that he had deleted his tweet after he found out that the information was incorrect.\n\n@KalrajMishra - had tweeted out something about you yesterday which I later found to be wrong. \n\n\n\nDeleted the tweet as soon as the incorrectness of the info was brought to my notice. \u2014 Ankit Lal (@AnkitLal) August 9, 2018 Moreover, ABP News has categorically called out the photoshopped screengrab of the channel in a \u2018Viral Sach\u2019 episode. More often than not, social media users are likely to believe such manipulated images which circulate on social media, as such content is designed to make it seem credible.", "lang": "en"}
