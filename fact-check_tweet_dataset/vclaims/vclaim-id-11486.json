It approached the aircraft at a safe distance and identified it as an EP-3E Aries signals reconnaissance version of the U.S. Navy. The fighter crew reported identification of the U.S. signals reconnaissance aircraft and escorted it away from the airspace of the Russian Federation in compliance with all security and safety requirements,\" read the Russian Defense Ministry statement.\n\nBut later on November 5, the U.S. Navy released a video corroborating its account of the event.\n\n\"The intercepting Su-27 made an additional pass, closing with the EP-3 and applying its afterburner while conducting a banking turn away. The crew of the EP-3 reported turbulence following the first interaction, and vibrations from the second,\" the Navy said.\n\nOr, in the words of Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon: \u201cThey buzzed us. They got a little too close,\u201d the Navy Times cites him as saying.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just absolutely no reason for this type of behavior,\u201d ABC News cited Pahon as saying. He said the last unsafe encounter with a Russian aircraft had happened in January.\n\nOn November 1, the Russian Defense Ministry released a statement saying at least 17 foreign planes and unmanned aerial vehicles had flown near Russia\u2019s borders in just a week, RT reported. It added that fighter jets had been scrambled four times to prevent potential violations of the country\u2019s borders.\n\nRegarding the latest incident, the 6th Fleet said the \u201cRussian military is within its right to exercise within international airspace,\u201d but added the most recent interaction was \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnsafe actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential for midair collisions,\u201d the 6th Fleet said.\n\nBased on the available video evidence, the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s claim that all security and safety requirements had been followed to carry out the latest intercept is demonstrably false.", "lang": "en"}
