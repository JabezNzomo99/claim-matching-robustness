Trump. The headline read, \"Michelle Obama: \u2018Florida shooting is clearly Trump\u2019s fault, these shootings are happening constantly since he became our president.\"\n\nThe news brief said Obama made those comments \"in Chicago amid the Obama Foundation worldwide event.\"\n\nBut this story is a hoax.\n\nThe Obama Foundation has not held an event since 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14.\n\nA search of the Nexis news database finds that former first lady Michelle Obama did not make those remarks at another event, or in any format whatsoever.\n\nAn identical article showed up on three websites \u2014 Usdeplorablesnews.com, DailynewsforAmericans.com and Uberconservative.com.\n\nNone should be trusted.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Florida shooting, Michelle Obama retweeted the comments made by her husband, Barack Obama. He wrote:\n\n\"We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.\"\n\nWebsites claimed that Michelle Obama blamed Trump for the shooting in Florida. But she never said that. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
