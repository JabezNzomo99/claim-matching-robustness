Can\u2019t understand what more we can do, all solutions are exhausted on ground. Our only hope remains up in the Sky, God rescue your people.\u201d\n\nThe post also shows a photo, presumably supposed to be of the Italian Prime Minister in tears.\n\nThe quote is made up. It does not appear on any reputable website attributed to Mr Conte when searched for on Google, and the general message doesn\u2019t match up with Mr Conte\u2019s recent statements on the pandemic.\n\nAlso the photo shown is of Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro from before the coronavirus pandemic, not Mr Conte.", "lang": "en"}
