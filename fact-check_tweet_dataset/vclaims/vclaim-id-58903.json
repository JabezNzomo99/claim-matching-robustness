The habits listed include; \u201cmissing breakfast\u201d, \u201csleeping late\u201d, \u201chigh sugar consumption\u201d, \u201cmore sleeping specially at morning\u201d, \u201ceating meal while watching TV or computer\u201d, \u201cwearing cap/scarf or socks while sleeping\u201d and \u201chabit of blocking/stopping urine.\u201d\n\nA preliminary check showed that the claim is filled with typographical and grammatical errors.\n\nIt reads, (sic) \u201cDon\u2019t Just ReadForward to whom you careAs I care for U\u201d with the word \u2018you\u2019 represented as an abbreviation \u201cu\u201d and spaces between some words omitted.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the WHO would issue a public information message in this pattern.\n\nThe claim was subjected to internet search and further findings revealed that a similar claim appeared on the internet in 2017.\n\nIt had similar content except for the quoted caption and graphics. While the claim under verification was attributed to the WHO, the latter was referenced to another organisation.\n\nAs part of the verification process, the WHO Nigeria office also debunked the claim that the message originated from its office.\n\nCharity Warigon, Head of Communications, WHO Nigeria, told The ICIR via a phone call that, \u201cCertainly, it doesn\u2019t sound WHO at all.\u201d\n\nShe asked for the viral claim to be forwarded to her through the WhatsApp platform. This was done, and in her response, she labelled it as fake.\n\nBased on the above findings, WHO did not send out the circulated message. Therefore, the attribution to WHO is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
