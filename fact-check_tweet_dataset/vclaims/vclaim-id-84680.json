The claim is false; UNHCR officials in Malaysia said the alleged statement is fake and condemned the erroneous claim for stoking \u201cunnecessary fear and distrust\u201d.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on March 18, 2020.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cHeard...This is issued by UNHCR. 4 bus loads of Myanmarese Muslims and Bangladeshis attended the Sri Petaling event. The illegals are afraid to be arrested if they go for testing. The refugee chat group is having problems trying to persuade migrants and illegals to be tested. They are serving in restaurant and working in Selayang market.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Sri Petaling event was an Islamic gathering held just outside Malaysia\u2019s capital Kuala Lumpur from February 27 to March 1, 2020. The event was organized by Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement, and drew a crowd of about 16,000 people. Since then, several hundred confirmed COVID-19 cases in Malaysia have been linked to the gathering, according to the Ministry of Health here in an infographic.\n\nSelayang is an area in Selangor, the most populous state in Malaysia.\n\nGlobally, the death toll from the virus has risen to nearly 10,000 with more than 232,000 cases in 158 countries and territories, according to the AFP tally on March 20, 2020. Malaysia has currently reported 900 confirmed cases.\n\nA similar claim was also published on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nBut the claim is false. UNHCR officials in Malaysia refuted the claim in this statement on March 18, 2020, saying it was \u201cFAKE\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cUNHCR has received reports of a WhatsApp message allegedly being sent out by UNHCR regarding refugees unwilling to get tested for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that this message is FAKE, and has not been issued by UNHCR.\n\n\u201cThis message creates unnecessary fear and distrust towards refugees, and it contributes to pushing refugees even further into the margins causing distress in the communities and preventing them from seeking help when they need it.\u201d\n\nThe statement adds that the agency has been in close co-ordination with the Malaysian government to \u201censure that refugee communities are included in the Government\u2019s national response measures\u201d.\n\nA UNHCR spokesperson also told AFP that refugees and asylum-seekers who attended the Sri Petaling event were co-operating with health officials.\n\n\u201cThere are reports from the communities that refugees and asylum-seekers have also participated. UNHCR has received accounts from refugee communities that affected refugees have been cooperative with authorities on tracing efforts,\u201d the spokesperson said via email on March 19, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
