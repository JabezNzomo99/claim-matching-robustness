She adopted a kitten tossed from a New York bridge in 2011, and adopted a blind and deaf puppy featured on The View in 2015. But she hasn\u2019t been arrested for any sort of animal abuse.\n\nThe story isn\u2019t true. It was originally posted June 17 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a self-described liberal troll who posts absurd articles in an attempt to fool conservatives.\n\nThe website said in its footer note that \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" A disclaimer on its About Us page added that \"we present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\n\nGoldberg has been a target of the site before. TheLastLineOfDefense.org has said Goldberg has been charged by the Secret Service, hired by Fox News Channel and faced the ire of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. And that\u2019s just since March.\n\nThis is another fake charge leveled by a website that makes up all its content, which is reshared online with no indication of its origins.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
