The picture shows a condition known as Trench foot which is caused by long immersion of feet in cold water or mud.\n\n\n\npost on Facebook, with the same claim, has been shared more than 12,000 times.\n\nThis picture has been shared by several users on Facebook with the same claim.We have also received requests to verify the image on the Alt News app\n\nOften, the quality of an image deteriorates as it traverses the world of social media from one platform to another. The strategy to fact-check blurry images or videos is to find a clearer version of the same, one with a higher resolution. A reverse image search on Yandex led Alt News to a better quality image posted by a Reddit user. This was one of the earliest instances of the image uploaded on the internet that Alt News could find.\n\nIn this image, the tag \u2018US Marine\u2019 embroidered above the left breast pocket is clearly visible.\n\n\n\nAlt News compared the viral image with several other images available on\n\nthe official website of the United States Marine Corps for further corroboration and found that the uniform is identical to that of the US Marines. Thus we were able to conclude that the person in the image is wearing the uniform of a US Marine and is not an Indian army soldier.\n\nSimilar misinformation has been circulated in the past. BJP MP Kirron Kher had posted an image of Russian army soldiers as Indian army men. Earlier this year, a still from a winter surfing video from Michigan, USA was viral as an Indian army soldier on duty in extremely cold weather.", "lang": "en"}
