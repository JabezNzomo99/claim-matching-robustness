The BJP symbols can also be seen in the background of two photos.\n\nThe celebrity factor mostly works for political parties during elections, considering their massive fan base.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found the claim to be misleading. None of them have joined the BJP yet. Although, Gambhir and Deol have campaigned for the party in 2014.\n\nPeople believed the viral post and commented on it and calling it \"good news\". The Facebook post has been shared more than 7,200 times as of now. The page on which it was shared has 18 lakh followers.\n\nThe post said, \"BJP ke sang hue Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Sunny Deol and Gautam Gambhir.\" The first image showed Kohli shaking hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kohli could be seen wearing a saffron-coloured cap and scarf.\n\nWhen we looked up the photo, we found that it was taken on December 20, 2017. It is from the time when Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli and actress Anushka Sharma went to invite PM Modi for their wedding reception. In the original photo, Kohli was not wearing any saffron cap or scarf.\n\nEven master blaster Sachin Tendulkar's picture has been photoshopped. The second image of Tendulkar, wearing a saffron kurta with BJP's symbol in the background, was clicked on April 24, 2015. Tendulkar had gone to visit the Siddhivinayak temple along with his family on his 42nd birthday. The original photo can be seen on the temple's official website.\n\nThe photo of actor Sunny Deol wearing a scarf with the party's lotus symbol all over it was clicked when he was campaigning for BJP candidate Satyapal Singh in Baghpat in 2014.\n\nFormer batsman Gautam Gambhir showing a victory sign with the BJP symbol in the background was taken on April 5, 2014, during an election campaign supporting Arun Jaitley. See the original photo here.\n\nSpeaking to India Today, Gambhir's manager Dinesh Chopra said he has not joined the BJP. Even Deol's PR team confirmed the news was fake, calling it \"baseless\"\n\nThough there have been media reports in the past which said Deol and Gambhir may join the BJP, there has been no official announcement made by the party so far.", "lang": "en"}
