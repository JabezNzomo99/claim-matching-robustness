His alleged statement, shared on the website AZ Quotes, reads:\n\n\"Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In cases when the statement is attributed to Churchill, we found, it is almost always in unsourced Facebook posts and on meme generator websites.\n\nLikewise, Richard Langworth, senior fellow at the Churchill Project at Hillsdale College, includes the quotation in his running list of \"All the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\" Langworth says there is no attribution for the quote.\n\nQuote Investigator, a website that tracks down quotations, also found \"no substantive evidence that Winston Churchill employed this joke,\" even though Churchill suddenly began receiving credit for it in the 2000s. The earliest instance of the statement, the website said, came in 1937 and was anonymous.", "lang": "en"}
