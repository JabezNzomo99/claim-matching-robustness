This sounds similar to the figures provided to us by Dame Carol, but they don\u2019t break down to a UK-only level.\n\nThe global results revealed 30% could get cocaine in 30 minutes or less, while just 16.5% said the same about pizza. In the UK, 83% of respondents said they could get cocaine on the day it was ordered, with 37% saying it would be delivered in 30 minutes or less. However, the survey did not break down pizza delivery-time by country, so no specific UK comparison can be done. We\u2019ve looked at this before.\n\nThe 2019 Global Drug Survey found that, internationally, 61.7% of cocaine-using participants had cocaine delivered on the same day and 30% of those reported waiting no more than 30 minutes, but it did not collect data on pizza.\n\nThe report said: \u201cWe also look at speed for delivery and update our work from last year \u2013 though we won\u2019t be mentioning pizzas for a while.\u201d\n\nProfessor Adam Winstock, founder and CEO of the Global Drug Survey, told Full Fact the organisation had decided not to compare to pizza again as there are \u201cother things to focus on that we consider more important than pizza to address our primary mission of reducing drug-related harm\u2014more important than pizza headlines.\u201d\n\nNo other comparisons between pizza and drug delivery have been done that we\u2019re aware of. Without any updated figures, or specific break-downs about pizza delivery time in the UK, there is not enough evidence to show that it is as easy to get some drugs as it is to get pizza.", "lang": "en"}
