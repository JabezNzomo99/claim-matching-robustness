Musk had also posted a tweet two days prior stating that the Tesla plant in Alameda County in California\u2019s Bay Area would reopen against the area\u2019s local stay-at-home orders. The Bay Area had been hit hard by the pandemic, and officials announced in late April that, in an effort to slow the virus\u2019 spread, they would extend those orders through the end of May 2020.\n\nThe cumulative impression left some viewers with the impression that Musk had posted the picture to demonstrate he had gone out to eat an ice cream sundae in defiance of orders. But internet detectives doing reverse-image searches discovered that the picture of the dessert posted to his Twitter account was identical to one originally taken by the food blogger The Episodic Eater, and reposted on Twitter by the Italian restaurant chain Buca di Beppo in 2017. That prompted some social media users to poke fun at Musk.\n\nBuca di Beppo responded with a joke itself, referencing Musk\u2019s advocacy for sending humans to Mars by stating that it was working with Musk to establish the first restaurant franchise there.\n\n \n\n Because Musk did post a picture of a sundae from the restaurant, but that the picture was posted 2 years prior to the pandemic, we rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
