A new provision that grabbed attention was section 32.10, which requires the US, Mexico and Canada to notify each other if they are entering into free trade negotiations with a \u201cnon-market economy.\u201d This prompted criticism that Canada was restricting its capacity to enter into free trade negotiations with China.\n\nSpeaking on CBC\u2019s The House, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, responded to these criticisms, stating that Canada\u2019s \u201csovereignty has not been limited by this clause in any way, this is optics only.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly does the contested section require? Would it actually impact Canada\u2019s ability to enter into free trade agreements with non-market economies such as China \u2013 or other sovereign rights \u2013 or is it only optics like Freeland claims?\n\nA non-market economy is defined by the World Trade Organization as a country where the government has complete or near complete monopoly on trade. A non-market economy is defined in the USMCA as a country that at least one USMCA country has determined to be a non-market economy for the purpose of its trade remedy laws. For example, countries may classify another this way in their anti-dumping provisions within the WTO.\n\nUnlike the US, Canada and Mexico don\u2019t always classify China as a non-market economy. Debra Steger, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, explained, \u201cCanada and Mexico appear to be applying China\u2019s WTO Protocol correctly, which requires an examination of Chinese exporting companies in anti-dumping cases to determine whether or not they are market-oriented.\u201d Steger noted that WTO rules no longer permit a presumption that companies from a particular country are non-market oriented, however, the US and the European Union do still apply this presumption to China.\n\nThis section has three main features.\n\n1) If a signatory is going to negotiate a free trade agreement with a non-market economy, it must notify the other USMCA signatories three months prior to beginning negotiations;\n\n2) A negotiating signatory must provide the other signatories with as much information as possible about the objectives of the negotiations and 30 days prior to signing an agreement, must give a copy of the agreement to the other USMCA signatories; and\n\n3) If a signatory then enters into a free trade agreement with a non-market economy, the other USMCA signatories may then, with 6 months\u2019 notice, withdraw from the trilateral USMCA and replace it with a bilateral trade agreement with each other.\n\nAre these new provisions? Not all of them. Some restate existing rights under NAFTA and some are in fact new.\n\nAccording to Andrew Newcombe, law professor at the University of Victoria, the obligation to inform trading partners about negotiations is a new requirement under the USMCA and was not present under NAFTA. He points out though, that this is a process obligation and does not limit the right to negotiate.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t change is the ability of a country to withdraw from the agreement. Both Newcombe and Steger point out that countries already had the ability to withdraw from NAFTA with 6 months\u2019 notice.\n\nSo do these new requirements limit Canada\u2019s sovereignty? Two core features of sovereignty, according to the legal scholars John Currie, Craig Forcese and Valerie Oosterveld, are autonomy in internal and foreign affairs.\n\nNewcombe says that any treaty obligation, from a pure international law perspective, does limit sovereignty. Significance of the limitation is arguable, however, and may be political too.\n\nFor example, Newcombe questioned if Freeland might instead emphasize the impact of such a provision if notification was required for human rights or gender issues. According to Armand de Mestral, a law professor at the University of McGill, it\u2019s speculative to say what the impact of a notification under section 32.10 would be as it would depend on the politics of the governments in place.\n\nOn the other hand, notification might not make much of a difference as the USMCA signatories may share information about each others\u2019 trade negotiations anyways. Additionally, Steger said she doubts that any USMCA country would actually withdraw on this basis.\n\nFreeland claims that section 32.10 does not limit Canada\u2019s sovereignty and is purely optics. While Newcombe pointed out that any obligation is technically a limit on sovereignty, we\u2019re asking whether, practically speaking, Canada is more constrained. What section 32.10 adds is the obligation to inform. Given that the USMCA countries would likely already share news about their trade negotiations and that this is about information only, we rate Freeland\u2019s claim as true.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s possible that Freeland\u2019s statement is contradictory. As de Mestral pointed out, we can\u2019t say how the notification would be used on a political level. So we add the caveat that even if it is a matter of optics, optics can still be consequential.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
