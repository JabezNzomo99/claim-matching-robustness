Many such Facebook posts are accompanied by a screenshot of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website on the COVID-19 antibody test. An example of one such post can be seen here, while an article making the same claim can be seen here.\n\nThe screenshot is genuine\u2014it is true that the CDC has cautioned that a COVID-19 antibody test may produce a positive result in the presence of antibodies against viruses causing the common cold. This is because some viruses that cause the common cold also belong to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2, potentially leading to cross-reactivity in COVID-19 antibody testing. However, it is inaccurate and misleading to claim that false-positive results from antibody testing are responsible for the number of COVID-19 positive cases detected in the U.S.\n\nBy examining this CDC website, we can see that the agency\u2019s report of total COVID-19 cases \u201cincludes confirmed and probable cases and deaths\u201d. The CDC bases its definitions of a confirmed and probable case from a Position Statement by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), which was approved on 5 April 2020.\n\nAccording to the CSTE, a confirmed case is defined as one that \u201cmeets confirmatory laboratory evidence.\u201d The CSTE considers confirmatory laboratory evidence as \u201cDetection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ribonucleic acid (SARS-CoV-2 RNA) in a clinical specimen using a molecular amplification detection test.\u201d This test detects the presence of the virus\u2019 genetic material in samples using a molecular technique called real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). As explained in an earlier Health Feedback review, the RT-PCR test is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and would not detect other viruses belonging to the coronavirus family, unlike antibody testing.\n\nOn the other hand, a probable case as defined by the CSTE needs to meet one of the three requirements:\n\nAccording to the CSTE statement, presumptive laboratory evidence can involve either the \u201cdetection of specific antigen in a clinical specimen\u201d or \u201cdetection of specific antibody in serum, plasma, or whole blood indicative of a new or recent infection.\u201d\n\nTherefore, a positive antibody test can indeed be part of the inclusion criteria for a COVID-19 case and it is possible that some probable cases among the total COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are due, in part, to antibody testing. However, as mentioned above, antibody test results must also be combined with the presence of either the clinical criteria or epidemiologic evidence for COVID-19. Clinical criteria includes the presence of signs and symptoms associated with COVID-19, such as fever, myalgia (muscle aches), headache, and sore throat. Epidemiologic evidence includes close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. In short, a positive antibody test alone is not sufficient for counting someone as a probable COVID-19 case.\n\nWhile probable cases, which may involve positive antibody test results, also comprise a part of the total COVID-19 cases detected in the U.S., they most likely do not contribute to the majority of cases. In fact, looking at the breakdown of total COVID-19 cases from 28 jurisdictions reported on the CDC website (see table below), we can observe that confirmed cases vastly outnumber probable cases, with the sole exception of Puerto Rico. Since RT-PCR testing is much more reliable for detecting current COVID-19 infection compared to antibody testing, the trend of confirmed cases outnumbering probable ones is likely to hold true for most, if not all, of the U.S.\n\nIn summary, it is inaccurate and misleading to claim that antibodies from the common cold produce a positive COVID-19 test result, as viral tests for current COVID-19 infection are performed using RT-PCR, not antibody testing. It is also inaccurate to claim that the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is due to false-positive results from COVID-19 antibody testing. This is supported by data from 28 U.S. jurisdictions, which show that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases are confirmed cases, which are detected using the highly specific molecular test for current COVID-19 infection.\n\nReuters, Lead Stories, and USA Today also fact-checked this claim; all three found it to be false.", "lang": "en"}
