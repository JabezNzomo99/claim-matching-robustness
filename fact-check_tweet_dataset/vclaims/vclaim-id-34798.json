However, there is no evidence that he ever made this statement. A search of Franklin\u2019s collected works turned up nothing similar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never run across it. Doesn\u2019t sound like Franklin to me,\u201d H.W. Brands, historian and author of \u201cThe First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,\u201d told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say This Quote About Avoiding Tyranny?)\n\nIn its current form, the expression has only been circulating in print since 1999, according to etymologist Barry Popik.\n\nVariations of the quote, however, date back much further. The saying resembles the words of 18th century French philosopher Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius, for example. In his \u201cA Treatise on Man,\u201d Helvetius writes, \u201cMan is born ignorant; he is not born a fool; and it is not even without labour that he is made one.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
