Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Wall of \u2018Paribesh Bhavan\u2019 building (Kolkata) in the photo. Fact: The photo was taken by Vivek Prakash for Reuters in 2009. The photo shows air conditioners on the wall of a building in Singapore\u2019s financial district. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the \u2018Adobe Stock\u2019 with the title, \u2018Rows of air conditioners are seen on the walls of a building in Singapore\u2019s financial district\u2019. \n\n\n\nIt was also found that the photo was taken by Vivek Prakash for Reuters in 2009. So, when searched with the keywords, the same photo was also found on the Reuters pictures website with the same title. And, the photo can also be found in an article published by Reuters in 2009. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the photo shows air conditioners on the wall of a building in Singapore, not on \u2018Paribesh Bhavan\u2019 (Kolkata).\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
