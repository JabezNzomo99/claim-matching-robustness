Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\n\nUS fact-checking website, Snopes, which also debunked the same claim said that there was no mention of this supposed court case on the Supreme People's website.\n\nOn the Official website of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, only the daily brief on Coronavirus outbreak was available. There was no mention of this shocking news.\n\nAB-TC City News can't be called a credible source of news.\n\nCalling out one of the articles published on the above website, the Singapore government on January 30, 2020, also issued corrections and clarifications regarding the false news.\n\nIt turns out that AB-TC is the sole source of this rumour.\n\nErgo, 'China seeks court approval to kill over 20,000 coronavirus patients' is not a fact and is a piece of fake news.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, 31,526 cases of coronavirus have been reported worldwide, of this 1,568 people have recovered. The death toll stands at 638.\n\nTherefore, with no evidence mentioned substantiating the claim made in the AB-TC City news report, It can be ascertained that the claim is false.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Scared Of Coronavirus?
