The GOLOS Association is one such group -- a Russia-based election watchdog that monitored Russia\u2019s presidential election in 2012, when Putin retook the presidency after handing it off to his once and future prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. The 2012 election was marked by \u201cinsufficient level of competition, government interference with the electoral process, and some degree of coercion to vote,\u201d GOLOS stated that year.\n\n\u201cThese elections cannot be classified as free and fair under the definitions provided in the Russian constitution and international electoral standards,\u201d the report added.\n\nIn a similar vein, Sobchak told a television interviewer in the U.S. last month: \u201c[I]n Russia, unfortunately we have a joke that you cannot choose your parents, you cannot choose your gender and you cannot choose your president.\u201d\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at some of what we know about the 2018 election. At the end of last December, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the country\u2019s Central Election Commission barring Navalny from running for president due to a criminal conviction. The anti-corruption activist and outspoken critic of Putin and his government claims the criminal case against him was fabricated. The EU\u2019s foreign service said the decision to bar Navalny from running \u201ccasts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year.\u201d\n\nNavalny says the election \u201cis not a real\u201d one and will feature candidates picked by Putin, and thus had called on Russians to boycott the vote.\n\nCritics say the Kremlin has denied genuine opposition leaders access to the electoral arena and the media, precluding their political visibility and effective participation in the campaign.\n\nSobchak, herself, made similar arguments when she questioned Putin at his annual press conference in December.\n\nPutin is widely expected to win easily against seven other candidates, including Sobchak, Yabloko Party leader Grigory Yavlinsky, Communist Party nominee Pavel Grudinin, and Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, among other, less profile figures.\n\nA poll conducted in December 2017 by the independent Levada Center put Putin\u2019s approval rating at 80 percent. Some 66 percent of respondents said that they intended to vote for Putin, while only 2 percent said they backed Navalny, who is not on the ballot.\n\nThis may explain why Putin did not show up at his nomination event or participate in the presidential debates, which some observers say were staged to make contest look more real and to encourage a higher voter turnout.\n\nIndeed, the Putin government has expressed concern that low turnout would undermine Putin\u2019s legitimacy \u2013 even though with a victory he would become the longest serving leader since Stalin.\n\n\u200bAccording to experts, Putin and his supporters are hoping to hit least 70% in both his share of the vote and voter turnout \u2013 an outcome seen as providing the incumbent with sufficient legitimacy.\n\nNot every claim by opposition figures is correct. In a fact-check published on March 13, the online publication Medusa called a claim by Navalny \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nNavalny had claimed his investigation showed the ballot system was redesigned to allow for massive repeat voting: that people could register at multiple polling places and vote 20 to 30 times. Medusa found a new automated registration system by election day \u201canalyzes all applications\u2026and green lights only the first one.\u201d\n\nAnd despite her criticism of President Putin and his government, Sobchak has come under criticism for allegedly working with the Kremlin to encourage a younger generation of voters to participate.\n\nPutin \u201csees no glory in defeating the usual run of puppet buffoons,\u201d said Oleg Kashin, a writer who purportedly urged Sobchak to participate in Russia\u2019s anti-government protests in 2011-2012.\n\n\u201cThat's why the Kremlin seeks fresh faces each time. ... The fresh face this time will be Ms. Sobchak,\u201d Kashin added.\n\nAs for the Navalny camp, Vladimir Milov, a co-author of Navalny\u2019s presidential program, said:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about this spectacle in which we already know the ending. What we care about is that this country have real, competitive elections.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
