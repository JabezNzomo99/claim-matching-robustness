(Biden). He hasn\u2019t a chance in hell & they\u2019re not about to let an outsider(Bernie) destroy their scheme.\n\nIt looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all of a sudden world crisis pandemic. Stock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and canceled, CEO\u2019s of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming.\n\nNow they say there are a couple ways a President doesn\u2019t win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy.\n\nBut there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it (Corona Virus) originated in China who we are in a global trade war with; brought on by Trump. Let\u2019s not forget Biden\u2019s back door deals with CHINA as well.\n\nChina doesn\u2019t want 4 more years of Trump either. It all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn\u2019t have hit at a more perfect time.\n\nWith the Democrats running out of campaign talking points, in light of no school shootings, no migrant caravans at the southern border, fighting in Syria winding down, North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The Corona Virus gave them one last hail Mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down in 2020.\n\nThis is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear-mongering and panic, control the media, spread propaganda and the fan-favorite disarm the population. Oh, and did anyone notice that while they are mad as hell at Trump for not sending aid to Ukraine, they THEMSELVES voted AGAINST giving ANY emergency aid to all Americans?\n\nSorry but I don\u2019t think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all, and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten.\n\nThe common flu has killed more people this year already and the media is SILENT!\n\nA handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. Because the media told you to react in such a way. It all just seems fishy, a little too well-timed if you ask me.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
