While many marveled at the skill (or luck) portrayed in this footage, others were skeptical. Was the internet being duped by another doctored piece of media?\n\nThe video was taken on the Shambhala ride at the Port Aventura amusement park in Spain. YouTube user SirSammy 15 of New Zealand shared the footage with the following description:\n\nSome of the roller coasters at Port Aventura are equipped with video cameras to capture the reactions of these thrill-seekers. This footage is then available for purchase at the end of the ride as a take-home souvenir. The Shambhala, the tallest in PortAventura Park, is one such \u201cvideoride.\u201d\n\nAfter the video above went viral, the New Zealand Herald contacted SirSammy 15 (real name Samuel Kempf) for more information about the incident. Kempf said the person who dropped the phone gave him a big hug. And, as a thank you, the phone\u2019s owner purchased the above-displayed footage from Port Aventura as a souvenir:\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe it, he gave me a big hug,\u201d Kempf told Stuff. \u201cThe funniest reaction was when we had got off the rollercoaster and you go down to look at the photos and videos they take and half the people there seemed to be watching our screen and then everyone started cheering and clapping when it happened.\u201d The owner of the phone bought the video as a thank you to the Kiwi.\n\nWhile SirSammy\u2019s roller coaster phone catch may seem miraculous, it isn\u2019t unprecedented. Our search for similar footage turned up two videos from the exact same roller coaster. The first, taken in 2013, shows a man catching a set of keys while riding this roller coaster:\n\nThe other, also from 2013, shows someone catching a phone:\n\nWe reached out to Port Aventura to see how often items are dropped \u2014 and caught \u2014 on the Shambhala ride, and we will update this article when more information becomes available. This may not happen more often than usual on the Shambhala, but because it is a \u201cvideoride,\u201d more evidence may exist of these roller-coaster catches.", "lang": "en"}
