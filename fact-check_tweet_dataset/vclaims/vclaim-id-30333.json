Let\u2019s try to analyse the authenticity of the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: A video of Naga sadhus rallying in support of CAA and NRC in Haryana. Fact: It can be seen that the video in the post was uploaded on YouTube in March, 2019. There is no relation between the video and the recent rallies held in support of CAA and NRC. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video in the post was searched using \u2018Yandex\u2019 reverse image technique, some videos were seen in the search results. In one of those search results, a video was posted on Twitter as a Kumbh Mela video in March 2019. It can also be seen here that the same video was posted by a user on YouTube in March 2019. However, there is no certainty that the video was taken during the Kumbh Mela. But, the video doesn\u2019t have any relation to the recent rallies held in support of CAA and NRC.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, an old video is being falsely shared as Naga sadhus rallying in support of CAA and NRC in Haridwar.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
