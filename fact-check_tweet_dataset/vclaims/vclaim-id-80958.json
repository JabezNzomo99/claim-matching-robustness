The claim is false; the image has been doctored to include the Kashmiri separatist leader\u2019s photo instead of a symbol for the Communist Party of India.\n\nThe photo was shared here on Facebook on May 5, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Hindi language caption alongside the photo in the misleading post translates to English as: \u201cKanhaiya is doing roadshow and seeking votes with an image of Afzal Guru, who is convicted for terrorism by the Supreme Court. Why isn't the election commission is taking notice of this? Think what is his mentality? Who are the Hindus supporting his and what are they thinking? Are we so forsaken that we will vote for a terror-supporter? In what direction we are thinking? Think, understand and then take a right decision to vote in the interest of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cKanhaiya\u201d refers to Kanhaiya Kumar, a student leader and political activist. This is his official Facebook page, where he describes himself as the former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union.\n\nHe is contesting the seat of Begusarai in the eastern Indian state of Bihar for the Communist Party of India in ongoing elections, according to this March 25, 2019 party statement.\n\n\u201cAfzal Guru\u201d refers to a Kashmiri separatist leader who was executed by the Indian Supreme Court after plotting an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. Here is an AFP report published on February 9, 2013, about his execution.\n\nThe same photo was shared on Facebook here, here and here, and on Twitter here and here with a similar claim.\n\nBut the claim is false; the image has been doctored to include the Kashmiri separatist leader\u2019s photo instead of a symbol for the Communist Party of India.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo was originally posted here on Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s official Facebook page on April 27, 2019:\n\nThe photo was included in his Facebook post here.\n\nThe Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201cGlittering straws of lies disappears when people take to streets. Today this was the scene of Begusarai, tomorrow it will of the whole country. Look at how the public's skyrocketing excitement was in today's mobile torch rally.\u201d\n\nKanhaiya Kumar also posted the same photo here in a post containing multiple images on his verified Instagram page:\n\nIn the original photos shared by Kanhaiya Kumar, the initials \u201cCPI\u201d refer to the Communist Party of India, while the ears of corn and a sickle represents one of the party\u2019s logos.\n\nHere is a recent statement issued by the CPI chief and published on the party\u2019s official website that shows the symbol.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image:\n\nThe original photos posted by Kumar show him campaigning in the Begusarai district of Bihar.\n\nHere is a video report by Hindi TV channel channel ABP news published on April 27, 2019, about the rally.", "lang": "en"}
