Greitens\u2019 press secretary, Parker Briden, s", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-68879", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/dec/26/parker-briden/governors-spokesman-fudges-education-funding-perfo/", "vclaim": "\"It is one of our missions to create better schools,\" Briden told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Nov. 13. \"You hear us talking about it all the time. We\u2019ve seen funding increases for schools. We haven\u2019t seen a corresponding performance increase.\"\n\nBriden did not respond to our questions, so we decided to start by looking at the general operating budget for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nThe budget in 2017, showed an increase from 2016\u2019s total to about $5.9 billion. This increase happened despite about a $13 million decrease to the the portion of federal funds for the department.\n\nFor Greitens\u2019 first budget, fiscal year 2018, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education saw an increase to about $6.03 billion. So, on face value, there has been an overall increase in general funding for schools over the past few years.\n\nThe budget just lists the funding for the department. The actual appropriations bill is what breaks it down, and it\u2019s clear that not all of the $6.03 billion goes directly to the kids.\n\n\"While an appropriation may technically be higher, without being increased for inflation as well, the value of that increase diminishes. For instance, for schools, the costs of their supplies, teacher salaries, maintenance, etc., go up, so increases need to take that into account,\" she said.\n\nA dollar in 2015, when the 2016 budget was passed, is equal to $1.06 today. That means to keep pace with the $5.8 billion granted to K-12 education in fiscal year 2016, the 2018 budget would need to allot $6.15 billion. So, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the money allocated is less than it was three years ago.\n\nPotter said the governor\u2019s office is referring to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in which the state went up in two measures and down in two measures between 2011 and 2015. But this data is older, and new results won\u2019t be out until February.\n\nWhile state funding has increased, it\u2019s not keeping up with inflation. Meanwhile, student scores on the MAP test have increased. The results of a national test are mixed, not down, and in any case are outdated.", "lang": "en"}
