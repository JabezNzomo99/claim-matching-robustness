As far as the incident goes \u2026 they\u2019ll only say it was an \u201cunfortunate misunderstanding.\u201d They add \u2026 they\u2019re committed to co-parenting, and \u2026 \u201cwill continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.\u201d\n\nThe California couple, who star in the program in which they \u201cflip\u201d houses (in other words, they buy real estate, fix it up and sell it at a higher price) released a statement to the media \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t shed much light on the status of their marriage:\n\nLike many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage. We had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed.\n\nThe statement was referring to media reports from a May 2016 incident in which Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies responded to the couple\u2019s Yorba Linda home, to a \u201cpossibly suicidal\u201d man with a gun.\n\nAccording to the Sheriff\u2019s department, deputies responded to the couple\u2019s home on the afternoon of 23 May 2016. They reported that witnesses had seen Tarek take a gun from a safe, put it in a backpack and walk off on a trail into Chino Hills State Park.\n\nPolice reported that he was cooperative, and none of those at the scene, including his wife, reported any threatening comments or suicidal tendencies. Regardless, he agreed to relinquish his firearms to authorities for safe keeping for 30 days. Police took five weapons from the home.\n\nThe network also avoided any definitive statements about the couple\u2019s marital status, only saying in a statement they will continue to air the show:\n\nWe admire and appreciate Tarek and Christina\u2019s great work on Flip or Flop. When it comes to matters related to their own family, we respect their privacy and honor any decision that works best for them and their children. HGTV is currently airing episodes of Flip or Flop and the series will continue production as scheduled.\n\nThe couple has not responded to an inquiry we sent through their web site about the matter.", "lang": "en"}
