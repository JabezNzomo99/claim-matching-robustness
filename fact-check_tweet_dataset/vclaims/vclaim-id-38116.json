No, that's not true: an article about AOC backing a report that calls for various measures to tackle climate change misrepresented the \"population control measures\" the report actually contained by claiming it included killing people. In reality the report called for measures to reduce fertility.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Life News on November 7, 2019 titled \"AOC Pushes Population Control to Stop Climate Change: Kill More People to Save the Planet\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSeveral high-profile Democrats who back the so-called Green New Deal are now apparently supporting a new report calling for a dramatic reduction in the world's population to stave off a climate crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey retweeted links to a report signed by more than 11,000 scientists who argue that the population \"must be stabilized--and, ideally, gradually reduced--within a framework that ensures social integrity.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe actual report can be found here, there is a PDF link there you can click to download the full thing:\n\nScientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and to \"tell it like it is.\" On the basis of this obligation and the graphical indicators presented below, we declare, with more than 11,000 scientist signatories from around the world, clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.\n\nHere is the section on population control:\n\nStill increasing by roughly 80 million people per year, or more than 200,000 per day (figure 1a-b), the world population must be stabilized--and, ideally, gradually reduced--within a framework that ensures social integrity. There are proven and effective policies that strengthen human rights while lowering fertility rates and lessening the impacts of population growth on GHG emissions and biodiversity loss. These policies make family-planning services available to all people, remove barriers to their access and achieve full gender equity, including primary and secondary education as a global norm for all, especially girls and young women (Bongaarts and O'Neill 2018).\n\nNowhere in that does it advocate for killing people, which would certainly not be something that would \"strengthen human rights\" or \"ensures social integrity\". And population stabilization, with \"ideally\" a gradual reduction is not the \"dramatic reduction in the world's population\" the LifeNews article claims is being proposed.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes lifenews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
