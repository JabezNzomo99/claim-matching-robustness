They are hospital staff.\n\nA spokesperson for Gandhi hospital (from the Health Ministers office) refuted the claim.\n\nAccording to a report by The News Minute, the spokesperson has clarified that the two persons in the video were class IV, sanitation staff. They were resting following the completion of their 12-hour shift.\n\n\"They were waiting for their transportation home and resting at the spot. They are wearing full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, patients only wear masks when moving between two locations within the hospital,\" he said.\n\nAccording to a resident doctor at the hospital, the video was shot in the ground floor near the triage area when incoming patients are checked in.\n\nThe people seen in the video are sanitation workers.\n\nHowever, that particular area is often used by patients to sit and wait for the ward boy who comes down the lift to take the patients to the seventh floor.\n\nThe doctor added that sometimes even the doctors wait there for the senior doctors to come down.\n\nEarlier also videos of patients of the hospital had gone viral on social media.\n\nPatients can be heard complaining in those videos regarding the lack of adequate patient care at the hospital.\n\nReportedly, the Health Department has tried to improve the public perception of the hospital by recording positive reviews given by patients getting treated at the hospital.\n\n\"Gandhi has treated and discharged over 5,000 COVID-19 patients but a few negative videos have got more eyeballs than the videos of positive reviews about the hospital,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nTherefore, the viral video showed hospital staff sitting on the floor and not the COVID-19 patients.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Uttar Pradesh: Hospital Sealed, License Revoked In Meerut For Offering Fake COVID Negative Report For Rs 2,500", "lang": "en"}
