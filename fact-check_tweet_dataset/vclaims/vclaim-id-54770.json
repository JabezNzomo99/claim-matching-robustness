Dan Patrick raised some eyebrows in March 2020 when he seemingly suggested during an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d that exposing vulnerable, older members of the U.S. population to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic was a reasonable trade-off for getting the U.S. \u201cback to work\u201d and \u201cback to living\u201d:\n\nTexas\u2019 lieutenant governor said that the U.S. should get back to work in the face of the global pandemic and that people over the age of 70, who the Centers for Disease Control says are at higher risk for the coronavirus, will \u201ctake care of ourselves.\u201d Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the comments while appearing on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d Patrick, 69, went on the program after President Donald Trump said that he wanted the country getting back to business in weeks, not months. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to work. Let\u2019s get back to living. Let\u2019s be smart about it,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAnd those of us who are 70 plus, we\u2019ll take care of ourselves. But don\u2019t sacrifice the country.\u201d\n\nPatrick raised even more eyebrows the following month when, according to social media postings, he declared (in reference to the lockdowns prompted by the COVID-19 outbreak) that \u201cthere are more important things than living\u201d:\n\nIndeed, on April 20, 2020, Patrick again appeared as a guest on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and echoed his earlier remarks on that program in questioning whether the threat posed by the coronavirus disease was exaggerated and worth the trade-off of shutting down businesses for a prolonged period of time:\n\nAt the end of January, Dr. Fauci, who I have great respect for, said this wasn\u2019t a big issue. Three weeks later, we were gonna lose two million people. Another few weeks later, it was one- to two-hundred thousand. Now it\u2019s under 60,000, and we\u2019ve had the wrong numbers, the wrong science. And I don\u2019t blame them, but let\u2019s face [the] reality of where we are. In Texas, we have 29 million people, [and] we\u2019ve lost 495. Every life is valuable, but 500 people out of 29 million and we\u2019re locked down. And we\u2019re crushing the average worker, we\u2019re crushing small business, we\u2019re crushing the markets, we\u2019re crushing this country. And what I said when I was with you that night, there are more important things than living, and that\u2019s saving this country for my children, and my grandchildren, and saving this country for all of us. And I don\u2019t wanna die. Nobody wants to die. But we gotta take some risks, and get back in the game, and get this country back up and running.\n\nAs NBC News reported of Patrick\u2019s controversial remarks, he is not alone in expressing the viewpoint that the importance of maintaining a functioning economy outweighed the dangers posed by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nThe Texas Democratic Party said in a statement that Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott would put Texans at risk to enrich business interests. \u201cThey would see our family members die to bail out Wall Street,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe lives of our families, our friends, and our communities have no dollar amount. Texas Republicans can no longer claim to be the pro-life party anymore.\u201d Other prominent voices have echoed Patrick\u2019s comments. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., said that deaths due to the coronavirus were \u201cthe lesser of these two evils\u201d compared to a failing economy. Economist Stephen Moore, who has served as an adviser to President Donald Trump, told CBS News that the economy must reopen soon. Moore said the effort to save every life by shutting down business was unwittingly \u201ccausing huge hardship for citizens.\u201d\n\nCritics of that viewpoint maintained that the COVID-19 mortality figures had been relatively low precisely because of the social-distancing and lockdown measures put into effect, and that loosening those restrictions to allow closed-down businesses to start operating again would risk producing a significant increase in the number of coronavirus deaths.", "lang": "en"}
