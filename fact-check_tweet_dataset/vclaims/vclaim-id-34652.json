The viral post has three images and a story written to it. One of the photos shows a woman with an abnormally swollen belly, and the other two show many babies the third one features a man too.\n\nThe post, put up by Facebook user Richard Camarinta Dy, says that one Catherine Bridge holds the World Record for delivering the most babies in one pregnancy.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the whole story is cooked up. The viral post was created from a fictional article written by World News Daily Report, a satirical website.\n\nThe viral post was shared by Richard Camarinta Dy on May 30. It has already been shared by more than 33,000 users at the time of filing this story.\n\n\n\nIn the post, Richard Camarinta Dy also shared the article link from a website called Women Daily Magazine, which describes the same story.\n\n\n\nBut it is clearly mentioned in the article that the viral story is fictional, taken from another article in a website called World News Daily Report\u2019.\n\n\n\nWorld News Daily Report is a satirical fake news website which publishes cooked-up stories for fun.\n\nWe also found that the pictures attached with the viral post are misleading. The one in which the pregnant lady can be seen with a swollen belly is morphed.\n\nAnother photo which shows a man with more than 17 babies is at least seven years old. The man in the photo is US-based obstetrician and gynecologist Robert M Biter who used this image as the cover photo on his Facebook profile.\n\nWe did find some media reports according to which there was one case in USA in which a woman gave birth to eight children in a single pregnancy.\n\nIndia Today couldn\u2019t find any incident in which a lady delivered 17 children in a single pregnancy.\n\nOther fact check portals such as Snopes and HOAX OR FACT also debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
