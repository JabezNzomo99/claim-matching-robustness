In summary, most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d could be had either if we remained in EU, or if we left\u2014but the claims are broadly accurate as descriptions of the EU status quo.\n\nOf the issues raised in the claims, the greatest degree of immigration control is only available by leaving, while tariff free trade with the EU and the ability to veto various EU decisions could only be guaranteed by remaining. (Though we might be able to leave the EU and keep tariff free trade, that outcome depends on negotiations with the EU.)\n\nOne claim about the UK\u2019s rebate on EU budget contributions is uncertain, as the EU has signalled its intention to end such rebates.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to keep control [of] our borders (stay out of the Schengen agreement on free movement)\u201d\n\nThis depends on how you interpret \u201ccontrol of our borders\u201d. Ultimately both leaving and remaining allows the UK to carry out border checks on people, but only leaving the EU allows the UK to set limits on EU migration.\n\nThe government has said it will end free movement of people from the EU and set its own immigration policy, with no preferential access for EU citizens after 2020.\n\nStaying in the EU would means we can do border checks on who is coming into the country. But EU law means we couldn\u2019t stop EU citizens coming to the UK if they met certain conditions and so couldn\u2019t, for example, set a cap on EU immigration.\n\nWhile the UK remains in the EU, citizens from other EU countries can travel to and live in the UK if they meet various obligations which vary depending on how long they stay.\n\nUnlike most other EU member states\u2014and some countries outside the EU\u2014the UK is not part of the Schengen passport-free area because it hasn\u2019t signed the Schengen agreement.\n\nPart of the Schengen agreement means the 26 signatories agree to not carry out border checks between each other. For example, you can drive from France to Belgium with no checks, because the assumption is that Belgium is happy to let in anyone that France was also happy to let in.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case with the UK. If you travel from France to the UK or vice-versa, your passport will be checked. The only exception is Ireland with whom the UK maintains a separate Common Travel Area allowing check-free movement of people between the two countries.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to send people from other countries home if they can\u2019t support themselves\u201d\n\nFor stays in the UK of over three months, EU citizens and their family members \u201cif not working \u2014 must have sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that they do not become a burden on the social services of the host Member State during their stay.\u201d\n\nThe EU says that host countries can ask EU residents to leave after six months of residence, if they haven\u2019t found a job and cannot prove they have a realistic chance of finding work in their host country.\n\nSo remaining in the EU would allow us to send migrants home who could not support themselves. Leaving would grant the UK government control over the immigration policy agenda, meaning it could choose to continue these arrangements, or develop another policy.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to stay out of the Euro\u201d\n\nThis is correct. The Treaty of the EU states that the UK is under no obligation to join the Euro, although obviously this would also be the case if we leave the EU.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to prevent Turkey joining the EU\u201d\n\nAccepting new members into the EU requires the agreement of all EU countries. That means it\u2019s correct to say the UK could prevent Turkey from joining the EU, as it has a veto. If we leave the EU, we naturally don\u2019t have that veto.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to stop the creation of a European army\u201d\n\nIf the UK stayed in the EU it would be able to veto the creation of an EU \u201carmy\u201d.\n\nEU member countries work together on military matters, but the EU doesn't have its own military capabilities currently.\n\nThe EU can\u2019t propose laws about security and defence. And it can\u2019t implement common defence policies, like the creation on an EU army, unless all EU members unanimously approve. This effectively gives the UK a veto on any EU defence policies.\n\nUK law also states that no such common EU defence powers can be handed from the UK to the EU without the approval of parliament and a referendum on the decision.\n\nIf we leave the EU, naturally we won\u2019t have any direct say over whether the EU enhances its military cooperation or creates an \u201cEU army\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to vote on our laws. And a court to make sure that British people and businesses are fairly treated\u201d\n\nWe elect the people who pass our laws, and this will be the case whether or not we leave the EU. What varies is who British people elect to pass laws and how they are represented in court. UK law is voted on by MPs and members of devolved administrations like the Scottish parliament. We elect these people directly.\n\nEU law is voted on by Members of the European Parliament (whom we vote for directly) and national government ministers at the EU Council. Although of course the citizens of the other EU countries also vote to elect their respective MEPs and ministers who have an influence on the EU law that the UK must follow.\n\nCurrently, as a member of the EU, people in the UK are bound by EU law and UK law, with EU law taking supremacy in cases where it might conflict with national law.\n\nLeaving the EU will mean that the UK is no longer bound by new EU laws, although we will transfer over most existing EU laws into UK law and this will come into effect on 29 March 2019. We\u2019ve written more about how EU laws work here.\n\nIn terms of courts, most legal cases are heard in UK courts, but some cases that relate to EU law can be heard in the Court of Justice of the European Union (which is the highest court on matters of EU law).\n\nAs leaving the EU would mean that the UK is no longer bound by EU law, the few cases that currently end up in European courts would be dealt with in British courts (after the end of the transition period).\n\nOne exception is on matters of EU citizens\u2019 rights in the UK. Under the current proposed Withdrawal Agreement, these cases can be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a period of eight years after the end of the transition period.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to vote on how the government spends our money\u201d\n\nWhether we leave or remain in the EU, we will still elect the representatives that decide how public money is spent.\n\nCurrently, UK taxpayer money is spent by the UK government, devolved administrations in the UK, and the EU.\n\nAt the UK level we elect MPs, members of devolved administrations and councillors.\n\nAt EU level, we vote for MEPs to represent us, and a UK government minister also has the power to veto some laws, as part of the EU council.\n\nAs a result of Brexit, we will stop paying into the EU budget after 2020, although some UK taxpayer money will be sent to the EU after this date, mainly in order to pay outstanding pension liabilities.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] for our business to buy and sell across Europe without customs checks and tariffs\u201d\n\nBeing in the EU means being in the single market and customs union. That means businesses and individuals can trade within the EU without any customs checks and tariffs in place.\n\nFollowing Brexit these aspects of UK-EU trade will be determined by a future trade relationship, which may or may not include tariff-free trade with Europe.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU allows us] to have ample supplies of fresh food and medicines\u201d\n\nIf we stay in the EU, then there\u2019s no reason to expect our supplies of medicine or food would be affected.\n\nIf we leave the EU, especially with no deal, concerns have been raised about the stability of supply, but it\u2019s difficult to be sure how severe any such problems could be.\n\nRegarding medicines, the government has said it would continue to recognise medicines that have already been approved by the EU after no deal so they can still be supplied in the UK.\n\nThere are concerns about the risks of short-term disruptions to the supply if there are delays at the border. The government has said it has plans to stockpile six weeks\u2019 worth of medicines (on top of normal stocks) in the event of no deal.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about what might happen to medicines and drinking water here.\n\n\u201c[Staying in the EU gives us the right] to have 1/3 reduction in the fee we pay for all these things\"\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the post\u2019s author what this refers to, but haven\u2019t received a reply yet.\n\nWe suspect that it\u2019s talking about the fact that the UK gets a rebate on its contributions to the EU budget.\n\nOver the period 2013-2017, without the rebate we would have paid around \u00a392 billion into the EU budget, but the rebate of \u00a323 billion means we got a discount of 24%. On top of this the EU spends some of the budget on public and private sector projects in the UK.\n\nHowever, the EU has signalled that it proposes to scrap rebates (for all EU countries that receive one) over the next decade, so it\u2019s far from guaranteed that we\u2019d keep our rebate if we remained in the EU.", "lang": "en"}
