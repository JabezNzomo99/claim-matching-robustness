He said in his administration, every American will receive a pony. He also plans to defeat ISIS by going back in time.\" It seems legitimate, but thought it should be added to your list.\n\nA performance artist named Vermin Supreme claimed he planned to run for President in 2016 on a platform of free ponies for all; Vermin Supreme is a performance artist who utilizes local elections as part of his repertoire.\n\nThe above-reproduced meme, which has been circulating on social media for an indeterminate amount of time, showed a man wearing two ties and a boot on his head. It maintained:\n\nOn 24 November 2015, the web site deathandtaxes published an article titled \u201cVermin Supreme running for president, still wants to give everyone a pony\u201d; that item subsequently explained the \u201ccandidate\u201d was no newcomer to politics and had been engaging in acts of political art and protest since the 1980s:\n\nPerennial political candidate Vermin Supreme filed papers on Friday to run for the presidential primary in New Hampshire. In a field that includes 30 Republicans and 28 Democrats, the Maryland Democrat stands out for his unique headgear, lush, wizard-like beard, and consistently pro-pony platform. Asked about how he\u2019d defeat terrorists, he answered \u201cHooves on the ground and boots on our heads!\u201d Political Monitor reports that Mr. Supreme paid his $1,000 registration fee in $50 bills marked \u201cnot to be used for bribing politicians.\u201d Of course, this ain\u2019t his first rodeo; this will be the protest candidate\u2019s seventh run for president of these United States, and he\u2019s been using absurdist humor to agitate against bourgeois democracy and stir up protest votes since the 1980s. But with \u201cserious\u201d candidates for president like Ben Carson and Donald Trump getting more outlandish by the day, the Vermin message seems more relevant than ever.\n\nAn ABC.net.au article titled \u201cVermin Supreme 2016: Alternative US presidential candidate promises free ponies for all\u201d reported that the \u201cbearded eccentric \u2026 regularly sports a boot on his head\u201d and \u201chas been running for public office since 1987\u201d:\n\nA well-known performance artist and activist has declared he will run as a US presidential candidate on a free pony platform. Vermin Supreme filed his paperwork for the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot on the last day before applications closed, along with the registration fee of $US1,000 \u2014 which he paid in $50 bills marked \u201cnot to be used for bribing politicians\u201d. \u201cThe pony-based economy is truly the most important issue in America today. Fossil fuels are literally killing the planet, and today, we stop that,\u201d he told the crowd gathered for his filing. \u201cWe don\u2019t need no more cars, we have ponies.\u201d\n\nThe approximate date on which the above-reproduced meme was created was unclear, but the image in question appeared no later than May 2012, and was unrelated to Vermin Supreme\u2019s November 2015 filings. A 21 January 2016 CNN piece titled \u201cThe presidential candidates you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d reported that Supreme\u2019s earlier campaigns were thwarted by a ban relating to \u201cproperty damage\u201d during a 2011 debate:\n\nAt the last lesser-known candidate debate in 2011, he stood up and poured glitter over the head of one of his competitors in order to, in his words, \u201cmake him gay.\u201d Supreme was barred from the forum this year for \u201cproperty damage\u201d and relegated to a zone surrounded by police tape outside the debate hall, where he stood with two toy ponies, a campaign sign painted onto a boogie board and a giant boot on his head.\n\nA 2012 item from CNN described Supreme\u2019s 28 August 2012 appearance outside the Republican National Convention in Tampa:\n\nThe gray-bearded hippie standing between them wore a boot on his head. \u201cBetween the cops and the protesters, there\u2019s a vacuum. That\u2019s the space I occupy,\u201d Vermin Supreme explained afterward. \u201cIt looked a little scary. It looked like it might get tense.\u201d\n\n The self-described \u201cfriendly fascist,\u201d who is a perennial presidential candidate and veteran of countless protests, recited passages from police manuals on crowd control tactics. Using the bullhorn, he urged calm: \u201cNobody needs to get hurt here.\u201d A man next to him started to warble \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d and Vermin Supreme felt soothed. He held the bullhorn close to the singer, letting the melody wash over the crowd of about 150. The tension melted away. It was, he said, \u201ca beautiful moment.\u201d\n\nSo while it\u2019s true Vermin Supreme has been throwing his hat (or boot) into the ring electorally since roughly 1987, his forays were never intended to be serious campaigns. Supreme is a performance artist, and political events are a common medium through which he performs.", "lang": "en"}
