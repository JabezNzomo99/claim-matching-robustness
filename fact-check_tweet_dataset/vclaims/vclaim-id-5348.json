No, that's not true, the story was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site that invents tales of bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on July 21, 2018 titled \"Woman Who Hasn't Had Sex In 120 Days Purposely Crashes Car Just To Feel Choked Again\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nALABAMA - Myliana Mendez purposely crashed her Honda Accord into a neighbors fence so her seat belt would choke her she claims she missed the feeling of being choked during sex. People outside the scene said she was screaming \"it has been over 120 days\" to the local PD.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have believed they saw a real news report:\n\nBut the woman pictured in the illustration with the story is actually Lauren Davis, a woman from Livermore, California who was charged in a double-fatal DUI crash:\n\nThe phone number listed at the end of the article (1-866-219-7490) that people can supposedly call if their friends suffer from lack of sex is actually the toll-free number for American Addiction Centers (https://americanaddictioncenters.org/).\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Tranquilizing And Raping Alligators In Everglades\n\u2022 Fake News: McDonald's Manager Did NOT Shoot Man For Putting Soda In His Free Water Cup\n\u2022 Fake News: White Woman Did NOT Call Cops On Innocent Man Selling Crack Cocaine Outside Her Apartment\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Alabama Man In Custody After Promising Kids V-Bucks, Did NOT Sexually Abuse Them\n\u2022 Fake News: Germany NOT Discussing Nuking South Korea After Being Eliminated From FIFA World Cup", "lang": "en"}
