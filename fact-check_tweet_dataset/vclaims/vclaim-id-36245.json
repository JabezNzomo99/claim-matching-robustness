The BJP lost just two seats by a margin of less than 2000 votes.Using keyword \u2018Delhi elections margin\u2019 on Google search, we found a news report by Hindustan Times titled \u201813 seats that saw the closest contests in Delhi assembly election\u2019. The report claims that there were only 13 constituencies where victory margins ranged from below 7,000 votes.Out of these 13 constituencies, BJP lost two seats namely Bijwasan and Adarsh Nagar to AAP by a margin of less than 2000 votes.AAP\u2019s Bhupinder Singh Joon from Bijwasan, a fresh face and a lawyer who replaced the party's disqualified MLA Devender Sehrawat, defeated the BJP\u2019s Sat Prakash Rana by only 753 votes.AAP\u2019s Pawan Sharma form Adarsh Nagar, another fresh face, defeated BJP\u2019s Raj Kumar Bhatia by 1,589 votes.Looking up on the official website of the Election Commission of India, we confirmed that only these two seats were lost by BJP to AAP by a margin of less than 2000 votes.This proves that the lowest margin for loss in Delhi was 753 votes, so question of BJP losing even a single seat by less than 100 votes doesn't arise.Times Fact Check has found the claims of BJP losing 8 seats in Delhi assembly elections by margin of less than 100 votes to be false.", "lang": "en"}
