This is false: the institute which Raoult directs denied he ever made these claims; moreover, no vaccine yet exists against coronavirus.\n\n\u201cUrgent. Didier Raoult calls on Africans not to take Bill Gates vaccine to fight Corona virus\u201d [sic]. This message was shared thousands of times on Facebook across Africa, mainly in French but also in an English translation.\n\nThe post refers to Dr Didier Raoult, a French infectious disease specialist who has recently made headlines for recommending treating COVID-19 \u2014 the disease caused by coronavirus \u2014 with a derivative of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine.\n\nThis poorly-written Facebook message claims that Raoult called on Africans \u201cnot to take the vaccine that will soon be sold against the Corono virus as it contains poison (sic)\u201d and goes on to claim that \u201cthe West wants to destroy Africa disguised under the Corono virus [sic]\u201d.\n\nThe message claims that Raoult said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they start their vaccine in Italy, Spain or France, where there are a lot of cases? Why do they want to start in Africa where there are fewer cases? I call on African leaders to caution, the only vaccine and antidote to fight the Corono virus is chloroquine (sic).\u201d\n\nThe misleading Facebook post ends with a plea: \u201cI want this message shared to all of Africa. \u201d The comments left by Facebook users show that some, though not all, believed the post\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty will punish who ever that has EVIL plans in Africa (sic),\u201d reads one comment.\n\nWith more than 11,000 cases and 572 deaths by April 9, numbers in Africa remain low compared to Europe, which at the same time has seen confirmed cases top 772,000, with more than 61,000 deaths.\n\nWorld Health Organization\u2019s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti, warned that the spread of the virus is undergoing a \u201cdramatic evolution\u201d.\n\nMediterranee Infection Institute, a research centre based in Marseille, France, and directed by Raoult, denied the claims.\n\nA spokesman for the institute told AFP that \u201cProfessor Didier Raoult did not say this; it\u2019s a false quote\u201d.\n\nOn March 28, 2020, Raoult published a study concerning the benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine-based treatments \u2014 commonly used to treat malaria \u2014 against COVID-19.\n\nAccording to Raoult and his team, 80% of the 80 patients involved in the study saw \u201cpositive developments\u201d. This study followed an initial one conducted on 24 patients.\n\nBoth studies faced the same criticism: they did not involve a control group, meaning a group of infected patients who are not given the treatment.\n\nFrance\u2019s National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products warned about the serious side effects caused by drugs tested against COVID-19 (including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and reminded the public not to self-medicate \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d.\n\nIn the United States, President Donald Trump expressed high hopes for a chloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19 and claimed the treatment \u201cto be one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d. He added it would be a \u201cgift from heaven if it works\u201d.\n\nHowever, the claims made in the Facebook posts are false. Chloroquine is not being tested as a vaccine but rather as a treatment for patients who contracted COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe are still very far from having a working vaccine\u201d\n\nThere are no treatments against COVID-19 that have yet been approved by leading health bodies, nor does any vaccine exist. Dr Richard Mihigo, Program Area Manager at WHO Immunization and Vaccines Development, told AFP on March 30 that \u201csadly, we are still very far from having a working vaccine\u201d.\n\nThe development and approval of such a vaccine are not expected until next year at the earliest.\n\n\u201cAs with all new diseases, the scientific community is mobilised in finding a vaccine against this pandemic. So far, the research is still preliminary. While we have several candidates in preclinical stages, developing, testing and approving a vaccine can take several years,\u201d Mihigo said.\n\n\u201cThere are several types of candidates for the preclinical phase, of which two will move on to phase 1: one to be developed by the Moderna laboratory in the U.S., and one in China (CanSinoBIO).\u201d\n\nUS pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson also announced on March 30, 2020, that it has chosen a potential vaccine to test on humans by September and that it may be used for emergency cases before the end of the year.\n\nMihigo stressed that no vaccine test nor campaign was planned for the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen these claims flourish on social networks, but there is no truth to them,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, we\u2019ve already seen this in the past, and sharing misleading information does more harm to people than good. Our collective effort should focus on minimising the effects of coronavirus on the population rather than misinforming the public, which could lead to unnecessary panic.\u201d\n\nThe misleading post also claims that US billionaire Bill Gates is behind a \u201cvaccine\u201d against coronavirus that will \u201csoon be sold\u201d.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced they would invest 100 million dollars in the fight against coronavirus. But no vaccine has yet been created.\n\nIn an interview given to the website Reddit, Gates expressed doubts that a vaccine would be available for another 18 months. A transcript of this interview was also published on Gates\u2019 website Gatesnotes.\n\nHe said that \u201ca therapeutic could be available well before a vaccine\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will need literally billions of vaccines to protect the world. Vaccines require testing to make sure they are safe and effective,\u201d stressed Gates.\n\n\u201cThe first vaccines we get will go to health care workers and critical workers,\u201d Gates continued. \u201cThis could happen before 18 months if everything goes well but we and ... others are being careful not to promise this when we are not sure. The work is going at full speed.\u201d\n\nSince December 2019, when the outbreak began in China, 1.5 million people have been infected with COVID-19 globally and more than 87,300 have died.", "lang": "en"}
