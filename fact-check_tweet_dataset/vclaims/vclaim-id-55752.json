It is being claimed that she threw her children because they had no food to eat during the current lockdown. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A woman in UP threw her five children into the river as they had no food to eat during the current lockdown. Fact: While it is true that a woman in UP had thrown her five children into the river, it is not due to the unavailability of food. The Bhadohi Police has clarified that the woman took such a drastic step after she quarrelled with her husband, not because of hunger. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe news \u2013 \u2018No food during lockdown, mother throws 5 children into river\u2019 was first published by \u2018IANS\u2019 (archived), which was later carried by other news agencies like \u2018Outlook\u2019 (archived), \u2018Business Insider\u2019 (archived) and India TV (archived) \n\n\n\nAlso, multiple people on social media [Prashant Bhushan (archived), Ashok Swain (archived), Rohan Gupta (archived). Brijesh Kalappa (archived) and Saba Naqvi (archived)] have tweeted the Outlook article with the same claim.\n\nWhen we searched for more information on the incident, it was found that the Bhadohi Police has rubbished the false claim and clarified that the incident is not related to hunger. The woman threw her children due to a fight with her husband and out of mental stress.\n\nThe Bhadohi Police has also tweeted the woman\u2019s video, where she mentions the fight with her husband.\n\nThe Bhadohi Police, in response to a tweet about the authenticity of the confession by the woman in police custody, has tweeted images of the food items present in the woman\u2019s house.\n\nIn order to check the authenticity of the claims made by the Bhadohi Police, with the available details of the children and the woman, when FACTLY looked for the ration details of the family on the Uttar Pradesh\u2019s NFSA website, it was found that the family has taken a ration of 14 kg rice and 21 kg wheat on 08 March 2020 as per the NFSA norms.\n\nTo sum it up, fight with the husband, not hunger, is the reason behind UP woman throwing her five children in the river.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
