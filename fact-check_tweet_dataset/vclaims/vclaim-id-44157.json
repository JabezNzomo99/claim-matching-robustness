In December 2019, Forbes named him the highest paid athlete of the decade, with an estimated $915 million in earnings.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,100 times, masquerades as a giveaway from Mayweather. It features a short video of the former boxer holding stacks of $100 bills as he talks about counting the money. (He does not mention giveaways at any point in the video.)\n\n\u201cHello Every Body, I will randomly select people on Facebook, everyone who shares will receive a gift card, cash, and a big winner can win a car,\u201d the Facebook post\u2019s caption states. \u201cI will choose 500 lucky people.\u201d\n\nA closer inspection of the account reveals it is not affiliated with Mayweather. It has the wrong name \u2013 Floyd Mayweather Jr TMT rather than Floyd Mayweather \u2013 and lacks a blue verification check mark. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Ellen DeGeneres Is Giving Away $5,000 To 100 People Who Like And Comment On It)\n\nSearching Mayweather\u2019s verified social media pages and websites turned up no similar contests. Nor have media outlets reported on Mayweather holding such a giveaway. The post appears to be a scam.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the former professional boxer has been the target of a social media scam. In 2015, the fact-checking website Snopes debunked a Facebook post claiming Mayweather would give away $2.6 million to a fan.", "lang": "en"}
