More than half of those disputes relate to Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, 17 disputes is double the average number of annual filings over the past 15 years. The last time there were so many cases against the U.S. was back in 2002. Not coincidentally, that was when President George W. Bush\u2019s steel policies were widely attacked.\n\nIn addition to being sued so often, Trump worries that the U.S. loses a disproportionate number of cases.\n\nHence, the now frequently heard claim that the United States is being unfairly punished under international trade law.\n\nThe White House is right about two things.\n\nFirst, it is true that the United States is sued more often than any other WTO member. Since it was set up in 1995, members have filed 150 complaints targeting U.S. policies, that\u2019s 78 percent more than there have been against the European Union and more than triple those against China. In fact, those 150 cases account for over 25 percent of all WTO disputes.\n\nSecond, it is also true that the United States lost the vast majority of those cases. Only about half of all WTO disputes end with a formal ruling. The other half are settled or linger for years in the initial consultation stage of the dispute process. Among those with a verdict, the U.S. lost entirely or in part 87 percent of the cases against it.\n\nAt first glance, that looks like strong support for Trump\u2019s argument. But do these two facts really mean the deck is stacked against the U.S.?\n\nNot once we put the numbers into context.\n\nWhere Trump gets it wrong\n\nTo begin with, it\u2019s worth considering why the U.S. gets sued in the first place.\n\nPart of the explanation is simple: the U.S. hasn\u2019t been shy about protecting its domestic industries, deploying a wide variety of policies to insulate them from foreign competition.\n\nSome of these are highly controversial. For example, the U.S. is a world leader in the use of anti-dumping, a form of duty applied to foreign goods sold below normal market prices.\n\nIn order to use anti-dumping legally, countries have to demonstrate material harm to their domestic industries. Naturally, proving that dumping has occurred is open to some debate.\n\nHence, there have been 126 individual disputes over this policy, accounting for almost 25 percent of the WTO\u2019s entire case load. This includes the U.S., which has been sued more than 50 times for its use of anti-dumping duties alone.\n\nThus, relying on controversial policies at home exposes the U.S. to trade litigation abroad.\n\nYes, the U.S. loses nearly 90 percent of panel rulings. But the fact is that every respondent almost always loses to the tune of at least a comparable 90 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the plain realities of WTO dispute settlement. If a country gets sued, and that case ends up before a panel, the respondent will likely lose. That\u2019s true of the U.S., the EU, China or anyone else. That\u2019s partly because litigation isn\u2019t free. Complainants are more likely to file, and proceed to a ruling, when there\u2019s high confidence of winning. Otherwise it isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nIn sum, the numbers simply don\u2019t support the argument that the U.S. is targeted without cause or that it is treated unfairly. Insistence in Washington on using contentious trade policies increases the rate of filings against the U.S. And, while the America loses a lot, it doesn\u2019t lose any more often than the membership at large.\n\nNone of this is to say that the system is perfect.\n\nLegitimate grounds for disagreement have created calls for reform. Downstream compliance remains a problem across its 160-plus members. And efforts by the U.S. or others to reform the system \u2013 such as to the appeals process to reduce lengthy delays and judicial overreach \u2013 have gone nowhere.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. has blocked all appointments of appellate judges since Trump took office, reducing the total number from seven to three, which could potentially paralyze the body\u2019s ability to work.\n\nThis is bad news for the system. The majority of panel rulings are appealed, and the process cannot function without a consensus over judge appointments.\n\nIn spite of the system\u2019s flaws, the WTO has benefits beyond trade promotion. Having a rules-based system is also important for limiting the kind of trade discrimination the White House frequently alleges.\n\nYet, Trump continues to talk like the WTO is a one-way street. He seems to forget that the U.S. isn\u2019t just the most frequent respondent. It\u2019s also the most frequent complainant.\n\nA political compromise over the appeals process is needed to ensure the WTO functions efficiently. But withdrawing from the agreement, and giving up America\u2019s seat at the table, isn\u2019t going to do much to protect U.S. interests \u2013 as we have seen in other areas of international law.", "lang": "en"}
