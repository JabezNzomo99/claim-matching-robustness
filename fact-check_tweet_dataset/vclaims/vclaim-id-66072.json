Greg Abbott.\n\nStraus elaborated: \"School districts are expected to send away $2 billion through Robin Hood in the upcoming year. One district alone -- Austin ISD -- is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year.\"\n\nStraus was referring to the Robin Hood or \"recapture\" facet of state law designed for equalization purposes so districts with rich tax bases share revenue with less property-wealthy districts. In July 2017, before Straus made his claim, the Texas Education Agency said that some $2 billion all told would be redistributed via the share-the-wealth mechanism in 2017-18.\n\nIn 2016, we found True a claim by Travis County state Sen. Kirk Watson that in Austin, \"the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture.\" That fact-check said the district for 2016-17 would be forwarding more than $400 million for schools elsewhere.\n\nAsked how Straus reached the larger $530-million figure, a Straus spokesman, Jason Embry, said by email that Straus relied on a June 19, 2017, Austin American-Statesman news story about the Austin district\u2019s board of trustees approving a nearly $1.5 billion budget for 2017-18.\n\nThe story said the district\u2019s recapture payment \"this year is expected to be $534 million, an increase of 32 percent, or $127.8 million, over 2016-17.\" It quoted Nicole Conley, the district\u2019s chief financial officer, saying the district expects to pay more than $1 billion in recapture payments \"during the next two years.\"\n\nWhen we reached out to the district, spokeswoman Cristina Nguyen specified that according to calculations taking into account expected student enrollment and tax collections, Austin\u2019s estimated payments would total $533,874,730 for the 2017-18 school year. She emailed us the district\u2019s calculations, viewable here.\n\nAnother district spokeswoman, Tiffany Young, sent an email pointing out a May 2017 district chart suggesting its recapture payments could top $800 million by the 2020-21 school year:\n\nSOURCE: Document, \"FY2018 Recommended Budget,\" Austin Independent School District, May 2017 (web link received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, July 17, 2017)\n\nWe also asked the Texas Education Agency how much the Austin district will be expected to forward in \"recapture\" money in 2017-18. By email, Lauren Callahan guided us to an agency estimate, last updated June 21, 2017, of $513,633,317.\n\nThat\u2019s $20 million less than the district\u2019s announced estimate. But Callahan also cautioned that the state figure is preliminary and likely to increase depending on the district\u2019s tax rate. Callahan wrote: \"We use different estimates of local property tax collections as well as different estimates of student counts, both of which affect the estimate of recapture. Our numbers tie together when all final data is reconciled.\"\n\nStraus said the Austin district \"is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year.\"\n\nAs of May 2017, the Austin district estimated that in 2017-18 it would flow nearly $534 million in local property tax revenue through the state\u2019s school finance system, nicknamed Robin Hood, to help equalize school funding across the state.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
