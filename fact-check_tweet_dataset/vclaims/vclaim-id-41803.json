But he has been making a version of the claim for more than a week. (We\u2019re not the first to point out he\u2019s wrong.)\n\nAs of the afternoon of April 29, the U.S had done almost 6.03 million tests for the disease, according to data collected by Worldometer, a widely cited data aggregation website. (The website\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page says it is run by an \u201cinternational team of developers, researchers, and volunteers\u201d and \u201cpublished by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States.\u201d)\n\nThe U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done \u2014 but not more than all other countries combined.\n\nAdding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy \u2014 the next three countries that have done the most testing \u2014 would produce a higher figure (about 7.29 million) than the U.S. total. And, overall, there have been nearly 25 million tests performed by the 172 non-U.S. countries for which Worldometer has data.\n\nSo, Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to being accurate.\n\nWe would also note \u2014 as we have before \u2014 that the U.S. trails many countries in terms of testing on a per-capita basis, according to multiple sources.\n\nWorldometer, for example, shows the U.S. doing 18,216 tests per 1 million people, as of April 29. But that was a lower figure than those of 41 other countries.\n\nThat is something else to consider when the president boasts that the U.S. \u2014 which is the third most populous country \u2014 has done a lot more testing than any other nation.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
