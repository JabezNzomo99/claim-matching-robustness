The alleged statement continues, \u201cPeople are starting to recognize that the reason they feel like they\u2019re mentally ill is that they\u2019re living in a system that\u2019s not designed to suit the human spirit.\u201d\n\nHowever, Carrey did not say the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Marleah Leslie, the actor\u2019s publicist, confirmed as much in an email to the Daily Caller, adding, \u201cThe quote is actually from Russell Brand from a BBC article.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Brand made the statement during a 2017 BBC interview while discussing the topics of mental health and addiction. At the time, he was promoting his book \u201cRecovery: Freedom From Our Addiction,\u201d which was released in October of that year.", "lang": "en"}
