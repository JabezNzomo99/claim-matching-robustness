A distasteful song is playing in the background.\n\nWhile tweeting the video one Zoya said, \u201c\u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0947?#\u091f\u0940\u0935\u0940_\u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928\u093e_\u092c\u0902\u0926_\u0915\u0930\u094b (Who is this?

Zoya\u2019s tweet had garnered close to 2,400 retweets. The tweet has now been deleted. The trend was a criticism of television media\u2019s coverage of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe same video was posted on Facebook and Twitter with messages abusing the anchor.\n\nWith a time search on Twitter, Alt News found the video posted by the official handle of Rubika Liyaquat in 2018. The original clip has been edited to add a distasteful song in the background. Liyaquat had posted the video on November 7, 2018, terming it \u201cDiwali celebrations\u201d.\n\nIn the original clip, the anchor dances while singing happy Diwali. Hence, a slanderous attempt was made on social media to malign the anchor by superimposing a distasteful song over her video from Diwali celebrations.", "lang": "en"}
