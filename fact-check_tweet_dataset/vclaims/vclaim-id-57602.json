The video is neither recent nor from Spain. It is in fact from Baku in Azerbaijan where the police detained protesters in October 2019.\n\nA reverse search using one of the keyframes of the video directed us to multiple links from 2019 which suggested that the video is from Azerbaijan. Further, we noticed that the video carried a watermark of Toplum TV, which operates from Baku, Azerbaijan. Taking a cue from here we ran a Google keyword search using terms \u201cAzerbaijan Police detains protesters\u201d. This helped us find the video uploaded by BBC Azerbaijan on YouTube.\n\nWe were able to identify several frames that confirmed that the two videos are indeed from the same instance.\n\nAccording to the video, the incident occurred at Baku where the police detained 60 people during a rally at the National Council Centre on 19 October 2019. As per a report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, \u201cThe protest was organised by the National Council of Democratic Forces (NCDF), an umbrella group of Azerbaijani opposition groups, and was not authorised by the authorities.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
