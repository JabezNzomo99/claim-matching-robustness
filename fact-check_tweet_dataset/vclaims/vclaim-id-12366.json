A BJP leader from Rajasthan, Ritalba Solanki, was among those who made the assertion.\n\nSeveral individual users have shared an identical claim on Facebook. Some have also circulated other photographs of \u201cUrvisha Jariwala\u201d, including one where she can be seen in a fighter plane.\n\nA screenshot of the Facebook profile of \u201cUrvisha Jariwala\u201d has also been shared by some Facebook users.\n\nThese images are viral on WhatsApp as well.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\n1. Upon searching the keywords \u2013 \u201cUrvisha Jariwala Indian air force\u201d and \u201cUrvashi Jariwala Indian air force\u201d \u2013 Google did not throw up any results. Alt News reverse-searched the woman\u2019s image on Google and found that she is actually IAF pilot Sneha Shekhawat.\n\nAccording to a 2015 Times of Indiareport, \u201cSneha Shekhawat made history as the first woman pilot to lead an IAF contingent in the 63-year history of the Republic Day parades.\u201d\n\n2. We were also able to locate the second image \u2013 the one of the woman pilot on a fighter plane \u2013 on an NBC Newsarticle from 2014. The woman in the photograph is the first female fighter jet pilot of UAE, Al Mansouri.\n\n3. About the screenshot of the Facebook profile of \u201cUrvisha Jariwal\u201d, we found that an account by that name did exist but is now deactivated or deleted. A Google cache link still shows the profile \u2018Urvisha Jariwala (urvi)\u2019.\n\nBoomlivespoke to an unnamed source with the Indian air force who said the names of operatives involved in the airstrike have not been revealed due to confidentiality. \u201cWe have not released any names of any officers. In fact, there has been no official statement from the IAF except what the foreign secretary made. All such claims are rubbish,\u201d they told Boomlive.\n\nThe same claim of \u201cUrvisha Jariwala\u201d being the IAF pilot who led the attack on Jaish camps has also been circulated with the image attached below.\n\nUpon reverse-searching the photograph on Google, we found that the woman is Avani Chaturvedi, the first Indian woman pilot to fly fighter jet MiG-21 Bison.\n\nWe found one more photograph that was captioned as \u201cUrvisha Jariwala\u201d.\n\nHowever, the woman in the image is IAF fighter pilot Mohona Singh.\n\nThe aftermath of IAF\u2019s airstrike on Jaish camps in the early hours of February 26 saw a surge in misinformation circulated not only on social media (1, 2) but also on mainstream media.", "lang": "en"}
