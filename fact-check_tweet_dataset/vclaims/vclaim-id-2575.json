Students have to repay the loans anyway, regardless of whether they work for the NHS.\n\nThe estimate comes from the Department of Health. It\u2019s consulting on whether new doctors should have to spend a fixed term working in the NHS. Under the proposals, doctors who don\u2019t might have to pay \u201ca sum of money in addition to their loan repayments\u201d to reflect the cost of training them.\n\nSome outlets have reported the \u00a3230,000 figure as the taxpayer\u2019s investment in each doctor. That\u2019s misleading in this context, but it\u2019s easy to see why the mistake may have happened.\n\nHere\u2019s how the figure was quoted in the Department of Health\u2019s press release, which you can read for yourself here:\n\nJeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, used a similar figure in a similar context when he outlined the proposal at the Conservative party conference back in October:\n\nYou can watch the speech as it was delivered here. We\u2019ve asked the government if Jeremy Hunt was referring to the same estimates.\n\nThe government should make it explicit that these costs are not all borne by the taxpayer and that students are already obliged to \u201cpay back\u201d the part that comes in student loans, whether or not they go on to work for the NHS.\n\nThe government ultimately pays less than \u00a3230,000 to put a doctor through medical school\n\nThe \u00a3230,000 estimate can be broken down into approximately:\n\u2022 \u00a3163,000 paid in grants that the government won\u2019t get back. These either go directly to students, to healthcare providers to support clinical placements, or to universities to reflect the higher costs of delivering medical education.\n\u2022 Another \u00a364,300 comes in student loans. These are similar to loans for other kinds of university courses, covering tuition and living costs.\n\nGraduates have to repay their loans once they earn a certain amount, currently \u00a321,000 for new students. That applies to all university graduates, whether or not they work for the NHS.\n\nThe government expects to get back at least 75-80% of tuition fee and maintenance loans across all subjects, as a pessimistic estimate.\n\nGiven that, we expect the final cost to \u201cthe taxpayer\u201d is closer to \u00a3163,000 than \u00a3230,000.\n\nIncluding private funding, the total cost of training a doctor will be higher than \u00a3230,000\n\nThe Department of Health\u2019s estimate doesn\u2019t include any private funding that supports students through their degree, so it won\u2019t tell you the full cost of training a doctor to both individuals and the government.\n\nBefore the government published its estimates in March, the other set we could find came from the the Personal Social Services Research Unit.\n\nIts estimates for the annual cost of training doctors after medical school are published on page 202 of \u201cUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2016\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
