That means how many people choose to participate in the work force. In other words, the nonpartisan agency is examining whether the law increases or decreases incentives for people to work.\n\nOne big issue: the health insurance subsidies in the law. That\u2019s a substantial benefit that decreases as people earn more money, so at a certain point, a person has to choose between earning more money or continuing to get the maximum help with health insurance payments. In other words, people might work longer and harder, but actually earn no more, or earn even less, money. That is a disincentive to work. (The same thing happens when people qualify for food stamps or other social services.)\n\nThus, some people might decide to work part-time, not full time, in order to keep getting health-care subsidies. Thus, they are reducing their supply of labor to the market. Other people near retirement age might decide they no longer need to hold onto their job just because it provides health insurance, and they also leave the work force.\n\nLook at it this way: If someone says they decided to leave their job for personal reasons, most people would not say they \u201clost\u201d their jobs. They simply decided not to work.\n\n\u201cThe estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).\u201d\n\nThe CBO did look at the effect on demand for labor (i.e., jobs) but said the effects are mostly on the margins or are not measurable. In fact, in contrast to a common GOP talking point, the CBO declares that \u201cthere is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA,\u201d though it notes the data may be murky because the employer mandate was delayed until 2015.\n\nAdvocates of the Affordable Care Act should not jump to the conclusion that departing workers will be simply replaced by other workers. Assuming a \u201cnormal\u201d unemployment rate of five percent, employers\u2019 demand for jobs would equal 95 percent of the supply of workers. Fewer workers initially would lead to higher wages as employers competed to hire people. But over time, the nation ends up with a slightly smaller economy because of the smaller workforce.\n\nFinally, we should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers \u2014 a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers. (This is also off a base of more than 160 million people, meaning the number of fewer workers is a relatively small percentage of the overall pie.)\n\nIn fact, no one really knows what percentage will leave the work force entirely and what percentage will shift to part-time work, making it difficult to predict how this will shake out in the end.\n\nThe Fact Checker takes no position on the implications of the CBO\u2019s analysis. Some might believe that the overall impact of the health law on employment is bad because it would be encouraging people \u2014 some 2.3 million \u2014 not to work. Indeed, the decline in the workforce participation rate has been of concern to economists, as the baby boom generation leaves the work force, and the health-care law appears to exacerbate that trend.\n\nMoreover, the argument could go, this would hurt the nation\u2019s budget because 2.3 million fewer people will pay taxes on their earnings. That\u2019s certainly an intellectually solid argument \u2014 though others might counter that universal health care is worth a reduction in overall employment \u2014 but it\u2019s not at all the same as saying that all of these jobs would be lost. Some jobs will go away, but the actual number is unclear because of the unknown interaction between part-time and full-time work.", "lang": "en"}
