Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of that video. \n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe directed to the same video on YouTube. The video has the title \u201cMoke Dreal of Khunti Police\u201d and was found to be uploaded on November 1, 2017. \n\n\n\nWhen searched with keywords on YouTube, another video that was shot from a different angle was found. In the video, a red building with \u2018Jagdamba Steel\u2019 shop can be seen. When looked for it on Google maps, it was found to exist at Khunti in Jharkhand. Also, the surrounding buildings in the video matched with the buildings beside the \u2018Jagdamba steel\u2019 shop.\n\nOn observing the video, one can easily conclude that the video is a mock drill because:\n\n1. The crowd in the video can be seen standing relaxed on both sides of the road while the police are shooting.\n\n2. At various instances of the video, people can be spotted recording the event casually. \n\n3. In the video, people can be heard laughing and talking casually.\n\nTo conclude, a video of a mock drill by Jharkhand Police is falsely shared as Police firing on Muslims in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
