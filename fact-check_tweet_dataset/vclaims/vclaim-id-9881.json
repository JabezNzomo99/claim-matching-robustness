No, that was an April Fools' Day joke from a wrestling news website which is still going viral two days later.\n\nThe story appeared on April 1, 2018 on Wrestling News Source and was titled \"WWE Sold To Walt Disney Company For $5 Billion; Vince McMahon Confirms\" (archived here).

WWE Chairman Vince McMahon confirmed the sale of World Wrestling Entertainment to The Associated Press on Sunday. Vince McMahon will stay on to run the WWE, which has grown into a highly successful global entertainment brand over the last 30 years under his leadership. \"No other entertainment company compares to WWE,\" McMahon said in a statement that stated he would keep his current role. \"Our goal has always been to put on the biggest and the best sports entertainment for our fans and to make this one of the biggest entertainment brands in the world.

According to BuzzSumo the joke about Roman Reigns being pulled got only 9 likes on Facebook and about 75 shares on Twitter. The 2018 joke got over 85,000 engagements on Facebook so far and is still gaining hundreds more each hour even days after it was published.\n\nIt may have had something to do with how the message looked on social media: it all seems quite convincing and appears to be a regular news article:\n\nAs long as you don't look too closely at the date of course...", "lang": "en"}
