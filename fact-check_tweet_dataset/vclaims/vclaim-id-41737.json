She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated,\" reads one such report published on News NT.\n\nThe first participant in a UK COVID-19 vaccine trial has died. Dr Granato is alive and well. The reports are fake. BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh, who had earlier covered the vaccine trial has debunked the fake news through a series of tweets on the micro-blogging site. \"Fake news has been circulating on social media that the first volunteer in the Oxford vaccine trial has died. This is not true! I spent several minutes this morning chatting with Elisa Granato via Skype. She is very much alive and told me she is feeling 'absolutely fine',\" Walsh wrote. He later posted a video of Dr Granato saying that she was \"very much alive\" and \"having a cup of tea\".\n\nThe Oxford University issued a statement on their website, in which they acknowledged the fake news and clarified that all official updates regarding the trial will be published on the website.\n\n \"We are aware there have been and will be rumours and false reports about the progress of the trial. We urge people not to give these any credibility and not to circulate them. We will not be offering a running commentary about the trial but all official updates will appear on this site,\" reads the statement.
