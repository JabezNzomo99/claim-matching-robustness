Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of a newly constructed chowk with \u2018mace, bow and arrow\u2019 sculpture in Ayodhya. Fact: The photo is not related to Ayodhya (UP). It shows the sculpture at \u2018Gada Circle\u2019 in Vadodara (Gujarat). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, a tweet with the same photo and claim was found in the search results. A user has commented below the tweet that the photo is related to \u2018Gada Circle\u2019 in Vadodara (Gujarat). So, when searched on the internet, it was confirmed that the photo shows a sculpture in Vadodara, not in Ayodhya. The Google Street View of the location can be seen here. The street view was captured in November 2016. So, it was not setup recently.\n\nTo sum it up, the chowk with \u2018mace, bow and arrow\u2019 sculpture in the photo is in Vadodara, not in Ayodhya.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
