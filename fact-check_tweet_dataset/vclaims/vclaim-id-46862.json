Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Indian Police brutality at a madrassa in Uttar Pradesh. Fact: The incident in the video took place Bangladesh in 2013. It is not related to India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were through the Google Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. A user has uploaded the same video on YouTube in 2013 with the following description: \u2018On 5/6th May 2013 BD Police, BGB & RAB attacked in Hefajote Islam\u2019s meeting at mid-night nearly 2.00/2.20 AM, many men injured and death on spot by police\u2019s gun\u2026\u2019. Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh is an Islamic fundamentalist organization in Bangladesh.\n\nAt 1min:45secs in the video, the letters \u2018RAB\u2019 can be seen on the riot gear of the police. \u2018RAB\u2019 stands for \u2018Rapid Action Battalion\u2019 (Bangladesh).\n\nAlso, in a fact-finding report released in June-2013 on the Hefazat-e-Islam incident, similar visuals can be seen.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video from Bangladesh is being falsely shared as \u2018Indian Police brutality on Muslims\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
