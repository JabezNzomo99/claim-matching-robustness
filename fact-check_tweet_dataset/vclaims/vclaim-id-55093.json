It was flagged by Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool. The tool showed it was reported at least 7 times for containing false information. Several readers also sent the post to Rappler for verification.\n\nABS-CBN Corporation\u2019s quarterly report covering April to June 2020 showed that there were 769,960 direct shares in ABS-CBN Corporation under the chairman emeritus\u2019 name \u2013 which remained consistent all throughout 2019. The company\u2019s public ownership reports filed with the PSE can be found here. Lopez is also the 5th biggest stockholder of ABS-CBN Corporation as of June 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Lopez\u2019s shares in ABS-CBN Holdings Corporation, another company owned by the Lopez family, turned to zero from the third quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. But ABS-CBN Holdings is a different company from ABS-CBN Corporation and Lopez Holdings Corp.\n\nLopez\u2019s direct shares in ABS-CBN Holdings during the first half of 2019 stood at 1,344,725 and then turned to zero for the succeeding quarters until the first quarter of 2020. ABS-CBN Holdings initially reported zero shares under Lopez's name during the second quarter of 2020, but it filed another report to amend it on July 16, to show that he held 3,071,478 indirect shares during the period.\n\nIn an email to Rappler, ABS-CBN explained that this was because Lopez's stockbroker lodged his PDRs with the Philippine Central Depository. The company said even though the PDRs are no longer under Lopez's name, they still belong to Lopez because they have not been sold. This was reflected in the amended report, since indirect shares refer to stocks held by the person through additional entities.", "lang": "en"}
