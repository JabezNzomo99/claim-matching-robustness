(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe did reverse image searches of the photos to find their original descriptions. Clockwise from left, the first photo shows thousands of people marching in Brooklyn, N.Y., in support of Black trans people on June 14.\n\nThe second photo is one we fact-checked in a previous story about photos mislabeled to look like they\u2019re from Trump\u2019s rally. In reality, this one shows Rolling Thunder motorcycle riders in a Virginia parking lot in 2019.\n\nBoth the third and fifth photos \u2014 which are actually the same picture \u2014 show a crowd gathering in Great Falls, Mont., before a Trump campaign rally in July 2018.\n\nThe fourth photo appears to be from outside the Tulsa rally, where hundreds lined up early to get in, an ABC News affiliate reported.\n\nBut most of these photos \u2014 including the two biggest photos \u2014 are from different events, and they\u2019re being deployed en masse here to paint a misleading picture about Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa.", "lang": "en"}
