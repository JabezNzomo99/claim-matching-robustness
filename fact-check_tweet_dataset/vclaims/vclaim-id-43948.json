No, that's not true: The photo is real, but it was not snapped at Normandy. Actually, it was taken in the French Riviera in 1945, seven months after the D-Day Invasion.\n\nThe story originated from a post (archived here) published by DoSomething.org on June 15, 2014. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe vintage photograph has been shared many times over the years, but the captions have not always accurately reflected what happened.\n\nOn June 23, 2016, the American Red Cross published a blog post titled, \"What's the Story Behind This Iconic Photo?\" The author noted that the image shows a U.S. Coast Guard-operated ship unloading passengers in the South of France, the C\u00f4te d'Azur, as it is known. The photo was taken on January 15, 1945, according to the Red Cross, not 1944, as the post claimed.\n\nThe caption may be wrong, but the bravery of the women pictured is not in question. Nor is that of the roughly 74,000 women who worked as nurses in the Army and Navy during World War II.\n\nWhile the picture does not show it, many other women helped out in field hospitals and medical evacuation planes in Normandy. This site shares some of the stories of these nurses, and the Veterans History Project is working to catalog many of their experiences.", "lang": "en"}
