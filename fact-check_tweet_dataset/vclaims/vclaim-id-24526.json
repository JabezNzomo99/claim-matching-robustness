In the video, some women in burqa and chained together, can be seen. The video has subtitles which read,\n\n\u201cWe have Yezidi women, we have Kurdish women, and we have Christians. get what your right hand possesses, come get your Mulk-al-yamin (slave). Get yourself a sex slave. Our brave fighters, our brave Islamic State fighters have gone into these areas and killed their murtadin (infidel) scum. So you can have their women today. Takbir, Takbir, Takbir (Allah is great)\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter this, the auction of the women begins, and the people gathered there can be heard quoting a price for \u2018Aisha, 13 years old fresh from Kobane\u2019. This is followed by the auction of more women. The entire video is 2:20 minutes long.\n\nThe video has been posted with a sarcastic message taking a jibe at Muslims, referring to them as shantidoot log (peacefuls). The tweet is of July 22.\n\nWHAT IS THE TRUTH?\n\nTo find out more about the video, Alt News used specific key words and came across an article by BBC Newsdated October 20, 2014. The article was titled, \u2018The mock Islamic State slave auction in London\u2019, and contained a 16 second clip of the same video which has been posted on Twitter.\n\nThe video was shot at Leicester square in London. The article states,\n\n\u201cThe savvy social media campaign against Islamic State by Kurdish activists continues \u2013 with a video of a mock \u201cIslamic State sex slave market\u201d in the heart of London watched more than quarter of a million times on YouTube.\n\nThe video shows the group\u2019s supposed ringleader bellowing into a microphone. Behind him stand a group of women \u2013 all of them actors \u2013 fully covered and chained together. \u201cWe have four women for you here today,\u201d the man announces, \u201cand we are here to sell them courtesy of the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nShot on 14 October, the stunt was organised by Compassion 4 Kurdistan, a group of Kurdish diaspora trying to raise awareness if IS\u2019s alleged actions in Iraq. It has now been viewed more than 250,000 times on YouTube. On the same night, the group performed the scene outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament as well.\u201d\n\nThe video represents a mock sex slave auction performed by Kurdish protesters in 2014. It sought to bring to light the atrocities committed by Islamic State fighters in Iraq, when the terror organisation was then at its zenith, having captured vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. It may be noted that this is a mock video. The original video of the performance, posted on YouTube, is no longer available.\n\nAbduction and enslavement of women under ISIS is no secret, and was in fact admitted by the organisation itself. According to CNN, ISIS in its English language publication Dabiq, in an article titled, \u2018The revival of slavery before the Hour\u2019 had justified enslavement of \u2018infidel\u2019 women, citing Islamic law. The same was reported by The New York Times. Several reports have documented the horror stories of women abducted by ISIS fighters and forced to be slaves. This was also confirmed by the United Nations in a report of 2014, adding that Yazidis were targeted the most.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be noted that the video posted on Twitter is a mock video of a ISIS sex slave auction, which was performed by a Kurdish group in London in 2014 in protest against ISIS.", "lang": "en"}
