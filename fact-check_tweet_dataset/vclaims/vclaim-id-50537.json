(Fareed Zakaria) \u2018Post\u2019 America means: The World \u2018After\u2019 America!\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Obama was \u201cfurious\u201d about the picture or that he \u201ctried to block\u201d its publication. The conspiracy theory that Obama is secretly a Muslim has been previously debunked numerous times.\n\nThe New York Times photographer Doug Mills took the photo in May 2008 while Obama was campaigning in Montana and later published it. The image does, as the post claims, show Obama holding CNN Worldwide host and Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria\u2019s book \u201cThe Post-American World.\u201d (RELATED: Are Muslims Barred From Holding Public Office In The US?)\n\nThere is, however, no indication that Obama was caught off-guard by the photograph or tried to stop its publication. At the time Mills was a known member of the press covering the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail. No news reporting could be found to corroborate the claim that Obama was \u201cfurious\u201d about the photo or that he \u201ctried to block it.\u201d\n\nPublished in May 2008, Zakaria\u2019s book was a New York Times bestseller and critically acclaimed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Foreign Affairs and others. It paints a picture of a future where other nations match the U.S. in terms of geopolitical, economic and cultural power. Zakaria has stated that, despite the title, the book is not about the \u201cdecline\u201d of American, but rather \u201cabout the rise of everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that Obama is Zakaria\u2019s \u201cfellow Muslim\u201d doesn\u2019t hold up either. Zakaria wrote in a 2015 op-ed for the Washington Post that he was \u201cnot a practicing Muslim.\u201d The conspiracy theory that Obama secretly practices Islam dates back over a decade and has been throughly debunked numerous times.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
