Then ace researcher Alice Crites suggested a good way to finally disprove this claim once and for all.\n\nMore than 20 years later, in 1995, Zeifman published a book titled \u201cWithout Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon.\u201d Clinton is mainly a bit player in the book. Zeifman was mostly concerned with settling scores with John Doar, a lawyer who essentially displaced Zeifman when he was tapped to head the committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Doar was a lifelong Republican who as a Justice Department lawyer in the 1960s had achieved fame for battling segregation in the South.\n\nDoar, as the chief lawyer for the impeachment probe, actually hired Clinton, and she reported to him. Zeifman, who passed away in 2010, in his book appeared to be a frustrated bystander to many of Doar\u2019s decisions. He had no control over her hiring \u2014 and would not have been in a position to fire her.\n\nZeifman, with little evidence, claims that Doar conspired to drag on the impeachment inquiry as long as possible as a way to keep an increasingly weakened Nixon in power and pave the way for a candidacy of Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Zeifman also contends that the impeachment staff tried to ensure that illegal acts by Democratic presidents could not be raised as a defense by Nixon. Why a Republican like Doar would engage in such a conspiracy is not really explained.\n\nZeifman\u2019s specific beef with Clinton is rather obscure. It mostly concerns his dislike of a brief that she wrote under Doar\u2019s direction to advance a position advocated by Rodino \u2014 which would have denied Nixon the right to counsel as the committee investigated whether to recommend impeachment. Zeifman also suspects her of discussing the probe with a former law professor at Yale (although he acknowledges that Doar received permission from Rodino to consult with the professor).\n\nZeifman, in 2006, repackaged the brief mentions of Clinton in another book, titled \u201cHillary\u2019s Pursuit of Power.\u201d But the thinness of the material is demonstrated by the fact that the Watergate section of the second book takes up only 30 pages. Clinton, after all, was just a low-level staff attorney, playing a relatively modest role. She did not even have a law license yet (and, in fact, failed the D.C. Bar exam she took three days before the committee\u2019s vote on the articles of impeachment).\n\nIn neither of his books does Zeifman say he fired Clinton. But in 2008, a reporter named Dan Calabrese wrote an article that claimed that \u201cwhen the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation.\u201d The article quoted Zeifman as saying: \u201cShe was a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.\u201d\n\nThere is no actual quote from Zeifman saying he fired her. Moreover, in other interviews, Zeifman acknowledged that he did not fire Clinton. In 1999, nine years before the Calabrese interview, Zeifman told the Scripps-Howard news agency: \u201cIf I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her.\u201d In a 2008 interview on \u201cThe Neal Boortz Show,\u201d Zeifman was asked directly whether he fired her. His answer: \u201cWell, let me put it this way. I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were \u2014 we no longer needed, and advised her that I would not \u2014 could not recommend her for any further positions.\u201d\n\nOf course, since Nixon resigned, the impeachment inquiry was over and none of the staff members had jobs anymore. So it was not Zeifman who terminated their jobs but Nixon, who short-circuited what would have been a lengthy process leading to his removal from office. It\u2019s impossible to know whether Clinton ever sought Zeifman\u2019s recommendation. She had accepted a job offer to teach at the University of Arkansas, in order to be with her then-boyfriend, Bill Clinton \u2014 and presumably she would have wanted a recommendation from Doar, for whom she actually worked.\n\nFinally, here\u2019s the critical piece of evidence unearthed by Crites: the pay records of the Judiciary Committee. Note that Hillary Rodham is paid ($3,377.77) through Sept. 4; two of her more senior colleagues on the impeachment staff, associate special counsel Robert Sack and senior associate special counsel Bernard Nussbaum, were paid through Sept. 2 and Sept. 6, respectively. The committee\u2019s impeachment report was published Aug. 20, and the staff\u2019s work was done by early September.\n\nWe know that it is all but impossible to stamp out these Internet memes. But whatever Zeifman may have said in one interview, he did not make this claim in either of his books. He also gave different answers in other interviews. It\u2019s clear he disliked Clinton, but he also disliked many of the other people he worked with, including her actual supervisor and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Zeifman was not Clinton\u2019s supervisor and did not fire her, as demonstrated by the committee\u2019s pay records.", "lang": "en"}
