These people lift poor women in the public eye and police also doesn\u2019t say anything. Spread this video to such an extent that the police is compelled to arrest them -translated)\u201d. The tweet has amassed close to 400 retweets so far.\n\nSeveral individuals on Facebook and Twitter shared the video with the identical narrative. It has been circulating with similar claims at least since November 2017.\n\n\n\nAlt News found that a version of the same video was posted by Rajasthan Patrika on September 24, 2017. Thus, the video is at least two years old.\n\nOne of the men in the video is the husband of the girl they try to abduct. The elderly woman is the mother of the girl. According to a September 27, 2017 report in Dainik Bhaskar, the husband\u2019s name is Shaukat who was married to Nemat and Aamad Khan\u2019s daughter. \u201cAs per the police, Aamad Khan, a resident of Kalu Khan ki Dhani village, had married his daughter to Shaukat at a very young age several years back. Shaukat had asked his in-laws several times to send his wife. However, Shaukat\u2019s mother-in-law Nemat insisted on doing the \u2018Gauna\u2019 when her daughter turns 18. -translated)\u201d, states the report. Shaukat, along with an accomplice Ilyas, came with a tractor and forcefully took his minor wife after beating his resistant mother-in-law.\n\nChild marriage in India is illegal yet prevalent in various parts of the country. Some communities marry their girls at a very young age however the bride stays at her father\u2019s house till the time she attains adulthood. The girl starts living with her husband after a post-marriage ceremony called \u201cGauna\u201d.\n\nThis incident reportedly took place on the afternoon of September 12, 2017. According to media reports, the duo was arrested after the police took cognizance of the matter on September 17, 2017.\n\nIn 2018, fact-checking outlet Boomlive spoke to inspector Kishore Singh from Bap Tehsil police station where the case against these two men was registered. He said that these men were arrested and charged with \u201cseveral sections of kidnapping, wrongful restraint and using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty\u201d. However, they were later released on bail while the minor girl was living in the same village with her mother.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a man beating his mother-in-law for not allowing him to take his minor wife home is being shared with the false claim that women from lower economic backgrounds were lifted in the public view to be raped by men in Rajasthan.", "lang": "en"}
