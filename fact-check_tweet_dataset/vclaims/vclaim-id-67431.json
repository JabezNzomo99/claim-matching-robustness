Of these, only three have the potential of being settled in the November election. ... Nearly 90 percent of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary\" on March 4, 2014.\n\nTravis County\u2019s pretty blue, as Thorburn noted and as PolitiFact Texas explored in a recent fact-check of U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett\u2019s claim that its surrounding counties are red ( ).\n\nIs it so blue that most of the county\u2019s votes cast in the Nov. 4 election won\u2019t really decide anything?\n\nBy email, Thorburn pointed us to the state elections website and said, \"Please realize that I did not say 90 percent of all races that will appear on the November ballot in Travis County (which would include state, multi-county district, and state legislative positions). What I specifically said is county offices, including county judge, commissioners from precincts 2 and 4, several justices of the peace, and several county court at law positions.\"\n\nThe only assumption he made, Thorburn said, is that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win. \"The secretary of state's web site does not include any Libertarian or Green Party candidates who may be nominated by a convention, rather than a primary,\" he said.\n\nCounty elections official Michelle Parker guided us by phone to a on the county\u2019s election website. Next, from the state secretary\u2019s elections web page of candidates who filed for the primary by the Dec. 9, 2013 deadline, we pulled the .\n\nAfter setting aside the candidates for Congress, governor and other federal or state offices, we came up with 32 candidates running in 19 races and only three Republicans in the lot.\n\nAfter we inquired, Thorburn said he had miscounted the number of races, and now tallied 19. \"The percentages are still valid if 84.2 percent is acceptable as \"nearly 90 percent,\u2019 \" he said.\n\nTravis County Republican Party spokesman Andy Hogue confirmed by email that three Republicans are running for three Travis County offices, though he pointed out that more are bidding for offices Thorburn did not include: state House districts 47 and 50, both within the county\u2019s boundaries.\n\nMost Travis County candidates are, so far, unopposed, so that unless a Green or Libertarian files, Democrats are set to claim 12 offices without having to campaign for them.\n\nFour more races will be settled in the Democratic primary in March (unless a Green, independent or Libertarian files) because they feature two Democrats facing off: county treasurer; county commissioner Precinct 4; county court at law judge No. 3; and justice of the peace Precinct 5.\n\nThe three races with a Republican contender: county judge, Precinct 2 county commissioner and Precinct 2 justice of the peace.\n\nThorburn said \"nearly 90 percent\" of the Travis County government races this year will be settled by the March Democratic primary, thanks to the paucity of Republicans who filed to run.\n\nHis declared count was too high. Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over.\n\nWe rate this statement as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
