Let\u2019s analyse the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Congress party supporters during their rally in North Karnataka have waved Pakistan flag along with the Indian flag Fact: The flag seen in the video other than India\u2019s is that of Indian Union Muslim League\u2019s (IUML), an Indian political party with a strong base in Kerala. Hence the claim made in the post that the flag in the video as Pakistan\u2019s stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through INVID tool , various fragments of the video are obtained. If observed closely, the green flag in one of the fragments ,it is found to be that of Indian Union Muslim League\u2019s (IUML) which is quite similar to that of the Pakistan\u2019s flag.\n\nYou can notice the difference between both the flags below. The one to the left is the flag of IUML and the one to the right is that of the Pakistan.\n\nHence, the flag used in the post by Congress partymen during their Karnataka election rally is that of Indian Union Muslim League\u2019s (IUML) and not that of Pakistan and the claim is False.", "lang": "en"}
