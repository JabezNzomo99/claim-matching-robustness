However, Bondi\u2019s attack misleads by omitting key context about father and son. (And it\u2019s worth noting that ethical questions have been raised about Trump family members and their roles in the government, the campaign and the family business.)\n\nLet\u2019s look at her attacks about the Bidens:\n\n\"A corrupt Ukrainian oligarch put Hunter on the board of his gas company, even though he had no experience in Ukraine \u2014 or in the energy sector. None. Yet he was paid millions to do nothing.\"\n\nBondi has a point that Hunter had no experience in Ukraine or the energy sector.\n\nDespite the lack of expertise, he joined the board of Burisma beginning in 2014 when his father as vice president was publicly representing U.S. policy on the country, which had become the center of a tug-of-war between Russia and the West.\n\nMost of the criticism we\u2019ve found focused on the conflict of interest Hunter Biden created by accepting the position. We found no evidence to suggest Joe Biden did anything wrong or inappropriate in his official capacity as vice president.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s work attracted attention at the time. The oligarch behind the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, faced investigations for money laundering and tax evasion. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.)\n\nStaff at the State Department said they expressed concerns in 2015 when Hunter Biden started serving on the board of Burisma.\n\nThe details of what Hunter did have been mysterious. Reuters, using unnamed sources, reported that Hunter weighed in during scheduled meetings but did little of substance. The report suggests he was compensated for contributing his high-profile name.\n\nExactly how much Hunter Biden was paid remains unclear. As a director, Biden made up to $50,000 per month some months, according to the New York Times. He left Burisma in spring 2019, around the time that the elder Biden announced his 2020 presidential run.\n\nIn 2019, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump for withholding aid to Ukraine while asking the government there to look into the Bidens\u2019 activities.\n\nWe found no evidence that Hunter Biden himself was investigated by Ukrainian or American authorities for his role as a board member of Burisma.\n\n\"That very same company was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor. Joe Biden \u2014 the vice president of the United States \u2014 threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless that same prosecutor was fired. And then he was fired.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that Vice President Biden called for Ukraine to fire Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general, but so did many other major world leaders and institutions, because of Shokin\u2019s slowness in addressing corruption. There is no evidence that Biden\u2019s position on Shokin had anything to do with his son.\n\nBiden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile.\n\nA frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. His actions were in line with the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy priorities.\n\n\"Fact: Joe Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with Hunter along for the ride. ... Ten days later, those Chinese communist bankers approved millions to go to Hunter's firm. ... To this day, Hunter controls a 10% stake in that firm.\"\n\nThis needs context. Bondi is drawing from the book by Peter Schweizer, a conservative author, in his 2019 book, \"Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\"\n\nIn 2008, the younger Biden joined a string of investment and consulting firms. One of these efforts led to business activities in China.\n\n\"In 2013, then-Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China,\" Schweizer wrote in a summary of his findings on FoxNews.com. \"Ten days later, Hunter Biden\u2019s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China.\"\n\nSchweizer wrote that \"Rosemont Seneca (one of Hunter Biden\u2019s firms) and the Bank of China created an investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST,\" or BHR.\n\nWe looked in detail at Hunter\u2019s China dealings in May. We found that BHR has been involved in several large deals since 2014, but solid information on the fund\u2019s money flow is hard to pin down.\n\nHunter\u2019s attorney George Mesires told PolitiFact in 2019 that Hunter Biden was an unpaid board member until October 2017, at which point he did take a financial stake in BHR.\n\n\"In October 2017, after his father left government service, Hunter acquired a 10% interest in BHR,\" Mesires said. As of October 2019, he added, \"Hunter\u2019s capital commitment for such interest is approximately $420,000.\"\n\nOverall, we found no indication that the younger Biden did anything illegal. Other relatives of politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, have had dealings with Chinese businesses.\n\nThe Biden arrangement appears to be a \"normal deal that I expect from Chinese businessmen,\" said Zhiguo He, a finance professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.\n\n\"And Joe Biden has done more than look the other way on China. He's said, \u2018The Chinese aren't our competition. Come on man, they're not bad folks.\u2019\"\n\nThis attack lacks the context of Biden\u2019s full remarks and omits that he was putting down China, not praising it. During a campaign stop in May 2019, Biden argued that China was no competition for the United States.\n\n\"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,\" Biden said. \"They can\u2019t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west. They can\u2019t figure out how they\u2019re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They\u2019re not competition for us.\"", "lang": "en"}
