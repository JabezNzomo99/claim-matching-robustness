Two photos, one of Trump and one of what appears to be a pallet of Covid Organics bottles, accompany the claim.\n\nMadagascan President Andry Rajoelina in April launched Covid Organics, and the herbal tonic has since been distributed and sold throughout the country, the Associated Press reported. Last month, World Health Organization Africa Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti warned against \u201cthe adoption of a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy\u201d after Rajoelina touted it as COVID-19 preventative and cure, according to France 24.\n\nWhile U.S. Ambassador to Madagascar Michael Pelletier did announce in April that the U.S. would allocate $2.5 million in health assistance to Madagascar to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, there is no evidence any of that money went toward producing Covid Organics. At no point in the videotaped statement about the funds does Pelletier mention any \u201cMadagascar herb drug.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, I am pleased to announce that the United States will provide Madagascar with an additional $2.5 million in health assistance, specifically to address the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d Pelletier said in the April 21 video. \u201cThis money will be used to strengthen the health response across the country, including hospitals, laboratories and community health.\u201d\n\nA fact sheet from the State Department lists the funds as going toward increasing laboratory capacity for diagnostics, improving disease surveillance and contact tracing, promoting risk communication campaigns, training health care workers, procuring essential health commodities and improving waste management.

On April 26, the outlet did publish an article, titled \u201cTrump offers $2.5 million to Madagascar to develop the Covid-19 remedy,\u201d but it provides no substantive evidence to support the claim it makes, only quoting from Pelletier\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Zambian Observer has made a number of false claims in the past, according to Africa Check.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
