The new coronavirus is not man-made or a biological weapon.\n\nThe post includes the Boston ABC affiliate WCVB\u2019s news report about Leiber\u2019s arrest in late January. The video caption claims the former chair of Harvard University\u2019s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, got arrested because he \u201cmanufactured and sold\u201d the new coronavirus to China.\n\nThe FBI arrested Lieber on Jan. 28 on charges of making false statements to federal authorities about his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology and his participation in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Thousand Talents Plan aims to attract Chinese ex-pats and foreign scientists to China.\n\nThere is, however, no link between Lieber\u2019s arrest and the new coronavirus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. He was not arrested for creating and selling the virus to China, and a DOJ spokesperson told FactCheck.org the agency had \u201cmade no such allegation.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ also announced that two non-Harvard Chinese researchers had been charged in unrelated cases on the same day: Yanqing Yi, who was charged \u201cwith one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy,\u201d and Zaosong Zheng, who was charged with \u201cone count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements,\u201d according to a DOJ press release. Their arrests were also unrelated to the new coronavirus.\n\nThe exact origin of the new coronavirus remains unknown, but experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Its genetic sequence shares similarities with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to civet cats to humans, according to Nature.
