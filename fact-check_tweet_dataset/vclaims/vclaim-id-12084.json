This purported cure was developed using phage display technology, which is used to identify interactions between proteins of potential biological interest. The scientists claimed that their approach is far superior to existing treatments for several reasons, such as its exploitation of several targets on cancer cells simultaneously and fewer side effects than existing cancer treatments, among others. They also claimed that \u201cclinical trials could be completed within a few years\u201d. AEBi\u2019s sensational claims, as it turned out, were founded on a few in vitro experiments and one in vivo experiment in 6 mice.\n\nMany cancer researchers and physicians have expressed skepticism over these claims, which they have found to be highly premature. The experiments performed by AEBi are simply not sufficient to make such extraordinary claims. AEBi\u2019s suggestion that their approach is a certain success fails to take into account the fact that many promising experimental therapies fail during clinical trials[1]. Therefore, their claims grossly overstate the significance of their research findings, and may ultimately offer only false hope to patients.\n\nYou can read an archived version of the article here.\n\nScientists have elaborated on the misleading idea of cancer as a single disease, which AEBi seems to suggest in claiming that they have a cure-all for every cancer.\n\nDr. Benjamin Neel, director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center, said in the New York Post:\n\nThis was corroborated by Dr. Ajit Johnson, a cancer researcher at Harvard Medical School, who explained in a Forbes article, \u201cCancer is a very heterogeneous disease. There are several tens of subtypes within each cancer type and even those vary significantly between patients.\u201d\n\nDr. Vince Luca, who leads a cancer research group at the Moffitt Cancer Center, also said in an ABC News article: \u201cThere are over 200 human cancers. Finding a cure for even one or two would be a major accomplishment. Claiming to cure them all is impossible.\u201d\n\nThe claim is not supported by available data, nor has it been peer-reviewed\n\nDr. Victoria Forster, cancer researcher at the Hospital for Sick Children, commented on the lack of data supporting AEBi\u2019s claims in a Forbes article. \u201cDelving into what the company does supply, there are two graphs and some pictures taken down a microscope, much less than I provided from a 6-week undergraduate research project a decade ago,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a separate Forbes article, Dr. Russell Pachynski, oncologist and assistant professor at Washington University School of Medicine, pointed out issues with what little data AEBi had provided. \u201cThe only data they show on their website is presumably not peer reviewed and is difficult to interpret in that context. In fact, the \u2018partial negative control\u2019 actually looks like it has similar effects to their cancer targeted peptide. They may have a great idea for the \u2018cure\u2019 of cancer, but without convincing, peer-reviewed, published data showing evidence of this, their claims are difficult to take at face value. Even promising therapeutics that have been successful through Phase II human trials often have negative Phase III controlled trials#,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society commented on the Jerusalem Post article in his blog post. \u201cThis is a news report based on limited information provided by researchers and a company working on this technology. It apparently has not been published in the scientific literature where it would be subject to review, support and/or criticism from knowledgeable peers.\u201d\n\nDrug development is actually a long, uncertain and often unsuccessful process\n\nDr. Lichtenfeld also highlighted that \u201c[the claims are] based on a mouse experiment which is described as \u201cexploratory.\u201d It appears at this point there is not a well-established program of experiments which could better define how this works\u2014and may not work\u2014as it moves from the laboratory bench to the clinic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will likely take some time to prove the benefit of this new approach to the treatment of cancer. And unfortunately\u2013based on other similar claims of breakthrough technologies for the treatment of cancer\u2013the odds are that it won\u2019t be successful,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven how little pre-clinical work AEBi has done, let alone clinical trials (which in the case of oncology have a median length of approximately 13 years[1]), it is extremely unlikely that the cure would be available within a few years as AEBi has claimed. Furthermore, the certainty with which AEBi makes its claims is questionable, given the fact that the success rate of drug development in oncology has been estimated at 3.4%[1]. In summary, their claims are unsupported and misleading.\n\nThe approach is claimed to be new, but isn\u2019t\n\nThe article described AEBi\u2019s approach as \u201ca disruption technology of the highest order\u201d and \u201cpotentially game-changing\u201d.\n\nThis is further underscored by one of the AEBi scientists\u2019 comments: \u201cThe probability of having multiple mutations that would modify all targeted receptors simultaneously decreases dramatically with the number of targets used,\u201d Morad continued. \u201cInstead of attacking receptors one at a time, we attack receptors three at a time \u2013 not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time.\u201d\n\nFirstly, the idea of using multiple targets is actually not novel in cancer treatment, as their claim implies. Treatment regimens using any combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy \u2013 which go after more than one target \u2013 are already a part of existing treatment regimens[3,4,5].\n\nSecondly, the statement that \u201cnot even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time\u201d is inaccurate. Cancer cells are often genomically unstable[6], which means that they easily undergo multiple mutations and can keep gaining more \u2013 this is also one of the main drivers of treatment resistance encountered in many cancer patients[7].\n\nFurthermore, cancer cells within the same patient and even the same tumour can differ significantly from one another \u2013 this phenomenon is called intra-tumour heterogeneity[6,7], and is yet another reason why AEBi\u2019s purported silver bullet for all cancers is unlikely to work.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 1 \u2013 Wong et al.

Phase II also tests for safety as well as whether the drug works. Phase III compares how well the new drug performs compared to another drug already used in clinics (standard-of-care). Phase IV occurs after the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is conducted on many more patients than the first 3 phases, which provides a better understanding of long-term effects.
