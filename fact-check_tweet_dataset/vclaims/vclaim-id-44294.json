Only two were U.S. Marines.\n\nThe viral image, posted Jan. 4, lists the names and ages of 11 servicemen, claiming they \u201cgave their lives this week for everyone in this country.\u201d It also urges social media users to share the post.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no record of 11 Marines dying in the week leading up to the post nor the week following it. A review of Pentagon press releases didn\u2019t turn up any instances of Marine deaths in the past two months. The Military Times\u2019 \u201cHonor the Fallen\u201d project doesn\u2019t mention any either.\n\nThe 11 men, whose service spanned two branches of the American military and one branch of the British military, all died in Afghanistan over a five-day period in July 2010.

Sheldon Tate, both Army servicemen, died in Kandahar City on July 13 that year.\n\nThe following day, Army Sgt. Zachary Fisher, Spcs. Jesse Reed and Matthew Johnson got killed in an improvised explosive device attack, according to the Military Times. Another soldier, Spc. Chase Stanley, also died from the attack, reported The Los Angeles Times. Pfc. Class Brandon King got killed on July 14 in separate incident.\n\nThe only two Marines listed \u2013 Staff Sgt. Justus Bartelt and Cpl. Dave Santos \u2013 both died July 16, while supporting combat operations in the Helmand province, according to Ogle County News.\n\nStaff Sgt. Brett Linley of the U.K. Royal Logistics Corps and Sgt. Justin Allen of the U.S. Army died on July 17 and 18 respectively, according to the Marine Corps Times.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that the media didn\u2019t cover their deaths doesn\u2019t hold up either. The New York Times, BBC News and other outlets have mentioned the 11 men\u2019s names in their coverage of military casualties in Afghanistan.", "lang": "en"}
