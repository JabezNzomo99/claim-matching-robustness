On August 21, 2020, Sunil Astay of the Bhim Army posted two images in a tweet, writing, \u201cThe Supreme Court released a list on August 17, which issued the names of six advocates who had been appointed as judges to the Delhi High Court. But the big news here is that the words inscribed under the Ashoka Pillar have changed.\u201d (archived link to the tweet)\n\nJournalist Punya Prasun Bajpai had also tweeted these photos with the same claim, later deleting his post. We managed to take a screenshot of the tweet, which is below.\n\nMany people made posts on Facebook stating that \u201cthe Supreme Court is more concerned with victory than justice since its motto is no longer \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 (the truth alone triumphs), but \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 (where there is dharma, there is victory). Another user had tagged Alt News on Twitter, requesting our team to verify this information. Meanwhile, other users wrote about how everyone should be speaking out about it along with the need for wide reportage on this change.\n\nWe could not find any sources or literature that pointed to the Supreme Court changing its motto from \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019. We checked the official website of the Supreme Court and did not find any press release that mentioned the change or said that its motto was \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 at any point in time. On the home page of the site, \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 appears under the words \u2018The Supreme Court of India\u2019. We will now check whether this has been changed recently. We looked up the website of the Supreme Court on Wayback Machine, a webpage archive which keeps automatic records of web pages at different times.\n\nIf you take a look at the archives of the official Supreme Court website on web.archive.org, you will find a total of 130 snapshots taken in the period between November 12, 2019 and August 18, 2020. On the snapshot taken on November 12, 2019, the phrase \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 can be seen written below the heading, \u2018The Supreme Court of India\u2019. Thus, the slogan cannot be a recent change.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at what the website of the Supreme Court used to look like. The web address of the top court used to be supremecourtofindia.nic.in earlier. We found around 1,580 snapshots on web.archive.org of this site taken from July 6, 2000 to August 20. 2020.\n\nWe looked through a number of snapshots on Wayback Machine and found one dated November 10, 2010. On this version, the words \u2018Yato Dharastato Jai\u2019 appeared on the page. However, these words were absent in the screenshot taken before November 10, 2010. Therefore, the phrase \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 appeared on the website for the first time somewhere between November 10. 2010 and November 20, 2010. This can be seen in the video below.\n\nIt is worth noting here that the Supreme Court did not change \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019. We did not see \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 written anywhere on the home page of the website in the first place. As a result, the claims being made online about the Supreme Court\u2019s recent change of its motto are false. Punya Prasun Bajpai later issued a regretful tweet, admitting he had been confused and accidentally circulated the information.\n\nIn reality, the logo of the Supreme Court contains the Ashok Chakra. Below the symbol are the words \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jai\u2019 inscribed in Sanskrit. On the other hand, \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 is the motto of the Government of India, and is written underneath the Ashok Pillar.", "lang": "en"}
