It was a spoof based on Trump\u2019s personality and public statements created by the satirical web site Facthole:\n\nFacthole was a relatively new website in November 2015, and many readers who stumbled upon the above-displayed logo were probably unfamiliar with the site\u2019s humorous nature. Additionally, Facthole didn\u2019t include a readily available disclaimer identifying the site\u2019s content as satirical in nature.\n\nUsers could have determined that the above-displayed logo was fake, however, by crosschecking the image with Trump\u2019s official web site, examining some of the other articles on Facthole (e.g., Rick Santorum did not convert to Islam), or deducing that Trump\u2019s official logo would not be watermarked by an unrelated web site.\n\nLater versions of the swastika-like Trump logos were also spoofs:\n\nThe gold \u201cTrump Logo\u201d pictured above was created by Mark Fox and Angie Wang of \u201cDesign Is Play\u201d and was among the winners of Communication Art\u2019s 7th Annual Typography Contest:\n\nDesign Is Play posted an image of their unofficial Trump logo on Instagram:\n\nIn mid-2019, an image was circulated via social media supposedly showing the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, wearing a shirt bearing the swastika-lake logo:\n\nHowever, this image was just a digitally altered version of a photograph that captured Ivanka\u2019s visit with Douglas County (Colorado) deputies in July 2019:", "lang": "en"}
