There are hacks who believe that Foster died in the White House and that his body was moved. There was even a member of Congress who fired bullets into a cantaloupe (or was it a watermelon?) in an effort to prove that Foster was killed.\n\nYes, the bullet was never found. (Foster died in a wooded park.) Yes, the Clinton White House was sometimes slow to release information or took steps that at times raised suspicions, such as removing from Foster\u2019s office files concerning an Arkansas real estate deal. But that was all examined, dissected, discussed, investigated two decades ago \u2014 and found to be not material. The fifth probe lasted three years \u2014 and still found nothing.\n\nFoster was a childhood friend of Bill Clinton\u2019s and a partner of Hillary Clinton\u2019s at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock who joined the White House staff when Clinton became president. He was found dead, in Fort Marcy Park in Virginia, six months into the administration, a few hours after having left his White House office at 1 p.m. He had a gunshot wound in his head and an 80-year-old gun in one of his hands.\n\nFoster had been involved in several controversies, such as failed nominations for attorney general and the firing of the travel office staff so business could be steered to the president\u2019s allies. At the time of his death, Foster was being treated for depression. In his briefcase was found a note, torn into 27 pieces, which said in part: \u201cI was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe condition of the scene, the medical examiner\u2019s findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide. Without an eyewitness, the conclusion of suicide is deducted after a review of the injury, the presence of the weapon, the existence of some indicators of a reason, and the elimination of murder. Our investigation has found no evidence of foul play. The information gathered from associates, relatives and friends provide us with enough evidence to conclude that\u2026. Mr. Foster was anxious about his work and he was distressed to the degree that he took his own life.\u201d\n\nAfter the White House confirmed that documents related to the Whitewater Development Corp., a failed real estate investment by the Clintons, had been in Foster\u2019s office at the time of his death, public pressure led Bill Clinton to appoint an independent counsel. On Jan. 20, 1994, Robert B. Fiske Jr. took over the Justice Department investigation into the Whitewater matter. He opened a new investigation of Foster\u2019s death, convening a panel of distinguished pathologists, and relying on the investigative prowess of seven experienced FBI agents.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee (led by Democrats) conducted an investigation into the Park Police probe. On Jan. 3, 1995, the committee issued a report stating that \u201cthe evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion of the Park Police that on July 20, 1993, Mr. Foster died in Fort Marcy Park from a self-inflicted gun shot wound to the upper palate of his mouth.\u201d Republicans on the committee also issued a statement, saying, \u201cWe agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that on July 20, 1993 Vincent Foster took his own life in Fort Marcy Park.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 5, 1994, Kenneth W. Starr was named the independent counsel in the Whitewater matter. He launched a fifth investigation, more comprehensive than the first four, and his report was not issued until Oct. 10, 1997. The probe uncovered new evidence, all of which pointed to the same conclusion as the four previous probes. Starr also consulted with leading forensic experts, who reviewed the materials, with one medical doctor declaring that \u201cto a 100 percent degree of medical certainty, the death of Vincent Foster was a suicide.\u201d\n\nStarr vigorously tried to tackle just about every conspiracy theory about the case. He definitively established that Foster owned the 80-year-old gun found in his hand. Investigators discovered that an oven mitt found in the glove compartment of Foster\u2019s car came from his kitchen \u2014 and traces of lead from the gun found in his hand were also found in the mitt (which he used to transport the gun) and in his pants pocket (which he used to carry the gun in the park).\n\nMost of the many carpet fibers found on Foster\u2019s clothing came from his home, office and his car, demonstrating that he had not been wrapped in a carpet and taken to the park, as some had claimed. Pathologists concluded that Foster was alive at the time the shot was fired and that he \u201cfired the gun with the muzzle in his mouth, his right thumb pulling the trigger and supporting the gun with both hands and with both index fingers relatively close to the cylinder gap (the space between the cylinder and the barrel).\u201d Moreover, blood splatters further confirmed that the body had not been moved.\n\nThe report also noted that Foster\u2019s troubled state of mind pointed to a suicide. As the report put it: \u201cMr. Foster told his sister four days before his death that he was depressed; he cried at dinner with his wife four days before his death; he told his mother a day or two before his death that he was unhappy because work was \u2018a grind\u2019; he was consulting attorneys for legal advice the week before his death; he told several people he was considering resignation; he wrote a note that he \u2018was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport.\u2019 The day before his death, he contacted a physician and indicated that he was under stress.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
