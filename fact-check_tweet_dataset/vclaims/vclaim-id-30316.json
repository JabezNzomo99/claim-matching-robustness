The evidence it provided does not support the claim.\n\u2022 The latest data from the Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that about 4% of women in Africa suffer from depression. \n\n\n\nabout the prevalence of depression among women in Africa, a number of Twitter users\n\nwhere the statistic came from.\n\n, who has described herself as a\n\n, is the daughter of former South African public protector\n\n.

The organisation is based in the United States and operates in Uganda\n\nthat one in four women in Africa suffers from depression. (\n\nJennifer Bass, marketing and communications manager for StrongMinds, said the one-in-four claim was in part based on door-to-door screenings conducted in 2017 in Uganda\u2019s\n\n, which found that 20% of women suffered from depression. The organisation uses the\n\nas a depression screening tool, she said.\n\nBass also sent Africa Check a copy of a\n\n. On the first page it says that \u201cup to 3-4 persons out of every 10 persons in the community suffer from a depressive illness\u201d.\n\nBut these numbers claim to apply to Uganda only, or a smaller part of the country, and the figure in the pamphlet is not for women specifically.\n\npsychologist consultant\u201d to do a literature review of prevalence rates in Uganda and sub-Saharan Africa. This was an \u201cinformal, internal exercise\u201d, said Bass.\n\nAccording to her, the review contained estimates for the prevalence\n\nof depression among women as high as 25%. But StrongMinds no longer has a copy of the report so we are unable to further interrogate this figure.\n\nNone of the sources provided by StrongMinds provides evidence for the claim that one in four women in Africa suffers from depression.\n\nNeither Msimanga nor the author of the Forbes article responded to our questions about the primary source of the claim.\n\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that\n\nof women in its\n\n(one in 17) suffered from\n\nThe rate was based on\n\nat the University of Washington in the US.\n\nAsked why the WHO regarded the GBD as the best available source of data for this estimate, WHO communications officer Alison Brunier said the study is \u201c\n\nunique in its comprehensiveness and the methodological approach used to deal with inconsistencies in data\u201d.\n\nleads the mental disorders component of the Global Burden of Disease Study on behalf of the IHME.\n\nShe said its prevalence estimates are based on a review of existing data.\n\nThe study\u2019s researchers look for survey data that is representative of the population and that has estimates of measures such as prevalence and\n\n(new cases of an illness). They apply the criteria\n\nfor mental disorders provided in the\n\nData from individual studies is pooled to arrive at a\n\nThe study was last updated in 2017.\n\nThe latest age-standardised estimate for the prevalence of depression in\n\nis 4.3% (one in 23). \u201cEstimates from sub-Saharan Africa represent our modelled results for the whole of Africa,\u201d Ferrari explained.\n\nModelled estimates indicate prevalence when raw survey data is not available, said Ferrari. \u201c\n\nThe alternative would be to assume no cases of mental disorders in countries where there is no high-quality survey data available, which we don\u2019t think is defensible.\u201d\n\nIt is possible to under- or overestimate prevalence when using\n\n, said Dr Florence Baingana, acting programme officer for mental health and substance abuse in the non-communicable\n\ncluster of the WHO.\n\n\u201cHowever, considering how expensive it is to do a good prevalence study for one country, then replicate it for the 47 countries of the [WHO\u2019s Africa] region, it would not be very cost-effective. That is why the IHME uses modelling, and they have been refining the different country contributions as the data becomes available.

The non-profit organisation that originally made the claim could not provide evidence to support it.\n\nThe latest available data estimates that about one in 23 women in Africa suffers from depression. We, therefore, rate the claim as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
