It is being claimed that, in the original photo, \u2018PM CARES\u2019 is not written over the ventilator and it was added using a photo-editing tool \u2013 \u2018Photoshop\u2019. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: \u2018PM CARES\u2019 sticker on this ventilator is photoshopped. Fact: When similar photos and videos of ventilators with the logos of \u2018Bharat Electronics Limited\u2019 and \u2018Skanray\u2019 companies are observed, it can be seen that \u2018PM CARES\u2019 is written over the ventilators. So, the ventilator was bought using the \u2018PM CARES\u2019 fund. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\nIn the posted collage, it is being claimed that the ventilator photo with \u2018PM CARES\u2019 is an edited one. While it is true that the text \u2013 \u2018PM CARES\u2019 can be inserted onto the ventilator photo using the Photoshop software, it is equally true that the text \u2013 \u2018PM CARES\u2019 can be removed from the ventilator photo using the same software (the process of removal of the name can be watched in the gif below). So, just by looking at two photos in the collage, it is difficult to conclude which is the real one.\n\nBut, on the ventilator, the logos of \u2018Bharat Electronics Limited\u2019 and \u2018Skanray\u2019 companies can be seen. Many other similar ventilators with the same company logos were found to be posted on social media which have \u2018PM CARES\u2019 written over them. Those posts can be seen here and here.\n\nAlso, Harsh Sanghavi, a BJP member and Surat MLA, has tweeted a video with the description that Surat city has received 25 ventilators from the \u2018PM CARES\u2019 fund. In the video, it can be seen that the ventilators have \u2018PM CARES\u2019 written over them. A doctor has also tweeted that the ventilators are currently being manufactured against the government order.\n\n\u2018ANI\u2019 has also reported that a senior government official has told them that, under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative, \u2018Bharat Electronics Limited\u2019 in collaboration with \u2018Skanray\u2019 has been given orders for 30,000 ventilators. It has also reported that \u2018in the first slot, about 3000 ventilators have been distributed to States\u2019. So, the ventilator was bought using the \u2018PM CARES\u2019 funds.\n\nTo sum it up, the ventilator photo, with \u2018PM CARES\u2019 written over it, is not photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
