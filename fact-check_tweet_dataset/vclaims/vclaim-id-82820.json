The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.\u201d\n\nDuring an exchange about veterans\u2019 health care, moderator Rachel Maddow asked the two candidates: \u201cHow will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? What\u2019s your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?\u201d Maddow cited efforts to \u201cabolish\u201d or privatize large portions of the VA.\n\nConcerned Veterans for America, or CVA, has been one of the most vocal critics of the VA since the wait time scandal that unfolded in 2014. Whistleblowers alleged that dozens of veterans died at the Phoenix VA while waiting for medical care, and the VA Office of Inspector General eventually acknowledged that wait lists may have contributed to the veterans\u2019 deaths. The inspector general also found patient and appointment record falsification and manipulations to be a systemic, years-long problem.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted previously, many veteran groups still criticize the senator for not reacting to the scandal quickly enough. They still point to Sanders\u2019s comments in May 2014, the month after the Phoenix VA problems were aired publicly, saying that the VA is a large health care system that inevitably has problems. Members of the Senate VA Committee also wrote a letter urging Sanders to hold more oversight hearings and said their previous requests for hearings had not been fulfilled.\n\u2022 None VHIP would be a program office at the Veterans Health Administration, which would continue to exist. Veterans would continue to be eligible for free VA health insurance, but would also receive premium support for private insurance.\n\u2022 None Ultimately, this office would provide direct subsidies for veterans\u2019 health care, whether veterans get it from private or public providers. (CVA denies it proposes vouchers.) The premium support program would be similar to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. Veterans can access private health care by selecting from a menu of insurance plans.\n\u2022 None Highest-priority veterans with 50 percent or more service-connected disabilities are offered larger amounts of support. Future veterans in the lowest-priority groups would not qualify (see Priority 7 and Priority 8 on Page 27 of the proposal ). Future veterans would be subject to cost-sharing based on levels of disability or financial need, according to Stars and Stripes\n\u2022 None VACO would be a nonprofit government corporation independent of the VA. This organization would oversee the VA\u2019s health facilities and compete with the private market and contract with the VHA to provide care. The current VA would continue providing domiciliary care, research, training for health care personnel, and contingency support for national emergencies and times of war.\n\u2022 None The VACO would follow the model of Amtrak, which is run by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (which is partially government-funded, for-profit corporation). It would receive congressional appropriations, be run by a board appointed by Congress and be subject to congressional oversight, said Dan Caldwell, CVA\u2019s vice president for political and legislative action.\n\u2022 None The proposal also calls for inefficient VA medical centers and clinics to be shut down after a review by a panel appointed by the president.\n\nThe Clinton campaign pointed to criticisms of plans to privatize the VA, but some of the criticism were not specifically about the CVA\u2019s plan. An op-ed in Military Times cited some advocates who say CVA has grown too political and that the proposal mixes the health care process with the claims process.\n\nFrankly, these attacks on the VA proposals remind us of false claims Democrats have previously made about GOP proposals for Social Security and Medicare. (Sanders even said during the debate that the Koch brothers want to \u201cdestroy\u201d Social Security and Medicare.) For more, see our previous fact checks on bogus Social Security claims and stale Medicare claims.\n\nThere are elements in the plan that open up veteran health care to the private market. But when people \u2014 especially politicians \u2014 talk about \u201cprivatization,\u201d they usually refer to the wholesale transfer of government services to the private industry. That does not accurately describe CVA\u2019s proposal, and both Clinton and Sanders earn Three Pinocchios. But a warning to politicians: The rhetoric that the proposal would \u201cabolish\u201d the VA is a Four Pinocchio claim, and we will treat it as such.", "lang": "en"}
