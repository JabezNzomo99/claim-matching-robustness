Guess who? George Soros and Hillary Clinton,\" the story reads.\n\nThe article, which has been shared more than 87,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe took a look at the New York Times story cited by the Red Pilled News. It doesn\u2019t prove what the website says it does.\n\nThe article, which was published in December 2017, reported how some political operatives have raised money to support accusers bringing sexual harassment charges against Trump and members of Congress. The story noted how the influx of partisan money could muddy the waters of the #MeToo movement.\n\nFor allegations made specifically about Trump, the story focuses on two lawyers (and Democratic donors): Gloria Allred and her daughter Lisa Bloom.\n\nBoth women raised money from \"influential Democrats\" to support women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct, according to the Times. Bloom asked one pro-Clinton super PAC for money to help her vet a claim against the president after he received the Republican nomination.\n\nBut Bloom told the Times she did not communicate directly with Clinton or her campaign. And the story doesn\u2019t mention Soros.\n\nThe other article that Red Pilled News cited was published by the Hill in December 2017. It also reported on Bloom\u2019s efforts but found no connection to Clinton or Soros.\n\nRed Pilled News\u2019 domain was created in late September, according to WhoIs data. Many of its articles contain grammatical mistakes, and the site includes a share button for VKontakte, a Russian social media site that\u2019s been a hotbed for disinformation. Soros and Clinton were popular targets of Russian disinformation in 2016.\n\nWe could not confirm who or what is behind the Red Pilled News site. But an analysis from Hoaxy, a tool that detects automated Twitter accounts, shows that a sizeable number of bot-like accounts have amplified the site\u2019s content.\n\nThe Red Pilled News article is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
