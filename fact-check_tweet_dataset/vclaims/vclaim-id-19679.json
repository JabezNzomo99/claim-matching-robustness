No grammar school received more than \u00a35,500 per pupil.\n\nAround 70 (or 5%) of the 1,500 non-grammar state schools taking students aged 11-18 received under \u00a34,500 per pupil. A small number (21) received more than \u00a38,000 per pupil.\n\nOn average, grammar schools in England received around \u00a34,500 per pupil, while other state schools received \u00a35,200.\n\nIt\u2019s been reported that the new formula used to fund schools will boost grammar school budgets relatively more than other schools in coming years.\n\nHow is the money shared out?\n\nGrammar schools are selective state secondary schools found in England and Northern Ireland. There are 163 grammar schools in England, which the claim refers to, so we\u2019ll focus on the schools there.\n\nSchools get different kinds of funding. The vast majority of school funding comes from \u201cbasic entitlements\u201d, with the rest coming from other grants such as those based on how deprived pupils at the school are.\n\nGrammar schools and other state schools received similar levels of basic entitlement. In 2016/17 English grammar schools received an average of \u00a34,100 a student, and other English state schools received \u00a34,300.\n\nGrammar schools however receive much less in other grants than other comparable state schools. For example, they receive about \u00a3250 per student less in deprivation funding, reflecting the fact that pupils in grammar schools are from relatively less disadvantaged backgrounds than pupils at other state schools\n\nThey also receive around \u00a3250 less in other funding sources.\n\nFor example, no grammar school received money for funding private finance initiatives (PFI) costs while around 100 other state schools did\u2014as much as \u00a32,100 per pupil in one school.\n\nThere is also a difference in the range of funding the different school types receive. While all grammars receive broadly similar funding per pupil (ranging from \u00a34,100 to \u00a35,400), non-grammar state schools can receive very different levels of funding per pupil (from \u00a34,100 to \u00a39,500).\n\nWe\u2019ve excluded the \u201ceducation services grant\u201d from our calculations. This is given to academies to \u201ccover the cost of the services that local authorities provide centrally to maintained schools but that academies must secure independently\u201d. Including the grant for academies only would skew the overall data when trying to compare grammar schools with other schools.\n\nWe\u2019ve also only included non-grammar state schools that take pupils of the same age range as grammar schools (11-18). This also excludes \u201call through\u201d schools who offer primary and secondary education. We've also excluded special schools.\n\nFinally we\u2019ve used 2016/17 funding data rather than 2017/18 funding data. That\u2019s because information about the types of schools (for example whether a school is a grammar or another type of state school) is only available from 2016/17.\n\nGrammar schools receive less than nearby state schools in most areas\n\nSchool funding is allocated primarily based on each local council\u2019s funding formula which means there are big differences in school funding between regions. You can view an interactive map here.\n\nOnce that is taken into account, grammar schools generally receive less funding than other state schools in the same area.\n\nOf the 36 councils with grammar schools, only two put more money into pupils in grammar schools\u2014\u00a310 more per pupil in Essex and \u00a332 more per pupil in Kirklees. The largest gap was in Slough where grammar schools received around \u00a31,300 less per pupil on average than the other state schools in the area.\n\nYou can find an interactive map of the data here.\n\nThe reason why schools receive such different amounts is partly down to the individual characteristics of each school, but also down to how funding has been managed historically.\n\nState-funded schools fall into two main groups: academies, where funding and oversight is directly from the Department for Education, and maintained schools, where funding and oversight is through councils,\n\nUp until recently, the government has decided how much of the budget to hand over to each council, largely based on how much each council has received per pupil in previous years. In 2016/17, the year which the data above refers to, this was still the case.\n\nEach council then uses a local funding formula to share this money out to local schools. They take into account several factors such as pupil numbers, deprivation, and prior attainment.\n\nAlthough outside of the control of councils, the money used to fund academies and free schools is still calculated using the local funding formulas.\n\nThe old funding system has been widely seen as flawed\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank, the government, and others have all said the old funding system is flawed and awards money inconsistently.\n\nPart of this is intentional, the IFS has said, because of deliberate choices by the government to target funding towards disadvantaged schools and areas with higher costs.\n\nBut some variation has been more unintentional.\n\nYou can read more about how the school funding system works here.", "lang": "en"}
