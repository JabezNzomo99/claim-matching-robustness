It appears to be a distortion of an August 2017 post Schumer published on Medium.\n\nSchumer has been the subject of viral misinformation on several occasions. In this case, a viral Maga2020 News article attempts to paint him in a negative light by suggesting he said it was racist to only allow U.S. citizens to vote.\n\nBut, contrary to the article, there is no evidence the Senate minority leader ever made the statement featured in the headline. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any instance of Schumer saying these words in the congressional record, social media or public statements.\n\nJustin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the Senate minority leader \u201chas not said this.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, \u2018It Is Dangerous To Let The Voters Decide Trump\u2019s Fate\u2019?)\n\nThe quote, previously debunked by PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, has been circulating online since at least 2017. It appears to distort what Schumer wrote in an Aug. 24, 2017, Medium post about President Donald Trump\u2019s now-dissolved Election Integrity Commission, which was established in May 2017 to address \u201cimproper voter registrations, improper voting, fraudulent voter registrations, and fraudulent voting.\u201d\n\nIn the Medium post, Schumer described the commission as an \u201ceffort to intimidate voters and purge them from the rolls through a national voter database of personal information\u201d that disenfranchises minority voters. He also called for its dissolution and public hearings about voting rights. (Trump dissolved the commission in January 2018, citing a lack of cooperation from various states.)\n\nNowhere in the Medium post does Schumer make the statement attributed to him in the Maga2020 News headline, nor does he express support for the idea that noncitizens should be allowed to vote in U.S. elections.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
