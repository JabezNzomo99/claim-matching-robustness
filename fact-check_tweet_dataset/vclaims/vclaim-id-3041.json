Human rights organizations say the bombing campaign is targeting an area where 400,000 civilians live.\n\nOn February 22, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called the situation in eastern Ghouta \u201ca human tragedy,\u201d saying the U.N. cannot \u201clet things go on happening in this horrendous way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u200bWarplanes struck eastern Ghouta overnight February 22-23 even as Russia objected to a draft U.N. resolution to implement a 30-day pause in fighting across Syria. Diplomats say the purpose of the resolution is to lift the siege of eastern Ghouta to allow humanitarian aid and medical evacuations.\n\nSaturday, the U.N. Security Council in New York adopted a resolution calling for a cease fire, demanding hostilities cease in Syria \"without delay\" and for 30-days to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and to evacuate the critically ill and injured. The resolution, itself, was delayed more than 24 hours as diplomats negotiated to settle on language acceptable to Russia.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Niki Haley expressed her skepticism that Syria would comply and admonished Russia for stalling U.N. action.\n\n\"Every minute this council waited on Russia, the human suffering grew,\" Haley said. \"In the three days it took us to adopt this resolution, how many mothers lost their kids to the bombing and shelling?\"\n\nEarlier, Western officials placed responsibility on Russia for the humanitarian emergency in eastern Ghouta.\n\n\u201cWithout Russia backing Syria, the devastation and the deaths would certainly not be occurring,\u201d U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on February 22.\n\nThe White House said the U.S. \u201cstrongly condemns \u201crecent attacks on the people of Syria in eastern Ghouta by Russia and the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nThe German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the bombing of eastern Ghouta a \u201cmassacre.\u201d\n\nThat same day, amid growing international criticism, President Vladimir Putin praised the performance of the Russian military in Syria: \u201cI would like to once again thank for their service all who participated and are participating in the military actions in the Syrian Arab Republic. Our warriors are splendidly prepared, they are honorably doing their duty, fighting decisively, fearlessly, to the end!\u201d Putin said.\n\n\u200bWhile formally advocating for ceasefire and peace negotiations in Syria, Russia continues taking steps that, experts say, are causing a further escalation of violence.\n\nAnd February 22, Russia blocked the first draft of a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire. Russia\u2019s envoy to the U.N., Vassily Nebenzia, stated that international media reports of heavy civilian casualties in eastern Ghouta was a product of \u201cmass psychosis.\"\n\nRussia circulated proposed amendments that some reports indicated would create loopholes in a ceasefire. Russia has vetoed 10 earlier U.N. resolutions on Syria.\n\nEarlier, on February 21, Kommersant.ru, citing sources in the Russian Defense Ministry, reported that Moscow has deployed an unknown number of Su-57s, its most advanced combat warplane, to Syria. Nicknamed the \u201cF-22 killer,\u201d the Russian military sees the Su-57 as a direct competitor to the U.S. F-22 Raptor.\n\n\u201cWith the arrival of the Su-57s, it appears that Moscow is expecting major escalations in Syria during 2018,\u201d reported Beirut-based Al-Masdar News, which boasts close links with the Syrian military.", "lang": "en"}
