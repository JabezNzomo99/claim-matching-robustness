William Stein during a meeting with the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe have escalated these threats to acts of domestic terrorism and are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to keep Americans safe this Halloween season.\u201d According to Stein, several threats about a \u201cHalloween night purge\u201d have been sent to schools, businesses, and even churches all across the United States. Local and state authorities are urging parents to not take their children out on October 31. Concerned parents are pushing for a mandatory curfew on the 31st which will begin at 5 PM. Others say this should not ruin their children\u2019s Halloween tradition \u2026 As of now, there has been no enforced curfew for the evening of October 31. However, Homeland Security is urging the president to sign an emergency declaration for this 5 PM curfew. This is a developing story and we will keep you updated as events progress.\n\nAlthough purge rumors and creepy clowns have both created social media panics more than once in the past, neither element has ever manifested in any measured danger, and creepy clowns become a pervasive motif around Halloween. Not only is Action News 3 a known fake news purveyor, it is not even the first to claim a Halloween purge involving creepy clowns is imminent. In 2016, a different fake news site spread an identical rumor (and no clowns participated in any purges).", "lang": "en"}
