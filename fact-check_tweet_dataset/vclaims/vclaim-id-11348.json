This includes the emissions from producing fossil fuels (like oil, coal and gas), and the subsequent use of the fossil fuels they sell to other companies.\n\nTherefore, it might not come as such a surprise that these 100 entities are linked to 71% of human activity-related greenhouse gas emissions, since all 100 are fossil fuel producers.\n\nHuman activity-related greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the greenhouse effect.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere is naturally made up of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat from the sun causing a warming effect on the Earth below. A certain level of naturally-occurring greenhouse gases keep the Earth (on average) at a pretty hospitable temperature for life.\n\nBurning fossil fuels, agriculture, and other industrial processes release extra greenhouse gases, and these trap extra heat close to the Earth\u2019s surface. That\u2019s caused global warming\u2014a long-term warming of the planet. A symptom of this is that since 2001 we\u2019ve experienced 17 of the 18 warmest years on record since records began 136 years ago.", "lang": "en"}
