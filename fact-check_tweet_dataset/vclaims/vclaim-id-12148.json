That\u2019s how much the Tories\u2019 No Deal preparations are costing our country. Per hour.\u201d \u201cThe Tories are spending \u00a3171,000 an hour on no deal preparations. That\u2019s \u00a31.9 billion and counting that could be spent on the salaries of approximately 85,000 nurses, 50,000 secondary school teachers or 49,000 police constables\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not correct that \u00a3171,000 an hour is being spent by the government on no deal preparations. This is the per-hour breakdown of the \u00a31.5 billion of additional funding budgeted by government for all kinds of Brexit preparations in 2018/19.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the true figure for no deal as government departments say they aren\u2019t able to separate what they\u2019re spending on preparing for Brexit into individual scenarios.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the UK\u2019s independent public finance watchdog, also predicts that some of the funding Labour\u2019s claim is based on won\u2019t actually be spent before the 29 March this year\u2014which is the default date the UK wlll leave with \u2018no deal\u2019 if nothing else is agreed before then.\n\nSome of the money that is spent will be in preparation for no deal, but Labour can\u2019t substantiate their claim that all of the money is for this.\n\nLabour\u2019s estimates of how many workers\u2019 annual salaries this Brexit preparation funding could pay for are generally in the right ballpark, but not very meaningful\u2014as these workers would ultimately cost more to employ than their salaries alone.\n\nThe government has not ruled out leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March this year, if a version of its own withdrawal agreement doesn\u2019t make it through parliament. Parliament this week supported a motion which rejects the UK leaving the EU without a deal, but this doesn\u2019t have any legal force.\n\nTowards the end of 2018, the government issued a series of technical notes for how government and businesses need to prepare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nAs the Institute for Government has set out, the government needs to do a lot if it is to be prepared enough for no deal, including putting new systems and processes in place to replace what EU bodies currently do for the UK.\n\nLabour explains how it estimates the cost of no deal Brexit preparations in a press release. It\u2019s based on the government spending \u00a31.5 billion in 2018/19, which works out at \u00a3171,000 per hour.\n\n\u00a31.5 billion is the amount of extra funding in 2018/19 that the government has put towards preparations for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\nIn total the Treasury has allocated \u00a34.2 billion towards government departments for Brexit preparations since 2016, which breaks down as:\n\u2022 \u00a31.5 billion in 2018/19 (the focus of Labour\u2019s claim)\n\nThis is not all the money that the government plans to spend on Brexit\u2014as some departments\u2019 pre-existing budgets will be used for Brexit preparation too.\n\nNot all of the money for 2018/19 is expected to be spent\n\nThe OBR says it doesn\u2019t expect all of the \u00a31.5 billion to actually be spent this year. It assumed government departments will underspend on their overall budgets by \u00a30.4 billion in 2018/19, some of which it said will be from the Brexit preparation funding pot.\n\nHow much of that \u00a30.4 billion underspending is from the Brexit preparation pot isn\u2019t known. The OBR told us they don\u2019t have an exact figure for this, and the government didn\u2019t provide much more in an answer it gave to the same question last year.\n\nNot all of this money is for no deal preparations\n\nThe extra funding allocated by the government for Brexit preparations\u2014including the \u00a31.5 billion that Labour refers to\u2014covers more than just preparing for a no deal scenario.\n\nThe Treasury describes the funding it is giving to departments for 2019/20 as for \u201ccore Brexit activity including deal and no deal preparations\u201d. \u201cThe money will support vital preparations including getting new border and customs operations ready, gearing up UK trade policy with existing and new international partners, and taking back control of our waters\u201d.\n\nTo give a concrete example, some of the 2018/19 funding is for the Home Office to prepare for the scheme which will offer \u2018settled status\u2019 to EU citizens in the UK. This scheme is set to be rolled out whether or not the UK leaves with a deal\u2014so it can\u2019t be considered as no deal planning.\n\nMost government departments explained in a series of written answers to MPs that they were preparing for \u201call scenarios\u201d and none specified how much they were spending specifically for no deal preparations.\n\nSo \u00a31.5 billion is the extra money that\u2019s being allocated for a range of possible Brexit scenarios, not just no deal.\n\nGiven the fact that Labour supports the UK leaving the EU, and its leadership voted to trigger the two year countdown to exit day in March 2019, it\u2019s likely that if the party was in government, it would be spending money preparing for Brexit as well.\n\nClaims how many nurses, teachers or police this could pay for aren\u2019t very useful\n\nLabour also claims the government\u2019s no deal Brexit funding is the equivalent of the annual salaries of 86,000 newly-qualified nurses, 50,000 secondary school teachers, or 49,000 police constables.\n\nConfusingly, this isn\u2019t using the same figure as the other part of its claim. These staffing figures are based on Brexit spending of \u00a31.9 billion, rather than the \u00a31.5 billion we\u2019ve been mentioning so far. \u00a31.9 billion is Labour\u2019s estimate of the total spent on Brexit preparations so far in the 2018/19 financial year, adding in what was already spent in 2017/18.\n\nIn a narrow sense, it\u2019s roughly correct that \u00a31.9 billion is the equivalent of the annual salaries of that many newly qualified nurses (as Labour specifies in its press release) or teachers or police constables (using the typical starting pay of nurses and the median full-time pay for teachers and police officers).\n\nBut in reality it would cost more than \u00a31.9 billion to employ that many nurses, teachers or police officers.\n\nThat\u2019s because the cost of employing someone goes beyond just paying their salary and includes things like pensions and national insurance payments, and possible additional costs like training, working space or managers to oversee them. So Labour\u2019s calculation is not a very helpful one.", "lang": "en"}
