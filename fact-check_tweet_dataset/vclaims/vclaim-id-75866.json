Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has again struck former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who\u2019s now running in New Hampshire to oust Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nThe April 27, 2014, ad, titled \" ,\" focuses on Brown\u2019s connection to \"big oil.\"\n\n\"Scott Brown\u2019s carrying some big oil baggage,\" the narrator says. \"In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions.\"\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll focus on Brown\u2019s votes. We\u2019ll tackle his campaign contributions separately.\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC cited Brown\u2019s votes in , and against measures that would have kept the \"big five\" oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips) from taking advantage of existing tax breaks. Sponsors of the measures sought to apply the roughly toward energy efficiency and conservation.\n\nSpecifically, the measures would have prevented those five oil companies from using these existing tax breaks:\n\nThree of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the \"big five\" oil firms.\n\nIn each of these three years, the measures failed -- by margins of 35-61 in 2010, 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. Majorities weren\u2019t enough in the final two years, since those measures required 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote.\n\nSen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote in favor of the 2012 bill. In 2011, she voted the same way, along with fellow Maine Republican Susan Collins. In 2010, no Republican supported the measure.\n\nBrown joined most Republicans and a few Democrats from oil states in voting against the measure each time it hit the floor. Ironically, the Senate Majority PAC supports this year\u2019s re-election bids of two other Democratic senators who voted the same way on these measures as Brown did -- Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.\n\nThe bill\u2019s opponents sometimes cited a by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded that withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump.\n\nIn general, then, the ad is correct that Brown sided with the position of \"big oil\" on these votes. However, the ad\u2019s claim is phrased slightly misleadingly. Rather than voting \"to give oil companies big tax breaks,\" Brown voted not to take away the tax breaks that oil companies were already using. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that two out of the five tax breaks in question were not targeted only at oil companies but were tax breaks that non-oil companies could benefit from, as well.\n\nA Senate Majority PAC ad said Brown \"voted to give oil companies big tax breaks.\" For three years in a row, Brown did indeed vote against measures that would\u2019ve barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed. That\u2019s slightly different than what the ad says -- rather than voting to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Brown voted to support the status quo. Still, the ad is correct to suggest that Brown was voting in concert with the biggest oil companies on that legislation.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
