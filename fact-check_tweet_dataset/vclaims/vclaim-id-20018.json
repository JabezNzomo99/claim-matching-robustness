Ted Cruz did not suggest Southern states ought to protect their beliefs with their own nuclear arsenal.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2017-06-07T10:15:51+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20018", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ted-cruz-southern-states-nuclear-weapons-protect-beliefs/", "vclaim": "In early June 2017, social media users shared an article reporting that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Southern states should build their own nuclear weapons in order to \u201cprotect their beliefs\u201d:\n\nThe claim came from a 6 June 2017 USPOLN item, which read:\n\n\u201cThey are out to exterminate us,\u201d Cruz raged on. \u201cThey are out and they are on the hunt for God-fearing conservative Christians whose only idea of a family entails a man and a woman and nothing else. They are like a beast who\u2019s had a taste of blood, Christian blood, and is now out for the kill. You are all and danger, I am in danger, Christians throughout America are in danger. It started with the Supreme Court ruling, and the way things are going, I\u2019m afraid to think how it\u2019ll end.\u201d \u201cBut, there is a solution. Or rather, there could be. I believe the southern states of America should come together in a joint effort to protect their religious freedom, what little of it they, we, have left. We are running out of time. We should build a nuclear bomb and use it to defend our right to believe in God as our one true Father \u2026 [Americans in other states] will come back to us some day, once they realize the error of their ways. Until then, the atomic bomb should remain a guarantee of Christians\u2019 right to believe in straight marriage and traditional values.\u201d\n\nThere was no truth to the claim, or any other published by USPOLN.
