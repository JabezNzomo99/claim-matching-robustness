No, that's not true: a staunchly pro-Israel blog that seems to contain articles that are mostly copy pasted together from other sources embedded a video making that claim but it is not true. The resolution in question does not even mention the Golan Heights or the return of any land.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by PoliticsOnline on March 22, 2019 titled \"UN to Israel \"Give the Golan Heights to ISIS, including all its Christian population\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe whole article reads like it has been copy pasted together from various anti-U.N. and anti-muslim talking points, with some sentences even appearing to be incomplete (\"Even a country like Iran has been given a seat in the UN Human.\").\n\nThe actual text of U.N. Resolution 2334 (which can be found here) does not even contain the words \"Golan\", \"Syria\" or \"ISIS\".

Reiterates its demand that Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and that it fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard; 3. Underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations; 4. Stresses that the cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential for salvaging the two-State solution, and calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends on the ground that are imperilling the two-State solution; 5.

Calls upon both parties to act on the basis of international law, including international humanitarian law, and their previous agreements and obligations, to observe calm and restraint, and to refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, with the aim, inter alia, of de-escalating the situation on the ground, rebuilding trust and confidence, demonstrating through policies and actions a genuine commitment to the two-State solution, and creating the conditions necessary for promoting peace; 8. Calls upon all parties to continue, in the interest of the promotion of peace and security, to exert collective efforts to launch credible negotiations on all final status issues in the Middle East peace process and within the time frame specified by the Quartet in its statement of 21 September 2010; 9. Urges in this regard the intensification and acceleration of international and regional diplomatic efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet Roadmap and an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967; and underscores in this regard the importance of the ongoing efforts to advance the Arab Peace Initiative, the initiative of France for the convening of an international peace conference, the recent efforts of the Quartet, as well as the efforts of Egypt and the Russian Federation; 10.
