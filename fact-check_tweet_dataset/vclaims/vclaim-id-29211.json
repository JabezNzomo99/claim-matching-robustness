Bam Aquino did not say the poor should be fed \u201cpag-pag\u201d or scavenged food, contrary to a meme posted by a Facebook fan page of senatorial candidate Bong Go.\n\nThe meme, published March 11, attributes to Aquino the false quote:\n\nAquino, author of the Zero Food Waste Bill (Senate Bill No. 357) which had earlier been the subject of fake news, has been urging food businesses such as restaurants and supermarkets to donate their excess food to food distribution charities.\n\nIn one post on his official website titled \u201cBIDA KA!: Habag, Hindi Pagpag,\u201d he said:\n\nIsinusulong ng panukala na bawasan ang pag-aaksaya ng pagkain sa pamamagitan ng pagbigay ng mga supermarket, restaurant sa sobra nilang pagkain sa tinatawag na food-distribution charities o \u2018food banks\u2019 para ipamahagi sa mahihirap na pamilyang Pilipino. Sa kabilang dulo, ang mga tira-tirang pagkain ay ipapadala sa mga composting at waste management plant kung saan ito\u2019y gagamiting compost (The bill seeks to reduce food waste by getting supermarkets and restaurants to donate their surplus food to food-distribution charities or \u2018food banks\u2019 to be shared with poor Filipino families. On the other hand, food waste will be sent to composting and waste management plants where they can be used as compost).\n\nThe Liberal Party senatorial candidate is seeking reelection and is in the 10-15 bracket in the most recent Pulse Asia survey.\n\nThe Bong Go fan page that posted the meme has more than 213,000 followers.
