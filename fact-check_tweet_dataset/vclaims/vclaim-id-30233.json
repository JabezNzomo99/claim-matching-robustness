Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, U.S. Rep. Paul A. Gosar, R-Az., tweeted a picture of former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, along with the caption \u201cThe world is a better place without these guys in power\u201d:\n\nHowever, Obama and Rouhani never met face-to-face during the former\u2019s term of office, and the image of the two men tweeted by Gosar was a fake created by altering a 2011 photograph of Obama\u2019s meeting with former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss nuclear-liability laws:\n\nMoreover, Gosar\u2019s critical caption for the fake photo (\u201cThe world is a better place without these guys in power\u201d) was inaccurate, as Rouhani is still very much in power as Iran\u2019s president.\n\nAfter the picture of Obama and Rouhani was identified as a fake, Gosar then criticized the \u201cdim witted reporters\u201d who pointed it out and attempted to claim that the false and misleading aspects of his tweet were irrelevant:", "lang": "en"}
