[O]bservers believe this is a clear signal that the protests in Hong Kong will be maximally radicalized.\u201d\n\u2022 --\u201cJoshua Wong confirmed this assumption, shouting furious slogans into the microphone and literally choking with hatred: \u2018Glory To Hong Kong! Glory to the heroes of Hong Kong! We hate the police! Don't obey the police! Liberate Hong Kong!\u2019 The crowd shouted back: \u2019USA!\u2019.\u201d\n\u2022 --\u201cThen everyone watched a video prepared by the organizers of the action. The video encouraged [them] not to stop there, but to continue the fight. Various white American uncles and aunts performed, and, against touching background music, spoke about the support of the \u2018people of Hong Kong.\u2019 In the frame appeared different faces from among American politicians and officials. All of them talked about how you must not stop, you need to protest as much as possible, and that only by force is it possible to satisfy the demands of the opposition.\u201d\n\nDuring the rally that took place at Hong Kong\u2019s Edinburgh Place on Nov. 28 \u2013 Thanksgiving Day in the United States -- protesters celebrated the fact that U.S. President Donald Trump had signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law.\n\nWhile reporting that rally participants chanted \u201cUSA!\u201d, RIAFAN.ru did not mention that the main reason they had gathered was to celebrate the new U.S. law supporting their democratic aspirations.\n\nAccording to Hong Kong police, some 9,600 people attended the rally, not the 2,000-2,500 reported by RIAFAN.ru. Rally organizers claimed 100,000 people participated.\n\nWhatever the case, photographs from the rally posted by Twitter users during the event suggested attendance was much higher than the numbers reported by RIAFAN.ru\n\nThe statue erected on the staircase, described by RIAFAN.ru in racist terms, is difficult to identify from the low-resolution photo embedded in the news agency\u2019s report.\n\nHowever, the statue of an African American man standing behind a rostrum with what appears to be an open Bible in his right hand as part of an exhibit symbolizing American democracy appears to depict Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his iconic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Online reverse image searches also support this conclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is fake news,\u201d Hong Kong opposition activist Joshua Wang told Polygraph.info in response to a request for comment on the RIAFAN.ru report. \u201cI have never said \u2018Glory to Hong Kong! Glory to the Heroes of Hong Kong! Hate to police! Disobedience to police! Free Hong Kong!\u2019 during the assembly,\u201d Wang said, referring to a live feed video on his Facebook page confirming that RIAFAN.ru fabricated the quote it attributed to him.\n\nIn its own video report, RIAFAN.ru included parts of what it described as a video clip in which \u201cvarious white American uncles and aunts\u201d tried convince the protesters that \u201conly by force\u201d they can achieve their goals.\n\nIn its edited video report, RIAFAN showed fragments of videos apparently shot from the screen with three persons speaking English, with subtitles in Russian but no identification of the speakers.\n\nUsing reverse image search tools Polygraph.info was able to identify the people on the video as (left to right):\n\u2022 Solomon Yue Jr., U.S. political activist of Chinese descent, a member of the Republican [Party\u2019s ] National Committee from the state of Oregon.\n\nThe original video recordings of all three expressing support for Hong Kong\u2019s protesters are available online.\n\nBlackburn posted the video on her official Twitter feed.\n\nDevin confirmed that he addressed the Thanksgiving Rally in Hong Kong via video in a Facebook post the same day, geotagged at the site of the rally.\n\nThe original video of Devin\u2019s address is also available on YouTube.\n\nYue posted on Twitter a link to a video of an interview he gave to the BBC\u2019s Chinese service on October 18 expressing support for the protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nFragments of that interview without the BBC logo also appear in a YouTube video titled \u201cSolomon Yue Video for 11.28 Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn their videos, Blackburn, Devin and Yue each expressed support for the protesters in Hong Kong in their fight for human rights and democracy, and criticized China\u2019s government. Nowhere in these videos, including the fragments used by RIAFAN.ru, did any of them call for use of violent force in Hong Kong.", "lang": "en"}
