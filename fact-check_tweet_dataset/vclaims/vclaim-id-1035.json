This claim is false.\n\nExamples of the screenshots can be seen here and here .\n\nThe tweets call for moving into residential areas and \u201cwhite hoods\u201d and contain offensive language. Some also display the hashtag \u201cBlacklivesMaters\u201d [sic].\n\nFacebook told Reuters reporters that the false Antifa tweets, widely circulated as screenshots, were tied to a white nationalist group attempting to spread misinformation ( here ). Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nIt is not clear how many, if any, of the protesters participating in demonstrations across the country are from Antifa, which experts note is not an organization but rather an amorphous movement ( here ).\n\nAntifa adherents have said they focus on defending people from attacks by authorities or vigilantes, but they have been vilified by President Donald Trump who, without citing evidence, said they were instigators of anti-police violence.\n\nFacebook executives said on Tuesday the goal of such content is often not to win thousands of followers but to plant a single false flag that can be used to sow distrust about the target group ( here ).\n\nOn May 31, Trump said the U.S. government will designate anti-fascist group Antifa as a terrorist organization, a move that legal experts say would be hard to execute ( here ).\n\nNBC also recently reported that a white nationalist group, known as Identity Evropa, had posed as Antifa and called for violence on Twitter, prompting the account\u2019s suspension ( here ).\n\nFalse. Tweets calling for violence from an account posing as a national Antifa organization are false.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
