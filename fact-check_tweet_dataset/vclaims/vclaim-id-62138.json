No, this chant of \"Islam Zindabad\" is being raised in Kolkata, capital city of #MamataBanerjee-ruled #WestBengal !\".\n\nA Bengali song including the words \"Islam Zindabad\" can be heard playing in the background of the viral video.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this viral video is not from Kolkata, West Bengal but from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The viral clip is from the year 2017. The rally was organised by an Islamist political party in Bangladesh - Islami Andolon Bangladesh - in protest against the military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.\n\nThe archived version of the posts are saved here, here and here.\n\nThe same video was tweeted by author and columnist Tarek Fatah with an identical misleading claim. He later apologised for the post and deleted the same after people pointed out that the video was from Bangladesh, not from Kolkata.\n\nMultiple Facebook users have also posted the same content with the wrong claim.\n\nWith the help of InVid reverse image search, we found that several people have uploaded the viral video on YouTube on September 13, 2017, which can be seen here, here and here.\n\nThe video titles mentioned in Bangla that the video is from a public rally held in Dhaka by Islami Andolon Bangladesh to protest against the killing of Rohingyas in Myanmar.\n\nBy searching keywords, we also found news articles published on September 13, 2017, by The Financial Express and Bangladesh news portal Bangla News 24.\n\nThese reports again mentioned how people in Dhaka took to streets against the killings of Rohingya Muslims in the northern Rakhine state of Myanmar.\n\nIslami Andolon Bangladesh organised the event and planned to gherao the Myanmar embassy in Dhaka but were stopped by the police at Shantinagar Chowk.\n\nWe identified the Bangladesh flag being waved by the protesters in the rally seen in the viral clip.\n\nWe also found a news clip of the same rally uploaded by a Bangladeshi news channel Channel i where the background score \"Islam Zindabad\" is missing and we can hear the regular ambience of a rally.\n\nWe have found that the background song in Bengali \"Islam Zindabad\" was actually sung by a Bengali band called Kolorob Gosthi and it was overlaid on the viral clip. The original song can be heard here.\n\nThe same viral video posted by several Facebook users with different misleading claims was also debunked by DailyO a few days ago.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that the viral protest rally video with misleading claims was held in Bangladesh in 2017 and not in Kolkata.", "lang": "en"}
