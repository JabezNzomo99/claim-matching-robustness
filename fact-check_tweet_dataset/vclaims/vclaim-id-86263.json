Presto, he ends up with a decrease of 14 to 18 million people.\n\nClearly, Cruz was never trained as a social scientist. He\u2019s comparing two different ways of measuring the number of the uninsured\u2014and reaching all the way back to 2008 to grab a relatively low number of the uninsured. The CBO estimate, by contrast, seeks to compare the results of the law with estimates of what would have happened to the number of uninsured if no law had passed. That\u2019s the proper way to make a comparison, or otherwise your numbers get polluted by factors such as normal population growth.\n\nFrazier defended Cruz\u2019s calculations. \u201cThat is the right comparison because the point is about the state of things at the time Obama was proposing Obamacare and his promise about how things would change if enacted,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing the 2013 number doesn\u2019t make sense as a starting point because it was a date three years into the future and three years after passage of Obamacare. And the fact that the uninsured have increased under the Obama Administration is but another example of this president\u2019s failed policies.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, Frazier said, taking the 2011 figure from the March 2011 CBO and comparing it to the 2023 projection in the May 2013 CBO, you end up with a reduction of 21 million in the uninsured, close to Cruz\u2019s initial estimate. Using the 2011 forecast would seem to require acknowledging the initial estimate in that report\u2014a reduction of 34 million. But Frazier disagrees, saying it \u201cwas based on policy declared unconstitutional so it\u2019s a moot point.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Cruz is assuming every single American with health insurance\u2014and then some\u2014is in jeopardy of losing his or her insurance. This is much higher than the most negative assessments of critics of the law. For instance, Christopher J. Conover, of Duke University, calculates that 129 million people are at risk of losing their insurance, or about 68 percent in the private market.\n\nA number of readers have asked The Fact Checker about Conover\u2019s estimate, which is based largely on the government\u2019s estimate of the number of plans that will lose their grandfathered status. But for many workers, especially those at larger firms that self-insure their plans, a loss of grandfather status likely will not be noticed, experts say. Indeed, 94 percent of the workers in firms with more than 5,000 employers are in partially or fully self-funded plans. (See Exhibit 10.1)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right that the degree of constriction on individual freedom is less for workers in self-insured plans than their fully insured counterparts but I\u2019m not inclined to just round that to zero and call it \u2018no big deal,\u2019\u201d Conover said. \u201cFreedom matters and so do promises.\u201d He argues that many employers are expecting to impose premium increases because of mandates in the law, with one in seven predicting increases of more than 10 percent. Moreover, he said that even self-insured plans offered by large employers are subject to some mandates that he says will change the nature of the plans.\n\n\u201cThe point is that Obamacare promised to insure a large portion of the uninsured while those with insurance would be able to keep it,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThat promise has been broken. Now Americans who already had plans in the private market have no guarantee if they will be able to keep those plans.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he could have said that 25 million Americans might get insurance, while as many as 128 million might experience changes in their plans that they don\u2019t like. Instead, he seeks to exaggerate, saying the law only reduces the number of uninsured by one third. Actually, it\u2019s a drop of 45 percent.\n\nMoreover, by pegging this as part of the \u201ctrade-off at the heart of Obamacare,\u201d he is ignoring the fact that the law, as crafted, was intended to cover many more of the uninsured\u2014including in his state of Texas, which has rejected the Medicaid expansion. (The experience in Kentucky, which unlike Texas accepted the Medicaid expansion, is an interesting test case, as documented by our colleague Stephanie McCrummen.)", "lang": "en"}
