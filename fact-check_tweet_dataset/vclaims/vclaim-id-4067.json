That\u2019s a matter of opinion, but State Department officials in the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump have said that the old location, while centrally located in an historic part of London, was unable to meet modern security standards, and was already overcrowded by a growing staff.\n\nTrump\u2019s account of what he described as a bad deal came during a campaign-style rally in Michigan on April 28. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the deal:\n\nTrump, April 28: Now in, as you know, in the UK, in London, we had the best site in all of London. The best site. Well some genius said, \u201cWe are going to sell the site and then we are going to take the money and build a new embassy.\u201d That sounds good, right? But you have to have money left over if you do that, right? So they sold the site for like, I think \u2014 and I\u2019ll check the numbers because they\u2019ll say, oh, he misrepresented, but these numbers are close enough. They sold the site for like $250 million. They think they are geniuses. They go out and they buy a horrible location and they build a new embassy. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news, the embassy cost over a billion dollars. So now what do we have? We have an embassy in a lousy location and I was supposed to cut the ribbon. I didn\u2019t do the deal. It was started by Bush and Obama. It was a Bush-Obama special. Okay. But it could have been stopped by Obama. It would have been stopped by me. So, they have \u2014 listen, they have \u2014 so I said, \u201cWhat kind of a deal is that? You sold this great site. It\u2019s the best site in London. Literally, the best site. They were so happy, they got $250 million, or whatever, but they spent all of that money plus a lot more to build a new embassy in a lousy location. So, I don\u2019t know, folks, we need a whole new thinking here.\n\nTrump aired similar complaints about the London embassy move back in January when he cancelled a visit to London to officially open the new embassy \u2013though some media reports claimed the trip was actually cancelled due to fear of mass protests about Trump\u2019s policies and his style of governing.\n\nUnlike that tweet, Trump rightly noted in Michigan that the real estate deal begun under Bush and finished under Obama. After that, though, Trump\u2019s account strays from the facts about the history of the move.\n\nThere\u2019s no question the old embassy in historic Grosvenor Square was situated in a desirable, high-value, historic neighborhood in London. But amid growing safety concerns \u2014 mainly fear of a terrorist bombing \u2014 State Department officials considered retrofitting the old building. They ultimately decided the building could not accommodate their security needs. For example, it would never have been able to meet the recommended 100-foot setback requirement from roads after two terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in 1998.\n\nIn 2008, then-U.S. Ambassador Robert Tuttle announced that he had signed a conditional agreement to purchase a nearly five-acre site in the Nine Elms area of Wandsworth, a London borough in the southwest of the city. At the time, an official with the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations said it would have cost up to $600 million and taken seven years to renovate the existing embassy building, and that it still would not have included state-of-the-art security.\n\nIn 2009, the building was designated as having historical and architectural significance, which would have made upgrades even more costly. Lydia Muniz, director of the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations at the State Department, told the New York Times in 2015 that it would have cost $730 million to renovate the old facility and it still would not have met all of their security needs.\n\nState Department officials also told the Times that the embassy had outgrown the Grosvenor Square building, which was housing 1,000 employees in a building meant for only 800.\n\nMore recently, Tuttle, who served as U.S. ambassador to Britain from 2005 to 2009, told the Washington Post the security of the old embassy building was the overriding factor in the decision to move.\n\n\u201cThere were two narrow side streets by the embassy,\u201d Tuttle told the Post. \u201cThey are very slim, and if someone came down there with a truck, a la the Oklahoma City bombing, it would not only blow up half the embassy and kill half the people in it but it would also kill half the people in nearby residences.\u201d\n\nIn a guest editorial for the Evening Standard in London, Robert \u201cWoody\u201d Johnson, Trump\u2019s appointee to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, said that while the building in Grosvenor Square carried substantial American historical significance, a new facility was needed to \u201cbetter protect American citizens and our British neighbours\u201d and meet \u201cthe complex challenges of the 21st century and beyond.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he said, it was entirely paid for by the sale of other London properties owned by the U.S.\n\nThe sale of the embassy in Grosvenor Square alone was never anticipated to cover the whole cost of the new embassy. The sale of the embassy combined with the proceeds from the sale of another building in Grosvenor Square the year before for $500 million would cover the cost, according to a Washington Post story in 2008 about the announced deal to purchase the Nine Elms property.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the sales price for the old embassy has not been publicly released, and the State Department did not divulge that price when we asked. But the sales price is likely far more than the $250 million cited by Trump.\n\nAccording to Reuters, local media reported the old embassy was sold for about 500 million pounds, roughly $680 million, to Qatari Diar Real Estate, a wing of the Qatari government. But Reuters was not able to independently verify that figure.\n\nBut assuming that figure is roughly accurate, that sum together with the reported $500 million from the sale of the lease of the nearby building is pretty close to the reported price of the new embassy in Nine Elms.\n\nAnd as we said, the current U.S. ambassador to the U.K., a Trump appointee, said the new embassy property and building were \u201cPurchased and built from the sale of our London properties, the new embassy did not cost the US taxpayer a cent.\u201d\n\nThat was the plan all along, a State Department official confirmed that in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, the Department developed a plan to finance a new Embassy project through a property swap for existing U.S. government property in London,\u201d the official told us. \u201cThis solution allowed construction of a new chancery that meets all security standards, yet used no taxpayer dollars to fund the project. The approximately $1 billion project budget includes the costs for site purchase, design, and construction. The project has been executed within the established budget.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. embassy in London is not the only diplomatic facility that has drawn Trump\u2019s ire.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump also repeated his distorted claim about the cost of a new embassy in Jerusalem. Trump told supporters he balked at the reported $1 billion cost for a new facility and that David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, assured him he could open a \u201ctemporary\u201d embassy in Jerusalem within months by renovating and adding to a \u201ccorner\u201d of an existing facility, and at a cost of just $150,000.\n\n\u201cBig difference, right?\u201d Trump said, drawing cheers from the crowd. \u201cBiiiiig difference. So we went from a billion dollars to $150,000. \u2026 So we save a bit.\u201d\n\nBut as we wrote when he made a similar claim in March, Trump is comparing the cost of renovating an existing facility in Jerusalem to use as an interim embassy on a temporary basis with the cost of building a new, permanent embassy in Jerusalem. Since the State Department is moving ahead with plans to build a permanent facility, it\u2019s unclear if the construction of a temporary facility will reduce the ultimate cost of a permanent home or not.", "lang": "en"}
