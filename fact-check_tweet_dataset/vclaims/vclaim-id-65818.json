He then goes on to claim that there is growing animosity against BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) due to their agenda to pitch Hindus against Muslims. As of this writing, the video has over 1.4 lakh views and more than 9,000 shares. The caption shared along with the video says, \u201cBJP MP Sunny Deol Ko Sikh Bhaiyyo Ne Gurudware Se Dhakke Deke Nikala\u2026ILYAS SHARAFUDDIN SLAVE OF ALLAH.\u201d\n\nThe same video was also shared by the Facebook page \u2018Shakeel Patni\u2019 earlier on May 31.\n\nIt has been circulated on Twitter as well.\n\nA YouTube search with the keywords \u2014 Sunny Deol Gurudwara \u2014 led us to multiple video reports on the BJP leader when he offered prayers at Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Deol, now an MP, was BJP\u2019s candidate from the constituency. Below is a video report by The Indian Express where Deol can be seen at the place of worship on May 2, 2019. Deol can be seen in the same clothes in the viral video and the one uploaded by The Indian Express. He was surrounded by hundreds of people who had gathered at the Gurudwara for a glimpse of the actor-turned-politician. This can be seen in many other videos. Furthermore, we did not find any media reports which claim that Sunny Deol was thrown out of a Gurudwara due to growing animosity against BJP. A one-year-old video shot during election campaigning for Lok Sabha elections was therefore shared with a false claim.", "lang": "en"}
