Both were historic elections, but they\u2019ve been coupled with falsehoods about Islam.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked some of them. Social media posts falsely claimed, for example, that former President Barack Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota to help elect Omar. Other posts falsely claimed Omar said, \"I think all white men should be put in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam.\"\n\nNow a May 8 Facebook post with a false claim about Minneapolis, which Omar represents, is gaining traction.\n\n\"The city of Minneapolis has set up a Sharia hotline for residents to report citizens who criticize Islam, in order to prosecute them for \u2018hate crimes,\u2019\" reads the text above a photo of a woman wearing a hijab. \"Wake up America!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nIn June 2017, the city of Minneapolis opened a new hotline to report hate crimes. A hate crime, according to the city, \"is any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone\u2019s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity. This includes prejudice-motivated property damage (including graffiti), stalking and assault.\"\n\nReporting citizens who \"criticize Islam\" is not listed.\n\nAt the time, Velma Korbel, director of the city\u2019s Department of Civil Rights, said \"hate-motivated speech\" had no place in Minneapolis. That raised suspicions about free speech. But Korbel later said the hotline \"is not a tool to curtail anybody\u2019s free speech, nor is it set up to compel anybody to worship or not worship in a way that they choose.\"\n\nThe city isn\u2019t the first to debut such a hotline (see: New York City and Seattle, among others), but as the Star Tribune reported in July 2017, it became \"a focal point of criticism in the blogosphere, where it was called a political move designed to quell speech in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s election.\"\n\nOne website, which called it a \"Sharia hotline for hate speech snitches,\" included a comment by former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who said the hotline was a way to impose \"Islamic anti-blasphemy laws on non-Muslims.\" We fact-checked that and rated it Pants on Fire.\n\nThis Facebook post is also smelling smoky.\n\nWhile Minneapolis announced the hate-crime hotline at a time when assaults against Muslims in the United States were on the rise, the new city service was not tailored to address crimes against Muslims and it makes no mention of Sharia. Rather, it\u2019s aimed at reporting crimes motivated by prejudice against someone\u2019s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
