Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of that image. \n\n\n\nWhen the photo in the post was subjected to the reverse image search technique, several search results were obtained. From those search results, the image in the post seemed to be a photoshopped one. The original image was found in the \u2018AP\u2019 Photo library. The image had the following text with it- \u2018Bespectacled Mahatma Gandhi, who eventually led India to its independence, laughs with the man who was to be the nation\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, at the All-India Congress committee meeting in Bombay, India, on July 6, 1946. Nehru took office as president of the Congress during the session. Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-violent resistance, including civil disobedience and fasts, drove India to independence in 1947 after nearly 200 years of British rule. The father of modern India, the Mahatma, which means great soul, was assassinated in 1948 for his tolerance of other religions\u2019.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the image of Gandhi in close proximity to a woman is a photoshopped one. The original image is that of Mahatma Gandhi with Jawaharlal Nehru. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
