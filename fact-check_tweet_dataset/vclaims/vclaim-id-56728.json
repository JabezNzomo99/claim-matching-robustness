Ron DeSantis, as implemented, requires visitors from hard-hit areas to complete a form with contact information as part of a requirement that they self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\n\u201cAfter the stay-at-home, shelter-in-place order was issued, you started having a flood out of New York City, taking hundreds of flights to the state of Florida,\u201d DeSantis told reporters in Tallahassee as the order went into effect. \u201cThose flights became the hottest ticket. ... It is mostly South Florida, but we saw 30-40 flights direct to Orlando.\"\n\nThe claim regarding airport forms was raised on the Facebook page of Health Nut News. An original posting was updated to make it clear the requirement did not apply to all incoming flights, only those from the three Northeast states hard-hit by the virus.\n\nSubsequent public posts from Facebook users included photos of the documents.\n\nThe requirement is authorized under Executive Order 20-80 issued by the Republican governor on March 23, although it does not specifically spell out the use of a traveler form. Instead, it directs the Florida Department of Health to take whatever steps necessary \"to ensure the screening and appropriate isolation and quarantine of individuals covered by this Order.\"\n\nThe governor, in the decree, noted that Florida is experiencing an increase in individuals fleeing to Florida from states where \"shelter-in-place\" orders are being implemented, including from the New York Tri-State area.\n\nThe order added that it was the duty of every state law enforcement official to help the Department of Health enforce the quarantine.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation, discussing its implementation of the order, said, \"Upon arrival to Florida, each arriving traveler or responsible family member (if traveling as a family) will be required to complete an airport traveler form.\"\n\n\"The form requires key information related to the traveler\u2019s history including contact information and trip details be provided to DOH,\" the transportation department said. \"Failure to complete the form and failure to follow any isolation or quarantine order from DOH are a violation of Florida law.\"\n\nThe DOT also noted that \"members of the Florida National Guard will be on site at airports throughout the state to help ensure the process runs efficiently.\"\n\nGreg Meyer, spokesman for the Broward County Aviation Department, said passengers traveling from eight New York City areas were given forms to fill out before boarding their flights to Florida, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\n\nThe arriving passengers are also given a travelers card that contains contact information and additional guidance if a person develops coronavirus symptoms.\n\nThe requirement is not applied to all incoming flights, rather focuses on those from the New York area.\n\nAs of May 19, the health department said, more than 37,400 traveler forms have been collected at public-use airports across the state.\n\nThat original order was followed by EO 20-82 on March 24, also aimed at the New York area as well as visitors from places experiencing \"substantial community spread\" of the coronavirus. It added a requirement that these visitors must \"inform individuals in Florida with whom they have had direct physical contact in the past 21 days that they traveled from an area with substantial community spread.\"\n\nFailure to abide by these executive orders could subject individuals to imprisonment up to 60 days and a fine up to $500.\n\nOn March 27, the governor issued EO 20-86 that specifically included visitors from Louisiana.\n\nIt spelled out the use of highway patrol roadblocks on Interstate 10, which passes through Louisiana, and Interstate 95, which extends to New York. Unlike the airport decree, it specifically required visitors from affected states to fill out a traveler form.\n\nThe health department said 36,900 travelers had filled out the forms as of May 19.\n\nMore:Florida Keys to reopen to tourists June 1, over two months after closing over coronavirus concerns\n\nFlorida does require airline travelers from areas hard-hit by the virus, especially New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, to fill out a traveler form with contact information and to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.
