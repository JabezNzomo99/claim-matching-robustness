John Nygren offered some numbers to support his case. Nygren, R-Marinette, is co-chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee.\n\n\"Our plan is better for working, middle-class families; 88% of the tax relief goes to those making $100,000 or less,\" Nygren tweeted Feb. 12, 2019. \"(Gov. Tony Evers\u2019) plan benefits higher income earners. Only 75% of the tax relief goes to those making $100,000 or less.\"\n\nEvers vetoed the GOP tax plan on Feb. 20, 2019, saying he didn\u2019t want to address a major fiscal policy item outside the budget. But with the tax cut showdown likely to continue in some form, we\u2019ll still dive into the numbers.\n\nDo they support Nygren\u2019s claim about how they impact the middle class?\n\nThe math is right. But\u2026\n\nNygren\u2019s staff pointed us to a pair of memos from the state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that estimate the impact the two plans would have on Wisconsin income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s analysis shows the Republican plan would send 87.9 percent of tax savings to taxpayers with a federal adjusted gross income of less than $100,000.\n\nAnd the proposal from Evers and the Democrats would direct 74.5 percent of savings to that group.\n\nBut there is a big catch.\n\nThe Democratic tax cuts are bigger overall \u2014 totaling $441 million compared to $338 million for the Republican plan.\n\nSo while a larger share of the GOP tax cuts would go to those making less than $100,000, the actual amount of tax savings for that group is lower.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 plan would save a total of $328 million for taxpayers making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 plan would save that group $297 million.\n\nThis chart shows the total projected tax savings for various income levels under the two plans:\n\nNygren says the Republican tax cut plan is \"better for working, middle-class families,\" citing as support the percentage of tax cuts going to Wisconsin residents with incomes under $100,000.\n\nThe numbers are accurate, so far as they go. The problem is they show only part of the picture.\n\nThe Democrats are proposing a larger overall tax cut that would result in more tax savings for those under $100,000 in earnings \u2014 even if that accounts for a lower percentage of the overall tax cut package.\n\nSo the statement is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details. That\u2019s our definition of Half True.", "lang": "en"}
