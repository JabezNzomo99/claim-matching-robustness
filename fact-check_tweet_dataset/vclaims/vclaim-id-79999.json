(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to the John Wayne Birthplace & Museum in Winterset, Iowa, which responded to an email from PolitiFact saying: \"In our research, we do not find that John Wayne stated that.\"\n\nHe didn\u2019t say it in Playboy in 1971, and searching for the exact quote that appeared in the Facebook post turned up eight web pages, mostly meme sites, but no credible, original sources. We found similar results searching for an abbreviated version of the quote.\n\nNext we searched the Nexis database for the quote in all available English-language publications and found nothing. Searching for \"John Wayne\" and \"American flag\" and \"town square,\" we couldn\u2019t find the quote or anything similar, though a 2003 story about rural Texas auctions in the Los Angeles Times quotes a man who wants a full-sized American flag emblazoned with Wayne\u2019s image.\n\nWe\u2019ll reconsider this fact-check if a source for this statement surfaces. In the meantime, we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
