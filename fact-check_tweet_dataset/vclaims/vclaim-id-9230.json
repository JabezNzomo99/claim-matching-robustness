Doctors Are Urging Parents Everywhere To Keep Their Kids\u2019 Baby Teeth There's an article going around Facebook claiming valuable stem cells can be salvaged from our baby teeth and, when preserved correctly, can provide a life-saving solution.\n\nWhether, to what degree, or when such potential uses for dental stem cells will actually come to pass.\n\nResearch shows that stem cells can be harvested from baby teeth and have potential dental and medical uses in repairing and regenerating tissues, and commercial facilities exist for the preservation and storage of dental stem cells for future use, at a price.\n\nStem cells, which differ from other types of cells in the human body in that they\u2019re capable of renewing themselves almost indefinitely and changing into more specialized cells with the potential to repair or replace specific tissues and organs, were discovered more than 100 years ago and, according to the National Institutes of Health, remain one of the most promising frontiers of medical research:\n\nThere are two basic kinds of stem cells, embryonic and adult. The former can only harvested from human embryos, while the latter are found in a variety of human tissues such as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, fat, and, since 2003, baby teeth. The scientists who discovered that the pulp of baby teeth is rich in stem cells also noted that SHED (\u201cstem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth\u201d) have unique properties:\n\nAnother innovation in stem cell technology is the implementation of stem cell banks \u2014 specifically, cord blood stem cell banks and dental stem cell banks for the purpose of enabling parents to cryopreserve and store their children\u2019s stem cells for use in reparative or regenerative medical treatments later in life. Any number of articles touting the use of such facilities are circulating online, including \u201cDoctors Are Urging Parents Everywhere to Keep Their Kids\u2019 Baby Teeth,\u201d which, despite its title, doesn\u2019t name or quote a single physician who actually recommends it.\n\nNor is there any mention of the cost of these services. One such facility, called Store-A-Tooth, charges $1,749 up front plus $120 per year for storage. Another, The Tooth Bank, charges $475 plus $115 per year for storage. And there\u2019s StemSave, whose services cost $630 up front and $120 per year. There are others within approximately the same range.\n\nThe main question facing most parents, then, is whether the potential benefits of preserving their kids\u2019 baby teeth justify the expense. The answer is possibly not. Research is ongoing and the future looks promising, but no one can predict when or to what degree those promises will be fulfilled. To date, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve the use of dental stem cells in any medical procedure.\n\nThis is what the California Dental Association had to say about dental stem cell banking in 2013:\n\nScientific study into cell-based therapies has identified tremendous potential for the use of stem cells to treat a number of diseases and disorders. As research has advanced, stem cell banking services, primarily umbilical cord blood banking, have sprung up around the country. More recently, researchers have discovered that stem cells harvested from deciduous teeth may be a source of tissue regeneration and repair. Like the marketing of umbilical cord banking to pregnant women, dental pulp stem cell tissue banks have begun to market to dentists and the public. Despite its exciting potential, experts agree it is premature to consider dental pulp stem cells as a source of cells for replacing or regenerating tissue.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know,\u201d the CDA quotes Dr. Pamela Robey of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research as saying, \u201cis the cells from dental pulp in baby or wisdom teeth have the ability to make dentin and pulp and they might have the ability to make bone, but right now that\u2019s all we really know for sure \u2026 we can\u2019t say how useful for the future they\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nConsidering the uncertainties and the cost, then, parents would be well advised to seek the opinion of a knowledgeable medical professional and carefully weigh their decision before investing in a baby tooth bank account.", "lang": "en"}
