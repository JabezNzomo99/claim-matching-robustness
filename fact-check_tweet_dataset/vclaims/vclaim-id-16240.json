It realised just one MP from the party\u2019s 3.9 million votes at the 2015 election.\n\nIf the system were perfectly proportional, that 12.4% of the vote would give UKIP 12.4% of MPs\u2014around 80 out of 650 in total.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for a change from the current \u2018first past the post\u2019 system, estimates that UKIP would have won 80 seats under a \u2018list PR\u2019 system, 54 under a \u2018single transferable vote\u2019 regime, and stayed at one using the \u2018alternative vote\u2019 that was rejected at a 2011 referendum.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how people would have voted if a different system was in place, and the actual votes cast don\u2019t tell you about people\u2019s second preferences.\n\nThese proportional systems involve selecting more than one preference, whereas in the general election people could only vote for one party. The different electoral scenarios were put together by conducting a survey of people\u2019s party preferences just after the election.", "lang": "en"}
