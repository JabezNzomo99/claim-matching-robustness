There is no evidence it is Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser.\n\n\n\nA meme circulating on social media attempts to portray Christine Blasey Ford as the \u201cLeft\u2019s latest weapon\u201d to undercut President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the photo used to illustrate that argument \u2014 of a woman holding a sign that says, \u201cNot my president\u201d \u2014 is misleading. We could find no evidence that the individual in the photo is Ford, the California professor whose accusation of sexual assault against Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh has roiled his confirmation process.\n\nThe photo in question is actually available on stock image websites, including Alamy and iStock. It was taken at a November 2016 rally in New York City. And the woman in the photo doesn\u2019t appear to match Ford, as she is seen in a widely circulated photo.\n\nA friend of Ford\u2019s did tell the Mercury News, of San Jose, California, that Ford attended a local Women\u2019s March in 2017, and later a March for Science. But there is no evidence she was at the New York rally.\n\nFord, who is a registered Democrat, has also donated small amounts to support Democratic candidates and groups, according to Federal Election Commission data. Through ActBlue, she contributed $42 in 2017 and less than $40 in 2014.\n\nThe meme emerged amid a deluge of misleading and false content that has taken aim at Ford in recent days. For example, viral stories claimed that Kavanaugh\u2019s mother, who was also a judge, foreclosed on the home of Ford\u2019s parents in the 1990s \u2014 giving Ford a motive for retribution. But, as we wrote, Martha Kavanaugh, actually approved a motion to dismiss the case at the bank\u2019s request \u2014 and the Blasey family still owns the property.\n\nFord, in an interview with the Washington Post published Sept. 16, claimed that Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both drunk, forced her into a bedroom while at a house party in Montgomery County, Maryland, in the early 1980s. The allegation was the subject of an earlier, confidential letter sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which the Democratic senator provided to the FBI. The FBI said it received the letter last week.\n\nThe Post reported: \u201cWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d Ford said in the interview. \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d\n\nFord reportedly recalled that the friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of the two, allowing her to run from the room. She said she locked herself in a bathroom and then left the house. The Post also reviewed a therapist\u2019s 2012 notes about the alleged encounter, from a couples therapy session in which Ford relayed some details about the incident.\n\nKavanaugh, through the White House, has called Ford\u2019s claim \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBrown, Emma. \u201cCalifornia professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault.\u201d The Washington Post. 16 Sep 2018.\n\nProdis Sulek, Julia. \u201cChristine Blasey Ford feared an avalanche of attacks if she went public about Kavanaugh, friends say.\u201d The Mercury News. 17 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
