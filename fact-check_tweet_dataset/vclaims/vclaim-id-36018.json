This has been clarified by the Income Tax Department in a tweet.\n\nThe fake notice can be read below.\n\nThe last date to file one's income tax returns for assessment year 2019 -2020 was previously extended by a month earlier this year - from July 31 to August 31. Therefore, the time at which this fake notice has surfaced is opportune; just one day before the final date of filing returns.\n\nMany users online have spread this and fallen for this message.\n\nArchived versions of the tweets above can be found here and here.\n\nThe Income Tax Department, however, has clarified that no such extension has been given through a tweet. It consists of the same letter as shared above.\n\nThe tweet can be viewed below.", "lang": "en"}
