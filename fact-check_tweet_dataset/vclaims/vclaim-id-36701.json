No, that's not true: The professor did not give students such an assignment, but he did post a Facebook message suggesting that Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 American cultural heritage sites that might be bombed by Iran. The professor, who claimed it was a joke, was fired by the college.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Liberty Hub on January 9, 2020, titled \"Professor Asks Students to Create List of 52 US Cultural Sites for Iran to Bomb\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nSeveral days before the professor's Facebook post, President Trump tweeted a warning that he had a list of 52 Iranian sites, including culture sites, ready for targeting by U.S. missiles:\n\nAsheen Phansey, who served as director of sustainability and an adjunct professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, never asked students to compile a list. But in response to Trump's tweet, Phansey wrote in a Facebook post on January 7, 2020, that could only be seen by his friends:\n\nAlthough the post was deleted, so was the professor's name from the school's staff list.", "lang": "en"}
