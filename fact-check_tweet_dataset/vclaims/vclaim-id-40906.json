It is noteworthy that the government has imposed a complete ban on public spitting and public urination in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSoon after the video was aired by leading channel, several prominent social media users picked it up and shared it with an anti-Muslim angle.

The uncivilised has crossed limits\u2026\u201d\n\nAnother user named Sudhir Mishra shared the clip. He is followed by Bagga and the Office of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Ankur Singh shared the video and wrote, \u201cWomen being used to throw spit inside houses in Kota, Rajasthan. Who\u2019s making them do this?\u201d\n\nOne Ridhima Pandey tweeted the video and claimed that COVID-19 was intentionally spread by those who are supported by anti-social elements.\n\nAccording to a report in The Times of India the incident indeed took place in Rajasthan\u2019s Kota. Five women were held for throwing spit bags into houses in Vallabhvadi area under Gumanpura police station. \u201cDuring preliminary investigation, the women admitted that they had thrown spit filled polythene bags into the houses over being denied alms. However, they denied spreading coronavirus infection,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cThe five women, identified as Mala Bawari (30), Anariya Bawari (65), Dulari Bawari (35), Asha Bawari (35) and Chanda Bawari (20), residents of Bapu Kacchi Basti in Kunhari, were on Tuesday produced before the court that ordered to send them to jail under 14-day judicial custody,\u201d SHO Gumanpura Manoj Sikarwar has been quoted in the report.\n\nTV9 Bharatvasrh aired a video report on the incident which carries a statement by SP Gaurav Yadav: \u201cWe traced the women within 24 hours and rounded them up for investigation. The women are residents of Kunhari area and hail from the Bawari community. They beg for alms in the area. They spat after being denied alms. Till now we haven\u2019t found any link with corona, the reason being that no positive cases have been reported in the area. The area where positive cases were reported is quite far.\u201d\n\nA local channel \u2018Kota News\u2019 also carried a video report along similar lines. The channel spoke with SHO Sikarwar who said that the investigation has not found that the act was carried out to spread coronavirus.\n\nTherefore, the CCTV footage was first sensationalised by the media and subsequently communalised on social media.", "lang": "en"}
