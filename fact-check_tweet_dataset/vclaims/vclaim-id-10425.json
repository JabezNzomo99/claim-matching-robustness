There were over 300,000 stop and searches in 2016/17, compared to 1.4 million in 2009/10\u2014meaning the overall number of stop and searches fell by 78%.\n\nWhile it's tempting to take the higher arrest rate as an indicator of success, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) note that an arrest isn't necessarily a success, nor is a failure to uncover any wrongdoing necessarily a failure.\n\nOffenders could, for instance, be arrested even if they're found to be empty of stolen or prohibited goods because they might react violently to officers or be wanted for another offence. On the flipside, failing to uncover wrongdoing could be regarded as a success if, without the stop and search powers in place, the person under suspicion would otherwise have been arrested unnecessarily.\n\nHMICFRS also reports that \u201cWhile stop and searches on white people have decreased by 78 percent, stop and searches on people from BAME communities decreased by 69 percent. The decrease for black people was even lower, at 66 percent.\u201d This is based on stop and searches under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which make up the vast majority of stop and searches.\n\nPeople who self-define as black or black British are the most likely to be stop and searched of any ethnic group\u2014it\u2019s estimated at around 29 per 1,000 in 2016/17. They\u2019re over eight times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and that ratio has been rising in recent years.\n\nHMICFRS said in December 2017 that the rising ethnic disparity in stop and search frequency \u201chas the potential to erode public trust and confidence in the police, particularly amongst black people, despite the reductions in the use of stop and search powers\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
