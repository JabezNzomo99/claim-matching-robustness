The article, in turn, linked to a November 2013 report from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Economics & Statistics Administration.\n\ncontained the figures Mother Jones cited, saying turkeys have more than doubled in weight -- from an average of 13.2 pounds in 1929 to 29.8 pounds in 2012.\n\nWe found that, if anything, Mother Jones might be light on its claim.\n\nThe average weight for 2013 is actually a half-pound higher, at 30.3 pounds, according to Michael Klamm, an agricultural statistician at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nHowever, the 2012 figure cited by Mother Jones is considered final, whereas the 2013 figure is still subject to revision, Klamm told us.\n\nSo, how\u2019d turkeys get so fat?\n\nMother Jones reported that the size of turkeys has grown, particularly since the 1950s, as the nation\u2019s poultry operations began to breed turkeys for size in order to meet Americans\u2019 demand for meat.\n\nIn government-speak, the Department of Commerce said the increase \"is a result of large increases in turkey industry productivity due to technological innovations in turkey breeding and specialization in turkey raising methods.\"\n\n\"The modern bird is too heavy and misshapen to procreate the old-fashioned way,\" the day before Thanksgiving 2013. \"And A.I. means that good genetic material can be easily spread around.\"\n\nBut it\u2019s almost Thanksgiving Day. Is turkey OK to eat?\n\n\"If you are looking for a lean cut of meat, turkey is hard to beat,\" Harvard Medical School. \"A 3-ounce serving of skinless white meat contains 26 grams of protein, barely 2 grams of fat, and under 1 gram of saturated fat,\" and \"it\u2019s healthy on the heart.\"\n\nNow don\u2019t call us late for dinner.\n\nMother Jones magazine said: \"Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds. In the \u201830s, they weighed 13.2 pounds.\"\n\nThose, in fact, are the latest-available federal figures. \"Today\" is actually a reference to 2012, but the preliminary figure for 2013 is even higher, at 30.3 pounds.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
