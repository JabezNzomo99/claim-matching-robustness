The report said Guiliani canceled his participation after learning that Russia was behind the event.\n\nOn September 30, the day of Giuliani\u2019s scheduled speech, his name was still listed on the agenda handed out to the press. According to journalists attending the conference, no explanation was given regarding the change of the agenda.\n\nThe Kremlin claimed on September 30 that Russia had nothing to do with Giuliani\u2019s invitation. \u201cThe Russian side knows nothing about Giuliani\u2019s participation, [or] the cancellation of his participation,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said.\n\nNeil Hauer, a journalist and security analyst based in Yerevan, Armenia, told Polygraph.info that the Armenian Foreign Ministry had told him it was not involved in inviting Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThe Armenian MFA told me they could not provide any information on Giuliani since his invitation was not sent through their official channels, so it must have come from someone else,\u201d Hauer said.\n\nEvidence suggests that the Giuliani invitation came from the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), which is headquartered in Moscow.\n\nThe panel on which Guiliani was scheduled to appear was moderated by Sergey Glazyev, who was an adviser to Putin from 2012 through last month. Glazyev became a candidate for a top position at the Eurasia Economic Commission, the executive body of the Eurasian Economic Union, during the Union\u2019s August 9 summit in Kyrgyzstan, pending confirmation of the EAEU member states during the September 30 meeting in Armenia.\n\nOn October 1, Russia announced Glazyev\u2019s appointment as the Eurasian Economic Commission\u2019s Minister of Integration and Macroeconomics.\n\nSergey Glazyev is best known for his calls to cut Russia off from the Euro/Dollar zone and for the country to focus its monetary resources on domestic production. Among his books is one titled \"The Last World War: The United States Start and Lose.\"\n\nGlazyev also was the first to publicly question the loyalty of top Russian officials who the U.S. did not include on the so-called \u201cKremlin list.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view the main criterion of personnel policy in our country under conditions of \u2018war with America\u2019 must be landing on the American sanctions list. Those who are on it are beyond suspicion of being called an American agent. Those who are not \u2013 it is precisely them about whom I have a very big question,\u201d Glazyev said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Glazyev in 2014 for his role of Russia\u2019s annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula and orchestrating the war in the eastern Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration created the Eurasian Economic as an alternative to the European Union.\n\nThe EAEU is supposed to be a fully transparent democratic organization with a rotating leadership and consensual decision-making.\n\nA closer examination of the EAEU\u2019s structure and its documents, however, reveals that the power over its management, and decision-making lies with the Eurasian Economic Commission, whose headquarters are permanently located in Moscow and to which Glazyev was appointed on October 1.\n\nArticle 18 of the Treaty of the Eurasian Economic Union, signed in October 2014 in Astana, Kazakhstan, states that the Commission is a permanent regulatory organ based in Moscow, Russia.\n\nAnnex I to the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union states that the Commission \u201cprovides for the conduct\u201d of all EAEU meetings, including the forums of the Supreme Council like the one that took place in Yerevan this week and at which Guiliani was listed as a speaker.\n\nMoreover, the list of the participants, including guest speakers, is determined and approved by the Commission, which is led by people from Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThus, Peskov\u2019s claim that Russia had nothing to do with the Giuliani\u2019s invitation is false.\n\nThe Russian government website listing government orders of goods and services, Zakupki.ru, lists hundreds of orders tied to the Eurasian Economic Union. Among the most current of them, for instance, is the order for the sum of 120,784,000 rubles (approx. $1,866,061.61) paid from the Russian federal budget to an unidentified contractor for \u201cproviding services in organizing \u2026 the digital agenda of the Eurasian Economic Union,\u201d placed on August 7 and completed on August 29.\n\nThe Moscow City Department of Foreign Economic and International Relations paid another 7,500,000 rubles (approx. $115,846.91) to an unidentified contractor \u201cfor providing services in organizing conference and business negotiations regarding trade and economic cooperation in the framework of the meeting of the Eurasian Economic Union in Yerevan, Armenia.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, listed as the main sponsor of the Supreme Council of the Eurasian Economic Union in Yerevan, has provided no information regarding funds dedicated to the EAEU. The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported in July that the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Eurasian Economic Commission were preparing a special program to replace supplies from abroad with EAEU-produced products worth at least $4 billion.\n\nThe financial arm of the Eurasian Economic Commission, the Eurasian Development Bank, declared an investment portfolio worth $3.9 billion as of October 1, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
