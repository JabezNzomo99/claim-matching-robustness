The report said a lack of water quality data predating oil and gas exploration prevented it from reaching \u201cfirm conclusions.\u201d Sen. James Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, made his remarks in a statement issued Nov. 10 \u2014 the day that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality issued a report on water-supply wells in Pavillion, a small town southeast of Yellowstone National Park. The industry-funded state report specifically looked at the \u201clikelihood of impacts from oil and gas operations\u201d on 14 water-supply wells used by residents living near Pavillion. Since the 1990s, residents in the area have \u201ccomplained of physical ailments and said their drinking water was black and tasted of chemicals,\u201d ProPublica reported. Inhofe, Nov. 10: The Wyoming DEQ\u2019s thorough investigation over the past several years has come to a close and confirms what we\u2019ve known all along: hydraulic fracturing has not impacted drinking water resources. But that\u2019s not what the report said. The \u201cfact sheet\u201d for the Wyoming report said it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that hydraulic fracturing had \u201cany impacts\u201d on these water-supply wells, but \u201c[l]imited baseline water quality data, predating development of the Pavillion Gas Field hinders reaching firm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes.\u201d In the next sections, we\u2019ll examine why it\u2019s difficult to isolate fracking from other potential causes of water contamination, and why the Wyoming report didn\u2019t reach \u201cfirm conclusions.\u201d We\u2019ll also review the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s research to date on fracking practices that take place across the country, and Inhofe\u2019s unsupported claim that it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking does not impact drinking water.\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique often used to retrieve natural gas and oil often from shale, a rock layer deep below the earth\u2019s surface. The process entails injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure, releasing oil and gas that would otherwise be difficult to recover. About half of U.S. crude oil production and two-thirds of natural gas production now involve fracking \u2014 a significant share of production that has steadily increased over the last 15 years, according to the Energy Information Administration. With this boom have come concerns about the impact of oil and gas drilling on water quality, as we wrote in March 2015 when we checked another false fracking claim made by Inhofe. Much of the debate surrounding whether fracking has led to groundwater contamination in Wyoming and elsewhere stems from a lack of water quality data predating fracking and oil and gas production in general. Without this information, researchers are less equipped to assess the relative impact of three possible sources on water quality: naturally occurring phenomena, conventional oil and gas recovery methods, and unconventional methods, including fracking. Since 1960, for example, both conventional and unconventional methods have been used to extract fuel from the Pavillion gas field. If water quality data had been collected before the drilling started, and since then, scientists could have compared that data with trends in the use of specific practices over the years. Conventional methods typically include drilling vertically to recover more easily accessible fuel from relatively shallow, permeable rock. Fracking and horizontal drilling, often used in unison, fall under unconventional methods. As its name suggests, horizontal drilling often involves drilling deeper to less porous shale rock and then drilling horizontally. (See the adjacent image.) This enables a single well to cross through a greater portion of a fuel reservoir and, as a result, recover more fuel. But fracking doesn\u2019t necessarily have to occur deep below the earth\u2019s surface or in horizontal wells. In fact, fracking was used in some relatively shallow Pavillion field wells, which means the activities took place closer to the aquifer tapped by residents\u2019 water-supply wells. All of the 169 wells in the field are also vertically-drilled wells, according to the EPA. Both conventional and unconventional fuel recovery methods have the potential to negatively impact groundwater resources, as do naturally occurring processes, such as bacteria proliferation or the natural movement of methane underground. So how could the boom in oil and gas production from fracking lead to water contamination? Among other mechanisms, methane, the main component of natural gas, could leach into aquifers through improperly constructed drilling wells or through cracks underground produced during the fracturing process. However, methane can naturally migrate into aquifers without the help of fracking, blurring the line between natural and anthropogenic, or human-caused, sources. Salty fracking fluids, which can contain toxic chemicals, also could leach into the aquifer after they\u2019re disposed of improperly or spilled. Lastly, fracking can influence the underground ecosystem\u2019s biology, further blurring the line between natural and anthropogenic causes. For example, bacteria are known to interact with the fracking process. In fact, a species of bacteria \u2014 the so-called \u201cFrackibacter\u201d \u2014 has specifically evolved to live in the subterranean environment shaped by fracking. Generally, bacteria have \u201cboth positive and negative impacts on energy recovery,\u201d the Ohio State University researchers who discovered the new bacteria wrote in their paper published in Nature Microbiology in September. For one, some bacteria play an important part in producing natural gas in the first place. But during the recovery of the fuel, bacteria can \u201csour\u201d the fuel by producing sulfide, a toxic chemical that smells like rotten eggs. Bacteria can also contribute \u201cto corrosion [of the drilling well] and the risk of environmental contamination,\u201d the researchers wrote. To kill these bacteria, \u201cbiocides like formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are thrown down the [wells] in an attempt to preserve a usable [fuel] product,\u201d reported Wired. These chemicals could then leach into aquifers in the routes described above. After wells are abandoned, these bacteria can also \u201ccome back with a vengeance, generating acidic byproducts that can corrode pipes and release heavy metals,\u201d Wired wrote. There are ways to distinguish natural from anthropogenic causes, such as using isotopic analysis, which aims to distinguish the signatures of different sources of compounds, but the technique isn\u2019t always sensitive enough to detect the difference. Overall, given the lack of baseline data, it\u2019s often difficult to \u201cconfirm\u201d that fracking in particular has played a role in water contamination.\n\nThe Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced that it would undertake the water-quality study in June 2013 \u2014 about 18 months after the EPA released a draft report that found chemicals associated with fracking in the groundwater near Pavillion.\n\nThe EPA decided to turn the investigation over to the state after its report was criticized by state officials, Congress and industry representatives, according to a Dec. 6, 2015, report by the Casper Star-Tribune. The Wyoming newspaper obtained about 56,000 EPA documents in a Freedom of Information Act request that the paper said revealed \u201can EPA worried it could not defend its Pavillion study against an onslaught of criticism.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the state would \u201cfurther investigate\u201d the water quality in Pavillion, the EPA said it \u201cstands behind its work and data,\u201d but \u201cdoes not plan to finalize or seek peer review of its draft Pavillion groundwater report released in December, 2011.\u201d\n\nThe Wyoming state study was headed by a private company, Acton Mickelson Environmental Inc., and was funded by Encana, the company that owns Encana Oil and Gas (USA) Inc., which operates the Pavillion gas field.\n\nWe emailed Kevin Frederick, water quality administrator at the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, to ask what role state scientists played in the report. He told us they \u201cobserved sample collection, evaluated sample results, and participated in development of the draft and final reports\u201d while working with Acton Mickelson Environmental Inc.\n\nAs we previously noted, the fact sheet for the Wyoming report concluded it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that fracking had \u201cany impacts\u201d on these water-supply wells. However, it added, \u201cLimited baseline water quality data, predating development of the Pavillion Gas Field hinders reaching firm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes.\u201d\n\nInstead, the state report said bacteria \u201cmay be a cause of taste and odor issues\u201d with the well water.\n\nBut in its comments on a draft of the report, the EPA argued that the state didn\u2019t support many of its conclusions with enough data. The EPA said \u201cdata limitations and uncertainties \u2026 suggest a need for additional investigation to provide support for many of the Report\u2019s conclusions.\u201d\n\nThe EPA also commented on the state\u2019s conclusion that bacteria may be to blame for residents\u2019 complaints about the poor taste and odor of the drinking water. The EPA agreed that the report showed a \u201ccorrelation\u201d between \u201cdissolved organic compounds,\u201d such as methane, in the water and the \u201cproliferation of bacteria.\u201d But it argued that this correlation doesn\u2019t \u201cestablish \u2026 the source.\u201d\n\nIn other words, fracking and related practices could be indirectly to blame for water quality issues.\n\nIn its final version, the Wyoming report did state that gas in the water could be from anthropogenic and/or natural sources.\n\nThe state report also concluded that it\u2019s unlikely that fracking fluids have interacted with \u201cshallow groundwater supplying the study wells,\u201d in part, because of the depth at which the fracking occurs underground. The water-supply wells reach 30 feet to 675 feet below the surface, while the \u201cshallowest\u201d fracking occurs \u201cgenerally deeper than 1,500 ft,\u201d the state said.\n\nBut the EPA in its comments on the draft report countered that the fracking of some of the drilling wells \u201coccurred at a substantially shallower depth.\u201d\n\nAlso, Dominic DiGiulio and Robert Jackson, earth and environmental scientists at Stanford University, published a paper in March in the journal Environmental Science and Technology that linked shallow fracking to toxic chemicals in aquifers in Pavillion.\n\nFor example, \u201cAcid stimulation and hydraulic fracturing occurred as shallowly as\u201d 699 feet and 1,056 feet below the surface, respectively, \u201cat depths comparable to deepest domestic groundwater use in the area,\u201d the authors wrote. Like hydraulic fracturing, acid stimulation (e.g. hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid) is used to improve oil and gas recovery.\n\nIn an interview with WyoFile, a local Wyoming news outlet, DiGiulio, who was an EPA scientist for over 25 years and co-authored the agency\u2019s 2011 draft report on Pavillion, said his 2016 study with Jackson stops \u201cshort of saying that there\u2019s strong evidence tying\u201d fracking to impacts on the water wells. But their paper had found that fracking has impacted the groundwater, which is water that may be used in the future.\n\nIn other words, DiGiulio and Jackson looked at groundwater generally, while the state looked at specific wells \u2014 an important distinction.\n\nIn an email DiGiulio and Jackson told us the state needs to install monitoring wells, solely used for research purposes, in the area to delineate the extent of groundwater contamination and to \u201cbetter address risk posed to domestic water wells.\u201d\n\nThe EPA did install two monitoring wells in the Pavillion field and used data collected from them in its 2011 report. However, the state didn\u2019t use this data for its report because some expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about the construction and sampling of the two wells during the public comment period for the EPA report.\n\nDiGiulio and Jackson also told us that about 20 additional water wells, out of 121 wells total, should be tested due to their proximity to unlined pits, where fracking fluids and other toxic byproducts of oil and gas exploration were disposed.\n\nDiGiulio and Jackson told us that \u201cthere can be a lag period of decades before contaminants\u201d in groundwater reach a water well. \u201cThese contaminants present a long-term unaddressed risk to domestic water wells\u201d if the contaminants continue to move upwards toward water wells, they added.\n\nRegardless of the criticisms of both state and federal investigations, even if the conclusions made in the Wyoming report are taken at face value, they still don\u2019t \u201cconfirm\u201d that \u201chydraulic fracturing has not impacted drinking water resources\u201d near Pavillion, as Inhofe claimed.\n\nInhofe draws national implications from the Pavillion study, claiming it adds to growing body of scientific research that proves fracking does not contaminate groundwater.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the facts have prevailed and the record is abundantly clear, with even the EPA affirming that \u2018hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources\u2019 in its landmark water study,\u201d Inhofe said in his Nov. 10 statement.\n\nIt is not, however, \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking does not impact drinking water and there is evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nInhofe is referring to a June 2015 draft report in which the EPA said it \u201cdid not find evidence\u201d that hydraulic fracturing has \u201cled to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources in the United States.\u201d But the EPA\u2019s draft report has been challenged by its own advisory board and a final report has yet to be issued.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board wrote a letter dated Aug. 11 to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, stating that the EPA failed to \u201cquantitatively\u201d support its conclusion that fracking has \u201cnot led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources.\u201d The board also said the EPA didn\u2019t \u201cclearly describe\u201d whether the conclusion pertained to groundwater and/or surface water nor what exactly it meant by the terms \u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cwidespread.\u201d\n\nIf the EPA wanted to retain its conclusion in its final report, the agency should address these issues, the advisory board said.\n\nOn Nov. 21, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency is \u201ctrying to wrap [the final report] up soon,\u201d but she didn\u2019t specify a date. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to listen to the direction of the science advisory board,\u201d but the \u201cchallenge for us is to characterize what we know\u201d without over-generalizing limited data, she added.\n\nInhofe has cited the draft EPA report in the past to support his position that fracking has no impact on drinking water. He claimed last year that the EPA draft report \u201cconfirms\u201d that fracking is \u201csafe.\u201d As we said at the time, the EPA reported specific cases of water contamination related to fracking and made no determination of safety.\n\nSimilarly, Inhofe draws sweeping conclusions from the Wyoming state study that are not supported by the research.\n\nAs we already explained, the state report did not reach \u201cfirm conclusions on causes and effects of reported water quality changes\u201d in specific wells, while the DiGiulio and Jackson study of Pavillion did find evidence that linked shallow fracking to toxic chemicals in the area\u2019s groundwater.\n\nResearchers know that shallow fracking and poor well integrity, which occurred in Pavillion, can raise the likelihood of water contamination. So how common are these practices?\n\nAn estimated 16 percent of fracked wells in the country are less than a mile deep (i.e. shallow), according to a separate survey published by Jackson, DiGiulio and others in Environmental Science and Technology in July 2015. Most of those shallow wells are located in Texas and California.\n\nBut the researchers believe that their estimate is low. They predominately looked at wells drilled in the U.S. between 2010 and 2013. At the beginning of 2012, only a few states \u2014 Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas \u2014 mandated companies to report well data to FracFocus, the database the researchers used to conduct their analysis. For other states, reporting is voluntary.\n\nThe researchers also looked at state regulations governing fracking well construction and groundwater protection and found that they varied widely.\n\nFor example, some states, such as New Mexico and Utah, do not have to have minimum surface casing depths. Surface casings are pipes within the wells that aim to prevent water contamination. If they don\u2019t extend beyond the groundwater level, there\u2019s a higher chance of contamination.\n\nIn Wyoming, however, surface casings must reach deeper than \u201call known usable groundwater,\u201d the researchers explained. And in Texas, drilling wells that have \u201cless than 1,000 feet of vertical separation\u201d from groundwater require additional testing for integrity.\n\nDiGiulio and Jackson conclude their paper by suggesting that operators should provide more information about their wells in the form of a \u201cmandatory state or federal registry,\u201d which \u201cwould allow people to track the locations, depths, and volumes of chemicals used around them.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the researchers argue that state or federal governments should require \u201cfull chemical disclosure \u2014 without trade secret exemptions \u2014 for all chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing above 3000 ft.\u201d While most states do require disclosure of some chemicals, oil and gas operators don\u2019t have to report them all because of trade secrets laws, which also protect Coca-Cola\u2019s recipe, for example.\n\nWhile Inhofe says it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that fracking has no impact on drinking water resources, the fact is that researchers do not have the data to make such a sweeping and firm conclusion \u2013 specifically in Pavillion and more generally in the U.S. at large.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
