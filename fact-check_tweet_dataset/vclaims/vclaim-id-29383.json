It may be a paraphrase of a statement by Presbyterian minister John Witherspoon.\n\nMadison, who served as the country\u2019s fourth president from 1809 to 1817, was one of the foremost framers of the Constitution.\n\nHis writings give little indication as to his views on religious doctrine, leading to scholarly debate about his religious convictions. According to some historians, Madison was a Deist, rather than a conventional Christian as the misattributed quote would suggest.\n\nThough he persistently advocated for religious freedom, Madison did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his collected works. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t sound like anything Madison would say, and indeed sounds like something he would staunchly disavow,\u201d Terence Ball, professor emeritus and Madison expert at Arizona State University, told The Daily Caller.\n\nThe quote may be a paraphrase of a similar statement: \u201cAccursed be all that learning which sets itself in opposition to the cross of Christ!\u201d This statement was made in a sermon by Witherspoon, the one-time president of the College of New Jersey, which would later become Princeton University.\n\nMadison himself attended the college from 1769 to 1771, studying under Witherspoon. A handful of years later, Witherspoon became the only clergyman to sign of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe quote has also been attributed to Jonathan Dickinson, the College of New Jersey\u2019s first president. However, we couldn\u2019t locate any source contemporary to Dickinson crediting him with the quote. Historian Bryan Lebeau told the Caller that he could find no record of Dickinson making this statement.", "lang": "en"}
