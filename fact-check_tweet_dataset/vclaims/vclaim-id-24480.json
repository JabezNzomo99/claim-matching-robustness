Ernst & Young (EY) chief economist Jo Masters said there were now 462,000 more Australians looking for work than there were job vacancies. Ms Masters said low-interest rates alone wouldn\u2019t lift wages if employers could not find staff. \u201cUntil we plug the gap between labour supply and labour demand it will be difficult to generate significant wage growth in Australia,\u201d the report said. [1]\n\nOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson told Breakfast TV\u2019s The Today Show economists don\u2019t always get it right. She said the country was in \u201cdire straits\u201d and more money needed to be invested in infrastructure projects such as water and coal to create more employment and solve the problem of more people looking for work than there were jobs. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Pauline Hanson\u2019s claim there were 462,000 unemployed people in Australia.\n\nThe latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to June 2019 showed there were 692,700 unemployed people in Australia. Seasonably adjusted, the figure was 711,500. [3]\n\nThe number of 462,000 quoted by Pauline Hanson on breakfast television comes from an EY report, sent to AAP FactCheck by EY, and refers to the gap between the number of people unemployed compared to the number of job vacancies. [2]\n\nThe original number of job vacancies in Australia stands at 230,800 and 241,500 when seasonally adjusted, according to the most recent May figures from the ABS released on July 4, 2019. [4]\n\nUsing the latest ABS original figures, the original number of unemployed in June was 692,700 while the number of job vacancies in May was 230,800. The difference or the gap between these two figures is 461,900, or rounded-up 462,000, people looking for work for whom there are no jobs. [3] [4] This is the figure quoted in the EY report.\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck finds the claim made by Pauline Hanson that there were 462,000 people unemployed in Australia was false. The One Nation leader appears to have misread or misunderstood an EY economist\u2019s report and mixed up the figures. She used the job gap rate of 462,000 - the gap between the number of unemployed people versus job vacancies - instead of the much higher unemployment figure of 692,700 - 711,500 for June 2019.", "lang": "en"}
