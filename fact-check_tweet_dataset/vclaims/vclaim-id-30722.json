But people commenting on the clip, posted by an account called \"Lets Make it Viral LMIV,\" weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\"ROFL,\" one person wrote. \"Those are fox pups, and, no koala is going to get milk like that.\"\n\n\"Reported for being fake,\" someone else said.\n\nThe video, which has been viewed thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because they\u2019re foxes, not koalas. Wildlife photographer Luc Durocher posted the video on Facebook in December 2014. He posted it again on Jan. 28, after Snopes reported that it contacted him about the miscaptioned video on YouTube. This time, he was more specific in his description of the video.\n\n\"The young are thirsty,\" he wrote in French. \"Red foxes.\"\n\nHe places the video in a park in Montreal, Canada.\n\nIn another video of red foxes suckling that Durocher posted on YouTube in 2014, you can more clearly see their faces \u2014 and there\u2019s no confusing them for koalas.\n\nWe rate the YouTube post that claims these baby animals are koalas False.", "lang": "en"}
