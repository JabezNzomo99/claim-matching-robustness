Community bankers have complained that it imposed regulatory burdens \u2013 largely aimed at larger banks \u2013 that are not necessary.\n\nAlex Conant, a Rubio spokesman, said his statement was in reference to the \u201cgeneral fall of community banks, 40 percent since 1994.\u201d He pointed to a media account of a 2015 working paper published the Harvard Kennedy School, \u201cThe State and Fate of Community Banking,\u201d by Marshall Lux and Robert Greene.\n\nThis is, of course, entirely different than what Rubio asserted during the debate. This is a trend line that starts 16 years before Dodd-Frank was enacted.\n\nLux, who said he was apolitical, said that \u201cRubio is simply wrong\u201d to pin so much of the decline on the law. \u201cCommunity banks had been consolidating for a long time before Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of good things in Dodd-Frank. To throw out the whole thing is, frankly, a political statement that doesn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge of the banking system behind it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Lux said his research showed that Dodd-Frank may have exacerbated the negative trend lines affecting smaller banks. Community banks (defined as those with assets under $10 billion) lost 6 percent of their share of banking assets in the four years before Dodd-Frank \u2014 and then lost more than 12 percent in the four years after the law\u2019s enactment, the report concludes. The researchers calculated the numbers by analyzing data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nThe report, which documents the importance of community banks in lending to farmers and for real estate transactions, pins at least some of the blame for the dwindling share of banking assets on Dodd-Frank:\n\n\u201cWhat is behind the decline of the community bank? Technology is obviously a factor. It may drive consolidation but ensure that some traditional banking services will be available if community banks\u2019 role in the banking sector naturally diminishes. Yet many commentators, community bankers, and regulators have also expressed fear or produced research showing that Dodd-Frank has exacerbated the preexisting trend of banking consolidation by piling up regulatory costs on institutions that neither pose systemic risks nor have the diversified businesses to support such costs.\u201d\n\nGreene said number of community banks (banks with less than $10 billion in assets consolidated at the holding company level) decreased from 6,937 to 6,094 between the second quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2014 \u2014 about a 12 percent decline. A slightly longer dataset, published by the Mercatus Center, which goes to the end of 2014, indicates a 14 percent decline in community banks.\n\nWhile Rubio\u2019s number for the nation is wildly off course, the American Banker newspaper noted that it is closer to the mark for Florida \u2014 where the number of banks has fallen by 37 percent since June 30, 2010, according to the FDIC.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a big difference between 14 and 40 percent \u2014 though to answer our reader\u2019s question, even the correct figure shows that hundreds of banks have closed since Dodd-Frank was enacted.\n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely clear this is all the fault of the law. The number of banks has plunged in the last two decades, so the best case that Rubio could make is that the law has possibly increased the pace of closures. But he cannot so sweepingly blame the law\u2014and he needs to get his numbers straight.", "lang": "en"}
