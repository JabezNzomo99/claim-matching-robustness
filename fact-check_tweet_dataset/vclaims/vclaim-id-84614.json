There are some who fall more often than others. Alt News brings you the interesting case of S. Gurumurthy, co-convener of Swadeshi Jagran Manch.\n\nMr. Gurumurthy has repeatedly fallen for misinformation. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Sharing the news that Angola has become the first country to ban Islam, Gurumurthy wondered about how liberals will react. Little did he realize that he was sharing a hoax. You can read more about it in this BBC article.\n\n2. Gurumurthy played the classic \u201cIf true\u201d trick while sharing an edited video of Rahul Gandhi. \u201cListen and think for yourself\u201d, he tweeted Gurumurthy while sharing a video of the Congress President. The video was clearly doctored.\n\nThe video was originally shared by @superlonday as a joke.\n\n3. Gurumurthy was among those who fell for the \u2018nano chip in the 2000 rupee note\u2019 hoax.\n\n4. Gurumurthy has even shared misinformation about music composer AR Rahman. \u201cJust read and share\u201d he tweeted, along with a poster which had a photo of AR Rahman and a fake quotation. The fact that the poster was shared by Postcard News, a known peddler of fake news escaped his notice.\n\nYou can read the fact-check by SMHoaxSlayer on this fake news here\n\n5. The Onion is a satirical news website, but Gurumurthy probably took it in all seriousness when he tweeted a link to an article which was titled \u201cHistorians Admit To Inventing Ancient Greeks.\u201d\n\nFrom GPS chip in Rs 2000 note to Postcard News memes, it is ironical that one of the most regarded right-wing ideologues and prolific political and economic commentators repeatedly falls for the most obvious hoaxes.", "lang": "en"}
