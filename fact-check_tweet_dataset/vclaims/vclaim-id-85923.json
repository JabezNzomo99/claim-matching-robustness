Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told a tale about a brown paper bag that was apparently too good to check.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:38:52Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85923", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/06/a-story-too-good-to-check-paul-ryan-and-the-story-of-the-brown-paper-bag/", "vclaim": "The first thing we did was look for Eloise Anderson and stories about brown paper bags. We discovered a congressional hearing, held on July 31, 2013, and chaired by Ryan, that focused on the War on Poverty. Ryan asked Anderson, who appeared as an expert witness, what should be done to make the food stamp program, also known as SNAP, work better.\n\nMy thought has always been around the SNAP program even when it was called \u201cfood stamps\u201d is, why do you have this program, school program, school breakfast, school lunch, school dinner, when do we start asking parents to be responsible for their children? You know, a little boy told me once that what was important to him is that he didn\u2019t want school lunch, he wanted a brown bag because the brown bag that he brought with his lunch in it meant that his mom cared about him. Just think what we have done. If this kid tells me a brown bag was more important than a free lunch, we\u2019ve missed the whole notion of parents being there for their children because we\u2019ve taken over that responsibility, and I think we need to be very careful about how we provide programs to families that don\u2019t undermine families\u2019 responsibilities.\n\nOkay, so Anderson had testified about this boy, and claimed that she had spoken to him and realized that welfare programs were draining any sense of responsibility. As she put it, \u201cIf this kid tells me a brown bag was more important than a free lunch, we\u2019ve missed the whole notion of parents being there for their children because we\u2019ve taken over that responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. Wonkette, a satiric blog, wondered if Anderson\u2019s story was actually derived from a 2011 book titled \u201cThe Invisible Thread,\u201d by Laura Schroff, which is about a busy executive and her relationship with an 11-year-old homeless panhandler named Maurice Mazyck. His mother was a drug addict, in jail, who had stolen things and cashed in food stamps to pay for drugs. At one point, Schroff offers to bring Mazyck lunch every day so he won\u2019t go hungry. The exchange goes like this:\n\n\u201cLook, Maurice, I don\u2019t want you out there hungry on the nights I don\u2019t see you, so this is what we can do. I can either give you some money for the week \u2013 and you\u2019ll have to be really careful about how you spend it \u2013 or when you come over on Monday night we can go to the supermarket and I can buy all the things you like to eat and make you lunch for the week. I\u2019ll leave it with the doormen, and you can pick it up on the way to school.\u201d\n\nThis actually seemed a little strange. Could the tale told in congressional testimony really be drawn from a book? It did not make much sense in part because Schroff and Mazyck are partnering with a group called No Kid Hungry to help end childhood hunger in the United States. One key part of the program is connecting hungry kids with federal programs such as school lunches and food stamps. The group also opposed Ryan\u2019s 2013 budget for its proposed reductions in the food stamp program.\n\nIn the course of giving live testimony, Secretary Anderson misspoke. What she had intended to say was the following: \u201cOnce I heard someone say, \u2018what was important to him as a boy was that he didn\u2019t want school lunch, he wanted a brown bag because the brown bag that he brought with his lunch in it meant that his mom cared about him.\u2019\u201d Secretary Anderson was referring to a television interview which she had seen with Maurice Mazyck.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there is no discussion in the book about the school lunch program, and we could find no interview with Mazyck in which he said that. He simply repeats the story as told in the book, without any larger political context about federal programs to help hungry children. Moreover, this incident happened more than 25 years ago; Mazyck is no longer a boy but in his late 30s.\n\nHere at The Fact Checker, we often deal with situations in which people misspeak. We certainly don\u2019t try to play gotcha. But this is a different order of magnitude. Anderson, in congressional testimony, represented that she spoke to this child \u2014 and then ripped the tale out of its original context. That\u2019s certainly worthy of Four Pinocchios.\n\nBut what about Ryan? Should he get a pass because he heard this from a witness before Congress? It really depends on the circumstances. In this case, he referenced the story in a major speech. The burden always falls on the speaker, and we believe politicians need to check the facts in any prepared remarks.", "lang": "en"}
