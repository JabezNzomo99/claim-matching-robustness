No, that's not true: the death hoax was put out by a site that belongs to a network of known fake news sites that often publish death hoaxes about celebrities that have been reported by legitimate media to be ill, in hospital or in accidents.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by \"AP News\" (not the real Associated Press) on September 3, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Kevin Hart dies a day after suffering 'major injuries' in car crash - News AP\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHart did suffer major back injuries in a crash last Sunday:\n\nBut later reports indicated he would be just fine, although he faces a long revalidation period:\n\nKevin Hart Will Require Months of Rehab After Car Crash TMZ Kevin Hart is on the mend, but he won't be out of the woods for a long time, the comedian will require extensive physical therapy ...

But all of them taken together strongly suggest it is the same person or persons.
