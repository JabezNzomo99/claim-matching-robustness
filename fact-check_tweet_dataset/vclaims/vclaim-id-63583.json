Police dismissed the claim as a scam.\n\n\u201cPeople are going door to door handing out masks. They say it\u2019s a new initiative from local government. They ask you to please put it on to see if it fits. It\u2019s doused with chemicals which knocks you out cold. Then they rob you!!\u201d claim the posts. The warning started circulating in late March 2020.\n\nOne April 5, 2020 post from a user whose profile says she is based in the US state of Georgia was shared more than 41,000 times. The claim also circulated on Instagram here, here and here.\n\nIn April and May 2020, a photo with a version of the claim on a flyer was also shared more than 14,000 times from a user in Tampa, Florida, 5,900 times from a user in the state of New York, and more than 500 times from a Saskatoon, Canada user.\n\nAnother view of the poster shows that it appears to have been put up by the board of directors at the Townhomes of Westbay Cove, a community in Tampa, Florida.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence of a rash of thefts taking place after people accepted masks from strangers.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any of that,\u201d Jamel Lane\u00e8, a spokeswoman for the Tampa Police Department said.\n\nJulie Clark, a public affairs official for the Saskatoon Police Service in Canada, said by email: \u201cWe have not heard of this scam in Saskatoon. Investigators have not received any reports of this.\u201d\n\nColleen Book, spokeswoman for the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, added: \u201cGovernment of Saskatchewan is not handing out masks through any kind of public program and we are not sending representatives door-to-door at this time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Carlos Campos of the Atlanta Police Department said via email that he was not aware of \u201cany crime\u201d like the one described in the post happening in the capital city of Georgia.\n\nAFP Fact Check also debunked the claim after it circulated in Dutch.", "lang": "en"}
