The purported quote states the media network\u2019s closure is related to its negative coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte. The claim is false; the graphic has been doctored to include a fabricated quote; it was originally published by another Philippine broadcaster with a different quote.\n\nThe graphic was shared in this Facebook post on May 9, 2020.\n\nIt bears the logo of One News, a Philippine media organisation, and shows remarks that Christopher Lawrence \"Bong\" Tesoro Go purportedly made on May 4, 2020.\n\nThe purported quote from Go translates from Tagalog to English as: \"No one else should be blamed for the closure of ABS-CBN except itself. If it did not hurt the feelings of the President then it would not have come to this. Don't they know, if the president is hurt, the people are hurt too. / SEN. BONG GO / MAY 4, 2020\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption states: \"Bong Go admits that ABS CBN closed because it hurt the feelings of Digong. So no one can do anything about it.\"\n\n\u201cDigong\u201d is a nickname for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, to whom Senator Bong Go is a close aide, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 top broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air on May 5, 2020, after failing to renew its operating licence. The network has seen proposals to extend its franchise languish in Congress since running afoul of Duterte in 2016, AFP reported here.\n\nThe same graphic has also been shared here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the graphic has been doctored.\n\nThe original graphic was published here on One News\u2019 Twitter account on May 4, 2020, one day before ABS-CBN was forced off air.\n\nThe graphic was included in the tweet about Go\u2019s proposal to delay mandatory health insurance contributions from overseas Filipino workers (OFW) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTranslated to English, the direct quote in the One News graphic reads: \"What I'm asking is for OFWs to be provided the needed 'extension' due to the hardships they are facing now. All the extensions we can provide in times of crisis, let us provide. They say, 'in times of crisis, every single peso counts'. Let us properly explain all the benefits of being a member of PhilHealth.\"\n\nOne News also posted on Twitter to alert its audience to the doctored graphic.\n\n\u201cThis quote card using the name of One News has been altered to spread false information,\u201d One News wrote here on May 9, 2020. \u201cIt is not true that Sen. Bong Go issued the statement on ABS-CBN's shutdown.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of One News\u2019 tweet, which shows a side-by-side comparison of its original graphic and the doctored graphic, stamped \u201cFAKE\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
