Bush in December 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act. The program passed by a close margin after Republican leadership whipped votes for several hours.\n\nFebruary 2004 from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which experts told us did the most thorough work on the issue, show that 25 percent of adults favored Part D, while 38 percent had an unfavorable view. The rest were either neutral or didn\u2019t know.\n\nThose numbers didn\u2019t change much until November 2006, after the enrollment period had been open nearly a year, said Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University.\n\nBy contrast, in September 2013 the Affordable Care Act registered a 39 percent favorable rating and a 43 percent unfavorable rating, according to . That hasn\u2019t changed all that much since the law was drafted in 2009.\n\nSo if Obama was measuring how many people liked Medicare Part D (25 percent) compared with the health care law (39 percent), he\u2019s right that Obamacare is more popular.\n\nBut the health care law also has higher unfavorable ratings. Polling shows that 43 percent have an unfavorable view of Obamacare, while fewer, 38 percent, had an unfavorable view of Medicare Part D.\n\nWe\u2019ll note that those who didn\u2019t want to express an opinion about Medicare Part D was much higher than the health care law, at 37 percent versus 17 percent.\n\nBoth polls have a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Factoring these in leaves unfavorability ratings a wash, while Obamacare still sees a significantly higher favorability rating.\n\nAs for the point Obama intended to make by noting the statistics, that Medicare Part D became more popular as people became familiar with it, we found that also holds water. Today, out of every 10 seniors are satisfied with Medicare Part D, though we should note that\u2019s according to the Healthcare Leadership Council, which is made up of health care executives.\n\n\"When you think of the popularity of Part D today, it\u2019s easy to forget how divided people were,\" Hoadley said. \"People felt like they didn\u2019t have enough information to understand the program.\"\n\nOf course, it\u2019s too soon to say if Obamacare will have the same long-term success in the public eye. Robert Blendon, a Harvard University health policy professor, said that poll results could start to shift as early as May, after enough people have had personal experiences with the law.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be a consumer issue rather than a policy issue,\" Blendon said.\n\nObamacare\u2019s popularity will also be affected in the next few years by the rhetoric of elections in 2014 and 2016, Hoadley said. So while people could look back years from now and not remember the act being a sharply divided policy issue, that shift won\u2019t likely happen overnight.\n\nNow, the comparison Obama sets up isn\u2019t the most straightforward, Blendon said. The prescription drug program for seniors is just one part of Medicare, which began in 1965. For students of politics, comparing Medicare itself with Obamacare would be more apples-to-apples. The former was favored by a majority of Americans at the time it was passed.\n\nTo illustrate that the Affordable Care Act can overcome its low popularity ratings, Obama claimed that Medicare Part D was even less popular when it first passed. Polling data shows that a lower percentage of people favored Part D in 2004 than favor Obamacare in 2013. However, depending on the margin of error, a slightly higher percentage of people may view the president\u2019s reform unfavorably compared with Part D.
