Many times, what they say is out of revenge for criticism against them.\u201d\n\nPabillo indeed said that in an interview with ABS-CBN on April 14. However, he did not \"strongly\" or \"fiercely\" resist the proposal as the report made it appear. The interview on ABS-CBN\u2019s Bandila shows Pabillo calmly reacting to the proposal.\n\nThe gossipdiary.comstory was posted a day after ABS-CBN.com published the report seeking the Catholic Church's comment after Alvarez suggested in March that church-run schools be taxed.\n\nThe original website was created in 2008. In October last year, it was bought and turned into a site that publishes stories by \u201cDuterte\u2019s Angels.\u201d\n\nThe biggest traffic generators on social media are President Rody Duterte - Federal Movement International, Marcos Loyalist and Alan Peter Cayetano Supporters International, and could have reached more than 2.1 million people.", "lang": "en"}
