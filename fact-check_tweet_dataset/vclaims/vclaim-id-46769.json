Adam Schiff posing for a photo with dead convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein was photoshopped into the image. The original picture shows Schiff posing with his father.\n\nEpstein, a convicted sex offended, was arrested in July on charges of sex trafficking underaged girls that he was accused of luring to his homes in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida. In August, he was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell in what officials ruled a suicide.\n\nBefore the allegations came to light, Epstein had an impressive rolodex of rich and powerful friends, including former President Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey and Prince Andrew. President Donald Trump and Epstein were also friends at one point but later had a falling out, according to Trump.\n\nFeatured in the photo are Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Epstein. The image was shared by multiple users on Facebook, presumably to suggest a link between the two.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff and Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cFriendship and pedophilia.\u201d (RELATED: Did Trump And Jeffrey Epstein Pose For A Picture With A Young Ivanka?)\n\nFound through a reverse image search, the original image actually shows Schiff sitting on a couch with his father, Ed Schiff, on Nov. 22, 2018. Schiff shared the actual photo on his verified personal Twitter account to wish people a \u201cHappy Thanksgiving\u201d that year.\n\n\u201cEve and I are spending a wonderful Thanksgiving with my 90 year old Dad, Ed, and cousins Karen and Julia,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cAlexa is away for her studies and Eli is our photographer! Wishing you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving!\u201d\n\nThe image that\u2019s been widely shared on Facebook has been doctored. Epstein\u2019s head has been superimposed onto Schiff\u2019s father\u2019s head, and a sex toy has been photoshopped onto the coffee table.", "lang": "en"}
