No, that's not true: the wild conspiracy theory was launched by a Belgian satire website aiming to make a point about wild conspiracy theories. It is not true and the article itself says so right away, directly below the headline.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NordPresse on December 14, 2018 titled \"Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt abattu afin qu'il ne puisse dire qu'il \u00e9tait aux ordres du gouvernement\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThis article has the sole purpose of making fun of the conspirators who will share it in the first degree without even reading it. It will allow them to consolidate their opinion, based only after seeing a screenshot of a government tweeter account that did not automatically reset to local time. Of course, once they have seen this information, they will not look any further and will not even wonder why no one saw this tweet before 9:00 PM while it would have been posted at 16:55 .\n\nUsers on social media would have only seen this title and thumbnail:\n\nThe reference to the tweet was about a conspiracy theory that went viral after an official government tweet announcing Chekatt's rampage seemed to have been published before the event happened. This was due to a mixup involving timezones:\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse. It is run by Vincent Flibustier who also offers media training about fake news on his website, he clearly knows what he is talking about.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: French Interior Minister Did NOT Announce Plan To Release Calm Jihadists to Make Room for Yellow Vests in Prisons\n\u2022 Fake News: BFMTV Did NOT Report Wearing Yellow Vests is Now Banned Until Further Notice\n\u2022 Fake News: Televison NOT Reporting 23 Dead, 300 Severely Wounded at 'Gilets Jaunes' Demonstration in Paris\n\u2022 Fake News: No 12 (or 123) Dead At 'Gilets Jaunes' Protests in France\n\u2022 Fake News: French Army Not Getting Ready to Stop Demonstration of Yellow Vests", "lang": "en"}
