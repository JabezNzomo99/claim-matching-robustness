Pew pegged the figure at 340,000 in 2008, while CIS gave a range of 300,000 to 400,000. Under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, all were recognized as U.S. citizens at birth.\n\nPew estimated that four out of every five children born to at least one authorized immigrant parent were born in the United States, for a total of 4 million in 2009. That number has probably grown by an additional 2 million in the past six years. Birth rates have declined since the Great Recession, so it\u2019s possible the annual figure has dropped slightly below 300,000 (7.5 percent of 3.9 million births is about 294,000), but not by much.\n\nWith about 70 percent of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras, it\u2019s a safe bet that two-thirds of these children are born to parents with Latin American roots. The next biggest population of undocumented immigrants is from China, Philippines, India and Korea \u2014 but with just 8 percent of the total, that\u2019s probably about 25,000 a year.\n\nSo what is Bush talking about? A spokesman says he is referencing an entirely different issue: women who come to the United States on tourist visas \u2014 and thus are on U.S. soil legally \u2014 but for the express purpose of having the child born in the United States.\n\nThe Washington Post wrote about the trend in 2010, noting that the regulations do not permit the State Department to refuse visas simply because a woman is pregnant. Rolling Stone magazine recently documented the case of a Chinese couple who paid $20,000 to be housed in a small hotel in Los Angeles while they were awaiting the birth of the child. The main motivation \u2014 ensuring the child could be educated in the United States.\n\nHow many women take this step? This is even more difficult to estimate. Steven A. Camarota of CIS in 2015 estimated the number of \u201cbirth tourists\u201d was about 36,000, after comparing the data for the number of foreign-born mothers who gave birth during the year against the number of such women who showed up in the U.S. Census. The gap was almost 36,000, but he cautioned that it was a very rough estimate.\n\nCamarota, in an interview, said the largest share of birth tourists was probably from East Asia, but many also came from Eastern Europe (such as Russia) and Nigeria. A report in Vice says that a handful of pregnant women board every flight from Moscow to Miami, which is apparently a popular spot for Russian birth tourists.\n\nBut The Huffington Post, quoting Chinese sources, said the total number of Chinese birth tourists is projected to be 60,000 in 2014, a sixfold increase over 2012 \u2014 apparently spurred on by a romantic comedy, \u201cFinding Mr. Right,\u201d about a Chinese woman who flew to Seattle so she could have an American baby (and also go shopping).\n\n\u201cThe conversation about immigrant families in the U.S. is typically centered around people from Latin America seeking economic opportunities in the States,\u201d The Huffington Post said. \u201cBut as incomes in China rise and visa hurdles fall, women from China are making up a larger share of foreign births in the U.S., and they\u2019re complicating many of the popular ideas about immigrant mothers.\u201d\n\nWhile precise figures are hard to come by, the number of children born to undocumented immigrants each year in the United States still easily outpaces the number of children born to women who come to the United States to give birth using a legal tourist visa. What is a more important issue is obviously a policy question beyond the purview of The Fact Checker.", "lang": "en"}
