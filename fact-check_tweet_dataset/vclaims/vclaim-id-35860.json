This is false; the local school board, the federal police, and a local reporter told AFP that no such incident took place.\n\nThis Facebook post and others like it were shared in Canada from February 7, 2020 and spread as news broke that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canada\u2019s federal law enforcement agency, had moved onto an activist camp blocking the construction site for a natural gas pipeline in northern BC, on Canada\u2019s west coast.\n\nThe posts claim that the arrests of blockaders on February 6 led to a subsequent attempt to apprehend their children at school in the nearby town of Smithers.\n\n\u201cYesterday in Smithers BC, the public school went into lockdown when RCMP arrived intending to apprehend the children of the people who were arrested on unceded Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory.\u201d\n\nHowever, the story is false.\n\nMatthew Monkman, assistant superintendent for British Columbia\u2019s school district 54, which includes Smithers, told AFP: \u201cNo school was put into lockdown. This appears to be completely fabricated.\u201d\n\n\u201cReports that the RCMP in Smithers entered a public school there to apprehend the children of people arrested at the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en camp nearby are absolutely not correct,\u201d Janelle Shoihet, a spokeswoman for the BC RCMP, told AFP in an email.\n\n\u201cI personally haven\u2019t heard anything to the effect of that rumor,\u201d Trevor Hewitt, a reporter for the local Interior News who has been covering the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en blockade, also told AFP.\n\nThe pipeline is planned to cross traditional territory of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation in order to move natural gas from northeastern BC to Canada\u2019s west coast for export.\n\nIndigenous elected officials have approved an amended route proposed by pipeline owner Coastal Gaslink. However, hereditary chiefs, who are not elected but draw authority from traditional Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en law, oppose the project, leading activists to block pipeline workers from accessing the Morice West Forest Service road, near Houston, BC.\n\nIn late December 2019, the BC Supreme Court gave Coastal Gaslink an injunction against protesters interfering with the pipeline\u2019s construction, which the Mounties enforced on February 6. Six people were arrested and an exclusion zone was established around the activist camps that same day.\n\nNews of the RCMP dismantling the activist camps led to several solidarity protests throughout Canada and in the United States on February 8 and 9, notably with blockades of Canadian National Railway tracks.\n\nOpponents of the pipeline reported on February 10 that several hereditary chiefs and other activists were arrested by the RCMP. An RCMP news release the same day reported that the police operation would soon be over.", "lang": "en"}
