Circulated along with a picture of Rushdie, the quote has been shared on social media and messaging platforms. Some WhatsApp users contacted Alt News seeking verification of the quote in question.\n\nThe quote has been shared widely on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe quotation attributed to Salman Rushdie is fake. The same statement had been circulated earlier as well. Alt News checked the Twitter profile of Salman Rushdie and found that this quote had been debunked by Rushdie himself, way back in 2015, wherein he had quote-tweeted a user, Lucy Wolf, saying, \u201cThank you for finding the source of this fake quote that people can\u2019t seem to stop quoting to justify their own bigotry.\u201d\n\nDespite being debunked by Salman Rushdie himself in 2015, the fake quotation continues to be shared in his name.", "lang": "en"}
