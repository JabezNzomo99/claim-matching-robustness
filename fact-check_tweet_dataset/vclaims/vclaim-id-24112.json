Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through Invid plugin, several YouTube links of the same video were obtained. The titles of a few YouTube results refer to this incident to have taken place in Goa. So, when googled with keywords \u201cHare Krishna devotees fight with Goa police\u201d, a Reddit article was found.

The persons in the photo of this article and the ones seen in the video posted are one and the same. As per the article, when a group of Russian members of the Hare Ram Hare Krishna group were singing religious chants in public, the police of Mapusa (a Goa town) region obstructed them. Due to this, the devotees entered into an argument with the police which later on led to a fight between them. In fact, many such videos are available on YouTube that make it clear that the event took place in Goa. You can watch them here, here and here.\n\nMultiple Goan newspapers also reported the incident when it occurred in 2008.\n\nTo sum it up, a decade-old video of Russian Hare Krishna devotees\u2019 public brawl with Goa Police is being shared as West Bengal Police attack on ISKCON members for selling Bhagavad Gita.", "lang": "en"}
