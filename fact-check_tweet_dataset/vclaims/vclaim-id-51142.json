It actually comes from John Innes Clark Hare\u2019s book \u201cAmerican Constitutional Law.\u201d\n\nThe image, posted Nov. 22, features a screen grab of a tweet from White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump. The tweet, in which she ascribes a quote about impeachment to Tocqueville, comes as her father, President Donald Trump, faces an impeachment inquiry over a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cA decline of public morals in the United States will probably be marked by the abuse of the power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office,\u201d she credits Tocqueville with saying.\n\nHowever, the quote does not appear in his canonical work \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d or any of his other writings. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his collected works for the expression but found no matches. (RELATED: Did Alexis de Tocqueville Say, \u2018The American Republic Will Endure Until The Day Congress Discovers That It Can Bribe The Public With The Public\u2019s Money\u2019?)\n\nHarvey Mansfield, author of \u201cTocqueville: A Very Short Introduction,\u201d told the DCNF in an email that while there is no record of it in Tocqueville\u2019s writings, the saying does express a similar sentiment to a line from Mansfield\u2019s translation of \u201cDemocracy in America.\u201d\n\nIn his translation, Tocqueville writes, \u201cOne should remark in the first place that in the United States the tribunal that pronounces these judgments is composed of the same elements and is subject to the same influences as the body charged with accusing, which gives an almost irresistible impetus to the vindictive passions of the parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is contrasting the mildness of American impeachment, just ejecting from office, with the harshness of jailing or killing the accused executive as punishments in European governments,\u201d Mansfield explained in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThe expression, debunked by numerous media outlets, actually comes from Hare\u2019s 1888 book \u201cAmerican Constitutional Law,\u201d though the wording varies slightly.\n\n\u201cIt was long since remarked by De Tocqueville that a decline of public morals in the United States would probably be marked by the abuse of power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office,\u201d wrote Hare.\n\nIn his book, Hare was not directly quoting Tocqueville but rather paraphrasing Tocqueville\u2019s views on impeachment in his own words to make a point about former President Andrew Johnson\u2019s 1868 impeachment. It\u2019s possible that readers mistook his characterization of Tocqueville\u2019s writing as a direct quote and subsequently attributed it to the 19th century French author and political scientist.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
