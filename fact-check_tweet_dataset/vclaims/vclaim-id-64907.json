Some Republicans say the site is filled with unreliable propaganda. \n\n \n\n Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on Recovery.gov and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and \"00th\" districts. \n\n \n\n \"The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist,\" Miller wrote. \"Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts. \n\n \n\n \"We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high,\" Miller wrote. \"The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida\u2019s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption.\" \n\n \n\n Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation \"unassigned congressional district.\" ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and we archived the Florida page that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data. \n\n \n\n We also looked into whether Democratic districts received more money than Republican districts , and rated that statement Barely True. \n\n \n\n Here, we're verifying Miller's statement that Recovery.gov listed congressional districts that do not exist. That was indeed the case until news reports brought attention to the wrong data. Officials removed the data the evening before Miller posted his newsletter, so that now the jobs and money are attributed to \"unassigned congressional district.\" So we rate Miller's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
