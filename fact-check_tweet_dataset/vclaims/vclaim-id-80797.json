Scott Walker has put caps on tuition increases, even amid budget cuts, saying he wants to be sure there is \"affordable\" tuition for the University of Wisconsin System.\n\nHe caught our attention May 16, 2016 when he said, on conservative talker Charlie Sykes radio show on WTMJ-AM, that rising tuition costs are far from unique.\n\n\"This is not just picking on the University of Wisconsin System,\" Walker said. \"This is a nationwide trend. Since \u201878, I think, tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation.\"\n\nWe have checked many claims about the cost of college tuition.\n\nIn 2014, for instance, PolitiFact National examined this claim: \"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year\u2019s full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.\"\n\nBased on national averages, a person could pay in-state tuition at most public universities with their summer earnings, but not for any school, such as one out of state. The claim was rated Mostly True.\n\nWe decided to check out Walker\u2019s claim, too.\n\nWhen asked for backup, Walker\u2019s team sent us to a Chart of the Day published by Bloomberg in 2012. The article said college tuition since 1978 has increased four times faster than inflation, but didn\u2019t cite a source for the statistic.\n\nWe turned to the National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing education data. The center, part of the U.S. Department of Education, provided data on undergraduate tuition going back to 1978. The numbers come from its annual surveys of colleges.\n\nIn 1978, tuition and required fees at all institutions averaged $1,073. By 2014, it increased more than 1,000 percent, topping $11,000. That\u2019s a big jump in cost.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s claim compared the increasing price of tuition to inflation.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is one measure of inflation, or how over time the value of money decreases. The CPI measures the change in cost over time for a representative basket of goods, such as food, housing, transportation and education.\n\nFrom 1978 to 2014, the index increased about 246 percent. So, clearly, the rate of increase for tuition has surpassed inflation. And the percent increase in tuition is more than four times the increase in inflation, as Walker claimed.\n\nSince Walker talked in the context of Wisconsin\u2019s public four-year college system, we took a look at tuition prices for those schools. Tuition at those institutions shot up from around $600 to more than $8,000 by 2014. That\u2019s more than a 1,000 percent increase.\n\nWhat about the total cost of an education?\n\nTuition is just a portion of the cost of a college degree and the costs for room and board have increased much slower than tuition. If tuition is combined with room and board, the price increase is about three times inflation since 1978, according to the same education and inflation data.\n\nSome experts say the out-of-pocket costs for tuition should be examined, rather than the published rates. Typically, few students pay the full amount, since many also get scholarships, grants and other financial aid.\n\nThe College Board reports data on the net tuition paid by students, but that data doesn\u2019t begin until the 1990s.\n\nSandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the Board\u2019s Trends in College Pricing and Trends in Student Aid reports, said the growth of actual prices is smaller than published prices, though still substantial.\n\nFor example, from 1990 until 2014, net tuition paid by in-state students at public four-year schools across the country doubled. In contrast, published tuition prices more than tripled during the same time period.\n\nWalker said since 1978, college \"tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation.\"\n\nAverage tuition prices from the National Center for Education Statistics and inflation rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point.", "lang": "en"}
