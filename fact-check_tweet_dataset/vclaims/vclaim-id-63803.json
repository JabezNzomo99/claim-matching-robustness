The claim is false; the images show coins with Aung San Suu Kyi's image created by a Burmese artist; as of August 2020, there was no international award for \"mother of the world\".\n\n\n\nThe images were published here on Facebook on July 28, 2020. The post has been shared more than 3,300 times.\n\nScreenshot of the misleading post, taken on July 30, 2020\n\nThe post's Burmese-language caption translates to English as: \"Good news: 43 countries signed the recognition of Mother Suu as the mother of the world\".\n\nAlso Read: Can Black Garlic Reduce Chances Of Developing Cancer? A Fact Check\n\n\"Delightfully sharing the good news that the title of 'Mother of the World' is signed by 43 countries. #When the love is true from the giver's side, the taker can feel it in their heart. Daw Aung Sann Suu Kyi.\"\n\nThe post includes a photo of Aung San Suu Kyi alongside two images of a coin. One coin contains an image of her alongside an engraving in English that reads: \"Mother of peace. Aung San Suu Kyi\". Suu Kyi's name can also be seen written in Burmese in purple ink.\n\nThe photos of the coin were posted on Facebook here and here and on blogs here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photos show a coin created by a Burmese artist. They were previously posted on this Facebook page for artist Aung Min on June 22, 2020.\n\nThe post's caption states in part: \"When the love is true from the giver's side, the taker can feel it in their heart. - Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\".\n\nThe artist also wrote in English:\n\n \"UNIQUE\n\n 75\n\n MOTHER OF PEACE\n\n HAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\n 19 JUNE 2020\".\n\nSuu Kyi celebrated her 75th birthday on June 19, 2020, according to reports published by Burmese media outlets The Myanmar Times here and The Irrawaddy here.\n\nAlso Read: This Video Of Muslims Praying In Front Of Hagia Sophia Was Shot In 2014\n\nPeacock, a popular iconography in Myanmar, is also used as a symbol of Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy.\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison of the images in the misleading post (L) and the pictures in Aung Min's post (R):\n\nThe artworks were also published here July 29, 2019.\n\nAs of August 2020, there was no international award for \"mother of the world\".
