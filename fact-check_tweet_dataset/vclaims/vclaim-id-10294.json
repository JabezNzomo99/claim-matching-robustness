Emergency services were alerted to the fire at Brassner\u2019s apartment by a silent alarm, according to CNN. On 8 April, the left-leaning Facebook page \u201cProud Snowflakes\u201d posted a widely-shared meme which read:\n\nThe meme accurately describes Trump\u2019s opposition to 1999 regulations on mandatory sprinkler installation, but also leaves out what appears to have been a change of mind by the future president, who later voluntarily installed the safety devices in another of his buildings despite the absence of a legal obligation.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, a spate of deadly apartment fires in New York City prompted then Mayor Rudy Giuliani to establish a panel to examine fire safety proposals as a matter of urgency. In 1998, 92 out of 107 deaths caused by fires took place in buildings without sprinklers (as reported by the New York Times at the time) and inadequate inspections of sprinklers in a Brooklyn apartment led to a fire that killed three firefighters that December.\n\nFire safety advocates and victims\u2019 relatives joined in appealing to New York City Council members to make sprinklers mandatory in apartment buildings, but some real estate developers \u2014 including Trump \u2014 voiced opposition to that proposed law. On 30 December 1998, the Times reported:\n\nArchie Spigner, the chairman of the City Council\u2019s Housing and Buildings Committee, said yesterday that he received a telephone call this week from Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer, who expressed concern about the high cost of installation and other problems that he had with sprinklers. Mr. Trump confirmed yesterday that he had \u201dreceived and placed calls\u201d from and to various city officials\u2026 \u2026Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, said yesterday that most fatal fires occur in two- and three-family homes, not in high-rise buildings that have fire-resistant construction. He and Mr. Trump said that in addition to being costly \u2014 up to $4 per square foot to equip an entire building, Mr. Spinola said \u2014 sprinklers were also prone to vandalism and mishaps, and widely disliked by tenants for esthetic reasons. \u201dWe believe that the code that exists in New York City basically gives us the safest buildings,\u201d Mr. Spinola said. \u201dWe don\u2019t believe sprinklers are necessary to have the safest buildings.\u201d\n\nHowever, within a few months, reports appeared that Trump had adjusted his stance slightly and in March 1999, the New York City Council passed a compromise law that required \u201cnew residential buildings with four or more units\u201d to have sprinklers in every apartment and hallway, and any renovation of an existing building which cost more than half the building\u2019s value must also involve the installation of sprinklers.\n\nOlder buildings like the Trump Tower do not fall under the scope of the regulations unless they undergo major renovations. The March 1999 law (Local Law 10-1999) also exempted buildings like the Trump World Tower, where excavation had already begun by that time:\n\nDonald J. Trump, one of the developers who initially fought the sprinkler law, said yesterday that he had decided to spend $3 million to install sprinklers in all 350 units of Trump World Tower, a high-rise apartment complex that he is building across from the United Nations. But Mr. Trump stressed that he did not believe the law would reduce fire fatalities. \u201dPeople feel safer with sprinklers,\u201d he said. \u201dBut the problem with the bill is that it doesn\u2019t address the buildings that need sprinklers the most. If you look at the fire deaths in New York, almost all of them are in one- or two-family houses.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Trump softened his stance on the installation of sprinklers and voluntarily invested in them for one of his buildings does not erase his earlier public opposition to them, but any discussion of his record on sprinklers in residential buildings is incomplete without mention of all these facts.", "lang": "en"}
