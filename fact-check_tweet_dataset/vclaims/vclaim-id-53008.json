It is being claimed that the video is from Ladakh where a violent confrontation took place between India and China on the night of June 15-16, 2020.\n\nAt the time of filing the report, the post (archived) had more than 6,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video is FAKE.\n\nWe extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search. The search led us to the same video on YouTube uploaded on November 27, 2011, titled, \u2018Video After NATO Attack On Pakistan Army Camp\u2019.\n\nWe ran a keyword search and found a BBC report dated November 26, 2011. According to the report, at least 24 soldiers were killed after Nato helicopters attacked a border checkpoint.\n\nNewsMobile independently couldn\u2019t confirm the origin of the video but from our fact check, it is clear that video is old and has no connection with the recent clash between India and China.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
