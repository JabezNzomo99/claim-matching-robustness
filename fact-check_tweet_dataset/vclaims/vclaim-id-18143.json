Overall, about 32,000 people entered teacher training in 2015/16\u20147,000 fewer trainees than were recruited for 2009/10.\n\nThe numbers were up last year, but not enough to meet the government\u2019s recruitment target, which hasn\u2019t been reached since 2012/13.\n\nBut the drop in teachers entering training hasn\u2019t led to a drop in the number of teachers in state schools. This may be because newly qualified teachers only account for about half of the additional teachers in a given year; others come from outside the state sector, or return to teaching after a break.\n\nMs May is correct that there were more teachers altogether in England\u2019s state schools in November 2015 than 2010, measuring by both headcount and full time equivalent.\n\nThat said, the number of pupils has also increased. And within that headline figure are big differences: the number of primary teachers has risen, but the number of secondary teachers is down. This may be what Mr Corbyn was referring to.\n\nFinally, slightly more qualified teachers left state-funded schools in England than entered them in 2015. 49,700 entered and 50,200 left. However, full time equivalent figures do show more entrants than leavers in 2015. 45,800 entered and 43,100 left.", "lang": "en"}
