No, that's not true: The claim is based on a lawsuit filed in 2016 by a woman who claimed Trump raped her when she was 13 years old. The complaint, which was dismissed months after it was filed, does not serve as \"legal documented proof\" of a rape, as Lead Stories explained in a previous debunk article titled Fact Check: Jane Doe V.
