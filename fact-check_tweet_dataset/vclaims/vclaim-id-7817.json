None is called Goose Rapids.\n\nBut a story claiming that the mayor of this fictional town had been keeping a storage unit full of cash and dead bodies has been getting popular on Facebook. One user of the social media site commented: \u201cThis is crazy! And yet another Democrat with REAL skeletons in the closet! I couldn\u2019t resist!\u201d\n\nOther users flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story, which has a headline that says, \u201c$4 Million And 2 Dead Bodies Found In Democrat Mayor\u2019s Storage Unit,\u201d claims that Mayor Stephen Foreman is now on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list. However, no one by that name is actually on the list.\n\nIt also says that a surveillance camera at another storage facility caught Foreman carrying a bag that \u201ccould contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds.\u201d But the picture that is shown in that section of the story is actually a still from a surveillance video in the Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Arizona, showing Jason Matthew Bristol allegedly smuggling his 2-day-old daughter out of the hospital in a plastic shopping bag in 2015.\n\nThe main photo with the story is also unrelated to Missouri \u2014 it shows an FBI agent talking to an upstate New York sheriff\u2019s officer at the start of a child abuse investigation in 2016.\n\nThe story originated on a site called Ladies of Liberty, which is part of a network of sites that describe themselves as satirical and have disclaimers that say, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nAnother clue that the story isn\u2019t true is the author\u2019s bio, which says, \u201cLoreli Eagleton is the wife of Flagg Eagleton. She is a stay-at-home Mom of 7 who loves to make sandwiches and does what she\u2019s told \u2014 until she doesn\u2019t!\u201d The photo shown next to the bio is of a woman in lingerie wielding a pistol in each hand. It was actually taken by Peter Kim, a Vancouver-based photographer who creates stock images like that one.\n\nKim told us in an interview that his work is sometimes lifted from various websites where the images are for sale. \u201cThe ones with the guns seem to get stolen the most,\u201d he said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nCarlson, Adam. \u201cFather Smuggles Infant Daughter Out of Hospital in Plastic Bag to Avoid Losing Custody, Cops Say.\u201d azcentral.com. 14 Mar 2015.", "lang": "en"}
