The post also includes a picture which it claims shows this.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t an SS officer and the picture isn\u2019t of him. The European Council told us Mr Tusk\u2019s grandfather, J\u00f3zef Tusk, was conscripted into Nazi Germany\u2019s combined armed forces, after having been imprisoned in two different concentration camps.\n\nThe European Council told us J\u00f3zef Tusk was Polish and a citizen of Gda\u0144sk (which was a semi-autonomous \u201cfree city\u201d administered by Poland between 1919 and 1939), who worked on the Polish state railway before he was arrested by the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police) in September 1939. He was then sent as a forced labourer to build the Stutthof concentration camp, where he was subsequently imprisoned.\n\nThen, the European Council told us, he was transferred to Neuengamme concentration camp. He was released in 1942, then in 1944 was conscripted into the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany\u2019s combined armed forces.\n\nIn March 1945, he deserted, and returned to Poland in October 1945.\n\nThe image isn\u2019t of Mr Tusk\u2019s grandfather, it\u2019s of Nazi intelligence officers\n\nAccording to the German Federal Archives, the image that purports to show Mr Tusk\u2019s grandfather actually shows four members of the Sicherheitsdienst\u2014the Nazi Party\u2019s intelligence and security service.\n\nIt was taken in Poland in September 1939 (around the time J\u00f3zef Tusk was arrested by the Gestapo).", "lang": "en"}
