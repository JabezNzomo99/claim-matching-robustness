A reverse image search reveals that the photo shared in the Facebook post originated from the New York Police Department (NYPD) after an operation carried out in April this year.\n\nThe post dated November 14, 2018, appeared after police raided the governor\u2019s two homes, recovered several guns and arrested him.\n\nThe governor, Zachary Okoth Obado, represents Migori county in the western Nyanza region and is currently facing trial for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend.\n\nThe photo shared on two Facebook pages with a total of more than 800,000 members, displayed sniper guns and other rifles purportedly recovered from Obado\u2019s homes.\n\nA caption accompanying the image on the misleading post read: \u201cThese are the WEAPONS which were found in the homes of Governor Okoth Obado at Migori and Nairobi. Is this guy a CROCODILE, sorry a terrorist?\u201d\n\nAccording to a reverse image search on Google and Yandex search engines, the picture was first taken when NYPD raided the home of Ronald G. Drabman, 60, who was found in illegal possession of the firearms.\n\nNYPD tweeted the picture in question after the raid in April 2018.\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Kenya's director of public prosecution confirmed that Obado was being held for possessing three firearms and ammunition without valid certificates.\n\nObado denied the charges when he appeared in court the same day.", "lang": "en"}
