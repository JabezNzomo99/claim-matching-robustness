Technically, doctors can already prescribe the drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing.\n\nBut Trump falsely suggested to reporters that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic spreading in communities across the US. That would mean that the drug had met the FDA\u2019s standards for safety and effectiveness.\n\nMinutes later, FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn emphasised that the drug still needs testing to determine if it can help patients. He said chloroquine would have to be tested in \u201ca large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
