Eliot once said, \u201cThe very existence of libraries affords the best evidence that we may yet have hope for the future of man.\u201d\n\nThe saying does not appear in any of Eliot\u2019s writings.\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot, better known as T.S. Eliot, was an American poet who won the Nobel Prize in 1948. His poems, including \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and \u201cFour Quartets,\u201d helped establish him as an important figure in the 20th century modernist movement.\n\nHowever, nowhere in these poems, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the statement. It doesn\u2019t appear in his plays or correspondence either.\n\nOn the T.S. Eliot Society\u2019s list of popular quotes, the quote attributed to Eliot in the Facebook post is categorized as \u201csource unknown.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been asked about this quote before, and we put out a call to our members here in the U.K. \u2014 but no-one could provide a source for it!\u201d Paul Keers, chair of the T.S. Eliot Society, told the DCNF in an email.\n\nAnother expert, John Carroll University associate english professor Jayme Stayer, noted that the quote sounded like something Eliot would have said.\n\nThe earliest known variation of the expression dates back to 1992, where it appears in author and former librarian Jayne Ann Krentz\u2019s novel \u201cPerfect Partners,\u201d according to the website Quote Investigator. It has been attributed to Eliot since at least 1999, though it\u2019s unclear how the quote became linked to him.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
