It actually comes from the 2002 film adaptation of Dickens\u2019 book \u201cNicholas Nickleby.\u201d\n\nOne of the most widely read Victorian writers, Dickens authored a number of classic novels, including \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d and \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d (RELATED: Did George Eliot Say, \u2018Wear A Smile And Have Friends\u2019?)\n\nHowever, nowhere in these works, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Dickens Project Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz didn\u2019t return any matches. It doesn\u2019t appear in his journals either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Dickens (it doesn\u2019t even sound like him),\u201d said Pamela Dalziel, an associate professor at the University of Victoria, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cThe quotation is supposedly from Nicholas Nickleby but isn\u2019t in the novel.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dalziel, the quote actually stems from the script of director Douglas McGrath\u2019s \u201cNicholas Nickleby,\u201d a 2002 movie based on Dickens\u2019 novel of the same name. The script was written by McGrath and, though some sections of dialogue may pull directly from the book, this quote about happiness was invented by the director.\n\nIn a 2003 Variety article about his writing process, McGrath confirmed that he originated this particular expression.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
