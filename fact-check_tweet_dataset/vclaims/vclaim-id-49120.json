Alt News also received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on TinEye and found that the photograph was clicked by Emilio Morenatti for Associated Press on March 12. According to the caption, the image shows a man and a woman kissing at Barcelona airport on March 12, 2020. \u201cPresident Donald Trump, who had downplayed the coronavirus for weeks, suddenly struck a different tone, announcing strict rules on restricting travel from much of Europe to begin this weekend,\u201d per the description.\n\nThis image was carried by several media outlets including Chicago Tribune, Boston GlobeandFox Tribune.\n\nThus the social media claim associated with the viral image is false and misleading. They are not Italian doctors who caught coronavirus infection after treating over 100 patients.", "lang": "en"}
