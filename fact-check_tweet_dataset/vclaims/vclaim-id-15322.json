It goes on to quote the designer.\n\n\"I have no interest in dressing a glorified escort who steals speeches and has bad taste in men,\" the post says Ford said about Trump. The text appears above photos of both of them.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ford has said he won\u2019t dress Melania Trump. But this particular insult-laden quote is manufactured.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOn The View in November 2016, Ford said: \"I was asked to dress her quite a few years ago and I declined.\" When one of the hosts asks why, he says that she\u2019s not necessarily his \"image.\"\n\nThough he says he\u2019s a Democrat, he explains that he doesn\u2019t think that Hillary Clinton should have worn his clothes if she had won the presidency, because they\u2019re too expensive.\n\nSeveral months later, he told Elle that he thinks whoever is the president or the first lady should wear \"clothes at a price point that are accessible to most Americans, and wearing clothes made in America.\"\n\nHowever, Ford denied that he ever called Trump a \"glorified escort.\" He talked to WWD on March 19 after he was rated \"the number-two trending topic on Twitter nationwide,\" according to the publication, because the quote had been attributed to him on the social media platform \"but unsubstantiated by source or date.\"\n\n\"Never! Never, ever, ever, have I said that Melania was an escort,\" Ford told WWD. \"I\u2019ve never said anything derogatory about Melania. I never would say anything derogatory. It\u2019s so weird, isn\u2019t it, in today\u2019s world the way someone out of nowhere can just make up a random quote and start circulating it on the Internet?\"\n\nWe rate this post as False.", "lang": "en"}
