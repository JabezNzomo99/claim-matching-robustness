(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Explaining martial law)\n\nMartial law in Mindanao has been extended twice since Proclamation 216 was issued.\n\nFirst on July 22, 2017, when Congress, in a joint session, approved the President\u2019s proposed extension until Dec. 31 that year, since the rebellion has not been fully quelled within the 60-day allowance of the Constitution.\n\nThe second on Dec. 17, 2017, when it was extended for another year, due to remnants of the Maute group and the ASG in some areas in Mindanao, as well as the \u201cintensified decades-long rebellion\u201d of the New People\u2019s Army against the government, among others.\n\nPCOO, President Rodrigo Duterte, Remarks during the lecture on militarization and drugs, Nov. 6, 2018\n\nPhilstar.com, Military to recommend another extension of Mindanao martial law, Nov. 13, 2018\n\nSupreme Court, Decision on whether there was sufficient factual bases for the issuance of Proclamation 216, July 4, 2017\n\nHouse of Representatives, Resolution of Both Houses No. 4, Dec. 13, 2017\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
