The woman, who speaks Indonesian, then secures the wipe tightly on her face over her mouth and nose.\n\n\u201cIf you are not sure, make two layers. If masks are not available, just use this one. Do not worry,\u201d she says, according to a translation of the video by AFP\u2019s team in Jakarta.\n\nAFP identified the product used in the clip as a baby wet wipe from PZ Cussons baby care line.\n\n\"Cussons Baby Wipes are designed solely for the cleansing of skin and not to be used as a face mask. All of our products must only be used as directed on the packaging. We recommend consumers follow World Health Organization (WHO) and national government guidelines in order to prevent infection,\u201d the company said in a statement sent by email to AFP.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is \u2018don\u2019t put yourself in dangerous situations,\u2019\u201d warns KK Cheng, Director of the Institute of Applied Health Research at the University of Birmingham in England. The professor emphasized the importance of \u201csocial distancing,\u201d \u201cstaying at home,\u201d and \u201cwashing your hands\u201d to protect against the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of no evidence for or against use. Certainly not implausible that it could cause harm through risk compensation (people feel protected so are less adherent to social distancing measures),\u201d warned Ben Cooper, professor of epidemiology, based at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nCooper recommended following WHO\u2019s guidelines on when and how to use a mask to protect against the virus.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says people who are not sick do not need to wear a mask unless they\u2019re taking care of someone who is ill.\n\n\u201cFacemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers,\u201d the CDC says.\n\nIn settings where facemasks are not available, health care professionals might use alternatives such as a bandana or a scarf \u201cfor care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort,\u201d the CDC recommends.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of many situations where people are so desperate to turn wet wipes into face masks,\u201d Cheng says.\n\nAFP Fact Check is debunking coronavirus misinformation as it emerges along with new cases across the world.
