They\u2019re more likely to be convicted of sexual assault, robbery, and driving under the influence. They\u2019re more than twice as likely to be convicted of murder.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Fact Checker, Lott maintained that he was following guidance from APAAC. Even if Nowrasteh is right, Lott said, the error would not change his conclusions because he estimated it would subtract only 10 percent of the undocumented immigrants in his study. This is based on calculations using data on detainer requests filed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as detailed in a series of posts by Lott and Nowrasteh.\n\nFor his part, Nowrasteh says there is no way to know how much of an impact Lott\u2019s error had on his study. \u201cThe Arizona data does not tell us,\u201d he said. It would be possible to find out by using statistical modeling, Nowrasteh said, but Lott has dismissed such estimates when other groups used statistical models in studies that found no relationship between immigration and higher crime.", "lang": "en"}
