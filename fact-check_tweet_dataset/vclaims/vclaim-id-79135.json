Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote.\n\nA curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: \"This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that\u2026 OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida.\"\n\nWe looked into it and found that there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme\u2019s creator was duped by a satirical website.\n\nWe learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a \"Show Facts\" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not.\n\nBut the viral image \u2014 which has been shared more than 3,000 times \u2014 does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what\u2019s the real story?\n\nOn May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho\u2019s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,\" he said in the video.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn\u2019t deserve to have the same voting power.\n\nPoliticalo included Yoho\u2019s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: \"The founding fathers didn\u2019t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man\u2019s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man\u2019s. It\u2019s what God intended.\"\n\nThe YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes.\n\nAn administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the \"Show Facts\" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post\u2019s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Yoho\u2019s comment about voters historically being property owners didn\u2019t face some backlash.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho\u2019s assertions \"harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens\" and \"should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nYoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that \"the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now.\"\n\nA viral image said Yoho said \"African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Yoho said anything specifically about black voters in a 2012 campaign appearance in Ocala. The image was taken from a satirical news story on a satire site that twisted Yoho\u2019s words about voting rights to make him appear biased against black voters.\n\nWhile Yoho has talked about reducing early voting, the post goes too far in using a fake quote to make it appear the congressman wants to strip away African Americans' civil rights.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
