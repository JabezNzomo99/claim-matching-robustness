It was estimated to be 66 million in 2016, compared to 61 million ten years before.\n\nThe main driver of increased population has been immigration, according to the Office for National Statistics. Life expectancy in the UK has also been steadily increasing over the last few decades.\n\nThe average household size has not changed much in the last two decades, since current figures began. There are on average 2.4 people per household, and that\u2019s been true every year since 1996.\n\nOut of 27 million estimated households in the UK, the most common type belongs to the 16 million couples living together with or without children. 8 million households are one person living alone, and there are 3 million lone parent households.\n\nThere are also around 306,000 households with multiple families living in them, this has been the fastest growing group over the last decade. The Office for National Statistics says this \u201cmay be because of older couples moving in with their adult child and their family, young adults who are partnered or lone parents, remaining or returning to their parent\u2019s household and unrelated families sharing a household.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
