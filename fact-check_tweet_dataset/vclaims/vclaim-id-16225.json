Our commitment has always been and will always be with our country, particularly with the Mexican family economy.\n\nThe \u201cTrump wall\u201d receipt was based off of another fake photo that circulated in 2013, accusing the company of charging customers for a \u201cadditional donation\u201d to the Telet\u00f3n, the annual national fundraiser for childrens\u2019 healthcare:\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s campaign promises was that his administration would not only build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but make the latter country pay for it. That statement is still on his campaign website. He has since stated:\n\nHowever, it should be noted that an unmistakable wall already exists along much of the border between Mexico and the United States.", "lang": "en"}
