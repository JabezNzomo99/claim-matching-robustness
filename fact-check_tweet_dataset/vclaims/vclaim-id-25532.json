No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Conservative Tears] on August 2, 2019 titled \"Veteran's Activist & Actor, Gary Sinise Dies At 67\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe website that posted the \"news\" literally says \"DEATH HOAXES FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS\" in the header and the Sinise story was published under a category named \"Death Hoax\". It also gets his year of birth wrong, which is 1955 and not 1956 as the image in the story suggests.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nThe hoax story also pretended Sinise was an ardent Trump supporter:\n\nSinise has publicly criticized President Trump for his statements about John McCain:\n\nConservative Tears is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about conservativetears.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Sam Elliott, NOT Famous for Mocking Liberals, Is NOT Dead at 83\n\u2022 Fake News: Steve Martin NOT Dead At 71 - NOT A Proud Conservative And NOT Friend Of The Trumps\n\u2022 Fake News: Democrat Senator Stuart Boll Did NOT Switch Sides or Pledge To Vote With Trump\n\u2022 Fake News: Tom Selleck NOT Dead, Final Words NOT 'Help Trump To Help America'", "lang": "en"}
