PolitiFact founder and former Washington bureau chief of the St. Petersburg Times Bill Adair investigated at the time.\n\n\"Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk,\" Adair wrote. \"The head injury caused the death, Berkland said.\"\n\nRecently, Adair wrote on Twitter about the reporting experience. \"I filed public records requests and did a fair number of interviews. I talked with people who knew the aide, Lori Klausutis, and questioned the police chief and the medical examiner,\" he wrote.\n\nAdair said there is no evidence to support the idea that Klausutis died of anything but natural causes. She had told others on the day of her death that she was feeling unwell.\n\nAt the time of her death, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen Trump raised the \"unsolved mystery\" in 2017, we rated that Pants on Fire. No evidence has emerged since that would alter that rating.\n\nAfter Trump tweeted May 12, widower Timothy Klausutis wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, asking the social media company to pull down Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\n\"I'm asking you to intervene in this instance because the President of the United States has taken something that does not belong to him \u2014 the memory of my dead wife and perverted it for perceived political gain,\" Klausitis wrote May 21.\n\nKlausitis said \"there has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories since the day she died.\"\n\n\"I have mourned my wife every day since her passing. I have tried to honor her memory and our marriage. As her husband, I feel that one of my marital obligations is to protect her memory as I would have protected her in life.\"\n\nIn his first tweet, Trump said Scarborough left office \"quietly and quickly\" after the aide\u2019s death. Scarborough had announced he wouldn\u2019t run two months before her death.\n\nTrump said there are unanswered and obvious questions about Scarborough and the death of a staff member in 2001.\n\nThe medical examiner reported that she died from a blow to the head after an underlying heart condition caused her to faint and fall.\n\nThe White House provided no list of unanswered questions from any official body.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
