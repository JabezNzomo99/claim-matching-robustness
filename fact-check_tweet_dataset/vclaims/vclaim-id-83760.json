The photo is from a crime elsewhere that police said had nothing do with the Muslim politician.\n\nA photo of a man carrying a severed head was posted on Facebook on October 3. The image has a caption in Hindi that reads, \u201cKarnataka Congress leader Rafiq Ali raped a Hindu woman, Neelam Rabidasiya. Her brother decapitated the Congressman and took his head to the police station. Does this Hindu deserves a punishment?\u201d\n\nThe post was shared around 250 times in a Facebook group called \u201cWar Against Paid Media\u201d and also in other Facebook groups. Comments included \u201cThe man did not deserve a punishment\u201d and \u201cHe deserves a reward for this.\u201d\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the text of the false post. AFP has chosen not to display the image in the false post due to its graphic nature.\n\nAn archived version of the post is also available here. Warning, clicking on the link will show the graphic image\n\nAn AFP investigation found the photo originated from a previous crime that had nothing to do with Ali.\n\nThe original photo can be seen in media reports of the crime elsewhere in Karnataka state on September 29, four days before the misleading post went on Facebook.\n\nThe reports can be seen here, here and here. Warning, the reports carry graphic content.\n\nThe chief of the police district where the crime occurred, Shiva Prakash Devraju, told AFP by phone the murder occurred in the town of Malavalli, where a Hindu man killed and decapitated another Hindu man in a personal feud.\n\n\"There is no communal [inter-religious] angle to the murder case. Both of them were Hindus, and no one was raped prior to the murder,\u201d Devraju said by phone.\n\nDevraju said the alleged murderer was a man named Pashupathi and the victim was named Girisha.\n\nHe added that the photo was taken by a local journalist in the Malavalli police station.\n\nBelow is a copy of a police charge sheet that Devraju sent to AFP via Whatsapp of the crime, which includes the names and details of the beheading murder. It lists Pashupathi as the accused and Girisha as \u201cfatal\u201d, or victim.", "lang": "en"}
