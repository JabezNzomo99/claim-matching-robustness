We did not receive any authentic media report.\n\nWe approached Sanjay Kumar, a former Intelligence and Information Analyst in the ministry of Home Affairs and currently an expert in Security and International Affairs at Unacademy. Describing the news as propaganda, Kumar said that Rafale is an advanced fighter aircraft. \u201cAfter the entry of the state-of-the-art Rafale fighter jet in the Indian Army, many false news gone viral on social media about it. It is propaganda and we should avoid them. No Rafale aircraft has crashed in India,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nSocial scanning of the twitter handle that shared the fake claim revealed that it is active since August 2015.
