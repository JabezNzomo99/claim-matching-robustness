In the same \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview quoted above, he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t even do those kinds of deals anymore. We can\u2019t even continue.\u201d In an Oct. 16 interview on Fox News\u2019s \u201cHannity,\u201d he said: \u201cWe were international businesspeople before politics and we gave up doing all new deals going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization last month received approval to build 550 houses and a second golf course in Balmedie, a village on the northeastern Scottish coast. \u201cIf the Trump Organization follows through on these plans, it would turn the company into something it has not been before: a large-scale house builder,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cThe company has built condo buildings before and sold off a few dozen houses or home lots next to other golf courses. But the company is now proposing to build a sizable suburban development, complete with the expenses of roads, streets and a school.\u201d\n\nThe projects can benefit from local zoning or infrastructure improvements, or even when U.S. military crews are billeted there. The House Oversight Committee is investigating why the Pentagon has spent nearly $200,000 at Trump Turnberry golf resort in Scotland since 2017 for overnight stays and other expenses during refueling stops in nearby Glasgow. The Trumps also can market existing projects under the [president\u2019s self-imposed] guidelines, and actively sell luxury condos to foreign buyers, among other investments. Last month, Trump Jr. hosted about 100 people in New York who had purchased homes in Trump-branded luxury towers near New Delhi. Visitors flew over Manhattan in helicopters, dined at Trump\u2019s hotel and listened to a \u201cfireside chat\u201d between Trump Jr. and an Indian business partner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the issue of projects. It\u2019s how influence works,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group among the plaintiffs suing Trump for alleged constitutional violations. \u201cThese towers in India that are going up, they advertised that if you bought before a certain point, you would get to meet Trump Jr. There\u2019s the project in Indonesia that Don Jr. was just at; they called it a pre-launch \u2014 a big event attended by members of the government. Their partner, Hary Tano, his daughter was just appointed tourism minister for Indonesia.\u201d\n\nA London-based watchdog group, Global Witness, said in a December 2018 report that the Trumps appeared to be pursuing a new business deal in the Dominican Republic\u2019s Punta Cana area and that \u201challmarks of a new deal include, among others, a potential change in Trump\u2019s role as developer instead of licensor, and the fact that the new and previous projects are not even close to one another \u2014 they are five miles apart.\u201d Forbes reported that \u201cthe younger Trumps sold a piece of land in January 2018 for $3.2 million\u201d in the island country.\n\nWe asked whether this constituted a new foreign deal, which would mean Trump broke his pledge. A Trump Organization spokesperson said: \u201cAll of the international projects, including the property in the Dominican Republic which was acquired in 2013, predate the presidency by several years. Some go back more than a decade. Since then, the company has not entered into any new international business deals.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
