The idea is something that has been talked about for decades.\n\nThe Coalition government also produced a plan for achieving parity of esteem by 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s office told us that she was referring to the government\u2019s policy of parity of esteem more broadly, rather than any specific action it has taken. That said, her statement could be misinterpreted to mean that the government has now achieved parity of esteem, which many experts have said is not the case.\n\nThe independent Mental Health Taskforce said last year that despite a number of steps there was \u201cnot yet parity between an individual\u2019s rights to physical and mental health care\u201d.\n\nThis year it said that there\u2019s a lot to be optimistic about in mental health and that the \u201cinfrastructure needed to sustain change has been put in place\u201d, but it\u2019s a long-term project.\n\nThe King's Fund, a health think tank, has said recently that mental health services need \u201cgreater parity of funding\u201d. A committee of MPs has also said that NHS budget pressures and the need for more planning to ensure the right workforce is in place are making it difficult to achieve equality.", "lang": "en"}
