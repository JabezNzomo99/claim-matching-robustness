(Click here to read FT's story)\n\nBOOM reached out to Rajan who is currently teaching at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nBOOM also reached out to Bank of England's Press Office, which said it did not have any comment. However, the central bank's press office said, \"The next Governor of the Bank of England will be a HM Treasury announcement and subsequently will come from them.\"\n\nIt is important to note that Financial Times' story headlined 'Starting gun prepped in race to replace Mark Carney at Bank of England' was merely a list of potential candidates for the job. The article listed pros and cons of several potential candidates. The story also said that UK's Treasury was expected to publish an advertisement for the job in July, a year ahead of the end of Mark Carney\u2019s term and that a formal process had not yet started.\n\nThat did not stop the fake news brigade in India to jump to conclude Rajan had already bagged the prestigious job. Several WhatsApp messages have been circulating over the past week already declaring his appointment.\n\nHyderabad-based The Siasat Daily fell for the fake and published the misinformation on its site on May 5. The article, which is now deleted, even used the same photo that was used in the viral forward.

Ironically Raghuram Rajan was not recognised in his own country. As RBI governor, Rajan\u2019s policies and views drew ire from senior members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since he\u2019d held on to his US green card, he wasn\u2019t deemed \u201cmentally fully Indian\u201d. - The Siasat Daily\n\nIn the past, BOOM has called out Siasat for publishing a fake survey that ranked the BJP as the fourth most corrupt party in the world.

When pointed out by Twitter users, Tharoor admitted to being taken in by fake news.\n\nTharoor's post on Facebook and Twitter were still online at the time of writing this story.", "lang": "en"}
