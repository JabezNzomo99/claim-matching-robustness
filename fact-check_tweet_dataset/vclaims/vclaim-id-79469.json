We only have 121 Tickets remaining so hurry up\" claimed a website with the URL http://alaskaair.com.travelfreetickets.bid/.\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. The URL directs people to a three-question survey. Once completed, it asks the person to share the page to their Facebook to finalize the deal.\n\nSimilar surveys that indicate Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Air, are giving away free tickets have circulated for years.\n\nBut just like the Alaska Airlines survey, these are all hoaxes.\n\nIn October 2016, Alaska Airlines posted tips for spotting scams like this, which featured a screenshot from the survey being circulated above. The post goes on to say that if a promotion is real it will be shared by a verified Alaska Airlines social account and it will use current Alaska Airlines branding.\n\nThey also said the promotion should be hosted on an Alaska Airlines official website.\n\n\"If you are sent to a website that is not alaskaair.com, promoted from alaskaair.com and/or does not have any affiliation or links to Alaska\u2019s official websites, then it could be a fake promotion,\" it says.\n\nA website\u2019s promise of two free tickets on Alaska Airlines after taking a survey isn\u2019t based on reality. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
