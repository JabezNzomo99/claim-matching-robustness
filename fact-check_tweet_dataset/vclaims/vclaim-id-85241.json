Kuwait \u201ccategorically denies these claims,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign ministry said. Trump\u2019s Facebook post has not been taken down.\n\nAs we have repeatedly noted before, the New York Times did not apologize to its subscribers for its coverage of Trump. Both the Times and The Washington Post have seen spikes in audience and subscribers.\n\nTrump tweeted a number of critical comments about the \u201cso-called judge\u201d who halted the president\u2019s travel ban of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. The judiciary was established in the U.S. Constitution as a third branch of government (along with the executive and legislative branches), part of the complex system of checks and balances that ensures the continuation of democracy. Marbury v. Madison, a Supreme Court case decided more than 200 years ago, helped establish the notion of judicial review and cemented the notion that the judiciary was equal in power to the president and Congress.\n\nThere is little evidence that the ruling halting Trump\u2019s order has allowed \u201cvery bad and dangerous people\u201d to pour into the country. The practical effect of the order was to restore visas and refugee admissions. Being accepted as a refugee in the United States is a difficult, lengthy process. Obtaining a U.S. visa generally requires an in-person interview, unless you are a citizen of one of 38 countries which participate in the visa waiver program. Under a 2015 law, however, four of the seven countries covered in the ban require even dual citizens to have an in-person interview.\n\nTrump now claims he doesn\u2019t know Putin, but in the past, he had claimed he has spoken to him. (Our colleague Philip Bump put together a chronology showing the various ways Trump has played up or played down the relationship.) Trump\u2019s assertion he has \u201cno deals in Russia\u201d is misleading at best, since Trump has actively pursued deals there and has relied on Russia investors. (A former federal prosecutor has alleged that \u201cRussian money is the lifeblood of the Trump organization\u201d and any sharp removal of Russian support \u201cwould exact a heavy financial toll\u201d on his company.)\n\nThis is false. Bill Clinton did not have a cabinet in place until March 11, George H.W. Bush had to wait till March 17 and Obama did not get a full cabinet until April 28. Trump would have grounds to complain that at this point he has fewer Cabinet members confirmed than his predecessors. While Democrats have put up roadblocks, part of the reason for the delay is because paperwork has been slow in coming from some of Trump\u2019s wealthier nominees.\n\nBlumenthal\u2019s account was immediately confirmed by Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding the judge through his confirmation process on behalf of the Trump administration. Moreover, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that Gorsuch was \u201cpretty passionate\u201d about Trump\u2019s attacks on judges. Sasse said that Gorsuch told him \u201cany attack on \u2026 brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to Blumenthal\u2019s \u201cmajor lie\u201d concerning Vietnam refers to a controversy that arose during Blumenthal\u2019s 2010 Senate race. Blumenthal had served in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1970-1976, after receiving five deferments, but never served overseas. But a damaging report in the New York Times showed how he often used ambiguous language that suggested to audiences he may have served in Vietnam \u2014 and at times flatly said he did.\n\nTrump is the same age as Blumenthal \u2014 70 \u2014 and never served in Vietnam either. He received four deferments for college \u2014 where he played sports such as football, tennis and squash \u2014 before receiving a diagnosis of a bone spur in his heels that led to a medical deferment that kept him from the war. Trump later said the bone spurs healed with no need for surgery.\n\nAs PolitiFact noted, in labeling this tweet as false, Cuomo\u2019s first question to Blumenthal was: \u201cWhat is your response to the president of the United States saying you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?\u201d Blumenthal ducked the question, but contrary to Trump\u2019s tweet, the issue was raised.", "lang": "en"}
