It did not conclusively prove that Depo-Provera increased a woman\u2019s chance of HIV infection.\n\n\u201cThe problem is all of these studies were what we call observational studies,\u201d said Prof Helen Rees, the executive director of the\n\n\u201cObservational studies have inherent biases because the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a person who chooses to use one [contraceptive] method over another there might be all sorts of things about you that differentiates you from a person who takes an IUD.\u201d An IUD is an\n\nThe observational studies could not take into account other factors, such as condom use, that might explain why one group had a higher HIV risk than another.\n\nusing animals suggested that a key chemical in Depo-Provera was associated with an increased vulnerability to HIV in the female genital tract.
