However, far more often than not the reports turn out to be nothing more than scarelore \u2014 viral tales of looming threats based on thin evidence. The rumors often involve stories of candy infused with various drugs, poison, or sharp objects such as razors or needles. Although caution and awareness of one\u2019s surroundings are always good practices, as of this writing we know of no legitimate reports of heroin-tainted candy posing a public health danger.", "lang": "en"}
