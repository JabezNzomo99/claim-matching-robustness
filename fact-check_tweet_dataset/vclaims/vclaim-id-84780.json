After BOOM and other social media users pointed out that that two of the videos were unrelated to his claims, he deleted the entire Twitter thread.\n\nThe first video posted by Khan was a footage of a police raid in Bangladesh. In the disturbing video, police officers in anti-riot gear could be seen rounding up and beating wounded protesters.\n\nThis video has been viral on social media for over a day, with false claims of being a footage of police crackdown in Assam after the implementation of the National Register of Citizens. BOOM had already fact checked this video before Imran Khan's tweet.\n\nAlso Read 2013 Bangladesh Video Peddled As Police Crackdown In Assam\n\nKhan shared the video with this misleading caption: \"Indian police's pogrom against Muslims in UP.\"\n\nHe also added two more videos in the thread - both showing scenes of police brutality on protesters - with the caption: \"Indian Police attacking Muslims as part of Modi Govt's ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nThe second clip turned out to be an unverified clip, which had gone viral in the wake of the recent protests and police crackdown in UP. BOOM has not yet been able to independently authenticate the origins of the video.\n\nAlso Read Anti-CAA Protests: Visualised On The Map\n\nThe third clip also showed police round up and lathicharge on protesters. \n\n\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes led us to an older video on YouTube from November 16, 2019 - weeks before the series of protests against the CAA and ensuing police brutality started. The caption in the video claims that it shows cops lathicharge on agitating farmers in Unnao, without any mention of their religion.\n\nWith 10 million followers, Khan's tweet started to go viral instantly. Soon, many users and fact checkers, including BOOM, responded to the thread with a previously done fact check of the first video of the Bangladesh police raid.\n\nUP police also jumped in on the conversation and tweeted to Khan, explaining to him that the video shows an old and unrelated event.\n\nUpon observing the comments with fact checks, Khan deleted the entire Twitter thread.", "lang": "en"}
