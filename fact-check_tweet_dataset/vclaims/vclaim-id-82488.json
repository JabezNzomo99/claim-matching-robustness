From social media to mainstream media and messaging platforms, propaganda warfare was at its peak, seeking to sway public opinion.\n\nAvi Dandiya, a social media user who has a significant following on Facebook, posted an \u2018audio clip\u2019 on March 1. He claimed that the audio clip was a conversation between BJP president Amit Shah and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and the conversation purportedly was about killing Indian soldiers. Dandiya claimed that this audio clip was evidence that the Pulwama terror attack of February was an inside job.\n\nAlt News, however, found that the audio clip presented by Dandiya was completely bogus and manufactured by lifting different portions of old interviews given by BJP leaders. Parts of these interviews were conjoined to make it seems that Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah were discussing a ploy to kill Indian soldiers.\n\nDandiya had later posted another manufactured audio clip, according to which the BJP had supposedly plotted to hack EVMs.\n\nA Twitter user Shekhar Chahal shared a WhatsApp chat with an alleged Pakistani, who is a resident of Balakot, to claim that the Indian air force\u2019s recent air strike killed 292 terrorists of JeM. Chahal is followed by prime minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.\n\nThe entire conversation is fake. Firstly, Alt News found that there is no \u2018Balakot Medical University\u2019 in the first place. Moreover, the urdu used in the chat was highly erroneous. Alt News\u2019 fact check can be read here.\n\nA set of images doing rounds on social media was shared with claims that it depicts the impact of Indian Air Force\u2019s airstrike in Pakistan. The photographs show mass graves and shrouded dead bodies. \u201c\u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b\u091f \u0939\u092e\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0939\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0940 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0947 \u0924\u093e\u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u092e \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0917\u093c\u0926\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0939 \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u092a\u0932 \u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u091a\u0941\u092a \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093e \u092e\u093e\u091c\u0915 \u0928 \u0909\u0921\u093c\u093e\u0910 |\u091c\u092f \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e!

Yes, we are showing you the satellite images of Balakot air strike. This is an answer to those who demand evidence -translated) \u201c, said the Zee News anchor presenting the satellite images of the alleged bombsite in Jaba, Balakot.\n\nAccording to the broadcast, the image on the left where the building had an intact rooftop was taken on February 23, 2018, whereas the image of same building on the right in which the rooftop was demolished was of February 26, 2018. Throughout the broadcast, it was claimed that these were the satellite images of the site bombed which now stands demolished after the air strike carried out by the Indian Air Force.\n\nAlt News fact-checked the Zee News broadcast and found that the channel had used old, unrelated images to claim that the IAF airstrike at Balakot had destroyed the terror camp of the JeM. The article can be accessed here.\n\n5. Amar Ujala uses image of 2014 US air strike to represent IAF\u2019s strike target\n\nOn March 5, the Hindi publication Amar Ujala published a report titled, \u201c\u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b\u091f: \u092e\u0926\u0930\u0938\u093e \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e- \u0930\u093e\u0924 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0925\u093e \u091c\u092c\u0930\u0926\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0927\u092e\u093e\u0915\u093e, \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0939\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u091a\u093e\u092f\u093e (Balakot: A Madrasa student told that \u2013 A tremendous explosion had happened at night, Pakistani army evacuated us -translated)\u201d. The article also carried a photo with a target symbol on a building, while the text below the photo said, \u201c\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093e \u091f\u093e\u0930\u0917\u0947\u091f (Air Force\u2019s target)\u201d.\n\nThe image attached to the Amar Ujala\u2019s article pertains to an U.S air strike aimed at ISIS targets in September 2014. A report published by Daily Mail on October 4, 2014 stated, \u201cThe targets of the strikes were fighters from the Khorasan Group, which is how the U.S. government refers to a cell of al Qaeda veterans who had relocated to Syria from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region\u201d.\n\n\n\n6. Did Pak army admit 200 killed in Balakot? Indian media runs video without verification\n\n\n\n\u201cPakistan admits that 200 terrorists were killed.\u201d; \u201cBodies of slain terrorists were shifted after IAF airstrike.\u201d; \u201cIAF Balakot airstrike proof.\u201d \u201cUS-based Gilgit activist shares video.\u201d \u2013 were the leading headlines on March 13 across Indian mainstream media outlets.\n\nANI, News18, India Today, ABP News, Times Now, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran, India TV and Zee Newswere among the media organisations that cited a video viral on social media and claimed that it represented the Pakistani army admitting that 200 terrorists were killed by the Indian Air Force in the February 26 airstrike.\n\nThe above-stated narrative was, however, not verified by media organisations. Most of them sourced the story to a US-based Gigit activist, Senge Hasnan Sering, who incidentally stated to ANI, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how authentic this video is but Pakistan is definitely hiding something very important that has happened in Balakot.\u201d\n\nAlt News found that the video, which was used by multiple media organisations to claim that it represented proof of militants killed in the Balakot airstrike, was old and unrelated. The fact-check can be read here.\n\nArmy veterans Major Gaurav Arya and Major Surendra Poonia, who have a large following on Twitter, posted a graphic video. Major Arya claimed that the men seen beaten in the video are Pakistani army soldiers who were flogged by Pak army personnel for supposedly deserting their post when attacked by Baloch rebels. On the other hand, Major Poonia claimed that the men who are being thrashed were Baloch rebels being persecuted by the Pakistani army.\n\nAlt News had fact-checked the video and established that both Arya\u2019s and Poonia\u2019s claims are false. Arya claimed that the incident depicted in the video had occurred on February 27, whereas Alt Newsfound that the same video had existed online at least 22 days earlier i.e on February 5, when it had been uploaded on YouTube. According to Republic TV\u2018s report, the alleged attack by BRA fighters on Pakistan outposts happened on February 27. Thus the video that both Poonia and Arya posted cannot be representative of that attack. Moreover, Alt News had found that the video actually pertained to a torture training module of the Pakistani army.\n\nApart from the above instances of misinformation related to the Balakot airstrike and its aftermath, there were some other prominent instances in the month of march.\n\n1. Child abduction rumours resurface: Provocative audio clip and 2015 image from Pakistan in circulation\n\nChild abduction rumours were revived on WhatsApp in march. A message doing the rounds on WhatsApp groups claimed that bodies of children, who were abducted, have been recovered from inside containers, and that their internal organs were found missing. The message was shared in the form of an audio clip, and is accompanied by a photograph which shows dead bodies lined together in a grave.\n\nAlt News found that the photograph circulated along with the narrative was actually taken in 2015 when a heatwave had hit Pakistan. Moreover, the message, which was in the form of an audio clip, has been circulating online since 2017.\n\n2.

It has been shared along with a video which shows green-coloured flags bearing a crescent, waved in a street rally. The video is 24 seconds long and was shared on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nThe banner in question is NOT the national flag of Pakistan.

Ms. Gandhi is seen bearing a cross, implying that she is actually a Christian and is simply masquerading as a Hindu.\n\nNeedless to say, the image was photoshopped.

It was uploaded by a Facebook page Namo Again, and also by the group WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI, among others.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of fans of Narendra Modi, the Modi apple has not been named after India\u2019s Prime Minister. It is in fact a variety of apple which was developed in Italy. The official name for this variety is CIVG198. Information about this brand of apple is available on the website www.modiapple.com.

The best way is to be aggressive.\u201d This was a tweet by filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri, which has now been deleted.\n\nThe Prime Minister of India in August-September 1965, when the Indo-Pak war broke out was Lal Bahadur Shastri. Jawaharlal Nehru was not even alive\u2013 he had died in May 1964. Alt News found that Agnihotri\u2019s tweet thread had been quoted verbatim from the work of deceased spiritual guru Acharya Rajneesh Osho.\n\n6. Prominent journalists fall for false claim about judge who gave Aseemanand verdict joining BJP\n\nSeveral prominent journalists claimed that former Judge Ravinder Reddy, who had resigned after delivering an acquittal for Swamy Aseemanand in Mecca Masjid blast case, has joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. These included Sadanand Dhume, Nidhi Razdan, Raju Parulekar and Swati Chaturvedi. The claim was accompanied by a photo.\n\nAlt News found that neither the claim nor the photograph is true. Last October, former judge Ravinder Reddy had joined the Telangana Jana Samiti, which was part of the opposition alliance led by the Congres party during the 2018 assembly election. \u201cLast month, Mr Reddy had expressed keenness to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), describing it as a \u201cpatriotic party\u201d, and banners welcoming him into the party were put up at the state BJP headquarters here, but it did not materialise\u201d, stated a report published by NDTV on October 14, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
