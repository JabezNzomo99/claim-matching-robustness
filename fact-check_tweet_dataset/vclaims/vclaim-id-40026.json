Another site unlibuzzmaniac.com also carried the same post.\n\nFacts: Republic Act 11199 or Social Security Act of 2018, which was signed by Duterte in February 2019, has no provision granting members a P50,000 bonus. (READ: Duterte approves law overhauling SSS charter). Existing laws on the SSS grant members specific benefits but not bonuses as described in the claim.\n\nThe official website of the SSS provides a summary table showing the benefits and qualifying conditions for its members. The information is as of June 2019. The alleged bonus is not in the published table of member benefits.\n\nThe official Facebook page of SSS also denounced the claim and warned the public not to be deceived by false information.\n\nThe two blog sites exhibited typical traits of many hoax sites that Rappler has fact checked in the past. Both embedded a 12-second video trimmed from Usapang SSS, a public service program aired on People's Television Network (PTV-4). However, the video does not contain sufficient information about the said bonus. Typical of other clickbait content, a warning message displayed in the middle of the video says viewers must share it first before watching in full. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
