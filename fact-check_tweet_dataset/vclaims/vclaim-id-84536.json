A news report about a Muslim doctor and his Hindu compounder spreading message of peace in violence-hit Basirhat has angered a BJP youth leader to go on a communal rant and threaten violence. There is nothing offensive in the news posted by Hindustan Times on its Facebook page but for some reason, Srinivas Raghavan, the General Secretary of a BJP Yuva Morcha has taken great offence to it.\n\nReacting to HT report on a doctor\u2019s appeal for communal harmony, Raghavan said, \u201cI remember what Mahatma Gandhi did. Enough is enough. We will not tolerate this anymore. Hope you all remember what happened in 2002.\u201d When confronted by other users, he continued his rant, talking of \u201cwarning you guys\u201d, \u201cgo back to your mother country\u201d, \u201cwe are waiting to take revenge\u201d (of 17th century rulers), \u201cthe day is not too far\u201d, and so on.\n\nIn his Facebook profile, Raghavan describes himself as a \u201ccharismatic go-getter\u201d and a \u201cbeliever in making India great again\u201d. His page is full of pictures with senior BJP leaders.\n\nNot the first time\n\nIt is shocking to see a youth leader of India\u2019s ruling party spewing hate on social media and threatening violence. Or maybe it is not so shocking, after all. This is not the first time. There have been instances in the past where BJP supporters have called for a 2002 like massacre. Many feel \u2018proud\u2019 of 2002 and have no qualms about expressing it publicly on social media.\n\nTathagata Roy, the present Governor of Tripura and the former president of the West Bengal state unit of BJP from 2002 till 2006 had stated on Twitter about \u2018appreciating what the Hindus did in 2002\u2019.\n\nHate speech coming from Sangh leaders in not a one-off incident. RSS Mahanagar Prachar Pramukh of Ujjain Kundan Chandrawat in a speech earlier this year, boasted about killing 2000 Muslims in Gujarat and offered a bounty of 1 crore for bringing him Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijaya\u2019s head.\n\nIn 2015, Amitesh Singh, who was followed by Prime Minister Modi on Twitter went a step further and actually gave call for a massacre. Singh was arrested over his tweet and has since disabled his account. In his twitter profile, Singh claimed to be vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s Yuva Morcha but the party denied any association with him. As per news reports, Singh was the grandson of a BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh.\n\nHDL India, yet another hate spewing Hindutva handle, called to turn UP into Gujarat to save it from turning into Kashmir. The @HDLIndiaOrg account is now suspended\n\nThe GodhraAgain rumor in 2015 was also started by @HDLIndiaOrg. The handle was also one of the select few followed by Prime Minister Modi on Twitter.\n\nThis is not all. There are several others who have made similar references to 2002 Gujarat riots.\n\nIn recent times we have seen Facebook posts and WhatsApp forwards result in lynching and riots. We have seen morphed pictures, doctored videos, rumours and now direct instigation and threats by a BJP youth leader. While the party may not take exception to incendiary words of its Youth Morcha leader, police and local authorities must keep a watch on such individuals for their role in instigating violence.", "lang": "en"}
