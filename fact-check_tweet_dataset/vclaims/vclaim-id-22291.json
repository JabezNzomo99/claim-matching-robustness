As the immediate result of Deripaska's lawsuit, Roskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s communications regulator, added the postings of the video to its list of banned Web pages.\n\nDeripaska is reportedly a confidant of President Vladimir Putin, and also has ties to President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\nPrikhodko, widely seen as Putin\u2019s most influential shadow foreign policy adviser, is also the chairman of Korporatsiya Takticheskoe Raketnoe Vooruzhenie \u2013 a private firm that has the largest contracts with the Russian military to develop tactical missiles and missile systems.\n\nNavalny, Russia\u2019s most popular opposition figure, has been barred from taking part in the country\u2019s upcoming presidential elections.\n\nNavalny\u2019s video, which was posted on February 8, shows Deripaska and Prikhodko relaxing on the oligarch\u2019s private yacht off the coast of Norway in August 2016. With the two men is a woman described as a \u201cVIP escort.\u201d At one point in the video clip, the two men discuss Russia-U.S. relations, and seem to blame Victoria Nuland, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, for the deterioration of those ties.\n\nNavalny said he found the video footage on the Instagram account and YouTube channel of the young \u201cVIP escort,\u201d Anastasia Vashukevich, who goes by the name Nastya Rybka. He also quoted from her book \u201cA Journal: How to Seduce a Billionaire\u201d \u2013 in which, according to Navalny, Rybka refers to Deripaska as \u201cRuslan\u201d and Prikhodko as \u201cPapa.\u201d\n\nSergei Prikhodko has not denied the authenticity of the video/photo/audio materials or any of Rybka\u2019s claims regarding his appearance and behavior on Deripaska\u2019s yacht. In a written statement to Russia\u2019s RBC news outlet published on February 9, Prikhodko only spoke about Alexey Navalny, describing him as \u201ca political loser\u201d who \u201conce again tried to stage a provocation and call attention to himself.\u201d\n\nPrikhodko added that Navlany \u201cconfusingly mixed everything possible and impossible \u00ad\u2013 from my friend (Oleg Deripaska) to the American President Trump and Manafort, who I do not know personally.\u201d\n\nOn February 10, Deripaska\u2019s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Anastasia Vashukevich (Nastya Rybka), demanding that she remove 14 Instagram posts and seven videos that violate Deripaska\u2019s right to privacy under article 24 of the Russian Constitution.\n\nDeripaska\u2019s legal representatives stated that Navalny \u201cis not a defendant in the suit.\u201d However, several developments before and after the suit was filed suggest that while Navalny formally is not a defendant in Deripaska\u2019s lawsuit, he might very well be the target of it.\n\nFirst of all, while Prikhodko told RBC that he himself would not be pursuing Navalny legally, because \u201cit is enough that others are doing that,\u201d Deripaska filed the lawsuit the next day.\n\nSecond, after Deripaska\u2019s legal team filed suit, Roskomnadzor immediately added Navalny\u2019s video investigation to its official list of sites containing information not to be distributed in Russia, specifically referring to Deripaska's lawsuit as the reason.\n\nThe Interfax news agency reported on February 15 that on the basis of a court ruling, Roskomnadzor was taking measures to restrict access to Web sites that had posted personal information about persons mentioned in Navalny\u2019s video investigation.\n\n\"Roskomnadzor received a ruling of Ust-Labinsk district court [in southern Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region] on interim measures on the claim,\u201d Interfax quoted an unnamed source in Roskomnadzor\u2019s press service as saying. \u201cThe court decision obligates Roskomnadzor to take measures to restrict access to information posted on a number of Internet resources.\"\n\nRoskomnadzor announced around midday on February 14 that \"nearly 30 resources\" had deleted Navalny's video from their sites.\n\nOn February 15, Alexey Navalny said Roskomnadzor had blocked access to his website in Russia. At the time of this publication, https://navalny.com could not be accessed on Polygraph.info's computers in Washington, DC.\n\nThird, the photographs and videos in question had been publicly available on Rybka\u2019s Instagram account and her YouTube channel at least for two years, but Deripaska never before complained that they violated his privacy. It is possible he did not know they existed, but Rybka claims the two kept in touch after the yacht incident.\n\nNavalny\u2019s producer Oxana Baulina said they have received a warning from YouTube and Google Russia offices ordering them to remove Navalny\u2019s video-investigation.\n\nNavalny has filed an appeal with Moscow\u2019s Taganka district court against Roskomnadzor. demanding that it remove his investigation from the list of the banned materials.\n\nFinally, Deripaska\u2019s legal team has cited Article 24 of the Russian Constitution, which states: \u201cCollecting, storing, using and distribution of information about the private life of individual without their consent is prohibited.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, an exception \u2013 if the individual in question is a government official and the information is vital to the public interest. The \u201cgovernment\u201d exception would apply to Prikhodko. It is up to interpretation whether the \u201cpublic interest\u201d exception would include Deripaska, who is known to be close to Putin and whose companies do business with the Russian Federation.\n\nOne particularly notorious use of this exception occurred in March 1999, when state-controlled Russian television aired a video showing, in its words, \u201ca man resembling\u201d then Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov, in bed with two prostitutes. Skuratov had been investigating charges of corruption against then President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nSkuratov resigned after the then director of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB), Vladimir Putin, confirmed that Skuratov was indeed the man featured in the video.\n\nIt is widely assumed that Russia\u2019s intelligence services secretly arranged the filming of Skuratov in bed with the prostitutes in order to use the footage as \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2013 compromising material \u2013 against him.", "lang": "en"}
