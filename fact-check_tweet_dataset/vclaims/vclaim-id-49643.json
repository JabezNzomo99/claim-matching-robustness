Some security personnel can also be seen in the picture, which appears to be one of a rescue operation.\n\nAmong others, Facebook page \u201cPrince Online Sumbal\u201d posted the picture on July 18 and captioned it, \u201c#Big Breaking At least 16 Amarnath yatras died. And many more injured as jksrtc pulgs in nalah\u201d. Many users have written \u201cgood news\u201d in the comment section.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral post to be misleading. The incident is true, but it is three years old. This year, the Amarnath yatra has not commenced yet.\n\nThe post is being widely shared on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nUsing reverse search, we found the viral image in the photo gallery of \u201cThe Indian Express\u201d. As per \u201cThe Indian Express\u201d, 16 pilgrims were feared dead and over 30 injured after a bus carrying Amarnath yatris fell into a gorge in Jammu and Kashmir on July 16, 2017.\n\nThe bus accident took place in J&K\u2019s Ramban district. The image was also used by \u201cThe Statesman\u201d in an article with the same information.\n\nThis proves that the incident described in the viral post is three years old and not a recent one.\n\nThe annual Amarnath yatra is likely to begin from July 21. As per reports, the J&K administration had said on July 4 that due to the spread of Covid-19, only 500 pilgrims would be allowed per day by road from Jammu to the holy cave shrine.\n\nHowever, the commencement of the yatra is still uncertain after the J&K high court asked Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) to take a decision on holding the annual pilgrimage due to the threat of Covid-19. The holy shrine is managed by SASB.", "lang": "en"}
