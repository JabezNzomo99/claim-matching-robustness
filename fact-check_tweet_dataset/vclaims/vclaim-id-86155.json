So the changes to the law contemplated in the Republican bill were also limited to this market. The problem is that the numbers in these tweets refer to the entire insurance market, including employer-based insurance. (Some aspects of the AHCA might have had an impact on the employer market, such as the proposed repeal of tax penalties on larger employers that failed to provide minimum essential health coverage.)\n\nThat HHS report, using 2014 data, said 61 million to 133 million non-elderly Americans (23 percent to 51 percent) have preexisting conditions. The difference in the numbers depends on the definition that is used. The more-narrow definition is based on eligibility for state-run, high-risk pools that predated Obamacare; these would have been an option under the AHCA. The broader definition includes health conditions (such as arthritis) or behavioral health disorders (such as substance abuse) that might have resulted in denial of coverage or higher premiums.\n\nThere are other estimates on people with preexisting conditions as well, such as a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said 27 percent of American adults younger than 65 have \u201chealth conditions that would likely leave them uninsurable if they applied for individual market coverage under pre-ACA underwriting practices that existed in nearly all states.\u201d This number is more conservative in part because the survey did not have enough detail on some illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS) that before Obamacare would have left someone without insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2010 investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, based on documents from the four largest for-profit health insurers, found that companies denied coverage to 1 out of every 7 applicants. That would be 14 percent, though the report notes that \u201cthe actual number of coverage denials is likely to be significantly higher\u201d than the number of documented denials. Still. if you took the entire U.S. population with health insurance \u2014 about 257 million people \u2014 that means 34 million would face a denial of coverage. Within the individual market \u2014 assuming every state took advantage of AHCA options \u2014 the number would be 2.5 million, assuming they all experienced a lapse in coverage of more than two months.\n\nAmelia Penniman, a spokeswoman for American Bridge, said they adhered to the CAP figure because it looked more broadly than the House Democratic report, which was focused on the individual market. \u201cThe preexisting conditions protections in the ACA were put into place to guarantee that no matter where you are in life -- you\u2019re currently employed but suddenly lose your job and therefore your health insurance -- you still could not be discriminated against for having a preexisting condition,\u201d she said. \u201cIt supposes that anyone could be on the individual market at any time, and that those numbers are constantly fluctuating.\u201d\n\n[Note: some readers objected to this sentence, saying we erected a straw man and that \u201cat risk\u201d is appropriate because anyone, at some point, could find themselves on the individual market at some point. Jesse Lee, vice president of communications for CAP Action, responded with this comment: \u201cEvery single American lost protections for pre-existing conditions under the 2017 repeal bill, just as they did for the countless full repeal bills that all the same Republicans voted to make law. Period, full stop. If anything, counting only those who already have pre-existing conditions underestimated the sweeping effects of the GOP repeal efforts.\u201d]\n\nMoreover, 11 states, including Arizona, passed laws prohibiting the use of preexisting-conditions exclusions and limitations after the ACA became law; other states already had such rules in place. So in those states, \u201cfederal protection\u201d might be gone if the lawsuit succeeded, but state protections might remain. The Commonwealth Fund in 2018 analyzed the state laws and found some state laws are explicitly tied to the ACA, meaning they would be void if the federal law was invalidated. Other state statutes are ambiguous and would be subject to legal challenges. Meanwhile, 29 states have not adopted any of the ACA consumer protections.\n\nIn the case of Democrats using statewide numbers for people with preexisting conditions for votes concerning the AHCA, that\u2019s worthy of Four Pinocchios. They\u2019ve taken high-end estimates for the entire insurance market, even though the law affected mostly the individual market. Different states also would have had to proactively seek waivers. The Congressional Budget Office found that in states with one-sixth of the U.S. population, there could be turmoil in the insurance markets \u2013 but that meant it might be fine in other states. There\u2019s little excuse to apply numbers for the entire insurance market to the much-smaller individual market.\n\nIn the case of attacking a supporter of the lawsuit, such as Hawley, there\u2019s a stronger case for a statewide number because the lawsuit would wipe out all protections embedded in the ACA and the impact is uncertain, even in the employer-based insurance market. But it\u2019s still a high-end estimate, so the real figure could be half as much. The same could be said for candidates who cast votes for the repeal of the ACA without a replacement, provided it is framed correctly as Sinema did in the debate. That\u2019s worthy of two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
