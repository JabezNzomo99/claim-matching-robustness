Through this article lets factcheck the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Price of petrol in other countries is very low compared to that in India. Fact: There are vast discrepancies between the price given in the list and the actual price in the respective country. Price per liter in some countries is high compared to India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we tried to verify the price of petrol in each of the countries mentioned in the post, we found that in Pakistan the price of petrol per liter according to Oil and Gas Regulating Authority of Pakistan\u2019s circular dated 26 June 2020, regarding the revision of prices, is PKR 100.11 per liter which in Indian currency is \u20b9 45.35. Shell oil and gas company Pakistan is selling petrol for the same amount mentioned above which can be seen on the company website. Whereas in Bangladesh according to Bangladesh Petroleum corporation the cost is Taka 86 per liter which in India currency is \u20b9 76.26. In Sri Lanka, according to Ministry of Petroleum Resource Development, the cost is LKR 161 per liter which in Indian currency is \u20b9 65.20. However, the price of petrol according to the post for Pakistan, Bangladesh & Sri Lanka is \u20b9 26, \u20b9 22 & \u20b9 34 respectively.\n\nAccording to Globalpetrolprices website as of 06 June 2020, the cost of per liter petrol in \u20b9 in Italy is \u20b9 120.50, in Cuba it is \u20b9 89.64 and in Nepal it is \u20b9 60.23. When we compared these prices with the numbers given in the post, there is a vast difference. According to the post, the price of per liter petrol in Italy, Cuba, and Nepal is \u20b9 14, \u20b9 19 and \u20b9 34 respectively. Similarly, the price in Afghanistan is \u20b9 33.01 whereas in the post it is \u20b9 36, in Burma, the price is \u20b9 38.24 compared to that in the post which is \u20b9 30. When we crosschecked the actual price of petrol in India on 06 June 2020, it the same as given in the post.\n\nWe can conclude that the price of petrol per liter in some countries is higher than in India and in some countries, it is lower. But the actual numbers are vastly different from what is given in the post. Hence the post is misleading.\n\nIn a nutshell, incorrect price of petrol in different countries is being compared to that of India.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
