One such scam reported that consumers could get a $100 coupon during the pandemic for use at Starbucks cafes by simply clicking on a link. Here is a screenshot of a Twitter post promoting the bogus offer:\n\nAlthough the links shared with the posts no longer appear to work, we are rating this offer a \u201cScam\u201d because no evidence exists that the coupon was real. The web address for the \u201ccoupon,\u201d for example, was not from an official Starbucks website.\n\nWe asked Starbucks to confirm the offer was a scam but didn\u2019t receive a response in time for publication. However, the \u201coffer\u201d being made echoes similar coupon scams that promise \u201cfree\u201d or discounted goods from well-known brands if users click on a site \u2014 collecting people\u2019s private information in the process \u2014 but then don\u2019t deliver on the promise.\n\nAs we have reported in the past on such scams:\n\nThese types of viral \u201ccoupon\u201d scams often involve websites and social media pages set up to mimic those of legitimate companies. Users who respond to those fake offers are required to share a website link or social media post in order to spread the scam more widely and lure in additional victims. Then those users are presented with a \u201csurvey\u201d that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who want to claim their \u201cfree\u201d gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau offers consumers several general tips to avoid getting scammed:", "lang": "en"}
