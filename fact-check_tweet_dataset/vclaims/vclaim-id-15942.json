At the time, her remarks \u201clet\u2019s eliminate all of that\u201d were widely interpreted to mean doing away with private insurance. In her recent appearance, she argued that in context she was talking about health-care bureaucracy today. (Rereading the full exchange, she has a point.) She said she did think there was a role for private insurance in the government-run system.\n\nAs of 2017, according to the Census Bureau, 67 percent of Americans \u2014 217 million people \u2014 received health insurance through a private plan, mostly through their employer. Almost 38 percent get insurance through a government plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military. Another 9 percent have no insurance. (The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because people can be on more than one type of plan in a given year.) The Sanders bill would put the whole country on a government plan.\n\nSection 107 would make it illegal for any private health insurer to sell coverage that duplicated benefits under the law or for any employer to duplicate the benefits, but adds that nothing on the proposed law would prohibit the sale of health insurance for benefits not covered under the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Sanders plan would be more sweeping in its coverage than just about any existing universal health-care system. For instance, Canadians must buy private insurance for prescription drugs, dentists and optometry, while Britain has a parallel private system that about 10 percent of the population participates in.\n\nThat\u2019s elective surgery generally not covered by health insurance. But insurance is purchased to defray costs for unexpected health problems. Who buys (or sells) insurance for the unexpected nose job or facelift? You can buy insurance for complications from cosmetic surgery, but that\u2019s not going to be an especially large business.\n\n\u201cYou are correct that the benefits package is extremely generous; private insurance would not be needed at all because everything that is medically necessary for any given individual would be covered under Medicare-for-all,\u201d said a Sanders aide. But she added: \u201cUnder Medicare-for-all, private insurance could continue to exist to cover anything not covered by Medicare, such as private hospital rooms, institutional long-term care and voluntary care.\u201d (Institutional long-term care, such as nursing homes, under the Sanders bill would continue to be covered under Medicaid, the health program for the poor.)\n\nMedicare-for-all \u201cmight strongly disincentivize private health insurance, and I think it\u2019s right to ask about what the role of private health insurers would be in this system \u2014 but the bill itself doesn\u2019t categorically ban private health insurers,\u201d said Katie Keith of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. She suggested that private insurance companies might continue to have a role as claims administrators.\n\nIan Sams, a spokesman for Harris, said she spoke accurately about the law. \u201cThe bill\u2019s language expressly allows supplemental insurance to cover any care/procedures not explicitly covered under the single-payer plan by law,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this would allow at least some level of private insurance to continue operating within the marketplace.\u201d\n\nCall us skeptical, but Section 107 looks like a loophole for single-payer supporters to claim that private insurance is not being eliminated, even as the main sponsor says he wants to put health insurance companies out of the business. There is virtually nothing left on the table but a few crumbs. Harris called it \u201csupplemental insurance,\u201d which sounds a lot like Medigap policies, but the reality is likely far different than that.\n\nGiven the back-and-forth between Harris and Tapper, we can\u2019t quite award Pinocchios. But her language is slippery. She could more forthrightly admit that the health plan she supports envisions virtually no role for the private insurance now used by nearly 220 million Americans.", "lang": "en"}
