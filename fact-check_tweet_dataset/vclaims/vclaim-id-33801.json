More than half of the statements come from a 2013 blog post by Fritz Edmunds.\n\nFoxworthy, an award-winning comedian, is known for his \u201cYou Might Be A Redneck\u201d one-liners. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 700 times, bears some resemblance to the format of these popular jokes. (RELATED: Did Jeff Foxworthy Write This Post Distinguishing Republicans From Democrats?)\n\n\u201cIf your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more \u2013 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots,\u201d reads one such statement.\n\n\u201cIf you cross the Cuban borden illegally you will be thrown into political prison to rot,\u201d reads another.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no evidence that Foxworthy ever wrote or said the statements attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his verified social media accounts yielded no results. No credible media outlets reported him making the statements either.\n\nMore than half of the statements appear to have originated with Edmunds\u2019 Politically True 2013 blog post entitled \u201cChanneling Jeff Foxworthy In A Country Founded By Geniuses And Run By Idiots,\u201d though Edmunds noted some ideas came from an uncopyrighted email. The mention of Foxworthy in the title and the resemblance of the format to Foxworthy\u2019s one-liners may have spurred the erroneous attribution to Foxworthy.\n\nThe original source of the statements centered on illegal border crossings is unclear, but they frequently get misattributed to Foxworthy in Facebook posts with Edmunds\u2019 words.\n\nFoxworthy\u2019s brother, Jay, confirmed to Snopes that his brother did not author the statements in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
