The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) refuted the claim.\n\nFauci, the director of the NIAID, has become a popular target for misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, social media users claim Fauci has said every American should be microchipped.\n\n\u201cDr. Fauci says every American should be microchipped,\u201d one viral post states. \u201cThe only chip going in my body will have Salsa on it.\u201d (RELATED: Has Anthony Fauci Ever Sat On Microsoft\u2019s Board?)\n\nThe Daily Caller found no credible report of Fauci discussing the idea of microchipping Americans online. Neither the NIAID nor the National Institutes of Health mention such a potential policy on their respective websites. Fauci saying a comment to that effect would be picked up by media outlets, yet none have, except to debunk it.\n\nIn an email to the Caller, the NIAID confirmed that Fauci has \u201cnever said any such thing.\u201d (RELATED: Has Anthony Fauci Ever Sat On Microsoft\u2019s Board?)\n\nWhile there is no record of Fauci advocating for microchipping, he has publicly talked about the possibility of Americans carrying certificates of COVID-19 immunity.\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s possible. It\u2019s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not,\u201d Fauci said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates has also been the subject of similar claims on Facebook, but those have also been debunked.", "lang": "en"}
