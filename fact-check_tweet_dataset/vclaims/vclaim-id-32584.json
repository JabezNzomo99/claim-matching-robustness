Andrew Cuomo greeted news that President Donald Trump had filed residency paperwork in Florida with a tweet saying, \"Good riddance.\" But Cuomo\u2019s anti-Trump sentiment hasn\u2019t made its way into an ad campaign from the New York City Sanitation Department, despite the claim of a viral Facebook post.\n\nThe post shows a photo of an outdoor trash can. On its side is an illustration of a woman holding a Bible and wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. A red circle with a line across it is stamped over her head and above her are the words \"Keep NYC Trash Free.\"\n\nA Nov. 5 Facebook post featuring the image says: \"These are real ads running in New York City calling for the removal of \u2018trash\u2019 which includes white people, Trump supporters, and Christians. This is an all out assault on western society. Rise up gamers. #MAGA.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because, as Gothamist reported last year, these aren\u2019t NYC Sanitation Department ads but the work of graphic artist Winston Tseng.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2018, NYC Sanitation tweeted: \"Unauthorized posters illegally affixed to some litter baskets are being removed.\"\n\nOther images Tseng created as part of the \"Trash Free\" campaign showed a man in a MAGA hat holding a Chick-fil-A hat and a New England Patriots fan holding a beer.\n\nThose weren\u2019t \"real ads\" either, as the Facebook post claims.", "lang": "en"}
