It is being claimed that the video was shot recently when she had visited a temple after declaring her country COVID-19 free.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cNew Zealand PM visiting the temple recently after declaring her country covid free.\n\n Those who are crying on Hindus.\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the above video and found the claim attached to it to be misleading.\n\nWe ran a search with keywords such as \u2018Prime Minister\u2019, \u2018New Zealand\u2019, \u2018Jacinda Ardern\u2019, \u2018Temple\u2019, \u2018Visit\u2019. The search led us to several video and reports suggesting that Ardern has recently visited temple in Auckland ahead of polls in New Zealand.\n\nThe same video was posted on the Facebook page of Radha Krishna Temple \u2013 Auckland on August 7, 2020.\n\nThe reports don\u2019t mention about the visit being connected with COVID-19.\n\nOn digging further, we found a tweet by Indian High Commissioner to New Zealand, Muktesh Pardeshi, in which he shared pictures with PM Ardern during her visit to Radha Krishna Mandir on August 6, 2020. He also mentioned that she had an Indian vegetarian meal which included Puri, Chhole and Daal.\n\nPardeshi in his tweet didn\u2019t mention about the visit being connected with Coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand polls have been delayed polls by four weeks to October 17 following fresh spurt of COVID-19 cases in the nation\u2019s largest city of Auckland.\n\nIn conclusion, the above fact-check proves that the video in question has no connection with New Zealand becoming Coronavirus-free in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
