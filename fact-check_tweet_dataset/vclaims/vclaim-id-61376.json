MSNBC had her back the next night on All In With Chris Hayes to talk about the balance between Israeli and Palestinian guests on major American news networks. We checked a claim from that back-and-forth here.\n\nJebreal also took it upon herself to trumpet the news she says goes unreported in the United States. \"Most Americans think, okay, Israelis are minding their own business and Palestine woke up one day in Gaza and said okay, let me fire missiles,\" Jebreal said. \"That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\"\n\n\"They don\u2019t know anything about the siege, 1.8 million Palestinians living under siege in extreme poverty, with 90 percent that don\u2019t have access even to water.\"\n\nBy all accounts, the situation in Gaza is bad, but we were surprised to hear that so few people have access to water.\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to reach Jebreal, but we did get in touch with Juan Cole, a history professor at the University of Michigan who frequently sounds off on Middle Eastern politics and who Jebreal cited during her interview. In a concurring with Jebreal\u2019s assessment of the U.S. media, Cole wrote, \"Israeli occupation has left 90% of people in Gaza without potable water.\"\n\nThat\u2019s already a step removed from Jebreal -- who didn\u2019t distinguish between access to water, and access to drinking water. (The difference would be in having running water available for cooking and showering).\n\nCole pointed us to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which pointed us to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 (OCHA) office in Palestine. Since July 7, when Israel began its military actions against Hamas, OCHA has published daily reports about the circumstances in the Gaza Strip.\n\n, covering the period from July 21 to July 22, estimates that \"1.2 million people have no or very limited access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators\" that provide water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nAccording to OCHA, Israel\u2019s bombings are causing definite harm to Gaza\u2019s water systems. The UN has been unable to reach several municipalities because of the threat of bombings, leaving them unable to repair 15 broken wells and six inoperative sewage pumping stages. The Municipality of Gaza reports that they\u2019re pumping less than half the \"required\" water.\n\nWith a population of 1.8 million, that means that roughly 67 percent of people living in the Gaza Strip could be classified as having \"no or very limited access to water.\"\n\nThat\u2019s less than the 90 percent Jabreal claimed and does not account for people who may have limited access to water.\n\nSo in the most literal reading, Jabreal is overstating the statistic. But another way to look at Jebreal\u2019s claim is the way Cole said it, that 90 percent of people in Gaza lack access to potable water.\n\nThe only natural source of fresh water in Gaza is an aquifer on the southern part of its coast, and according to a , 90 to 95 percent of that water isn\u2019t safe for drinking because of seawater, sewage, and runoff from agriculture. That statistic has since been corroborated by the UN.\n\nBefore the current crisis, in Gaza had access to water coming from the aquifer, but that the aquifer alone cannot sustain the Gaza Strip. In April 2013, the head of the Palestinian Water Authority estimated that Palestinians purchase 56 million cubic meters of water a year for drinking to make up for what he calls a \"severe shortage.\" And according to the UN , four-fifths of privately sold water isn\u2019t sanitary.\n\nWhat does that all mean? People living in Gaza have access to potable water, but they have to buy it from an outside source. The natural aquifer that people living in Gaza have access to largely is unsafe for drinking.\n\nWe should note that this problem began well before Israel began bombing. The UN sent Princeton professor Richard Falk to the Gaza Strip in 2013 to , and Falk wrote that \"the Israeli blockade of Gaza has exacerbated water scarcity.\" Among other things, Falk said, Israel takes a \"disproportionate share of water from the coastal aquifer,\" the Israeli-Palestine Joint Water Committee disproportionately rejects Palestinian proposals for water wells, and Israeli military operations often destroy existing Palestinian wells.\n\nJebreal claimed that \"90 percent\" of people living in Gaza \"don\u2019t have access even to water,\" in the course of arguing that a significant part of the Israel-Palestine situation goes unreported in the United States.\n\nRecent estimates suggest that about 67 percent of people living in Gaza currently have little or no access to running water, a figure lower than Jebreal claimed. But what's true is that 90 to 95 percent of the water from Gaza\u2019s coastal aquifer (their only natural source of fresh water) isn\u2019t suitable for drinking.\n\nJebreal\u2019s claim needs that caveat. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
