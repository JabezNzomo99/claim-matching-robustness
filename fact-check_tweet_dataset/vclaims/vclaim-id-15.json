They always went to public events dressed in white\u201d.\n\nSeveral users have remarked on the similarity between this attire and that adopted by female Democrats wearing white at the State of the Union speech on February 4, 2020, such as this post: here\n\nSome posts, such as this one here make the connection more explicit, claiming that the two groups are the \u201csame\u201d.\n\nThis is not correct. The unsupported claim featured on the archive photograph regarding the subjects\u2019 support for a \u201cHitler\u2019s dream of a socialist paradise\u201d is not linked to the female Democrats\u2019 choice to wear white to the State of the Union speech, which was in honour of women\u2019s economic rights and for the women\u2019s suffrage movement.\n\nThis year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified on August 18, 1920 enshrining women\u2019s right to vote.\n\nEarly suffragette Glenda Tinnin once said (here \u201cAn idea that is driven home to the mind through the eye, produces a more striking and lasting impression than any that goes through the ear.\u201d From early days, suffragettes had became aware of how visuals could affect perceptions of them and began use the color white as a part of their publicity.\n\n\u201cBecoming aware of the way visuals could shift public opinion, suffragists began to incorporate media and publicity tactics into their campaign, using all kinds of spectacles to popularize their cause. Color played a crucial role in these efforts, especially during public demonstrations such as pageants and parades\u201d writes Einav Rabinovitch-Fox in The Conversation article linked to above. \u201cSuffragists deployed white to convey these messages, but they also turned to a much more diverse palette\u2026 These American suffrage colors \u2013 purple, white and yellow \u2013 stood for loyalty, purity and hope, respectively. And while all three of them were used during parades, it was the brightness of the white that left the biggest impression.\u201d White is therefore a historically significant color for the suffrage and women\u2019s equality movements.\n\n2020 marked the fourth year (see here) that congresswomen have color coordinated for the State of the Union (seen here in 2019 wearing white, in 2018 wearing black in solidarity with the #MeToo movement, see here, and in 2017 wearing white again, see here).\n\nAmong the congresswomen that tweeted about why they were wearing white to the SOTU were Alma Adams (here), Robin Kelly (here), Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (here), Sharice Davids (here) as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (here). Congresswomen wore white in the past as well as this year as a reference not only to recognize past women\u2019s rights, but also as a reminder to the current administration that they take a strong stand against perceived injustice toward women (here).\n\nCongresswoman Susie Lee tweeted here \u201cRockin our all-white outfits at #SOTU for two reasons: [One] Honoring the 20th Century Suffragettes who coined the all white look. [Two] Reminding you that you can\u2019t ignore the force that is women in Congress.\u201d\n\nReturning to the archive photograph, there is no evidence that the group named on the image (the \u201cLeague of Nazi Socialist women\u201d) even existed. A group called National Socialist Women's League (Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft) did exist and it was founded in 1931. However, Reuters could not find evidence that they always went to public events dressed in white, and indeed archive pictures show members of this group dressed in other colours \u2013 see here .\n\nThere was also a group called League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del or BDM) founded in 1926. The uniform for the League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del or BDM, see more here) worn to public meetings was made up of dark blue skirts, brown jackets, white shirts and black neckerchiefs (see here).\n\nIt is unclear which group the women and young girls in the picture belong to. Reuters was able to find other angles appearing to show the same women and girls in this photograph taken, which can be seen here. This photograph shows the parade from higher up. The school age girls\u2019 dresses appear to match with the photo in the original claim, and both the older women seen in the original claim photograph are also recognizable near the front, by their clothes, shoes and accessories.\n\nThis photograph is from the photograph archives (www.sz-photo.de/) of the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung (www.sueddeutsche.de/). They have captioned it:\n\n\u201cView of the parade through the Old Town of Coburg decorated on the occasion of obtaining of the federal banner as part of the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association Coburg that was founded in 1860. Besides the swastika flags hangs a flag with the emblem of the German Gymnastics Association. In the background you can see the hospital tower and a commercial building of Gustav Dehler (sign).\u201d\n\nThe current logo (seen www.dtb.de/?www.) of the German Gymnastics Association looks similar to the symbol on the flags in this photograph.\n\nThe same photograph that appears in the original claim also appears here on an archival website. Below it (around 2/3 scrolling down on the page above) there is another photograph of this group of women and girls from a different angle. The caption for the same photograph is:\n\n\u201cA group of young girls parade in the Coburg Hauptplatz (market square), giving the \u201cHitler-Gru\u00df\u201d salute and singing the \u201cHorst-Wessel-Lied,\u201d the unofficial anthem of the Nazi Party. The occasion was the 75th anniversary of the German gymnastics association in Coburg, 1936. The modern views show a slightly wider angle to show more of the surrounding architecture, including the statue of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, who married Queen Victoria of Great Britain (seen in the modern view below). (National Archives, RG 208) (MapQuest Map Link)\u201d\n\nIt is therefore very likely this photograph shows women and girls saluting during a parade for the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association in Coburg in 1936. While this gives an indication of the event and date, it still does not confirm if the women and girls were part of a specific group. While this photo was taken during the Third Reich, Reuters was unable to independently confirm if these specific girls and women were part of an official Nazi women\u2019s group.\n\nFalse: female Democrats did not wear white to the State of the Union address in 2020 to show support for \u201ca socialist paradise\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
