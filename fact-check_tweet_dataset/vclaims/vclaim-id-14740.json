According to the tweet, the letter exposes the divide-and-rule policy of the Congress party which had allegedly fomented division within the Hindu community in Karnataka by pledging a separate status for the Lingayat community.\n\nTweeted in the morning of April 16, it has been retweeted over 1400 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 1800 times so far. An excerpt from this \u2018letter\u2019 is quoted below.\n\n\u201cThe unanimous opinion is that in order to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is essential to curb the RSS growth in Karnataka and defeat BJP in the 2018 Assembly elections. This can be achieved by uniting the Muslims and Christians on the basis of their faith; divide the Hindus on the basis of caste/sub-caste and sect and sub/sect.\u201d\n\nThe same \u2018letter\u2019 had circulated widely ahead of the assembly election in Karnataka in May 2018. The fake news website Postcard News had even published an article based purely on this fake letter. The article was, expectedly, later deleted and so was Postcard News founder Mahesh Vikram Hegde\u2019s tweet regarding the same.\n\nThe letter is fake. Not only are the language and contents a dead giveaway, a quick Google search reveals that \u2018Global Christian Council\u2019 and \u2018World Islamic Organisation\u2019, organisations with which the Congress has supposedly schemed to politically divide the state, do not even exist. The names of the organisations are a figment of imagination.\n\nMoreover, M B Patil, in a conversation with Alt News had confirmed that the letter is fake. Alt News\u2019 earlier fact-check can be read here.\n\nThe English news channel Republic TV initially reported about this letter, publishing an article with the words \u201cSENSATIONAL: BJP shares purported Congress\u2019 2017 strategy letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi pitching explosive caste and religion divide and conquer plan\u201d.\n\nThe article is now no longer on the website. A little later, Republic TVupdated their reportage with the word \u2018fake\u2019 to describe the letter. It may be noted that this was in the nature of an updation, despite the fact that this letter has been debunked previously.\n\nWith the Lok Sabha election underway and Karnataka set to vote from the second phase onward on April 18, such recirculation of previously bunked information is to be expected.", "lang": "en"}
