Where do the numbers come from?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:09:18Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86001", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/28/ken-cuccinellis-fantastical-vision-of-terry-mcauliffes-spending-plans/", "vclaim": "As the ad notes, The Fact Checker (and FactCheck.org and PolitiFact) criticized McAuliffe\u2019s math as misleading. McAuliffe had justified his numbers because Cuccinelli has not spelled out how he would make up lost revenue \u2014 though he says he will \u2014 and so he blithely assumed none of the revenue was recovered. Ergo, massive cuts!\n\nAs with Cuccinelli\u2019s tax plan, McAuliffe\u2019s spending plans emphasize the possibilities \u2014 but rarely explain how he would pay for them. He wants to tap what he says is a potential gusher of cash by accepting an expansion of Medicaid contained in the Affordable Care Act, even though a state panel examining whether to accept the expansion is not expected to complete its work for some time.\n\nIn a detailed article, the Richmond Times-Dispatch demonstrated how both candidates are using fuzzy figures to discuss the Medicaid proposal \u2014 Cuccinelli to discredit it, McAuliffe to tout it. In McAuliffe\u2019s case, he claims there would be more than $500 million in net annual savings because of speculative tax revenue from new jobs and economic activity that supposedly would be created from the Medicaid expansion. The figure would be much less, about $50 million a year, under other analyses.\n\nBut even if this money materialized, the Cuccinelli campaign argues, it doesn\u2019t come close to paying for McAuliffe\u2019s various proposals. That\u2019s because, given that McAuliffe tends to be vague about his proposals or their costs, the Cuccinelli campaign gives itself license to speculate about the most expensive and expansive possibilities.\n\nCase in point: McAuliffe has claimed he wants to reduce student debts, but with few details, so the Cuccinelli campaign assumed he wanted to pick up the tab for all debt of all students at state universities and colleges. Similarly, because McAuliffe has spoken favorably of raising the teacher salaries to the national average, the Cuccinelli campaign assumed he would immediately reach that goal.\n\nThus the numbers quickly add up: Nearly $1.3 billion a year more for PK-12 education, nearly $1.1 billion for college affordability and community colleges, $700 million for higher teacher pay, and so forth. Before you know it, McAuliffe, by Cuccinelli\u2019s account, has added $14 billion in spending over four years.\n\nBut Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, defended the calculations as reasonable given the paucity of data and explanation about McAuliffe\u2019s proposals. For instance, McAuliffe\u2019s campaign platform declares: \u201cControlling costs and fees to keep our kids out of debt: Every student in Virginia deserves the opportunity to get a quality education and start their working lives without the burden of heavy debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcAuliffe says he\u2019s going to keep students out of debt,\u201d Nix said. \u201cThe only ways to do that are (A) lower the cost of tuition and provide a less quality of education, (B) refuse to let anyone enter college who cannot pay for it without incurring debt, (C) lower the costs of tuition and offset it with state support or (D) pay off student\u2019s debt when they graduate.\u201d\n\nOptions A and B are not politically viable, and C would be even more expensive than D in the long run, so she said the Cuccinelli campaign chose the middle ground option: D. \u201cBottom line, while it may be far-fetched to assume McAuliffe would pay off student debt, it\u2019s utterly ridiculous for him to say that he would control costs to keep them out of debt,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he said \u2018help them graduate with less debt,\u2019 then he\u2019d be fine, but he dug this hole with his overly broad statement.\u201d She noted that this sentence appeared in a campaign document, not in an offhand statement, suggesting it was carefully considered by the McAuliffe campaign before the platform document was issued.\n\nBoth ignore the fact that any grand plans for tax cuts or new spending must be approved by the Virginia legislature, which is likely to view both plans with a skeptical eye, even once the details are filled in.\n\nWhen we wrote about McAuliffe\u2019s claims, we wrote: \u201cGiven that Cuccinelli has not identified specific cuts, he has left himself open to some speculation about the impact of his plan. Thus we can\u2019t quite label McAuliffe\u2019s fuzzy math as worthy of Four Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true here. Given that McAuliffe has not explained how he would pay for his initiatives, or even what they might be, we can\u2019t quite award these made-up numbers with Four Pinocchios. But it\u2019s close.", "lang": "en"}
