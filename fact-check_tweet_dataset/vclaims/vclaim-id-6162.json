The changes redirected the money spent on federal aid for low-income families to a block grant for the states, giving them flexibility on how to spend the money, so long as it went toward programs to reduce poverty. Graham said this shift in funding \u201cworked like a charm.\u201d\n\nThe federal government set aside $16.5 billion, which does not increase with inflation, for states to create programs that would help people transition from welfare to work. To qualify for the maximum allotment, states must also make a financial commitment to TANF programs. Under the revised system, states were free to spend the money as needed, provided they met several federal guidelines, such as maintaining minimum levels of state funding, meeting work participation requirements, and reporting data on the programs to the federal government.\n\nGraham\u2019s key argument is that turning money over to the states will help create a better, more efficient, health-insurance system, much like he believes the welfare law did. When Graham said block-granting welfare \u201cworked like a charm,\u201d he is pointing out many people who said changing welfare would \u201chave disastrous effects,\u201d according to Kevin Bishop, Graham\u2019s spokesman. But instead of creating a disaster, each state restructured the program based on its unique needs.\n\n\u201cGraham-Cassidy is built upon the same principle,\u201d Bishop said in an email. \u201cNo two health care populations in a state are exactly the same. And what health care reforms that work in Arkansas may not work in California. Vermont has discussed and wanted to go single-payer. They can use the money from Graham-Cassidy to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not just that people left welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people never went on the rolls in the first place. With the work provision, there was a substantial increase in employment in never-married mothers, one of the main groups the reform intended to help, which persists to this day.\u201d\n\nFrom 2000 to 2008, as economic growth slowed, the number of families living below the poverty line increased by 24 percent, increasing the number of families who were eligible to qualify for TANF, according to the CBO. But from 2000 to 2008, the number of families receiving cash assistance fell by 28 percent. Overall, from 1994 to 2013, the number of families receiving assistance through TANF \u201cfell by nearly 70 percent,\u201d according to the report, even though the number of families living below the poverty threshold was nearly the same.\n\nA major reason for the dwindling rolls was the newly implemented work requirements, which Rector says was the key aspect of the 1996 law. To receive TANF funding, states had to show that at least 50 percent of the people on welfare were working or engaged in a work-prep program. According to the CBO report, very few states can claim that 50 percent of the families on cash assistance are working. The national average is roughly 17 percent, the CBO found. Still, states rarely lose funding because they are able to take advantage of several loopholes.", "lang": "en"}
