The number registered in the UK fell by 1,783 to 690,773, in the year to March\u2026 A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"We are making sure we have the nurses we need to continue delivering world-class patient care - that's why there are almost 13,100 more on our wards since May 2010 and 52,000 in training.\u201d\n\nThe number of nurses and midwives registered in the UK with the Nursing and Midwifery Council NMC decreased by 1,783 between March 2016 and March 2017, according to the NMC\u2019s own figures. This was a change from 692,556 registered nurses and midwives to 690,773 over that time.\n\nIt also says that the number of people registered with the NMC decreased by another 3,264 between April and May 2017.\n\nOverall, nearly 35,000 nurses and midwives left the NMC\u2019s register in 2016/17.\n\nThat represents a shift from the trend in recent years. Between March 2013 and March 2016 the number on the register increased by just over 17,000.\n\nThe trend in the number of people on the register varies depending on where they registered from. The number of people registered, who originally registered from the UK, decreased while the number of people registered from the EU and Overseas continued to increase.\n\nBut looking just at people who are joining the register for the first time (rather than people who have been on the register for a number of years or who are re-joining) the trend is slightly different. The number of people joining from the EU has decreased in 2016/17 for the first time in at least the last five years. Meanwhile the numbers initially joining from the UK and Overseas has continued to increase.\n\nThe NMC says that the overall decrease in the number of nurses and midwives on its register is \u201cmainly\u201d due to UK nurses and midwives leaving the register.\n\nAll nurses and midwives in the UK must be registered with the NMC in order to practise in the UK. But it also says \u201cimportantly, this does not mean that all registrants are currently working as registered nurses and midwives in the NHS, the independent sector or other settings.\u201d\n\nThe NMC surveyed just over 17,000 nurses and midwives who left the profession last year and asked why they left. Of the 4,500 responses it received around half said they had retired. Of those who hadn\u2019t retired, the top three reasons for leaving were: workload, changing personal circumstances and \u201cdisillusionment with the quality of care provided to patients\u201d.\n\nThe NMC told us that these figures were only based on those who chose to respond, and weren\u2019t weighted for how closely they reflected the overall register. So they might not be representative of all nurses who left last year.\n\nThe NMC couldn\u2019t tell us how the numbers of nurses and midwives it has registered relates to the numbers working for the NHS. It told us it doesn\u2019t collect this information.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t quoting numbers for all nurses here. They are referring specifically to nurses working on acute, elderly and general wards for adults in England.\n\nThere were almost 13,100 more full-time equivalent nurses working in these types of wards in March 2017 than in May 2010. That doesn\u2019t include those nurses who work in other areas such as mental health or on children\u2019s wards.\n\nThese figures aren\u2019t necessarily directly comparable as nurse numbers change from month to month. But looking back to March 2010 doesn\u2019t change the comparison that much\u2014there are 13,000 more nurses in March 2017 compared to March 2010.\n\nThese nurses on acute, elderly and general wards account for around 61% of all nurses and health visitors working in hospitals and community health services in England\u2014as of March 2017. But the government was specifically referring to nurses working \u201con our wards\u201d and not all nurses and health visitors will do this. Community health nurses, for example, would not normally be expected to work on a ward.\n\nWe don\u2019t have figures for the number of nurses on all hospital wards specifically.\n\nOverall the number of nurses working in hospitals and community health services has increased by around 3,900 since March 2010.\n\nSome types of nursing have seen a drop in numbers though. There are around 2,000 fewer nurses working in learning disabilities since March 2010 and 3,600 fewer working in maternity services.\n\nNurses also work in other sectors of healthcare. There were almost 15,800 full-time equivalent nurses working in GP practices across England in September 2016 (the latest figures available).\n\nAt the same time there were over 11,000 full-time equivalent nurses and health visitors working in independent sector healthcare\u2014many of whom are commissioned to provide services for the NHS. Because of issues with the way this data is collected NHS Digital, which publish the figures, say they shouldn\u2019t be compared with other types of nurses.\n\nThe Department of Health told us that the figure of 52,000 nurses in training comes from Health Education England (HEE)\u2014the body responsible for education and training of NHS staff. HEE confirmed this was the case and told us that it relates to nurses working with adult, children, in mental health and learning disabilities and any nurses with dual qualifications.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Health Education England where and whether this figure is published.\n\nHEE also told us that the numbers of nurses in training have increased each year over the last three years.\n\nAround 29,000 people were accepted onto undergraduate nursing courses in the UK in 2016, according to figures from UCAS. That\u2019s compared to around 27,000 in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year the Royal College of Midwives said there was a shortage of 3,500 midwives across England.", "lang": "en"}
