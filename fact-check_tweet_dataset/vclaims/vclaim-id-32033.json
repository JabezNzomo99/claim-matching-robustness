It further narrates that when the patient came to India for treatment it was discovered that the cockroach was in the x-ray machine. Vishvas News investigated and found that both the photo and the claim is fake.\n\nA photo showing a cockroach in a chest x-ray is doing rounds on social media with a claim that the incident happened at the Rusape General hospital in Zimbabwe. The patient came to India for treatment it was discovered that the cockroach was in the x-ray machine.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by performing reverse image search of the viral photo showing cockroach in the x-ray. We found that the photo is circulating online since 2012 with different narratives. In our investigation, we found that the original image is that of the x-ray of the yesteryear Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe\u2019s chest. In 1954, she was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital for surgery for endometriosis, a gynaecological condition where the x-ray was taken. In 2010, a set of three X-ray images were auctioned for $45,000 by the hospital. Many media companies reported the same.\n\nComparing the viral image with the original one, it was clear that the viral image is morphed.\n\nThe photo went viral with a false story narrative.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr Sajeev Kumar, who is a general physician. He said: \u201cThis is a fake photo doing rounds on social media since many years. Nothing such incident happened. \u201d\n\nMorphed image of a chest x-ray of yesteryears actress Marilyn Monroe going viral since many years with a false narrative.", "lang": "en"}
