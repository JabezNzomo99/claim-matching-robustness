Before we get to the story behind this picture, let\u2019s get some basic facts out of the way:\n\u2022 This photograph was taken at Cambridge Mill, a restaurant and wedding venue in Ontario, Canada, that is also used as part of the set for the Hulu television series \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\u2022 This photograph was taken in front of the \u201cHanging Wall\u201d from the television show.\n\u2022 The handmaids were digitally inserted into this image by wedding photographers.\n\u2022 The actual wedding was not \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d-themed.\n\nThis photograph was originally posted to the social media pages of Van Daele & Russell Photography and shows a couple identified only as Kendra and Torsten. Many viewers expressed \u201coutrage\u201d over the theme of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a novel penned by Margaret Atwood in 1985 and later made into the Hulu show. The novel and show focus on a dystopian future in which fertile women, called handmaids, are subjected to brutal treatment and forced into child-bearing slavery. The hanging wall is a particular gruesome aspect of the show because it is where those who resist the rules of this new society are hanged.\n\nPhotographer Shawn Van Daele said the bride and groom are big fans of the \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d And, since their wedding was being held at the same venue that doubles as a set for the show, they wanted a photograph of them in front of the hanging wall. Van Daele told Peta Pixel that he digitally added the handmaids after the photo shoot:\n\n\u201cThe couple as well as ourselves are HUGE fans of the TV show (and obviously, first, the book). Anyone who would put out an image like this without understanding what it implies has bigger problems than upset people on social media,\u201d Shawn tells PetaPixel. \u201cI knew when creating the image that it would possibly upset people, but that\u2019s sort of the point\u2026to wake people up.\u201d \u201cThe groom wanted photos on the \u2018hanging wall,\u2019 which is where we were taking their wedding photos; I joked about adding in some handmaids (since it seemed the natural thing to do since we were there \u2026 I\u2019m certain any \u2018creative\u2019 or photographer would have the exact same thoughts),\u201d continues Shawn. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the photo to go viral, but we are SOOO HAPPY IT HAS because hopefully it will wake people up to how they too contribute to the oppression and hatred that they\u2019re rightfully worked up over.\u201d\n\nIn sum, though this image will likely be the one most viewed from this couple\u2019s wedding, they didn\u2019t actually have a themed wedding based on the dystopian novel. The bride and groom are fans of the show and because the wedding was being held at Cambridge Mill, where part of the show is filmed, they decided to take at least one handmaid\u2019s-themed photograph.\n\nIn the end, Shawn wants to remind people that this wasn\u2019t \u201ca \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 themed wedding,\u201d it was their wedding day. One photo in a series of thousands from their wedding day that was intended mostly as a keepsake for them. \u201cEveryone loves a good witch hunt \u2026\u201d laments Shawn. \u201cApparently today we are their witch.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
