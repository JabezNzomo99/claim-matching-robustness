Polygraph.info is happy to correct its earlier story and explain further the context of RT's coverage.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 03, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22145", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/29005500.html", "vclaim": "Editor\u2019s Note, Correction: On Monday, Polygraph reported RT and Sputnik did not cover the Russian protests. This week, RT sent an e-mail to Polygraph.info detailing its coverage of the January 28 \u201cVoters Strike\u201d on the Web and its television programs on Sunday and Monday. On the day of the protest, some of RT\u2019s audience members complained they were not seeing the government news organization\u2019s coverage. This story corrects the record. RT filed one news story under Russian Politics on its Web site as well as TV and editorial coverage.\n\nDemonstrations nicknamed \u201cZabastovki Izbiratelei\u201d [Voters\u2019 Strikes] calling for a boycott of the nation\u2019s presidential elections on March 18 were staged in 84 cities, which included isolated clashes with police and the detention of 371 protesters.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Putin critic banned from running against President Vladimir Putin, was arrested while he was walking toward the protest on Moscow's Pushkin Square. The Kremlin says that Navalny is not a political threat.\n\nThe same day as the protests, Navalny\u2019s TV crew reported live as the police seized a television studio in Navalny\u2019s Moscow offices and detained the hosts.\n\nWhile the \u201cVoters\u2019 Strike\u201d rallies and Navalny\u2019s arrest made headlines internationally and trended on Twitter, but not seen by many readers.\n\nIn an e-mail to Polygraph.info pointing to RT coverage on its Web site and television program in Russian and English, RT\u2019S press office wrote: \u201cOn the day of the protest, RT.com published a large piece on the subject.\u201d The e-mail linked to a five paragraph article that indicates it was initially published 12:35 p.m. Sunday and updated at 1:35 p.m. The story still is up under Russian News.\n\nThe story omitted overall crowd estimates and only said rallies were staged in \u201cdozens of cities.\u201d Other reports on Sunday estimated 100 cities. Polygraph.info established that rallies were held in 84 cities.\n\nThe general News sections on RT and Sputnik, did not include coverage of the protests.\n\nIn contrast, the Moscow Times covered the developing story with a \u201clive blog\u201d that continuously updated the developing story using information and graphic material, such as tweets and photos. The online newspaper included estimates of the number of arrests and crowd sizes, as well as information on speakers at the rallies.\n\nThe RT story did include footage of Navalny\u2019s arrest and pointed out he was released that evening. Later, RT ran an editorial that was highly critical of Navalny.\n\nThe RT press office did not explain its editorial decisions on coverage. In another instance, March 2017, Sputnik included a statement from its editor-in-chief criticizing \u201cWestern media\u201d for coverage of an anti-government rally that attracted an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people.\n\n\u201cI think opposition and particularly Western media have blown this story out of proportion,\u201d Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan was quoted as saying. She added that rallies in the U.S. and France with much larger crowds had received less attention.\n\nAccording to the RT & Sputnik government charter: \u201cThe Agency has been created and acts according to the following goals \u2013 overseas coverage of the government policy of the Russian Federation and public life in the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe Putin government apparently measures RT and Sputnik performance by the positive image the two news organizations project abroad. The 2016 annual report for the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communication stated the agency\u2019s \u201csubordinate entities\u201d acted in accordance with Putin\u2019s \u201cdirections.\u201d This includes \u201cpropagating and promoting the formulation of Russia\u2019s positive image globally.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin said on Monday, it did not regard opposition leader Alexei Navalny as a political threat to the upcoming presidential election and claimed that protests he had organized on Sunday had been sparsely attended in places.\n\nHere are the links to RT's coverage:", "lang": "en"}
