But it\u2019s not accurate to suggest that this was a decision the BBC made itself.\n\nThe level of increase is as a result of a decision by the government in 2016 which announced that from 2017/18 the licence fee would rise in line with inflation.\n\nAt the time, the government said \u201cthis will provide the BBC with the funding it needs to thrive and deliver against its updated mission and purposes.\u201d\n\nInflation in the year to September 2019 was measured at 2%, and so the licence fee is increasing from \u00a3154.50 to \u00a3157.50 (1.9%).\n\nThe Sun did clarify this but its headline and first paragraph, which suggest the BBC and not the government sets the licence fee, are misleading.", "lang": "en"}
