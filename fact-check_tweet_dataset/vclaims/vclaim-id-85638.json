The mandate, which polls indicate is one of the most disliked aspects of Obamacare, requires Americans to pay a fine if they are uninsured for all or a portion of the year. During a news conference with Senate leaders, Sen. John Cornyn criticized the mandate, calling it a \u201ctax on poor Americans\u201d because \u201cabout half\u201d make $25,000 or less.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, people with an AGI of more than $25,000 paid the lion\u2019s share of the taxes collected from the penalty. In 2014, the IRS collected nearly $1.7 billion in penalties, and 77 percent was paid by people with an AGI over $25,000. The next year, the IRS collected $3.1 billion in penalties, and once again 77 percent came from people with an AGI over $25,000.\n\nSo even though nearly half of the penalty payers have an AGI of less than $25,000, they aren\u2019t saddled with high fines. That\u2019s because the fines are calculated as either a flat dollar amount or a percentage of household income, whichever is greater. In 2014, the fines were capped at $95 per uninsured adult and $47.50 per child with a family maximum of $285. Fines increased in 2015, to $325 per adult and $162 per child, with a family max of $975.\n\nMoreover, the vast majority of people who paid a penalty \u2014 82 percent \u2014 still received a tax refund in 2015, according to the IRS. For the millions of low-income Americans who paid a penalty but received a refund, the Earned Income Tax Credit boosted their income. In 2015, the average EITC was $3,186 for a family with children and $293 for a family without children, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The average fine in 2015 was $210, with 39 percent paying $100 or less.\n\nBut many low-income people shouldn\u2019t have to pay a fine at all. The ACA offers several exemptions, including an exemption for people who would qualify for Medicaid under the expansion but who live in a state, such as Texas, that chose not to expand coverage. Contrary to Cornyn\u2019s assertion that low-income people are forced to purchase overpriced plans or face a fee, Americans can claim an exemption when the health insurance available in their area is considered unaffordable.\n\nWe shared our findings with Cornyn\u2019s office but a spokesman declined to comment. [Update: Drew Brandewie, Cornyn\u2019s spokesperson, responded to this fact check. He argues that looking at total dollar amounts instead of the raw number of people is flawed because the fines are pegged to income, so wealthier people will pay a larger share of the penalty even if more low-income people paid in.]\n\nIn 2015, 38 percent of the people who paid a fine because they lacked insurance had an AGI of under $25,000, which is proportional to the number of low-income people who filed tax returns that year. And the bulk of the fines paid are paid by people with AGI above $25,000. Moreover, only 4 percent of the \u201cpoor\u201d actually paid a penalty.\n\nThe number of low-income taxpayers who remain uninsured reflects the fact that low-income people are more likely to be uninsured. Many apparently are unaware that they are eligible for exemptions. In 2014 and 2015, the IRS addressed the error by sending letters to people who may have overpaid; for the next tax year it won\u2019t accept returns without insurance information.", "lang": "en"}
