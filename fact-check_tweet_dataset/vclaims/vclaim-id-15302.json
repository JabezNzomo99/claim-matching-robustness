As the date suggests, the article is an April Fools\u2019 joke, which is made clear at the bottom of the very long article describing every imagined detail of the project, which even featured an approval poll.\n\nMost readers recognized the article was published for April Fools\u2019 Day. However, several political Facebook pages and groups shared the post without specifying the humoristic intentions of the article.\n\nThis screenshot of data from the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows the social media pages and groups which shared the article.\n\nComments found on these posts suggest certain users took the information seriously.\n\nSuch comments reflect a resentment towards the UN that was also seen in the lead-up to the signing of the Global Compact for Migration.

Neither did Toronto mayor John Tory or UN general-secretary Antonio Guterres.\n\nDue to the increased risk of information being shared out of its humoristic context, several newspapers decided to discontinue their traditions of an April Fools\u2019 article. This year, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s daily Le Devoir followed the example of Scandinavian newspapers who made the decision in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
