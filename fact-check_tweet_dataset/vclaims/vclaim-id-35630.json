The Telugu song 'Veede Veede' has been overlaid on to the video.\n\nThe clip has been tweeted with the caption, \"Those who think Modi\u2019s popularity in Tamilnadu is a myth must watch this video. The madi magic is sure to leave you spellbound! #DontGoBackModi #NarendraModi\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nThe same video was shared on Facebook with the caption, \"Tamil Nadu shows its love for PM Modi\" by the Facebook page named 'My First Vote For Modi', a page run by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The post was deleted soon after.\n\nTaking a cue from Twitter replies pointing out that the video was not from Tamil Nadu, we broke the video into key-frames and ran a reverse image search using Google.\n\nThe search results showed that the video was from December 2017 during the Gujarat elections when PM Modi had gone to cast his vote in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.\n\nAdditionally, in this report dated December 14, 2017, by ABP News, one can spot Modi wear the same clothes and similar visuals of his showing his index finger after voting. The same security personnel and cameraman can also be seen in the frame.\n\nThe same video has been previously shared in April 2019 by the same Twitter user with the caption, \"Those who say there is no Modi wave in Tamilnadu ,This video is especially for them.\" and using the hashtag '#TNElection2019'.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.", "lang": "en"}
