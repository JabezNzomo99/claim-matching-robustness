The graphic, which appears to have been published by Philippine news outlet Inquirer.net, claims that Panelo said the poor are to blame for being unable to protect themselves from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this claim is false; the graphic was doctored to include the quote and was disowned by the Inquirer, which called on social media users not to share \"manipulated\" images.\n\nThe graphic was published here on Facebook on April 16, 2020.\n\nThe purported quote, written in a mix of English and Tagalog, translates to English as: \u201cStop the criticism, suffer from this, you are poor, you don\u2019t have savings, you did not prepare for emergency, that\u2019s your fault. You are very lucky, the government is doing all its best to help you.\"\n\nThe quote is credited to Panelo, who now serves as the chief presidential legal counsel for President Rodrigo Duterte, and is dated April 8, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states, in part: \u201cPainful but true.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same graphic, whose layouts appears identical to others published by Inquirer.net, was also shared on Facebook here, here and here alongside similar claims.\n\nHowever, the claims are false.\n\nInquirer.net issued this statement on Facebook on April 12, 2020 denying they published the graphic and affirming that it was \u201cmanipulated\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Inquirer.net\u2019s statement, which shows a comparison of the doctored and original quote cards:\n\nThe post reads, in part: \u201cWARNING! The INQUIRER.net did not produce the image on the left. We urge the public to be wary and mindful of the content they share.\u201d\n\nThe original Inquirer.net graphic, published here, matches this official government transcript of Panelo\u2019s April 8, 2020 press conference.
