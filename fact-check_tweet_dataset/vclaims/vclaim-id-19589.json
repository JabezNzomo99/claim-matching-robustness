The economy grew at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent between April and June.\n\nTrump said the country was seeing proof of the power of his tax- and regulation-cutting agenda. Let\u2019s take a look at some of his assertions and see whether they hold up.\n\n\"In the second quarter of this year, the United States economy grew at the amazing rate of 4.1 percent.\"\n\nTrump is correct about the 4.1 percent growth rate for gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2018. (It\u2019s worth noting that this number could fall, or rise, based on subsequent revisions by government statisticians.)\n\nThis is a strong showing in the context of recent history, and the highest since the third quarter of 2014. But most economists would not use the word \"amazing\" to describe it.\n\nQuarterly increases of at least 4 percent are not unheard of. That level was reached four times under President Barack Obama, including heights Trump has not yet reached, such as 4.6 percent (twice) and 5.2 percent (once). On two other occasions, Obama oversaw 3.9 percent growth.\n\n\"These numbers are very, very sustainable.\"\n\nIndependent analysts are skeptical about how long this growth spurt can last.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this rapid growth is largely the effect of a one-time sugar high and is not representative of likely growth over the course of the next year, let alone the next decade,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote after Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe group cited a confluence of positive events in early 2018 that won\u2019t be repeated indefinitely: the passage of a major tax bill in December 2017, a 13 percent bump in discretionary spending in the latest federal appropriations bill, and accelerated purchases of goods in advance of threatened Trump administration tariffs, notably soybeans.\n\nThe pro-business Tax Foundation also injected a note of caution, writing, \"A short time period is not sufficient to make conclusions about long-term policy changes.\"\n\nGrowing at 3 percent for a full year is now in the realm of possibility for Trump, and if it happens, it would be an accomplishment. The last time the economy grew at 3 percent for an entire year was in 2005, when it grew at 3.3 percent. Read our more detailed explanation of why economists think 3 percent growth is unlikely over the long-term.\n\n\"The year before I came into office, private business investment grew at only 1.8 percent. Last year, it jumped to 6.3 percent. \u2026 This year, it's growing at 9.4 percent, so that's a very tremendous increase.\"\n\nThe math checks out. Between the last quarter of 2017 and the latest one, fixed investment went from $3.42 trillion to to $3.58 trillion. That\u2019s a 4.7 percent increase for the first six months. If you assume that will continue, you can double it and you get 9 to 10 percent for the year.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the rise in the first quarter of 2018 was 11.5 percent and in the second it was 7.3 percent.\n\n\"It's definitely slowing down, but that was a pretty big leap in the first quarter,\" said Justin Fox, the editorial director of the Harvard Business Review.\n\nIndeed Hiring Lab economist Nick Bunker cautioned that these numbers will change as the data is refined and republished in subsequent months.\n\n\"You don't want to get too nitpicky with the data, especially a first release,\" Bunker said. \"This will get revised a few times and there are margins of errors and so forth.\"\n\n\"We had lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs under the previous administration. \u2026 Since I was elected, we've added 400,000 new manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nThe math is roughly right, but it needs context. Manufacturing jobs did decline by 192,000 under Obama, and since Trump\u2019s election, they have increased by 373,000.\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s numbers look particularly bad because he took office as the Great Recession was in full force \u2014 a situation Trump, in his short tenure, has avoided.\n\nOnce manufacturing jobs hit rock bottom in February 2010, they increased by 916,000 by the time Obama left office.\n\nThe chart below shows that manufacturing employment did weaken slightly during the final three years of Obama\u2019s tenure and began to increase early in Trump\u2019s. So it\u2019s not unreasonable for Trump to cite an uptick on his watch.\n\nThat said, the rate of increase has been fairly stable since around 2010, regardless of the president in office.\n\n\"We have added 3.7 million new jobs since the election, a number that is unthinkable if you go back to the campaign.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s number is in the ballpark. If you use November 2016 as the baseline, almost 3.5 million jobs have been added through June 2018.\n\nThis is a notable achievement, especially at the end of a long economic recovery -- the longer a recovery goes, the harder it is to keep up high rates of job growth.\n\nThat said, \"unthinkable\" is the wrong word to use. The scale of monthly job gains under Trump (shown in red in this chart) are broadly in line with the scale of monthly job gains under Obama (shown in blue).\n\n\"We are in the midst of the longest positive job growth streak in history.\"\n\nThat\u2019s correct. But as the chart above shows, a large majority of that job growth streak came on Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nThere\u2019s little question that the economy is in good health right now. But Trump is off-base when he suggests that this required a \"turnaround.\" During the second half, or more, of Obama\u2019s term, the economy was doing well, too.\n\nThe data above on job creation and GDP growth are clear evidence of that. Trends in the unemployment rate, the housing market, bankruptcies and bank failures also showed significant improvement throughout the Obama years. (Read our detailed analysis.)\n\n\"African American unemployment is the best it's ever been in the history of our country.\"\n\nThis was correct for May 2018, when it was 5.9 percent, but the rate ticked up again in June, to 6.5 percent. That\u2019s still low by historical standards, however.\n\n\"The Hispanic unemployment rate has reached the lowest level likewise in history.\"\n\nTrump is on safe ground here. The current 4.6 percent Hispanic unemployment rate is a record low.\n\n\"The Asian unemployment rate has recently reached the lowest level, again likewise, in history.\"\n\nThis statistic has only been calculated since 2003, so \"in history\" should be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the rate has been low, mostly hovering around 3.0 in the first half of 2018. That\u2019s in the ballpark of past lows.\n\nTrump is probably referring to the 2.1 percent rate in May 2018, but that appears to have been a one-month blip that returned to 3.2 percent in June, the most recent month available.\n\nThe current level is 3.7 percent. That\u2019s certainly low by historical standards, but it was as low or lower than that for most of the time between August 1999 and April 2001.\n\nConsumer confidence is high at the moment, but it\u2019s not at a record. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer confidence index was higher in the late 1990s and early 2000s.", "lang": "en"}
