The title of the article is the same as the message.\n\nFaking News specifies in its bio that it is a satirical website, yet people shared the title of its article as authentic news.\n\nSome individuals also shared a photograph of people trying to push a jeep stuck in the snow, which was the same image used in the Faking News story. A Google reverse-image search led us to a free stock photos website that described the photograph as \u2013 \u201cCar stuck in the snow \u2013 Mongolia\u201d. It was uploaded on the website in 2013 by a user named Martin Vorel.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that social media users fell for a satire or a parody handle. Last month, a satire on Kapil Sibal regarding Mallya\u2019s extradition was shared as authentic news. Recently, a tweet by a parody handle that scientists died in Karachi bomb blast was believed to be true by many. It is, however, simple to debunk such claims by searching for the message on Google.", "lang": "en"}
