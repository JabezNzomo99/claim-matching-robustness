No, that's not true: the \"news\" comes from a website that habitually takes bits and pieces of real news articles and then adds a false or exaggerated headline to it in order to attract clicks and advertising money.\n\nThe CNN story originated from an article published on May 18, 2018 by YourNewsWire titled \"CNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nCNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May. While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN's viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end. Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN's relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel's ratings crisis is even more severe.\n\nThe Breitbart article it links to accurately describes the Adweek numbers:\n\nBut neither report has any information about CNN permanently closing down.

Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pedophile Who Raped 5-Year-Old Boy NOT Found Dead With Testicles Removed\n\u2022 Fake News: Congress Did NOT Call For Immediate Arrest Of John Kerry For Treason\n\u2022 Fake News: North Korea Did NOT Agree To Open Its Doors To Christianity (Yet?)\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Calls On US Authorities To Disarm The Population", "lang": "en"}
