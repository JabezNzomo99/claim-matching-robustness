At least one of them is from London.\n\nOn 5 June 2017, the Red State Watcher web site posted two articles featuring a video that appeared to show Londoners chanting U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s name in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in the city two days earlier, which left at least victims dead, as well as the three attackers.\n\nOne article carried the headline \u201cWow! Londoners chant President Trump\u2019s name instead of mayor,\u201d and another was headlined \u201cSadiq Khan May Be In Trouble \u2013 Look What Londoners Are Doing!\u201d\n\nThat story went on to claim:\n\nLondoners are fed up [with] Sadiq\u2019s [sic] Khan\u2019s soft stance on terrorism. As British citizens die, Kahn [sic] tells the public \u201cnot to be alarm.\u201d [sic] This did not settle well with some citizens. Some Londoners took [to] the streets and instead of chanting Khan\u2019s name, they chanted Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nBoth stories included the following video:\n\nThe articles, the posting of the video, and the text that accompanied it \u2013 which labelled London Mayor Sadiq Khan an \u201cembarrassment\u201d \u2013 all came in the context of a high-profile dispute between Khan and Trump.\n\nThe morning after the attack, Trump grossly misrepresented comments made by Khan, claiming that the London Mayor had told the people of the British capital there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d at the attack.\n\nIn fact, Khan was referring specifically to increased police patrols on the streets of London, and reassuring its residents not to be unduly concerned by that escalation.\n\nA spokesperson for the London Mayor then issued a statement calling Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cill-informed\u201d and accusing him of deliberately taking Khan\u2019s comments out of context.\n\nThe following day, Trump doubled down on his attack, saying the mayor\u2019s explanation of his remarks \u2013 which was accurate \u2013 was a \u201cpathetic excuse.\u201d\n\nContrary to what the Red State Watcher articles implied, however, the video had nothing to do with that dispute, or with the June 2017 terrorist attack.\n\nIn fact, Paul Golding, leader of the right-wing extremist group Britain First, shot the video in March 2017:\n\nThe video shows a small group of far-right activists engaged in a counter-protest at a much larger anti-racism rally in London on 18 March, at which demonstrators carried signs saying \u201cStand up to Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible some of those chanting in favor of the US President are from London \u2013 Paul Golding himself is from the British capital \u2013 but the video does not show a spontaneous assembly of non-aligned Londoners favoring Donald Trump over Sadiq Khan in their dispute, following a 3 June 2017 terrorist attack in the city.", "lang": "en"}
