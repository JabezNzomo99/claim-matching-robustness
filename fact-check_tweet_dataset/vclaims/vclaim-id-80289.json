Multiple websites claim it is one of the most amazing photographs ever taken which did not use Photoshop. New Zealand photographer Chris Pegman told AFP it was a composite image created from two pictures using editing software.\n\nThis widely-shared October 16 Facebook post shows the photo of a full moon above a radio telescope.\n\nThe image has previously gone viral -- for example here in 2016 when CrowdTangle data showed it was shared by pages with more than a million followers -- along with claims that it was a perfectly timed photo and not digitally manipulated.\n\nMultiple websites -- for example here and here -- claim it is one of the best photographs ever taken without using Photoshop editing software.\n\nA reverse image search found the photo belonged to New Zealand photographer Chris Pegman.\n\nPegman told AFP it was a composite image. He said he had taken two separate images, shot a year apart and in different locations, and then merged them in Photoshop.\n\n\u201cI did not shoot this photo just when the super moon passed over the telescope. It is a composite image made with photo editing software Photoshop,\u201d Pegman said in an email.\n\n\u201cThe radio telescope panorama, located around an hour North of Auckland at Warkworth, was taken 2014,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAbout a year later, I shot a rising full moon from my home in the Bay of Islands. I put them together,\u201d Pegman said.\n\nPegman originally uploaded the image to photo sharing site Flickr where it was clearly tagged: \u201cWarkworth Radio Telescope & full moon composite\u201d.\n\n\u201cSadly, it was cropped -- my explanation of this being a composite was lost -- and went viral on Twitter with the title 'Perfect Framing, Perfect Timing' and has been featured goodness knows how many times in articles with titles like '30 perfect photos you won't believe aren't Photoshopped'\u201d, Pegman said.\n\nThe Photoshopped composite image has been viewed more than two million times on photo-sharing site Imgur, and widely shared on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.\n\nPhoto website 500px wrote in 2015 that the composite image had been cropped and shared without crediting the photographer.", "lang": "en"}
