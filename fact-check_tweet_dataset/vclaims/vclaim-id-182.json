Examples of this post can be seen here , here and here .\n\nThis claim follows President Donald Trump\u2019s recent suggestion that mosques might receive special treatment ( youtu.be/M3Ll18Cz4Yc?t=3000 ).\n\nA sample post on Facebook reads: \u201cJust want to inform you all that all Christian churches in Minnesota are closed!!! BUT the governor has allowed the mosque to remain open!! We should all be outraged at this! I spoke with a deputy with St. Cloud Police Department he said they are ALLOWED TO BE OPEN GOVERNORS ORDERS.\u201d\n\nThis claim is false. The Minnesota state government confirmed to Reuters via email that there is \u201cabsolutely no distinction between churches and mosques in any order issued by the Governor.\u201d It is true that in-person gatherings of congregants, without distinction of religion, are not allowed by the Governor\u2019s Executive Order to contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Stay at Home Order visible here , states that all workers who can work from home must do so. However, it makes an exemption for faith leaders and workers in houses of worship, who are currently among those permitted to perform their duties \u201cwherever their services may be needed.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governor\u2019s Executive Order, this category includes: \u201cofficials, workers, and leaders in houses of worship and other places of religious expression or fellowship \u2026 This category also includes workers necessary to plan, record, and distribute online or broadcast content to community members.\u201d A representative of Minnesota\u2019s state government reiterated to Reuters that this does not permit in-person gatherings of congregants.\n\nFunerals are part of the \u201cpermissible activities\u201d within Minnesota\u2019s Stay at Home Order ( here ), as long as gatherings consist of \u201cno more than 10 attendees\u201d and space allows social distancing of six feet between people. The Minnesota government states that if possible, venues should accommodate remote services.\n\nThe St. Cloud Times, a central Minnesota local media outlet, reported on churches engaging in alternative ways of worship amidst the coronavirus outbreak, including online services and masses held in parking lots ( here ).\n\nAs of April 21, 2020, Minnesota has reported 2,470 confirmed cases and 143 deaths of COVID-19 ( mn.gov/covid19/ ).\n\nReligious authorities in the United Arab Emirates urged Muslims not to congregate for prayers during the holy month expected to start this week ( here ).\n\nFalse: There is no distinction between mosques and churches in Minnesota during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
