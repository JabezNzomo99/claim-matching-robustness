The photos have been shared in a misleading context; they show a boat accident that occurred in South Sulawesi\u2019s waters more than one year earlier, in July 2018.\n\nThe photos were published in this Facebook post on October 3, 2019. It has been shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cMay our brothers and sisters are safe, an accident of a ferry from Makassar to Selayar that sank at 2 pm today.\u201d\n\nMakassar is the capital city of the Indonesian province of Sulawesi, while Selayar refers to both an island and a regency in the province.\n\nThe same photos were also shared in this post with the same claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the photos show a ferry accident that happened in July 2018.\n\nReverse image searches on Google using the three photos show they were all taken in July 2018.\n\nTwo of the photos were handout pictures from the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency dated July 3, 2018. They were published on AFP\u2019s website here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the two photos:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cThis handout picture taken and released on July 3, 2018 by Indonesia\u2019s Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB), the accident mitigation agency, shows passengers clinging to the side of a ferry as it sank off the coast of Selayar island, in South Sulawesi province. Six people died on July 3 after a ferry sank off the coast of Indonesia, as rescuers raced to save more than 130 other passengers aboard the downed vessel, officials said. The deadly accident comes as Indonesia on July 3 officially called off a search for some 164 people still missing after another ferry sank on a lake in Sumatra two weeks ago.\u201d\n\nBelow is a comparison between the photos in the misleading posts (top) and the photos from the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency (bottom):\n\nThe third photo was also taken of the same accident in July 2018.

This ferry was en route to Selayar regency.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the third image in the misleading posts (L) and the photo published by Tempo (R):\n\nAccording to this CNN Indonesia report on July 3, 2018, MV Lestari Maju capsized on that day while \u201csailing from the Bira pier, Bulukumba regency, to Pamatata pier, Selayar regency\u201d.\n\nHere are the locations of the two piers on Google Maps.", "lang": "en"}
