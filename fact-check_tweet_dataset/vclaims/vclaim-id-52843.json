Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating an image that purported to be a photograph of a graduating cadet who pulled open his tunic to reveal a crude, pejorative message aimed at the president:\n\nThis image was an altered version of a photograph related to a similar incident which had occurred several years earlier and was unrelated to Trump.\n\nIn 2018, various news accounts reported that Lt. Spenser Rapone had resigned his U.S. Army commission after being reprimanded for conduct unbecoming of an officer, a charge which encompassed his posting online \u201cto advocate for a socialist revolution and disparage high-ranking officers\u201d:\n\nTop brass at Fort Drum accepted Rapone\u2019s resignation after an earlier reprimand for \u201cconduct unbecoming of an officer.\u201d Rapone said an investigation found he went online to advocate for a socialist revolution and disparage high-ranking officers. Officially, the Army said in a statement only that it conducted a full investigation and \u201cappropriate action was taken.\u201d An unrepentant Rapone summed up the fallout in yet another tweet Monday that showed him extending a middle finger at a sign at the entrance to Fort Drum, accompanied by the words, \u201cOne final salute.\u201d \u201cI consider myself a revolutionary socialist,\u201d the 26-year-old Rapone told The Associated Press. \u201cI would encourage all soldiers who have a conscience to lay down their arms and join me and so many others who are willing to stop serving the agents of imperialism and join us in a revolutionary movement.\u201d\n\nThose posts included pictures taken at Rapone\u2019s May 2016 West Point graduation ceremony, which he later tweeted \u201cin solidarity with NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\u201d Below you can see the original photograph with the likeness of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara on Rapone\u2019s shirt, not the anti-Trump message that someone added later in the digitally altered image displayed above.", "lang": "en"}
