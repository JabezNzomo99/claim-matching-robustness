(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post appears to be referring to Chicago\u2019s \"CityKey,\" an optional, valid, government-issued ID card available to all Chicago residents \u2014 regardless of immigration status. Chicago\u2019s city council in April 2017 passed an ordinance authorizing the implementation of the CityKey program.\n\nThe card is for identification purposes and also serves as a library card and transit card. It can also be used to get discounts at museums, certain businesses and sporting events.\n\nSince it\u2019s an identification card, U.S. citizens can also use it to register to vote. But that doesn\u2019t mean it \"allows\" immigrants in the country illegally to also register or participate in the election process.\n\n\"The law has not changed: only U.S. citizens who meet other eligibility requirements such as age can register to vote. Possessing a CityKey does not change that,\" said Janece Ortiz, director of Chicago CityKey, within the city clerk\u2019s office. \"To be perfectly clear, this office would never encourage any person who is ineligible to vote to do so.\"\n\nFederal law prohibits non-U.S. citizens from voting for candidates seeking federal offices, such as the presidency or a seat in Congress.\n\nA few municipalities across the country let non-U.S. citizens vote in local elections if it\u2019s allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance. (Non-U.S. citizens includes immigrants with lawful permanent residence and immigrants here illegally.)\n\nBut Chicago is not one of these cities. Non-U.S. citizens cannot vote for city offices or state offices, said Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections.\n\nRegardless of their immigration status, parents in Chicago can vote for Local School Councils at the school level, Allen said. Traditional Local School Councils include the principal, parents, community representatives, teachers, a non-teacher representative and a student representative. (Chicago Board of Education members are appointed by the mayor.)\n\n\"Local School Council elections are nothing like standard elections,\" Allen said. \"LSC elections do not involve voter registration, they are not governed by the Election Code, and they are not managed by election authorities.\"\n\nThe Facebook post claiming that Chicago\u2019s ID card \"allows\" immigrants in the country illegally to vote in local, state, and federal elections is not based in facts.
