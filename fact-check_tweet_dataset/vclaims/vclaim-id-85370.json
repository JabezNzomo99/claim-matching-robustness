Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d March 16 \u201cActually, according to the CBO score, 14 million people will lose their insurance next year and 24 million people ultimately will lose their insurance.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Rep. Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.), news briefing, March 15\n\nThe two headline-grabbing estimates from the CBO report have been taken out of context by some lawmakers, including Pelosi and S\u00e1nchez. The CBO estimated that under the GOP replacement bill, 14 million fewer people would be insured in 2018 than under the current health-care law and 24 million fewer people insured by 2026.\n\nMany of the people who would be uninsured, at least initially, would choose not to have insurance, because they had decided to obtain health insurance only to avoid a penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate; the replacement bill eliminates the mandate. Others, such as elderly Americans, would not get insurance because the premiums are too high. (The replacement bill would allow the elderly to be charged five times as much as the youngest insured, compared with a 3:1 ratio under the ACA.) Many of the uninsured people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment \u2014 after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nThe CBO estimated that the GOP bill would lead to 14 million fewer people insured than under Obamacare by 2018. Six million of 14 million would be people who now have coverage in the individual insurance market; 5 million would be people with coverage under Medicaid; and 2 million would be people with coverage through their employers, who also would no longer be required to provide insurance. (The remainder come from other insurance shifts.)\n\nThe CBO estimated that health insurance premiums would be 10 percent lower in 2026 than projected under current law. That\u2019s because insurance premiums would spike for older people (20 to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old) and many older people would drop out of the insurance markets. Then the pool of people getting insurance would be younger and healthier, leading to lower premiums than currently projected. But it\u2019s important to remember that it does not mean that premiums would decline by 10 percent, just that they would increase at a lower rate than now projected.\n\nAccording to CNNMoney: \u201cFive major insurers paid their CEO\u2019s $73 million in 2015, the most recent year for which pay has been reported. Only $2.5 million of that was deductible under Obamacare tax laws. But more than $70 million of that would be deductible under the proposed Republican legislation.\u201d\n\nIn general, other types of businesses face a $1 million deduction limit for executive compensation. The cap also restricted corporations from making tax deductions on stock options and other \u201cperformance-based\u201d pay for the executives. So Baldwin and others argue that eliminating the cap would give incentive to companies to pay their executives more, since they\u2019d make up for some of it through lower taxes. Removing the cap would ultimately boost the incomes of top executives, who stand to gain from their companies\u2019 profitability, they say.", "lang": "en"}
