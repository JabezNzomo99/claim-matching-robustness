As reported previously by Snopes\u2019 Bethania Palma:\n\nIn August 2014, the Inspector General\u2019s office for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the original estimate for the cost of contracts associated with developing HealthCare.gov totaled $1.7 billion. In its own September 2014 investigation, Bloomberg Government, in an independent analysis, tallied the cost of the website at $2.1 billion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no secret there were big problems around the launch of HealthCare.gov in 2014, we found no documentation to support the $5 billion price tag Trump cited (or even close to that), so we\u2019re rating the new variant of this claim as False.", "lang": "en"}
