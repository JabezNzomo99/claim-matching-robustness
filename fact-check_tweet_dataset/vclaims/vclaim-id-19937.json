Activist Rees Mann was discussing\n\nexpos\u00e9 about alleged sexual abuse at an all-boys school in Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cOne in 4 females will be sexually abused before the age of 18 and one in 6 boys will be sexually abused,\u201d Mann, founder of the advocacy organisation\n\nIs this the current situation in South Africa?\n\nTo support his statement, Mann emailed Africa Check a number of links to various websites, most of which were American.\n\nHis statistic for the percentage of men who are sexually abused by the time they turn 18 was mainly based on estimates by\n\n, a US non-governmental organisation that provides support and counselling services to male survivors of sexual assault and their families.\n\nAccording to the organisation, \u201cat least one in 6 [American] men have had unwanted sexual experiences, including abuse and assault\u201d.\n\nthis number to the United States\u2019 Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMann didn\u2019t provide a source for his estimate that one in 4 girls will be sexually abused by the age of 18.\n\nResearch on the extent of child sexual abuse in South Africa is scarce and where information is available, the numbers vary widely.\n\nhas provided new insight into the sexual abuse of children in South Africa.\n\nwas conducted by the\n\nas well as its psychology department.\n\n\u201cThis is the first-ever nationally representative study of the extent of sexual violence against children in South Africa\n\nResearchers asked 4,086 school children and 5,631 children out of school - all between the ages of 15 and 17 - about various forms of abuse they had experienced.\n\nBefore 2007, South Africa had a very narrow definition of rape. If this definition of rape was used in previous studies, then the level of reported sexual assault would be lower. (\n\nThe definition we used included a far wider definition of sexual abuse than has been used before, but our definition is in line with the best and newest science globally,\u201d said Ward.\n\nThe study made a distinction between penetrative and non-penetrative sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n \n\n Questions asked by Optimus Study researchers:\n\u2022 None Did a grown-up (adult) you know touch your private parts when they shouldn\u2019t have or make you touch their private parts or force you to have sex?\n\u2022 None Did a grown-up (adult) you did not know touch your private parts when they shouldn\u2019t have, make you touch their private parts or force you to have sex?\n\u2022 None Did another child or teen make you do sexual things against your will?\n\u2022 None Did anyone try to force you to have sex, that is sexual intercourse of any kind, even if it didn\u2019t happen?\n\u2022 None Did anyone make you look at their private parts by using force or surprise, force you to watch them masturbate, view nude pictures or pornographic videos (pictures and videos about sex), or by \u201cflashing\u201d you?\n\u2022 None Did anyone hurt your feelings by saying or writing something sexual about you or your body?\n\u2022 None Other than previous incidents you may have already mentioned, at any time in your life, did you do sexual things with anyone 18 or older, even things you both wanted? \n\n \n\n If a child answered yes to any of these questions, they were considered to have been sexually abused. \n\n\n\nThe study found that 35.4% of the young people interviewed in schools had been sexually abused at some point in their lives. In comparison, 26.3% of those interviewed in their homes said they had ever experienced sexual abuse.\n\nWard said: \u201cYoung people interviewed in school may have felt freer to disclose sexual abuse than those interviewed in their homes, and therefore these figures are higher.\u201d\n\nThe study found that at least as many boys (36.8%) as girls (33.9%) reported some form of sexual abuse.\n\nExtrapolating this figure, the study estimated that at least\n\n784,967 young people aged 15 to 17 in South Africa have been sexually abused.\n\nConclusion: Level of child sexual abuse even higher than claimed\n\nFollowing allegations of sexual abuse at an all-boys school in Johannesburg, activist Rees Mann said in a radio interview that one in 4 girls and one in 6 boys will be sexually abused before the age of 18.\n\nBut Mann\u2019s figures are an underestimate, one of the lead researchers of the first nationally representative study on child sexual abuse said. The study found that one in 3 South African children reported some form of sexual abuse by their 17th birthday.\n\n1 in 3 SA children reported some form of sexual abuse before age 17.South Africa's minister of home affairs, Hlengiwe Buhle Mkhize, signs a pledge in support of child protection in Langa, Cape Town, in May 2017.
