As of February, 20 2020, the image has over 200,300 shares and has been posted in at least 500 Facebook groups and pages, according to Crowdtangle (examples here and here )\n\nBoth claims are false. While the image does not attribute the statistics to any source, Reuters could not find any official record matching these numbers.\n\nThere is no nationwide data on crimes committed specifically by \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. However, the alleged number of Americans killed as stated in this claim is much higher than any available information on crime.\n\nFBI records show that in the year 2018 the total number of murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in the U.S. was 16,214 (as listed here ). Therefore, for the claimed data to be true, 62% of the homicides of that year would have been committed by \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. According to the Pew Research Center (here ), \u201cunauthorised immigrants\u201d only represent around 3.2% of the U.S. population.\n\nAccording to ICE statistics published in ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations Report, in the Fiscal Year 2018 here page 4) (from October 2017 to September 2018) there were 2,028 total offenses for homicide (387 criminal charges 1641 for criminal convictions) committed by aliens in the U.S. The IRS defines aliens as any person who is not a U.S. national (which would include legal and illegal immigrants. The number is even lower for the Fiscal Year 2019 here page 15) with 1,923 total offenses for homicide (374 criminal charges and 1,549 criminal convictions). The Fiscal Year 2018 data was the closest we could find to match the claim of murders \u201cin 2018\u201d. Reuters was unable to find official government data on U.S. homicide statistics committed by illegal immigrants for the calendar year 2018.\n\nWhile there is no official record that specifically tracks crimes committed by \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in the U.S., the closest available data available from ICE and the FBI show the claimed number of homicides committed by \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d is, by any imaginable means, exaggerated.\n\nClaim: 194 Americans were killed in mass shootings in 2018\n\nAs there is no set definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d, the statistics on fatalities of these incidents differ among organisations. Reuters could not find any existing record that matched the 194 deaths by mass shootings in 2018 put forth in this claim.\n\nAccording to the FBI (report here ), in 2018 there were 27 \u201cactive shooter incidents\u201d that resulted in 213 casualties excluding the shooters (85 people killed and 128 people injured). The FBI does not use the term \u201cmass shooting\u201d, but \u201cactive shooter incidents\u201d (as referenced here ). This refers to incidents of one or more shooters \u201cactively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area\u201d, which excludes drug or gang violence and \u201caccidental discharges of a firearm\u201d. Of the 27 incidents of 2018, 10 met the criteria of the definition put forth by the Justice Department of \u201cmass killings\u201d, which is that three or more people were killed in the same incident. (Read the Act here )\n\nA lower number was reported by Mother Jones\u2019 open-source database here . According to the nonprofit, in 2018 there were 12 \u201cmass shootings\u201d that resulted in 80 fatalities and 70 injuries. Mother Jones considers any shooting in public places that result in four of more victims killed by the attacker, excluding armed robbery, gang violence or \u201cthose in which the perpetrators have not been identified\u201d.\n\nWith a much broader definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d, the Gun Violence Archive organization (Link to the website\n\nhere )recorded 371 killings and 1,336 injuries in 337 incidents in 2018. According to their methodology here , the nonprofit considers any event in which four or more people, not including the shooter, were either shot and killed or shot and wounded. They do not \u201cexclude, set apart, caveat, or differentiate victims based upon the circumstances in which they were shot\u201d.\n\nAccording to a report by Everytown here , based on police and court records as well as media reports, in 2018 there were 19 \u201cmass shootings\u201d that resulted in 112 fatalities and 45 injuries. The gun control group defines a mass shooting as any incident in which four or more people are shot and killed, excluding the shooter.\n\nWhile there is no standard definition for \u201cmass shooting\u201d and the numbers vary from outlet to outlet, there is no clear statistic pointing to the claim that in 2018, 194 Americans were killed in mass shootings.", "lang": "en"}
