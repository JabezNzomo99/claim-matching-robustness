It shows a person, presumably the Sultan, being escorted by security personnel before gunshots are fired and he is quickly whisked away. Several Facebook users have posted the video with identical text.\n\nNumerous users of the official Alt News app have requested verification of this video, which has also been circulated with a message in English- \u201cAttack on Sultan of Oman\u201c.\n\nAlt News found the same video posted on Twitter on December 19. The tweet claims that the video shows an attempted assassination of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. It has been retweeted over 4500 times already.\n\nAlt News found the accompanying social media claims false. The video represents not an assassination attempt on the Sultan of Oman or the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. It shows a mock drill conducted by security personnel. This is indicated by the fact that people present at the scene are shooting the event on their mobile phones, as can be seen in the video.\n\nAfter breaking up the video into multiple key-frames, Alt News reverse-searched one of the frames on Google and came across an article on a Lebanese news website, www.annahar.com. The report of December 13, 2019 states that the video is from Kuwait, and fact-checks the claim that the speaker of the Kuwaiti Parliament was attacked. According to the article, the security personnel seen in the video are Kuwait Emiri Guard, an elite combat unit of the Kuwaiti armed forces, who are conducting a mock drill in Kuwait. Alt News also found other reports stating the same.\n\nIt may thus be noted the claim that the Sultan of Oman was attacked, is false. The video is from Kuwait and represents a mock drill conducted by security personnel.", "lang": "en"}
