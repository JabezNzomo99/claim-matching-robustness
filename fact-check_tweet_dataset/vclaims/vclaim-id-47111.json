Responding to Twitter user @Vivek21shukla, Pratapgarh police tweeted in Hindi, \u201cThe flag displayed in the above-mentioned case is of Nepal. To protest the parliament of Nepal allegedly declaring Indian territories as their land, members of AIMIM party Pratapgarh burnt Nepalese flags.

As per a June 18 Hindustan Times report, \u201cAlmost 98% of the 1,750-km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in the Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar.\u201d\n\nThe clipping shared by the police clearly shows that the men are burning a Nepalese flag.\n\nIn response to @Asli_Shivani\u2019s tweet, Pratapgarh police upload a video clarification by one of the men in the viral video. He says, \u201cI had notified the respected president and district magistrate about this protest. I\u2019m protesting against Nepal. In case someone thinks that this act was done to hurt religious sentiments, I\u2019d like to apologise.
