Bon Appetit!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been shared more than 29,000 times.\n\narticle debunking myths around margarine explains: \u201cMost types of margarine are blends of vegetable oils, while plastics are usually a polymer (chain of repeating molecules) of ethylene molecules (four hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms).\u201d\n\n\u201cAdding another molecule to margarine does not turn it into plastic,\u201d Huffpost says.\n\n, describes the claim as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cobviously made up by someone with no understanding of chemistry\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even make sense. Margarine contains several different molecules. Plastics are polymers and completely unrelated to anything in margarine.\u201d\n\n, which explains: \u201cMany disparate substances share similar chemical properties, but even the slightest variation in molecular structure can make a world of difference.\u201d\n\nEven if margarine were one molecule away from plastic (it isn\u2019t), eating it still wouldn\u2019t be the same as eating a plastic bag.\n\nAs Snopes points out: \u201cThe only difference between hydrogen peroxide and water is one oxygen atom.\u201d We need water to survive, but drinking\n\nexplains this simply: \u201cPaint doesn\u2019t contain any of the ingredients in margarine.\u201d\n\nMargarine has only eight ingredients, according to New Zealand consumer website\n\n. \u201cCreating margarine generally requires salt, emulsifiers, lecithin, flavouring, colour agent, water, skim milk and a plant based oil (such as sunflower, olive, palm or corn).\u201d\n\nThe ingredients of paint are very different.\n\n, a civil engineering site, has the recipe. \u201cFor most of the paints the basic ingredients are: solvent (used to obtain the desired flow of paint), binder (to add adhesion and cohesion), pigments (to add colour) and additives (for additional characters).\u201d\n\nNot only does margarine not have enough ingredients to share 27 of them with paint, but the ingredients of the two substances are simply not the same.\n\nBut where does the myth come from?\n\nFats such as margarine have\n\n, which means they can be spread, manipulated and shaped. It\n\n\u201cFats are made up of triglycerides (three individual fatty acids bound together through their reaction with glycerol in a single large molecule),\u201d says\n\n\u201cTriglycerides have different melting points, with some fatty acids staying solid for longer than other. This feature gives the fat its plasticity.\u201d \u2013", "lang": "en"}
