No news outlets have reported on it, and the photos used in the meme are miscaptioned.\n\nTrump attended the New York Military Academy (NYMA) for high school and graduated in 1964. This post, representing itself as a news clipping, claims that during his time there, Trump may have taken a test to measure his IQ, or intelligence quotient.\n\n\u201cThe results of an IQ test that President Donald Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy have been discovered in a file box in a closet in Brooklyn. According to the test results, Trump\u2019s IQ is 73,\u201d the image reads.\n\nThe post claims that someone named William Askew Jr. uncovered the document while clearing out his late father\u2019s home. \u201cDad was the school counselor at NYMA from 1955 to 1985,\u201d it quotes him as saying. \u201cHe didn\u2019t administer these tests, but he was in charge of collecting them and sending them to the grading office.\u201d\n\nTrump is notorious for touting his intelligence, so if the post were true, it would be a bombshell \u2013 an IQ score in the low 70s is significantly below average. \u201cNearly 70 percent of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115 on most tests,\u201d reads the website for MENSA.\n\nHowever, no news outlets have covered this story, and it appears nowhere credible online. The story is a hoax.\n\nThere\u2019s one other indication that the story is fake. The meme claims to show photos of Askew and his father, yet both are miscaptioned. As reported by Snopes, the supposed picture of Askew comes from a stock photo website, labelled \u201cportrait of an elderly man.\u201d The image captioned as Askew\u2019s father is actually of Lawrence Hanson, then-principal of Grand Forks Central High School in North Dakota. The photo is dated 1950.", "lang": "en"}
