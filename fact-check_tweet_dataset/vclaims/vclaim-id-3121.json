Bush say he doesn\u2019t approve of the media\u2019s treatment of Donald Trump?\n\n\n\nA: No. That statement is based on a misrepresentation of what the former president said a year ago.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush hasn\u2019t said much publicly about President Donald Trump.\n\nBut something he did say a year ago while he was promoting his book \u201cPortraits of Courage\u201d has been taken out of context and used to falsely convey his statements about the current president.\n\nA story using a quote from a \u201cToday\u201d show interview is circulating on Facebook under the headline: \u201cGeorge W. Bush Breaks Silence With Incredible Statement About President Trump.\u201d\n\nUsers of the social media site flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story, which was published on Feb. 26, 2018, quotes an interview Bush did with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer on Feb. 27, 2017, shortly after Trump took office.\n\nAlthough the story implies that the statement came from a recent interview, Lauer hasn\u2019t worked at the \u201cToday\u201d show since November 2017, when he was fired in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIn the interview, Lauer had asked Bush to compare the divisions in the country when he took office in 2001 to the divisions in the country following the 2016 elections and to talk about the likelihood of unifying the country.\n\nBush answered: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to unify the country, though, with the news media being so split up.\u201d\n\nHe went on, looking at Lauer, \u201cWhen I was president, you know, you mattered a lot more. Because there was, like, three of you, and now there\u2019s all kinds of information being bombarded out and people can say things anonymously \u2014 it\u2019s just a different world.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the quote that the false story used.\n\nAfter that, it claimed: \u201cHe confirmed how dishonest the mainstream media can be and publicly said that he doesn\u2019t approve of what they have been saying about Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBush didn\u2019t say anything like that, though.\n\nIn the actual interview, Lauer followed up by asking, \u201cDid you ever consider the media to be the enemy of the American people?\u201d\n\nBush answered: \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. We need an independent media to hold people like me to account. I mean, power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive and it\u2019s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from what the false story claims Bush said.\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first story to distort that quote.\n\nThere have been several similarly misleading stories, going back as far as July 2017. A spate of them were published in the fall, around the time that Bush gave a speech that was widely considered to be critical of Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nStelter, Brian and Kludt, Tom. \u201cNBC fires Matt Lauer after complaint about \u2018inappropriate sexual behavior.\u2019\u201d CNN. 29 Nov 2017.", "lang": "en"}
