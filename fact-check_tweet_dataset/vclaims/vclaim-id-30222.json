The image can check the person\u2019s level of stress as per the text in the viral post. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nAn image shared on Facebook by a user named Rashmi Arora reads: \u201cThis is a still image created by a Japanese Neurologist, Yamamoto. As per the Neurologist, if you find it as a still image, you are healthy, if the image appears to be shaky, you are a little stressed or you have not got a sound sleep during night, if you find the image circulating, then you are stressed and you need some rest, if you find the image moving fast, you are highly stressed and you need treatment.\u201d You can see the archived post here.\n\nVishvas News had debunked the fake post sometime back and you can check the fact-checked article by clicking here.\n\nConclusion: The post claiming that the image created by a Japanese neurologist checks a person\u2019s level of stress is fake. The post is actually created by Yurii Perepadia, who is a graphic designer from Ukraine. And, it does not determine the state of mind or levels of stress.\n\nFact-checking journalism, which holds mirror to power while being free from the ropes of corporate and politics, is possible only with support from public.
