Your mask works, right?\u201d more about the rating framework Flawed reasoning: The claim that masks \u201ceither work or don\u2019t work\u201d fails to acknowledge the reality that face masks are extremely effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 even though they provide only partial protection from the virus that causes it. In order to be optimally effective, masks must be combined with other measures like physical distancing and proper hand hygiene. It is an oversimplification to claim that \u201ceither masks work or they don\u2019t\u201d, because the underlying assumption is that face masks must work perfectly, and if they do not, then they don\u2019t work at all. On the contrary, the risks of disease exposure and the degree of protection one can achieve from different safety measures lie on a continuum. Even though face masks do not confer 100% protection to the wearer or to others, scientific evidence has demonstrated that face masks reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19 to some degree. Therefore, it remains important for people to continue to practice physical distancing and proper hand hygiene as the combination of the three measures greatly enhances the effectiveness of any one measure used alone.\n\n\n\n Memes calling into question the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19 have been circulating on social media platforms in various forms. Some have asserted that \u201ceither masks work or they don\u2019t\u201d and questioned why lockdowns are necessary if masks supposedly work. Others asserted that \u201cif masks work\u201d, then there is no reason to restrict activities such as nursing home visits and in-person voting.\n\nBy using a combination of a misleading rhetorical technique known as \u201cjust asking questions\u201d\u2014which allows a person to ask leading questions and posit baseless or disproven hypotheses without having to provide evidence\u2014and a form of flawed reasoning known as the nirvana fallacy\u2014where a solution to a problem is rejected because it is imperfect even though a perfect solution is unrealistic\u2014the memes suggest that masks are an ineffective and unnecessary measure for reducing virus transmission.\n\nFirstly, scientific evidence demonstrates that face masks reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19, as this Health Feedback review explained. Face masks are therefore an important measure for minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and controlling the outbreak.\n\nHowever, face masks do not provide the wearer with 100% protection from exposure, nor do they 100% prevent an infected mask wearer from spreading their infection. Incorrect use of face masks can also further reduce their effectiveness. For this reason, health authorities recommend that people practice physical distancing and proper hand hygiene, which act as additional layers of protection, in addition to wearing face masks. This is analogous to measures used to improve traffic safety, like the use of seatbelts, which significantly reduce the risk of injury or death from a traffic accident. But seatbelts alone do not remove the risk entirely, hence they do not render additional safety features such as airbags and brakes redundant, as this Facebook post pointed out. In spite of this, one would not argue that seatbelts either work or they don\u2019t, or that they are useless simply because they do not prevent all risks.\n\nSecondly, these memes oversimplify the concepts of risk and protection by portraying them as binary concepts that either exist or do not exist. The reality is that risk and protection exist on a continuum. For example, different types of activities carry different levels of infection risk; some activities, such as taking a walk outdoors, carry less risk compared to activities such as attending a live concert (Figure 1). But it is nearly impossible for someone to achieve a state of no risk.\n\nThe meme that references nursing homes is inaccurate, as some nursing homes have begun to allow in-person visits once more. Nursing homes have had to balance residents\u2019 safety during the outbreak\u2014given that the elderly population is highly vulnerable to COVID-19 complications\u2014with the risks of prolonged isolation that comes from banning visits, which is also detrimental to residents\u2019 health and wellbeing. In light of the complex risks, the decision to allow in-person visits is guided by the epidemiological situation within the nursing home and the community, as well as the ability of a nursing home to meet the reopening criteria outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Homeland Security.\n\nThe CMS recommendations for reopening nursing homes, issued on 18 May 2020, clearly include the use of face masks and cloth face coverings, among other measures:\n\nIn cases where such safety measures have been met, some nursing homes have started to allow visits once more, although Christian Bergman, a geriatrician and assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, estimated that less than 5% of facilities in the U.S. have managed to meet the criteria in this New York Times article published on 18 August 2020.", "lang": "en"}
