Overall, the government emphasised that the analysis was a work in progress and \u201cis not representative of the expected outcome of the negotiations.\u201d\n\nThese figures don\u2019t mean that the government thinks there will be a recession. A recession would mean the economy is shrinking, whereas these figures are about it growing less quickly than it otherwise might have.\n\nThere are a wide range of estimates on what might happen to the UK economy in the long-term after Brexit is complete. Most predict that growth will be slower.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about interpreting economic models and predictions here.", "lang": "en"}
