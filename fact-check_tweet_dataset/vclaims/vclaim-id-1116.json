This is false.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe claims seem to be in relation to the QAnon conspiracy theory that powerful celebrities are a part of a child sex trafficking ring ( here ).\n\nThe photograph of DeGeneres was taken from a clip of the Ellen Show, where she makes a video call to actress Courtney Cox ( here ). The photograph in the claim captures the moment at around the 3:05 minute mark. Her sweatpants are ruffled but there is no clear visual of an ankle monitor. Another recent video of DeGeneres clearly shows her ankles with no monitors ( youtu.be/fES_YdzwqxI?t=120 ).\n\nThe photograph of Winfrey was taken from a clip of her cooking spaghetti carbonara ( here ). Throughout the video, there is no clear visual of an ankle monitor. Another recent live video of Winfrey shows her bare ankles ( here ).\n\nAny arrest of Winfrey or DeGeneres would have been widely reported by news organizations.\n\nWinfrey has previously responded to conspiracy claims she was arrested in a tweet, published in March: \u201cJust got a phone call that my name is trending. And being trolled for some awful FAKE thing. It\u2019s NOT TRUE. Haven\u2019t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. These posts are inspired by baseless conspiracy claims. Videos of both women do not show them wearing ankle monitors.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
