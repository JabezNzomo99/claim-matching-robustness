However, both videos show footage of earlier looting incidents and were already circulating online last year.\n\nOne of the videos shared in a Facebook post from April 1 is captioned: \u201cAnd the looting starts in South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe 43-second video shows people running into a shop at a petrol station and grabbing items before bolting out the doors.\n\nHowever, a Facebook search shows the video has been on the platform since at least September 4, 2019, as seen in this post.\n\nThe second video gaining traction on Facebook was posted on April 2 and it reads: \u201cPeople looting shops in Cape Town suburbs ?? ~ Welcome to South Africa.\u201d\n\nAgain, an internet search shows the video in this News24 article from September 25, 2019, titled: \u201cBrazen 'looters' ransack Cape Town butchery, make off with carcasses.\u201d\n\nThe article reports on footage shared on social media of people allegedly stealing animal carcasses from a butchery in Valhalla Park in Cape Town.\n\nAccording to this report, the butchery lootings were carried out on the prompting of local gangsters in preparation for Heritage Day celebrations, when many South Africans fire up their barbecues.\n\nNeither video is, therefore, recent.\n\nMeanwhile, a genuine incident of looting at a liquor store in Cape Town on April 5 was reported in this Independent Online article, a few days after the misleading use of the two videos on Facebook.\n\nElsewhere, live streams viewed by tens of thousands of people on a Kenyan Facebook page also purportedly showed a looting spree in Mexico prompted by panic over the pandemic, but the footage was actually an old video played on a loop.
