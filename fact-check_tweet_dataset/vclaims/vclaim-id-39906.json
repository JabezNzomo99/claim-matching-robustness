I don\u2019t get a salary from Westminster\u201d Chris Hazzard MP, 4 September 2019\n\nJournalist Victoria Derbyshire recently asked Chris Hazzard\u2014an MP for the Irish Republican party Sinn F\u00e9in\u2014why he takes his salary as an MP, given that he claims that the UK parliament does not represent the interests of his constituents.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MPs maintain a policy of abstentionism in the House of Commons, meaning they don\u2019t take their seats or vote.\n\nAs Mr Hazzard pointed out, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs do not receive parliamentary salaries. However they do receive money for expenses and the party itself receives some public money for party business, as do other opposition parties.\n\nMPs are required by law to make an oath of allegiance or \u201csolemn affirmation\u201d to the Queen before being able to take their seats, vote in parliament or draw a salary.\n\nAs this goes against Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s rejection of the Queen as their head of State, its MPs refuse to do this.\n\nPaul Maskey, MP for Belfast West, explained Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s view in the Guardian last year: \u201cThe crucial point here is that we are not British MPs. We are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cSinn F\u00e9in goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs by people who vote for Sinn F\u00e9in not to take seats at Westminster.\n\n\u201cAs MPs, therefore, we take no part in the Westminster parliament but in every other way we provide active representation for our constituents. We engage with British political parties, civic society and the Irish diaspora in Britain. We challenge the British government directly in our meetings with them. We lobby on constituents\u2019 issues, and on all the political matters that affect the Irish people.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, a Sinn F\u00e9in press release stated that the rules on salaries meant that the party had been \u201cdenied\u201d almost \u00a31.5 million over a five year period. This suggests that the party felt that its MPs should receive their salaries; we\u2019ve asked them for more recent information on their position.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MPs are allowed to claim parliamentary expenses. In 2018/19 Sinn Fein\u2019s seven MPs claimed \u00a3106,000 in office costs (things like stationery, rental costs and other bills) and \u00a314,000 in accommodation costs (specifically hotels in the London area).\n\nAside from expenses for individual MPs, Sinn F\u00e9in as a party receives some money to cover \u201cexpenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for the employment of staff and related support to Members designated as that party\u2019s spokesman in relation to the party\u2019s representative business.\u201d\n\nThis is similar to a scheme available to all other opposition parties, but unlike that one the money available to Sinn F\u00e9in is for parties whose MPs have not taken up their seats. Sinn F\u00e9in received around \u00a3170,000 through this scheme for party business in 2018/19.", "lang": "en"}
