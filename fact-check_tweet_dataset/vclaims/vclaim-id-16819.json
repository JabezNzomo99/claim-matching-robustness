It estimated a \u00a31.3 billion gap between what care providers say they need and what councils spent last year, and another \u00a31.3 billion for extra costs due to inflation, an aging population and the new National Living Wage rate of \u00a37.20.\n\nThe LGA says it takes into account the government\u2019s promises of extra funding through the Better Care Fund and the optional council tax rise, but not other potential pressures from policy changes or unmet needs.\n\nA group of leading health charities calculated a similar figure. It compared projected needs with projected spending and found a gap of at least \u00a31.9 billion in 2017/18 and \u00a32.3 billion by 2020.\n\nSimilarly, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services says that the additional funding gap by then will be \u00a32.9 billion.", "lang": "en"}
