The video was uploaded to the Internet months before the World Cup began in June.\n\nA video showing a team of footballers huddled in a hotel room singing and praying has gone viral on WhatsApp and Facebook with a false message that it depicts the Croatian team during the ongoing World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe clips shows a bunch of footballers in a hotel room singing and praying with what appears to be an open bible placed on the hotel bed.\n\nThe video is being shared on social media with text that reads as, \"This is Croatia Foot Ball Team. They play together... but pray and praise together too. This is the secret why they had won in 2 matches so far. God bless them...\"\n\nHowever, the athletes can be heard singing in Portuguese. The lyrics are of the song \"Todavia Me Alegrarei\" which loosely translates as I will still rejoice.\n\nBOOM did a Reverse Image Search of a still from the video and was able to find it on a website called id-tv.org\n\nThe post from the account 'Gospel Life Sound' from April 2018 states that the players in the video belong to the team CSA of Alagoas. CSA stands for Centro Sportivo Alagoano a football club in the city of Macei\u00f3 in the state of Alagoas in Brazil.\n\nWhile the team's official apparel includes blue and white stripes; we were also able to find a photo on the club's verified Facebook page where the jersey and club logo match that of those seen in the video.\n\nMeanwhile Croatia are having a dream run in their world cup campaign. The Croats have topped Group D beating Argentina, Nigeria and Iceland in the group matches so far.", "lang": "en"}
