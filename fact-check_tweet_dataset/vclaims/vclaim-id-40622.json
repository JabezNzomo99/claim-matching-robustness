It appears in neither the transcript nor the footage of his recent Michigan rally.\n\nTrump held a campaign rally at the Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek, Michigan, Dec. 18, the same night the House voted to impeach him on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 600 times, claims Trump said there were \u201c40,000 people in [Kellogg Arena] tonight, with thousands waiting outside to get in but they \u2026 won\u2019t show it to you.\u201d Similar claims have been circulating on Twitter.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no record of him making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The quote about 40,000 people supposedly attending the rally appears in neither the footage nor the transcript of the event.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any media reports crediting him with the claim either. (RELATED: Did Four Republicans Vote To Impeach Trump?)\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t make the claim that 40,000 people attended the event, Trump did comment on the size of the rally\u2019s crowd.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave,\u201d said Trump. \u201cYou know? It\u2019s so cold outside we told them, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch.\u2019 But we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena. And I said to my people, \u2018Why so small?'\u201d\n\nKellogg Arena has a maximum capacity of 6,200 people, according to its website. A local journalist, Leon Hendrix, reported that, per the Calhoun County sheriff, more than 2,000 people were in the overflow area outside the arena.\n\nTrump has claimed that media outlets intentionally don\u2019t cover the crowd size at his rallies in the past, according to PolitiFact.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
