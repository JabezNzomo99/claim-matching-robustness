It doesn\u2019t appear in any of his lyrics or his three books.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to several experts, none of whom recognized the quote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost positive that is not a John Lennon quote,\u201d said Nicole Michael, a spokeswoman for Lennon biographer Jude Southerland Kessler, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cIn fact, I think it\u2019s from a Tears for Fears song.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a quick Google search reveals the quote does come from a song written by Roland Orzabal, a member of Tears for Fears, and Nicky Holland, a singer-songwriter. Tears for Fears included the song in which the words appear on its 1989 album, \u201cThe Seeds of Love.\u201d\n\nThe words are in the second verse of their song \u201cAdvice for the Young at Heart,\u201d according to the lyric website Genius. The song was released as a single in 1990.\n\nThe quote has been attributed to Lennon since at least 2010, according to the website Quote Investigator, though there might have been earlier instances.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
