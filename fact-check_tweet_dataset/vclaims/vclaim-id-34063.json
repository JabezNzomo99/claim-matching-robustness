The text of the morphed poster reads, \"Remove CAB. Make this nation a Muslim country.\" (Original text in Hindi: \u0915\u0948\u092c (CAB) \u0939\u091f\u093e\u0913 \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0913\u0902).\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra led the protest at India Gate, Delhi, against the police crackdown on students of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) on December 16. The students of the varsity were allegedly beaten up for demonstrating against the Citizenship Law on December 15.\n\nThe edited image is doing the rounds with the caption: \"All the anti-Modi people, open your eyes and read the text circled in red and understand the agenda of Congress and opposition parties. If you will be content with free water and electricity, then Muslim rule will be back.\" (Caption in Hindi:\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927\u0940, \u0917\u094b\u0932 \u0918\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u094b \u0932\u093f\u0916\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0916\u0902 \u0916\u094b\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0922\u093c \u0932\u094b \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u094b \u0915\u093f \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u093f\u092a\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0926\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u090f\u091c\u0947\u0902\u0921\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948? \u092e\u0941\u092b\u094d\u0924 \u092c\u093f\u091c\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u0916\u0941\u0936 \u0939\u094b \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939 \u091c\u093e\u0913\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u091c \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0906 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e\u0964)\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the poster in the photograph was edited as no such poster was seen during the demonstrations of the Congress party in India Gate last week.\n\nWe compared an image that was uploaded on an unofficial page of Indian Overseas Congress and found that the original poster held by the party worker read as, \"not lathis and bullets. But employment (rozgar) and food (roti),\". \n\n\n\nIn the below comparison of images, multiple similarities show that the poster originally read as, \"\u0932\u093e\u0920\u0940-\u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0930\u094b\u091c\u093c\u0917\u093e\u0930-\u0930\u094b\u091f\u0940 \u0926\u094b\"\n\nAnother photograph, clicked by The Print photojournalist Suraj Singh Bisht, shows the same party leader, holding the original poster (circled in red) .\n\nBelow is a clearer shot of the same poster held by Supriya Shrinate, the national spokesperson of the Indian National Congress.\n\nWhile we could not find the same image that had been morphed, another photograph by United News India, taken from a different angle corroborated the original poster. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, we looked up multiple live videos from the protest, which showed similar posters being showcased as part of the agitation.\n\n\n\nThe posters can be seen at 14 second mark in the below Facebook LIVE that was shot.", "lang": "en"}
