The quote credited to him in the Facebook post is one such example. (RELATED: Did Ralph Waldo Emerson Say This Quote About \u2018What Lies Within Us\u2019?)\n\nA search of his written body of work turned up no matching or similar expressions. It also does not appear in \u201cMark Twain at Your Fingertips: A Book of Quotations\u201d or the \u201cYale Book of Quotations.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote was Twain\u2019s.\n\nQuote Investigator, a website dedicated to researching the source of quotations, believes the saying attributed to the author of \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\u201d actually came from 18th-century French writer Nicolas Chamfort, though the wording varied slightly when translated from its original French. The quote, according to Quote Investigator, was first linked to Twain in 1988, over 70 years after his death.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
