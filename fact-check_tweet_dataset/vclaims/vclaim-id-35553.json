And that came out of the blue.\u201d\n\nIn early March, the State Department asked to extend Yovanovitch\u2019s term as Ukraine ambassador until 2020. But by the end of May, she was removed. During a meeting in Washington, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said that \u201cthe President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador,\u201d Yovanovitch testified as part of the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nSullivan added that \u201cthere had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\u201d Yovanovitch told lawmakers. \u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch testified to Congress that she first learned Giuliani had it out for her in late 2018: \u201cBasically, it was people in the Ukrainian Government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, was in communication with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.\u201d\n\nLutsenko \u2014 an ally of former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who lost to Zelensky \u2014 had pledged to root out corruption in the prosecutor general\u2019s office, prosecute the killers of innocent people during the 2014 Maidan revolution, and prosecute money-laundering cases to recover more than $40 billion stolen by a previous Ukrainian president and other officials, Yovanovitch testified. \u201cNone of those things were done. And we thought those were great goals, and we wanted him to encourage him to continue with those goals,\u201d she recalled to Congress.\n\nLutsenko would also ask Yovanovitch to set up meetings for him with top U.S. officials, dangling the vague prospect of important information to share with them, she said. She declined to set up the meetings, she told lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry, and said Lutsenko could be charming but was also seen as corrupt.\n\nNow let\u2019s go back to Trump\u2019s claim that Zelensky had negative things to say about Yovanovitch. It\u2019s not the first time that Trump has made this claim. He told reporters Oct. 11: \u201cIf you remember the phone call I had with the president \u2014 the new president \u2014 he didn\u2019t speak favorably. But I just don\u2019t know her. She may be a wonderful woman.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 12, Trump said in a Fox News interview: \u201cShe may be a very fine person. I just don\u2019t know. But even if you listen to the very good conversation that I had \u2014 a very, very good, no-pressure, congenial conversation with the new president of Ukraine \u2014 he had some things that were not flattering to say about her. And that came out of the blue.\u201d (In this interview, Trump also called Yovanovitch \u201cvery partisan\u201d and \u201ca Clinton-type person,\u201d but there\u2019s no evidence for either claim.)\n\nThis came seemingly out of the blue. It was in the middle of two requests Trump made of Zelensky that are being investigated as part of the House impeachment inquiry. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic server, Ukraine and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike; then he threw in the criticism of Yovanovitch; then he asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAs for Yovanovitch, Zelensky responded: \u201cI would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
