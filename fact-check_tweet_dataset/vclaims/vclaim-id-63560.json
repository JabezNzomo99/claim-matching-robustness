Chauvin, a 19-year-veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department, has been involved in several police-involved shootings, the Star Tribune reported. On social media, people are sharing a photo that seemingly adds another layer to his history.\n\n\"Hey look,\" reads the caption of a photo that shows several people on a stage with President Donald Trump. A yellow arrow points to a man standing near him, behind a podium with the presidential seal. \"Here\u2019s a picture of Derek Chauvin - the cop who killed George Floyd.\"\n\nA Fox News affiliate in Minneapolis reported on May 27 that neither Chauvin nor the other three officers were at the October campaign rally in Minneapolis that\u2019s shown in the photo being shared online.\n\nLt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, spoke at the rally, according to the station. Kroll, who is standing next to the man in the photo social media users have fingered as Chauvin, said it\u2019s a different officer.", "lang": "en"}
