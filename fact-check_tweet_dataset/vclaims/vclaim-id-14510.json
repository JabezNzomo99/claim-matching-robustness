The confusion arose after media platforms reported on one part of the manifesto which was a separate section on minorities. Several of the schemes highlighted by media outlets as 'Muslim-only', are actually in the manifesto for all communities, or at least for communities from other backward groups as well.\n\nBut, the storm has refused to die down and now the misleading claims have been relayed by none other than BJP President Amit Shah, in an election rally in poll-bound Telangana.\n\nOn 2 December, at a public meeting in Narayanpet in Telangana, Shah accused the Congress of \u2018minority appeasement\u2019 by highlighting five promises made in the Congress\u2019 manifesto. Incidentally, all of these five schemes were also portrayed by media platforms as \u2018Muslim-only\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
