A Democratic congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told us: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence that there was a \u2018White House review\u2019 of corruption in Ukraine. \u2026 State/DoD never identified any concerns in this case. In addition, we have seen no evidence that the White House seriously requested any kind of information on corruption in Ukraine as part of its hold on security assistance.\u201d The White House has not held up assistance funds for other countries as it did with Ukraine\u2019s, the aide said.\n\nEurope has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness. The United States provided $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the top 10 donors in gross overseas development assistance for Ukraine in 2016-2017 are: European Institutions ($425.2 million), United States ($204.4 million), Germany ($189.8 million), Japan ($180.8 million), Global Fund to fight diseases ($44.8 million), Canada ($44.5 million), Poland ($42.5 million), Sweden ($34.6 million), Britain ($31.6 million) and Switzerland ($29.6 million). Trump would be on more solid ground if he had kept his complaint strictly to military aid. \u201cThe United States is the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at the Atlantic Council.\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mulvaney said: \u201cOnce we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014 they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister [President] Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries\u2019 aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don\u2019t get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid. Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
