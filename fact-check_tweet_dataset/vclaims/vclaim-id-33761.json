Instead, out of the blue we received a phone call from John Solomon, a former Washington Post reporter who apparently was the source for Republicans. He said two people from Capitol Hill had alerted him to our inquiry.\n\nSolomon acknowledged that there had been a seizure of assets in 2015 but said that on the basis of his interviews, such as with Shokin, and a review of court files, he believes some new assets were seized in February 2016. \u201cMy understanding is there was a reseizure and a new seizure of assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was back and forth [in the courts], sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of our investigation is to find out the truth of what the son of a former vice president of the United States was doing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company who was paying him $50,000 a month,\u201d said Taylor Reidy, spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any known experience in Ukraine or the oil and gas industry. But the company did appear to be running into legal issues regarding corruption. Our letter was the first step in our investigation, not the last. We expect additional requests for information as we learn more about these interactions and what was happening among the stakeholders.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
