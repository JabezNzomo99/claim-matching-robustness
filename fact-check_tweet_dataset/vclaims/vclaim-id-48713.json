But there is currently only limited evidence to suggest the drugs are effective against the new virus.\n\nOver a series of press conferences and on Twitter, Trump has repeatedly expressed his optimism that two existing malaria drugs \u2014 chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine \u2014 will work in COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCalling himself a \u201cbig fan\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, Trump said in a March 20 press conference that he had \u201cseen things that are impressive,\u201d even as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the evidence supporting the drug was anecdotal \u2014 and that it would take a large, well-done clinical trial to prove its effectiveness.\n\nAs we have written previously, Trump left the misleading impression that the FDA had approved chloroquine to treat COVID-19. In fact, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although existing drugs can be legally prescribed by doctors to treat other ailments for which they weren\u2019t approved in what\u2019s called off-label prescribing.\n\nAfter the release of a small clinical trial in France, Trump also trumpeted combining hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin, which is sold under the brand name Zithromax.\n\n\u201cHYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\u201d Trump wrote in a March 21 tweet. \u201cHopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents)\u2026.. \u2026.be put in use IMMEDIATELY,\u201d he added, referring to the journal in which the French study appeared.\n\nBut as we\u2019ll explain, the trial has significant caveats and limitations \u2014 and far more data is needed to know whether the drugs are safe and effective to treat COVID-19.\n\nIn a press conference the following day, Trump exaggerated the existing evidence for the pharmaceuticals being sent to New York state for COVID-19 clinical trials.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which drug Trump had in mind, but New York state said in a press release that it received shipments of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and chloroquine.\n\nTrump is entitled to his opinion of how the trials will turn out, but he overstates the evidence supporting the drugs, which is slim.\n\nAt least two studies have found that hydroxychloroquine has antiviral effects against the new coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, in cells grown in the lab. Publishing in Clinical Infectious Diseases on March 9, researchers in Beijing found that hydroxychloroquine was better than chloroquine in preventing the virus from replicating in cultured monkey cells.\n\nAnother Chinese group reported on March 18 that hydroxychloroquine blocked entry of the virus into the same kind of cultured cells, and also appeared to prevent the virus from being released from cells. The drug, however, was less effective against the novel coronavirus than chloroquine.\n\nThese are suggestive findings, but as Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us, the experiments by themselves don\u2019t mean all that much.\n\n\u201cHydroxychloroquine has some activity in a test tube against the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know how that corresponds to clinical disease.\u201d\n\nIn the past, for example, chloroquine has been found to inhibit a variety of viruses in cells, including influenza and chikungunya. But when tested in animals or people, those results didn\u2019t hold. In fact, in nonhuman primates, chloroquine treatment made their chikungunya infections worse, not better.\n\nThe authors of the second SARS-CoV-2 report also cautioned that while hydroxychloroquine is usually considered less toxic than chloroquine, overdoses are still possible \u2014 and in their experiment, the drug killed a fair number of cells at the levels needed to produce antiviral effects. That feature, they wrote, \u201crequires careful designing and conducting of clinical trials to achieve efficient and safe control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the so-called evidence for hydroxychloroquine is largely anecdotal \u2014 essentially, people around the world trying it, and claiming it has worked.\n\nTrump, for example, tweeted a link to New York Post story about a 52-year-old Florida man with COVID-19 who said hydroxychloroquine had saved his life. The president later appeared to reference the man in his press briefing, falsely suggesting that the drug had been \u201capproved\u201d to treat COVID-19 \u201cin record-setting time.\u201d\n\nBut as Fauci has explained in press briefings, without a controlled clinical trial, in which a treatment group can be compared with a control group, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the drug actually did anything \u2014 or whether the person improved for other reasons.\n\nChina has reportedly used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in some COVID-19 clinical trials, but most of those studies haven\u2019t been published yet.\n\nOne that has been published \u2014 a small randomized controlled trial of 30 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms \u2014 found \u201cno significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group,\u201d according to a World Health Organization report.\n\nThe authors of the trial concluded that the drug needed to be tested in a larger group of patients.\n\nIt turns out that the French study Trump cited was, in at least one respect, less rigorous than the Chinese clinical trial.\n\nThe study, which was done at a hospital in Marseille, France, calls itself a clinical trial, but it wasn\u2019t a randomized controlled trial, and therefore, not the type of study that can actually determine whether a treatment is effective.\n\nRather than randomly selecting which patients would receive the treatment \u2014 thereby minimizing any differences between groups that could affect the outcome \u2014 the study used those who refused the hydroxychloroquine treatment as the control group. Controls also included patients at other hospitals in southern France.\n\nThe study was very small, ultimately including just 20 patients who received hydroxychloroquine \u2014 six of whom also received azithromycin \u2014 to compare against the 16 patients who did not.\n\nThe study also did not test for clinical outcomes. Instead, researchers measured the amount of virus in patients over time using nasal swab samples, and found that after six days, those treated with hydroxychloroquine had less virus and were more likely to test negative for COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the paper, on the sixth day, only two of the 16 untreated patients tested negative, compared with eight of the 14 hydroxychloroquine-only patients and all six of the dual-treated patients.\n\nWhile the results may sound impressive, they don\u2019t say anything about whether patients\u2019 conditions or symptoms improved, and the lack of randomization means it\u2019s not possible to attribute the differences in the virus amount, or what\u2019s called viral load, to the treatments.\n\nMany scientists identified other odd details and possible technical errors when they commented on the paper on the preprint site medRxiv. The paper, curiously, was posted on the preprint site on March 20, the same day it was published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, and had been accepted just a day after submission \u2014 raising questions about whether there was a peer-review process and how thorough it was.\n\nThe Immunology Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine\u2019s review noted that of the 26 original patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, six were lost to follow up, including three who transferred to the ICU, one who died, and one who decided to stop treatment because of side effects.\n\n\u201cTotal length of clinical follow up was 14 days, but the data beyond day 6 post-inclusion are not shown,\u201d the review reads, adding that the way the authors reported the viral loads was not standardized, making it \u201cimpossible to compare what is defined as a positive value between the patients in the control and treatment arms.\u201d Many of the control patients also didn\u2019t have nasal swabs taken every day.\n\nUpdate, April 7: On April 3, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the French study appeared, issued a statement of concern about the paper, writing that the group \u201cbelieves the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Australian National University geneticist Gaetan Burgio lambasted the study, saying, \u201cIn short, all this hype on the clinical trial is based on a open label, non randomized and underpowered clinical trial on [hydroxychloroquine] treatment against #COVID19 with viral load as an outcome that was not properly measured in 2/3 of the control cohort !!!\u201d\n\nTo at least some scientists, then, the outsized attention this particular study has received is unwarranted. But it\u2019s important to recognize that even if the French study had been done perfectly and had been randomized, it still wouldn\u2019t be particularly strong evidence that the drugs work, since the study is so small.\n\nBaylor\u2019s Hotez said that when small studies are repeated with more patients, the results often don\u2019t pan out. This is a normal part of science, but it\u2019s why scientists like to see larger clinical trials before concluding a drug is safe and effective.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that this is actually going to be a useful therapy is not high, but it\u2019s not zero, either,\u201d Hotez said of the drug combo. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to see how it works in larger clinical studies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine\u2019s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, this includes a 1,600-person prevention study for people exposed to COVID-19 patients in New York and a similar study by the University of Minnesota involving 1,500 people across the U.S.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also coordinating a large multinational trial called SOLIDARITY, which among other potential COVID-19 treatments, will test chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Hotez is not especially optimistic about the drugs Trump has promoted, and said he\u2019d prefer a different experimental therapy for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIf I was a patient or a family member, hydroxychloroquine and azithromax would not be my first choice,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first choice would be the plasma convalescent antibody.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind convalescent plasma \u2014 which is hardly new, having been used in the 1918 influenza pandemic \u2014 is to harvest antibodies from the blood of people who have been infected with the virus and have recovered, and infuse them into sick patients to help them fight off the virus.\n\nWhile the treatment doesn\u2019t work for every disease and carries some risks, Hotez said it did work during the 2003 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a highly similar coronavirus. \u201cAnd so this has a much higher probability of success,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that although the drugs Trump has touted are generally well tolerated, they do have side effects, and it\u2019s not clear if there might be more extreme or other negative effects specifically in COVID-19 patients.\n\nAs a March 24 viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association explains, it\u2019s often assumed the benefits of \u201clast resort\u201d medications will offset the harms, but that\u2019s not always the case.\n\n\u201cA common interpretation of off-label use and compassionate use of drugs is that if the patient died, they died from the disease, but if the patient survived, they survived because of the given drug,\u201d the article reads. \u201cThis is not true.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can trigger abnormal heart rhythms and many of the sickest COVID-19 patients are elderly and may have heart problems, it\u2019s possible the drugs could \u201cincrease the risk of cardiac death.\u201d\n\nStill, given the circumstances, some U.S. hospitals have included these drugs in their COVID-19 guidelines, as they view the potential benefits to outweigh the risks. The U.S. Society of Critical Care Medicine, however, has neither endorsed nor advised against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, due to \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, the promotion of unproven drugs for COVID-19 is having other unintended effects. In Nigeria, two people were hospitalized for chloroquine overdoses, and in Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine. Many patients with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, who rely on hydroxychloroquine to keep their symptoms at bay have also reported shortages of the drugs as orders related to COVID-19 have spiked.\n\nWithout naming any names, in a March 23 editorial H. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the prestigious journal Science, cautioned against excessively hyping therapies that remain speculative.\n\n\u201cPolitical overhyping of such approaches is extremely dangerous \u2014 it risks creating false expectations and depleting drugs needed to treat diseases for which they are approved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it sets science up to overpromise and underdeliver.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
