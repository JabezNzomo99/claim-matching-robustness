So by 6 PM Today someone who shares and also comments will get $5,000 in Cash To Spend in any Kohl\u2019s store \u2013 Best Of Luck Everyone.\u201d\n\nSome users reported seeing a similar offer, but with an even higher reward of $7,500.\n\nAs WAND reported, the verified Kohl\u2019s Facebook account confirmed the offer was not genuine.\n\nAs of this writing, the scam account and posts about the offer in question appeared to have been scrubbed from Facebook.\n\nUnsure about an offer you see online? Here\u2019s what to look for:\n\u2022 Is there a blue check mark next to brand name on the social media profile? If no, it\u2019s not a verified account and unlikely to be affiliated with a major brand.\n\u2022 Cross check the company\u2019s website and social media profiles for similar promotions. Don\u2019t see them there? That\u2019s a good sign the company is not participating in that promotion.\n\u2022 Ask yourself: Why would someone pay a person thousands of dollars for sharing and commenting on a Facebook post something that millions of people do for free every day? It\u2019s possible that the post is connected to \u201clike-farming\u201d or other nefarious efforts to swindle unsuspecting users.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau also offers these tips for protecting yourself from such scams:", "lang": "en"}
