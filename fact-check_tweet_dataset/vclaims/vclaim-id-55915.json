The National Trust have since edited their Facebook post to credit him, and removed the implication that it was made on their property.\n\nAccording to Steve Byrne, Mr Fanner explained that he manipulated the shape of the hive lid in order to encourage the bees to make the shapes.\n\nThe National Trust has now commented under its post: \u201cIt looks like it was shared by one of our property teams, in the belief it'd been created by the bees they care for. We often share photos captured by our teams, but in this case, we've bee-n stung. The photo was captured two years earlier by a photographer not associated with the Trust. We've been unable to verify with our local team where the photo came from as it was shared so long ago, but we've updated the credit for the photo.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
