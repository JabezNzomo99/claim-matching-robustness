No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on January 7, 2019 by America's Last Line of Defense titled \"BREAKING: Bre Payton's Death Ruled Murder - DA Investigating Clinton Connection\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBre Payton was a woman dedicated to the truth. She told people that vaccinating their children will be the downfall of society because that's what she believed, and sometimes that's all that matters. She decided not to get a flu shot because she feared the same fate, and ultimately, the flu killed her -- or so it seemed. In reality, Bre was murdered with a dose of foxglove so devastating that it would have \"killed a small moose or possibly a large mountain lion.\" Doctors missed the heart attack because she was so ill with influenza. Come to find out, the flu was given to her intentionally. Investigators say they believe they've found the source. Detective Art Tubolls of the Lancaster Sheriff's Office told Breitbart: \"Ms. Payton purchased a smoothie at a new shop in the lobby of her building. That smoothie, it seems, was infected with the influenza purposely. Then, when she was fighting the bug, she had another smoothie that delivered the fatal foxglove. In the end, it was her love of smoothies that did her in.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under the category \"Satirical Clinton Murder Sprees\" and none of the links in the article pointed to any serious content.\n\nThe name of the detective in the article (\"Art Tubbols\") is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the site. Also named is \"John Prager\" who was said to have \"an unnatural obsession with Fiona Douriff\". Prager is also a writer who regularily publishes fictional stories on the site and Fiona Douriff has featured in several of them.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
