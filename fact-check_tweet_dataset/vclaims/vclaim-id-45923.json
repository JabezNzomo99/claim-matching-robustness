The original shows de Blasio wearing a \u201cRoma\u201d shirt.\n\nThe black-and-white image being shared shows a young de Blasio looking at the camera while allegedly wearing a shirt imprinted with the face of Guevara. The caption reads, \u201cYoung Bill DeBlasio [sic], current NYC mayor. No comment!!\u201d\n\nThe image of Guevara that purportedly appears printed on de Blasio\u2019s shirt is a stylized reproduction of a well-known photo of the revolutionary. Guevara was a prominent Marxist figure in the Cuban revolution during the late 1950s.

The Daily Caller News Foundation conducted a reverse-image search and discovered the original picture on photographer Todd Maisel\u2019s website. In the original, de Blasio wears a shirt featuring the word \u201cRoma\u201d alongside prints of Rome\u2019s historic buildings.\n\n\u201cBefore becoming the Mayor of the City of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio, the former Bill Wilhelm, was a strong activist for student rights and at this rally at New York University on Washington Square East, he rallied with students for tuition cap at what will become the most expensive private college in the city,\u201d reads the caption, which dates the photo to March 1981.\n\nFreddi Goldstein, the press secretary for de Blasio\u2019s office, confirmed the image \u201cis photoshopped\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
