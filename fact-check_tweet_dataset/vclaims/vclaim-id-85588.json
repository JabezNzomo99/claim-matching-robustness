The simple answer I can give is, there is a fellow back home by the name of Moon Griffon. He is a conservative talk show host who speaks with passion about the Affordable Care Act. Why does he speak with passion? Moon Griffon is very open. He has a special needs child, and he has to buy insurance. His premium per year is over $40,000\u2013$40,000, with a $5,000 deductible and an additional deductible for his pharmaceutical costs. He has to pay $50,000 a year for insurance, deductible, and pharmaceutical deductible\u2026.Now, there are many Moon Griffons across our nation.\u201d\n\nGriffon used to get group insurance through an employer but then he moved and had to buy insurance on the individual market. He said he and his wife, a nurse, have a six-figure income, though \u201cit\u2019s not high but middle class.\u201d They have two children: a 15-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter who has seizures and needs to take four kinds of medicine.\n\nThe medicine started out this year at $2,800 a month, he said, but they were able to switch one, Keppra, to a generic brand, Levetiracetam, which significantly cut the costs this year \u2013 to $1,100 a month. \u201cWe have used generics before but sometimes they don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this seems to work.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 110,000 people in Louisiana \u2014 90 percent of those on the Obamacare exchanges \u2014 receive tax subsidies averaging $433.11 a month that help defray the cost of premiums. Almost 60 percent receive cost-sharing reductions that help bring down the cost of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. Louisiana recently expanded Medicaid, so an additional 427,000 people receive health care through it.\n\nOn his radio show, Griffon warned, \u201cA lot of people upset about the comment he made [about the Kimmel test]\u2026. The only thing I would tell Senator Bill Cassidy is he needs to be very, very careful about the way he votes. He\u2019s got to be very careful some real conservative doesn\u2019t come along because people are not liking his voting record.\u201d Griffon also was wary about the fact that Cassidy was working at the time with moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on a potential bill.\n\nThe Cassidy-Graham bill is certainly more conservative than the Collins-Cassidy plan. But it might have not worked out well for Griffon and his family, even though it essentially left it up to the states to create health-insurance markets. His daughter has a preexisting condition, and Louisiana could have decided to increase rates for people with certain condition. The state waivers envisioned in the plan also might have impacted prescription drug coverage and caps on out-of-pocket expenses, both of which could have been dropped or changed by a state.\n\nGriffon said he wanted to be able to buy health insurance across state lines like car insurance. But as we have noted before, car and life insurance currently is sold exactly the same way as health insurance \u2014 regulated by state insurance regulators, with policies tailored to the rules and laws set by the state. He also said he wanted to be able to buy insurance as part of \u201cpool,\u201d but that\u2019s a central concept of Obamacare. The law already creates a single-risk pool for the individual market, but premiums have risen in part because fewer younger people than expected have purchased health insurance.\n\nRegular readers know that we often warn about making policy by anecdote. Griffon\u2019s insurance costs are through the roof and we understand his frustration. Cassidy portrayed Griffon as a \u201cstriver\u201d who was being wronged by Obamacare, but in doing so the senator ignores the tens of thousands of state residents who receive subsidies and other help to pay for health insurance \u2014 help that has significantly increased the percentage of people with health insurance in the state.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s unclear whether Griffon would find himself much better off under a repeal plan, especially because he has a child with a pre-existing condition who could find herself priced entirely out of the market. In fact, he might have found himself worse off, with even higher premiums, depending on how the market was restructured.", "lang": "en"}
