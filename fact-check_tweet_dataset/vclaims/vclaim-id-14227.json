Bob Hall from Edgewood expressed concern about the sustainability of the system based on changing demographics in the state.\n\n\"This world has changed significantly, but our overall retirement program hasn\u2019t changed much,\" he said, addressing the bill\u2019s author. \"If we were doing this today, we would probably take an entirely different approach.\n\n\"We\u2019re in a situation where we now have several hundred teachers that are over 100 years old and what I've read recently is that a baby born today, their age expectancy is 110, at least. Thanks to medical science.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that there are hundreds of retired teachers in Texas who are older than 100, but Hall\u2019s claim about life expectancy is off base.\n\nKathi Seay, a policy adviser for Hall, said that his claim about teachers over 100 years old was about retired teachers who are members of the state\u2019s retirement system \u2014 not current teachers in the classroom.\n\nCarolyn Perez, spokeswoman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said that as of February the system had 420,458 retired members.\n\nOf that group, 321 were over 100 years old.\n\nThat number is consistent with the count from earlier years offered by Perez. In fiscal year 2016, there were 393 retired teachers older than 100. In 2014 there were 285 and in 2012 there were 254.\n\nHall\u2019s staff did not provide a source for the second part of his claim, which stated that life expectancy for babies born this year is at least 110 years old.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates life expectancy estimates using information from death certificates in a given year.\n\nThe most recent report on mortality, submitted to the agency by the National Center for Health Statistics, was published in 2017, when the life expectancy at birth was 78.6 years.\n\nThat marked a slight decline from 2016, \"largely because of increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, suicide, diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia, with unintentional injuries making the largest contribution,\" the report says.\n\nHas the pension system (and population) changed?\n\nThe Teacher Retirement System of Texas was established in 1937 and initially offered retirement benefits just to teachers and public school administrators, according to a strategic plan published by the system.\n\nIt was slowly expanded and now offers retirement and health care benefits to all employees at \"public schools, educational service centers, charter schools, community and junior colleges, universities, and medical schools.\"\n\nLawmakers have also made tweaks to how the system manages investments and eligibility requirements for benefits.\n\nData from the Social Security Administration shows that the retirement age has gone up since 1937, when the state\u2019s system was established.\n\nThe full retirement age for people born before 1937 is 65. From there forward, the retirement age slowly increases. The retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67.\n\nDuring that time, the life expectancy increased. For men born in 1930, it was an average of 58 and for women it was 62, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThis estimate was on the low-end, \"due mainly to high infant mortality.\"\n\nHall said \"We now have several hundred teachers that are over 100 years old and what I've read recently is that a baby born today, their age expectancy is 110, at least.\"\n\nThe Teacher Retirement System of Texas said that as of February, they had 321 retired members who were older than 100, so Hall is right about that number.\n\nAnd he\u2019s right that life expectancy has increased since the system was established, but his characterization is exaggerated.\n\nThe most recent study on mortality in the United States reports that the life expectancy for babies born in 2017 is 78.6 years, not 110.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "lang": "en"}
