While netizens are demanding that Palestine be put \u2018back\u2019 on the maps, we found it never existed on Google or Apple maps in the first place.\n\nThe claim is quite viral on Twitter. The archived versions can be seen here and here.\n\nPalestine is recognised by the United Nations and 138 of its members as an independent state, but not by the United States where Google and Apple are headquartered.\n\nWe tried searching for Palestine on Google and Apple maps.\n\nTyping Palestine on Google Maps will show you an approximate location with an outline of Gaza and West Bank territories. Nowhere can the name \u2018Palestine\u2019 be found.\n\nThe search result on Apple Maps is almost the same. We couldn\u2019t find \u2018Palestine\u2019 marked on the service.\n\nThrough an Internet search, we found this is not the first time Google has been accused of removing Palestine from its map service.\n\nIn 2016 too, Google was accused of \u2018removing\u2019 Palestine from its map service. We found a statement released by the Forum of Palestinian Journalists \u2018condemning\u2019 Google for not marking Palestine on its map service.\n\nA 2016 article by \u201cThe Guardian\u201d says Palestine was never on Google or Apple maps. The article said, \u201cGoogle has been accused of deleting Palestine from Google Maps but the truth is, it was never labeled by Google in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe article also quotes a Google spokesperson who said, \u201cThere has never been a \u2018Palestine\u2019 label on Google Maps.\u201d\n\nAnother 2016 article by \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d confirmed that Apple Maps too neither marks Palestinian territory nor differentiates it from Israel.\n\nWe also checked the official websites of Google Maps and Apple Maps for any clarification on the matter.\n\nGoogle, in a section in its online help centre for \u2018disputed boundaries\u2019, states: \u201cDisputed boundaries are displayed as a dashed grey line. The places involved don\u2019t agree on a boundary.\u201d\n\nThus, the claim that Palestine was recently removed from the map services of Google and Apple is false. The tech giants never marked the region on their maps.", "lang": "en"}
