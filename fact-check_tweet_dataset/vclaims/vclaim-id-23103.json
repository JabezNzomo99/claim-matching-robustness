Below we\u2019ve taken a look at each of the Facebook post\u2019s claims in turn.\n\nIn 1955 the toothpaste manufacturer Crest launched its \u2018Crest with Fluoristan\u2019 toothpaste in several test markets in the United States and had expanded nationally by the following year. This was not the first time fluoride had ever been added to toothpaste, but it was at this time that \u201cfluoride became the standard and ADA-accepted toothpaste additive for the prevention of tooth decay,\u201d according to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nIn the UK today the main fluoride chemicals found in toothpaste are sodium fluoride, sodium mono-fluorophosphate and stannous fluoride. The maximum amount of fluoride allowed in toothpaste before it is classed as medicine under UK and EU law is equal to 1,500 parts per million, or about 0.15% fluoride.\n\nThe pineal gland is located in the brain and is part of the endocrine system (which produces hormones in your body). This particular gland produces the hormone melatonin which controls the body\u2019s sleep/wake cycle.\n\nCalcium can sometimes be deposited in the pineal gland over the course of a person\u2019s lifetime and fluoride can bind to calcium. Studies that have looked at the impact of fluoride on the pineal gland have been inconclusive.\n\nFluoride is toxic at high concentrations, but in the amounts added to water it is not. The Drinking Water Inspectorate, which monitors drinking water in England and Wales, checks that supplies don\u2019t contain more than 1.5 mg of fluoride per litre of water.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the USA told us that fluoride is not defined as hazardous waste, but fluorine\u2014the element it comes from\u2014and some other compounds \u201cmay be considered hazardous waste\u201d.\n\nThere is no evidence that Hitler or the Nazi Party ever used fluoride in the water in concentration camps, according to US factchecking organisation Politifact.\n\nThe active ingredient in Prozac, which is used primarily to treat depression along with a number of other mental health conditions, is fluoxetine hydrochloride. This is not the same as fluoride\u2014its chemical structure is made up of a variety of elements and fluoride is just part of this.\n\nSodium fluoride has been commonly used as a rat poison in the past. Again, the fluoride in that is present in much stronger concentrations than the fluoride found in tap water for example. According to academics at McGill University in California, a rat \u201cwould have to drink roughly a hundred liters of fluoridated tap water before suffering the same fate if the water had the usual fluoride concentration of 1 part per million.\u201d\n\nDr Bill Osmunson is an American dentist and senior advisor of the anti-fluoride campaign group Fluoride Action Network.\n\nIn an interview Dr Osmunson did say that a pea-sized amount of toothpaste works out at around one quarter milligrams of fluoride\u2014as much as is contained in a glass of Chicago tap water.\n\nA \u2018pea-sized amount\u2019 is thought to be around 0.25g of toothpaste, although there isn\u2019t much guidance available on this. The usual strength of fluoride in a normal tube of toothpaste is between 1,000 and 1,500 parts per million, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the \u201cleading journal and database for systematic reviews in health care\u201d). If someone was using regular over-the-counter toothpaste available for adults in the UK this would mean they\u2019d consume between roughly one quarter and one third of a milligram (mg) of fluoride every time they brushed their teeth.\n\nIn the UK drinking water that is deliberately fluoridated (rather than water where fluoride occurs naturally) must not exceed 1.5mg per litre. That\u2019s 1.5 parts per million. So in the UK you would need to brush your teeth four to six times a day (with a pea-sized amount, and swallow all that toothpaste) to consume the same amount of fluoride as in a litre of tap water (if it was fluoridated to the maximum amount.)\n\nThere is no recommended maximum amount of fluoride that should be consumed by adults per day in the UK. In the USA this upper maximum is 10mg. Using this as a guide the NHS Special Pharmacy Service says that a 70kg adult could safely consume anywhere between 1.7g and 10g of toothpaste a day\u2014depending on the strength of fluoride in it and the levels of fluoride in the water they are also consuming.\n\nIn the USA the Federal Drug Administration rules say that all fluoride toothpastes, gels and powders have to have a warning on the packaging stating: \u201cKeep out of reach of children under 6 years of age. If more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.\u201d\n\nThe NHS says: \u201cThere have been some concerns that fluoride may be linked to a variety of health conditions. Reviews of the risks have so far found no convincing evidence to support these concerns.\u201d\n\nPublic health England also says that: \u201cAt the levels allowed by UK legislation, the only potential negative impact is a greater risk of dental fluorosis, which is a mottling on the teeth usually in the form of white lines or patches.\u201d It adds that dental fluorosis can happen in areas where the water isn\u2019t fluoridated too.", "lang": "en"}
