He is among a chorus of lawmakers \u2014 Democrat and Republican \u2014 who want to repeal the tax, and among many who are using the job-loss claim as one of the reasons to get rid of it. Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have spoken against the tax since 2009, saying jobs would be threatened. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) is a long-time critic of the tax and will push for a permanent repeal through the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThe claim of massive job losses is one of the main arguments for the repeal. The tax is imposed on a variety of medical devices, including MRI machines and pacemakers, but does not include consumer retail items such as contact lenses or eyeglasses. The tax, which took effect January 2013, is projected to generate $29 billion over 10 years in net revenues. The effective tax rate is about 1.5 percent, because businesses can deduct it from their federal taxes.\n\nAdvaMed says the survey was sent to every member of the organization, and its 2013 annual report says it has nearly 300 members. So that\u2019s a pretty poor response rate. For all we know, the other 250+ companies added jobs and saw no reason to respond to the survey. The survey certainly does not tell you much about the impact of the medical device tax on the entire industry, let alone AdvaMed\u2019s membership.\n\nLawmakers also cite anecdotes of local manufacturers blaming the tax for creating harm to their companies. Shawn Millan, communications director for Dent, e-mailed to The Fact Checker: \u201cEverything that Congressman Dent has heard from his local manufacturers indicates the tax is damaging to their ability to maintain or potentially expand their workforces, their facilities and their research and product development efforts. The fact that the tax is harmful to manufacturers across the country is why its repeal enjoys broad bipartisan and geographical support.\u201d\n\nNot all small companies or start-ups are yet feeling the pressure to cut jobs. A spokesperson for Innovative Trauma Care, a San Antonio start-up that makes emergency clamps that control bleeding before the surgery, said the company is so new that the impact of the tax has been minimal. Frank Fischer, chief executive of NeuroPace, a privately held California company of 120 employees, said the tax hasn\u2019t had any impact on his employee base because the company is just beginning to commercialize devices to treat neurological disorders. But Fischer said he anticipates forgone hires as the company grows.\n\nMedtronic said in a statement: \u201cThe device tax is one of the many business pressures we must account for in our planning. The reality is that the medical device tax takes funding away from other areas where we could invest. Medtronic has always stated that we believe that the medical device tax is a regressive tax, and we believe it discourages innovation.\u201d\n\nNexon, the AdvaMed executive, acknowledged there are many factors that contribute to companies\u2019 staffing decisions. But he said the companies\u2019 answers to AdvaMed\u2019s survey were telling that staffing cuts were attributable in some part to the tax, because it is an additional payment they have to take into account. Head count is an \u201cobvious place\u201d that companies are going to look to cut, Nexon said.\n\nThe public is not privy to the companies\u2019 individual business decisions, so it is difficult to prove or disprove the exact impact of the tax on their personnel matters. Based on self-reported announcements and survey answers by small and large companies, there were indeed some jobs that were cut at least partly due to the tax or the anticipation of its impact. The tax is not helping the industry, but neither is it single-handedly destroying thousands of jobs. Indeed, one survey of senior managers found that the impact was less than expected.", "lang": "en"}
