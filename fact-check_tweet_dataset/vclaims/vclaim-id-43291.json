Both the images seem to be a still from TV channels.\n\nThe viral image with the logo of Aaj Tak shows Shah surrounded by men dressed in white and in military uniform. In the bottom of the image, we see the caption \u2013 \u201cBreaking News \u0917\u0943\u0939\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u092e\u093f\u0924 \u0936\u093e\u0939 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u092a\u0947\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 (Translation Home Minister Amit Shah in the grip of coronavirus). Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nThe second viral image has a logo of Sach News. This image shows a screen with the text in Hindi which states Amit Shah tested positive with coronavirus, admitted in hospital (translated from \u0905\u092e\u093f\u0924 \u0936\u093e\u0939 \u0906\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093f \u091a\u092a\u0947\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940). Just like the first viral image, we received several requests to fact-check this image as well.\n\nThis image has been made using Break Your Own News, a meme generator. Once the meme is made, the image has a watermark which says \u2018breakyourownnews.com\u2019. The screenshot below highlights that in green.\n\nIn the viral image, it is noticeable that the area next to the Aaj Tak logo is blurred. This confirms that the meme has been maliciously morphed by adding the Aaj Tak logo and blurring the watermark which was not hidden by the logo.\n\nThe person on Shah\u2019s right is BJP member Ashish Shelar. Using this as a clue, Alt News performed a keyword search on Google and found an Indian Express report from 2014. According to the report, Amit Shah visited NCP chief Sharad Pawar at Breach Candy Hospital after Pawar underwent a thigh surgery.\n\nAlt News looked up for Sach news channel on the list of paid and free TV channels grouped by the Telecom Regulatory Authority. We could not find a channel by this name. Moreover, the background screen has ABP News written on it.\n\nHere\u2019s a still from March 28 bulletin published on YouTube.\n\nThere is an online news outlet by the name Sach News . However, its logo doesn\u2019t match with the one used in the viral image.\n\nTherefore, social media claim that Home Minister Amit Shah has contracted coronavirus is false.", "lang": "en"}
