The Department of Health (DOH) set the suggested retail price for non-medical grade face shields at P26 to P50.\n\nOn August 7, SM Supermalls addressed the claim on Facebook saying that this information did not officially come from either the SM Supermalls or SM Hypermarket. \"Face shields are available for sale in all SM Malls nationwide at various retail prices,\" the statement read.\n\nThe DOH Department Memorandum No. 2020-0345, dated August 10, set the SRP of non-medical grade face shields at P26 to P50. The memorandum also stated that \"a 10% allowable variation to the SRP may be added to account for the distribution cost for the Visayas and Mindanao areas.\"\n\nIn the past, Rappler had debunked other claims about medical devices, such as a supposed \"official\" coronavirus face mask and a false claim that prolonged face mask use causes hypoxia and/or hypercapnia. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
