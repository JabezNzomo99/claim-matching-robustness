One woman remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s a meme, people on FB should realize by now not to believe everything you see.\u201d\n\nBut throughout the thousands of comments left on the photo were many betraying users\u2019 apparent belief in the quote.\n\n\u201cIgnorance at it\u2019s worst. This poor child must not be able to read, or think. Where do these crazy ideas come from??\u201d one woman commented. Another replied, \u201cLiberal schools!\u201d\n\nLawrence has been a critic of Trump: In a 2017 interview with Oprah Winfrey, she suggested that she would throw a martini in his face if she ever met him.\n\nShe also has expressed her dismay with his election in other interviews, too.\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump got elected, my head exploded,\u201d Lawrence said (at the 5:30-minute mark) during an event in New York City earlier this year. \u201cI felt helpless, I felt scared, I felt devastated. And I found that the only thing that I could actually do is educate myself.\u201d\n\nNaming issues such as the environment, public education, health care and immigration, she added: \u201cEverything that I care about is all affected by corruption and it doesn\u2019t actually matter who we have in office, these problems are going to exist either way \u2014 that is what we have to fix. We have to have a fair democracy where these corporations and billionaires are not able to buy votes from the people that we the American people elect into office.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
