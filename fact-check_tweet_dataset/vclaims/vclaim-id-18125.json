Instead, Apple announced, the iPhone 7 would come with a set of Apple earbuds designed to plug into the phone\u2019s Lightning connector port.\n\nShortly afterwards, some online pranksters played on that change, circulating a fool\u2019s errand image suggesting that the headphone jack was still present on the new phones but \u201chidden behind the casing\u201d and could be accessed by drilling a small hole in the device\u2019s shell:\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to point out (but we will) that no amount of drilling will turn up the iPhone 7\u2019s \u201chidden\u201d headphone jack, as such a jack is no longer a feature included with that device. It\u2019s possible the image was created simply as a joke mocking the company\u2019s decision to drop the headphone jack, a decision that Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller maintained was made to make room for other, newer features:", "lang": "en"}
