No, that's not true: The Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate was arrested in 1963 for taking part in an anti-segregation protest -- in support of black protesters. It is documented in a black-and-white photograph found in the archives of the Chicago Tribune in 2016.\n\nThe story originated from a meme using the old image, including a post (archived here) published on July 14, 2019 under the title \"The ultimate hypocrite\".

He was arrested, charged with resisting arrest, found guilty and fined $25. He was a University of Chicago student at the time.\"\n\nSanders' had been accused of overstating his college days involvement in the civil rights struggle by some Hillary Clinton supporters, so the discovery of the photograph helped bolster his biography.", "lang": "en"}
