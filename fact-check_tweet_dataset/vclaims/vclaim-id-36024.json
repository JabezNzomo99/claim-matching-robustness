His key work in the areas of wireless telegraphy, broadcast radio, and synchronized-sound films led to his being referred to as the \u201cFather of Radio\u201d and the \u201cFather of Electronics.\u201d\n\nBut de Forest is also known, in a lesser sense, for famously demonstrating that persons notable for achievements in one field of science aren\u2019t necessarily reliable prognosticators about other scientific fields. For it was de Forest who boldly proclaimed in the 1950s that humanity\u2019s sending a man to the moon and returning him to Earth alive was merely a Jules Verne-esque fantasy, a \u201cvoyage [that] will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances.\u201d\n\nHe made his remarks during an interview with Voice of America radio, as reported by the Associated Press in February 1957:\n\nOne of America\u2019s most famous scientists dismissed as impossible one of modern science\u2019s most persistent dreams \u2014 the dream of travel into the outer space. Dr. Lee De Forest, known as the \u201cFather of Electronics,\u201d predicted that man would never even reach the moon, let alone travel by rocket ship to strange worlds in distant galaxies. \u201cMan,\u201d declared Dr. De Forest, \u201cis inherently an earthly creature, and only his scientific imagination will ever make him a planetary emigrant.\u201d De Forest invented the vacuum tube 51 years ago, and that made possible the development of modern radio broadcasting, television and radar. His observations on the future were broadcast by the Voice of America, the State Dept.\u2019s overseas information program. De Forest forecast transoceanic television within 10 years. He said this could be accomplished by skillful location of relay stations and by taking advantage of reflections of television waves from the ionosphere, the layer of electrical energy which surrounds the earth at a great height. \u201cBut I am much more conservative in my estimate of interspace flight,\u201d De Forest said. True, this year may become known as the year of the first man-made planet \u2014 the tiny artificial earth satellite, he said. \u201cBut to place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon, where the passenger can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth \u2014 all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI am bold enough to say that such a man-made moon voyage will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances.\u201d\n\nThat was not the first of de Forest\u2019s pronouncements along such lines. In an article for Popular Mechanics published five years earlier, the scientist had asserted: \u201cI do not foresee \u2018spaceships\u2019 to the moon or Mars. Mortals must live and die on Earth or within its atmosphere!\u201d\n\nHowever, de Forest was at least correct in anticipating the first \u201cartificial earth satellite\u201d would be launched in 1957, as the Soviet Union put Sputnik I into low Earth orbit on Oct. 4, 1957. The Soviets also accomplished the first manned space flight less than four years later, launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1 for a single Earth orbit on April 12, 1961.\n\nBut it only took the United States to prove de Forest wrong with the July 1969 mission of Apollo 11 that landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon and then returned them safely to Earth.", "lang": "en"}
