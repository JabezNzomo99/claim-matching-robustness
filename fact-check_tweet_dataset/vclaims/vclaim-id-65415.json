Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show.\"\n\nImage taken from the New York Times website.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep this short and sweet.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s claim is not accurate. It rates False.", "lang": "en"}
