It put in place a monitoring mechanism on the size, number and capabilities of military hardware.\n\n \n\n Putin announced in 2007 his intent to \u201csuspend implementation\u201d of the CFE Treaty and, within a month, the Russian parliament approved his request. The treaty, however, has no provision for \u201csuspension,\u201d offering only a mechanism for withdrawal.\n\n \n\n Russia also violated one of the CFE Treaty\u2019s guiding principles, which calls on members to refrain \u201cfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\u201d \n\n \n\n Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and used military force to set up annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in 2014. Respect for nations\u2019 territorial integrity and political independence is also one of the main principles of the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997, also signed by Russia.\n\n \n\n U.S. administrations and Congressional leaders have frequently criticized what they say are Russian violations of treaties.\n\n \n\n The U.S. State Department raised concerns about Russia\u2019s violations of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.\n\n \n\n The U.S. says Russia for multiple years has violated the principle that the parties should \u201cnot to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.\u201d The U.S. Department of Defense has a similar claim. \n\n \n\n In testimony before the U.S. Congress, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Brian McKeon said that \u201cthe evidence is conclusive. Russia has tested this ground-based system well into the ranges covered by the INF Treaty. We are talking about a real system and not a potential capability.\u201d\n\n \n\n McKeon said that the U.S. is also concerned about \u201cRussian adherence to several other arms control treaties.\u201d\n\n \n\n One of them is the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows for observational overflights of 34 nations which signed the agreement.\n\n \n\n Russia, however, has denied several requests for overflights under the treaty, including \u201cover Chechnya and nearby areas of southwestern Russia; [\u2026] and along the border of Russia with the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia,\u201d according to the U.S. State Department.\n\n \n\n Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told Polygraph.info that \u201calthough Russia has not formally \u2018withdrawn\u2019 from existing treaties and agreements, it has repeatedly violated them or \u2013 in the case of CFE \u2013 \u2018suspended implementation,\u2019 which is really a euphemism for intentionally violating the treaty.\u201d\n\n \n\n But in his speech to the generals on November 18, Putin said it is the U.S. which does not adhere to its agreements.\n\n \n\n \u201cBut some other nations, as we all know, cancel previous agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cAs was the case with anti-ballistic missile defense.\u201d\n\n \n\n Putin was referring to the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n\nBut that move was legal and in accordance with the terms of the treaty, Volker said.\n\nPresident George W. Bush sent the withdrawal notice to Russia in December 2001, three months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which President Bush defined as an \u201cextraordinary event.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have concluded the ABM treaty hinders our government's ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks,\u201d Bush said.\n\nVolker told Polygraph.info: \u201cThe U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was conducted completely in compliance with the rules of the treaty itself. The U.S. gave proper six month\u2019s notice, and gave a justification for why things had changed and why this step was necessary. And even beyond that, the United States reached out to Russia to create a new nuclear arms agreement -- the Moscow Treaty -- and sought to expand NATO cooperation with Russia through an enhanced NATO-Russia Council.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
