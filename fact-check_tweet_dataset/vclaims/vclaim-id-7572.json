Why? 1/4 Oxford colleges did not admit a single black student in a whole year group at least once between 2015-17. 8 colleges less than 1% black. Why?\u201d \u201cBME students make up 17.9% of all British Oxford undergraduates. That's pretty close to the percentage of BME people among 17-24-year-olds in England and Wales \u2013 18.3%.\u201d\n\nBoth David Lammy and Toby Young are both broadly correct in their claims, yet they are making contrasting points about how accessible the University of Oxford is for black and minority ethnic students.\n\nThe exact figures vary depending on which year you look at, whether you\u2019re talking about the overall student population or applicants\u2019 relative chances of being accepted, and also which groups in particular you are talking about.\n\n2017 was the first year (in recent times at least) when Oxford\u2019s UK undergraduate intake had a similar level of black and minority ethnic students to the general population of England and Wales aged 17-24, but black students are still underrepresented.\n\nBlack students who apply to Oxford are less likely to be accepted than white students, and in some colleges make up less than 1% of all students from the UK.\n\nAll figures in this article refer to applicants for undergraduate courses living in the UK.\n\n16% of black students living in the UK who applied to the University of Oxford in 2017 were offered a place, compared to 26% of white students. Over the last three years, the average is 17% for black students and 27% for white students.\n\nNot all of these students will necessarily take up their place though. 12% of black students living in the UK who applied to Oxford were admitted for the year 2017/18. 23% of UK-domiciled white applicants were. Over the last three years, the average is 12% for black students and 24% for white students.\n\nAround 6% of applicants to Oxford living in the UK didn\u2019t declare their ethnicity from 2013 to 2017, so some students will not be included in the figures.\n\nBlack students are less likely to get an offer for medicine or law\n\nThe University of Oxford says that that \u201cstudents from BME backgrounds are more likely to apply for the most competitive courses than White students\u201d. 41% of black students from the UK who applied to Oxford between 2015 and 2017 applied for medicine or law, which Oxford describes as \u201chighly competitive\u201d. In comparison around 12% of white students applied for these courses.\n\nFor these courses, white students are significantly more likely to be made an offer or admitted than black students. 11% of black law applicants from 2015to 2017 received an offer, and 6% were admitted. 23% of white applicants received an offer, and 20% were admitted. For medicine, 9% of black students received an offer and 8% were admitted, compared to 22% and 20% respectively for white students.\n\nA quarter of Oxford colleges didn\u2019t admit a single black student in at least one year between 2015 and 2017\n\nEight of the 29 colleges at Oxford admitted two or fewer black students between 2015 and 2017 (less than 1% of all UK students admitted to the college). This means that in at least one year those colleges can\u2019t have admitted any black students. We don\u2019t know what happened in each of the individual years between 2015 and 2017, so it\u2019s possible there were more colleges who didn\u2019t admit any black students in any given year.\n\nNo college admitted more than seven black students across those three years\u2014again that\u2019s looking at students living in the UK.\n\nAcross the university black students made up 1.9% of all UK students admitted in 2017.\n\nComparing with the rest of the country\n\nBlack and minority ethnic students made up around 18% of Oxford\u2019s 2017 UK intake. That\u2019s roughly the same as the proportion of 17-24 year-olds in England and Wales who are black and minority ethnic, based on figures from the 2011 census.\n\nIn 2016, 26% of UK students starting an undergraduate degree at all UK universities were black or minority ethnic, compared to 16% at Oxford.\n\nApplicants to Oxford normally need to get at least three As to be offered a place. Looking at UK students who got three As (or equivalent) at A-level, 20% of students were black or minority ethnic in 2015, compared to 14% of Oxford\u2019s UK intake that year.\n\nAmong black and minority ethnic students, certain groups are more represented than others. 1.9% of Oxford\u2019s UK undergraduates starting in 2017 were black, and 1.7% were Bangladeshi or Pakistani. 6.5% were Asian (not including those who identified as Bangladeshi or Pakistani which Oxford provides separate figures for), and 6.6% had mixed heritage.\n\nAmong the population of England and Wales now aged 17 to 24, around 4% identify as Bangladeshi/Pakistani, 4.5% identify as Asian, 4% identify as Black. This is based on approximations using the 2011 census.", "lang": "en"}
