FleishmanHillard is one of the most respected PR firms in the country, with big-name clients like Chevrolet, EA Sports, Olay and Procter & Gamble.\n\nThe Mission Continues paid FleishmanHillard $619,599 for its services in 2014 and 2015, according to public filings required by the charity.\n\nGreitens\u2019 charity launched its new image to the public \"at a food bank event that brought veterans together with President (Barack) Obama, as they served meals to dozens of underprivileged families,\" according to the PR Week article.\n\nThe crown jewel of the nonprofit\u2019s new image was a new logo. It features a shield-shaped patch with a two-sided bird: an eagle to represent patriotism, and a dove to illustrate a commitment to service, as explained by a video on the group\u2019s website. The logo won a Silver Anvil Award of Excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, a top trade organization for the industry.\n\nThe campaign also introduced a new website and introduced the branding into designs for community service projects.\n\nClearly, FleishmanHillard\u2019s campaign was designed to rebrand The Mission Continues as a charity, not Greitens himself. This rebranding was covered by several major news outlets, including ABCNews.com and Bloomberg News. Charities have to market themselves so the people they want to help know about their services, said Daniel Borochoff, president and founder of Charity Watch. \"It\u2019s a legitimate expense,\" Borochoff said. \"They can\u2019t do it in the dark.\" A representative from the Greitens campaign said the ad was a blatant misrepresentation of the reality of the expense. In a TV ad, Koster said Greitens\u2019 charity The Mission Continues spent $600,000 on image consultants. This amount was well-supported by non-profit Form 990s, which listed $619,599 in payment to PR firm FleishmanHillard. The ad was misleading, however, when it suggested that the image consultants were used to craft Greiten\u2019s personal image, instead of The Mission Continues. Furthermore, it implied that a charity spending money on branding is wasteful. An expert who monitors charities said it was a legitimate expense.", "lang": "en"}
