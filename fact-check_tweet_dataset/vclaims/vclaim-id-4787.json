The principal budget categories include the civil budget, the military budget and the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP).\n\n\u201cDirect contributions are made to finance requirements of the Alliance that serve the interests of all 29 members \u2014 and are not the responsibility of any single member \u2014 such as NATO-wide air defence or command and control systems,\u201d NATO says. \u201cCosts are borne collectively, often using the principle of common funding.\u201d\n\nNATO says its military budget for 2018 is \u20ac1.325 billion (or about $1.55 billion). Its civil budget is \u20ac245.8 million (or about $289 million). And the ceiling for the NSIP is \u20ac700 million (or about $822 million). That means the U.S. share for all three combined would be around $590 million, at most.\n\nDirect spending may also include other \u201cjoint funding\u201d projects that are arranged by participating NATO countries, but that are still overseen politically and financially by NATO. Those programs \u201cvary in the number of participating countries, cost-share arrangements and management structures,\u201d NATO says.\n\nTrump, however, is referring to so-called indirect spending, which is the amount that the U.S. and other NATO countries willingly spend on their own defense budgets.\n\nThe 90 percent figure cited by Trump is still too high, according to NATO estimates.\n\nIn a June 27 update on spending, NATO said: \u201cToday, the volume of the US defence expenditure effectively represents some 67 per cent of the defence spending of the Alliance as a whole.\u201d That disparity \u201chas been a constant,\u201d NATO says, and has only grown since the U.S. began increasing its defense spending after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nAll together, the 29 alliance members spent an estimated $917 billion on defense in 2017, and the U.S. portion was about $618 billion.\n\nEither way, that still isn\u2019t how much the U.S. \u201cis paying for NATO,\u201d as Trump has repeatedly described it.\n\nAs NATO said in its June update: \u201cThis does not mean that the United States covers 67 per cent of the costs involved in the operational running of NATO as an organisation, including its headquarters in Brussels and its subordinate military commands, but it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities, including for instance, in regard to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; air-to-air refuelling; ballistic missile defence; and airborne electronic warfare.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Trump is right that many countries in the international security alliance come \u201cnowhere close to their 2% commitment.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, NATO members agreed to try to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense spending. In 2014, they agreed again to aim to meet that standard by 2024.\n\nBut in March, NATO said that only four nations met that guideline in 2017: the U.S. (3.57 percent), Greece (2.36 percent), Britain (2.12 percent) and Estonia (2.08 percent). Poland, at an estimated 1.99 percent of GDP, was just shy of the goal.\n\nTrump is pushing for other countries to spend more on their own defense, while taking credit for some increases that have already occurred.\n\n\u201cWhile these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThere was an estimated 4.87 percent increase in total defense spending by Canada and European allies in 2017, marking the third straight year that defense spending by those countries increased, according to NATO. That was after several years of declines in spending by those countries.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Politico EU\u2019s Confidential podcast this month that he expects eight nations will cross the 2 percent threshold in 2018, which he said was up from three countries in 2014.", "lang": "en"}
