And, please, follow theorfor guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nIn spring 2020, as U.S. high schools nationwide remained closed to curb the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, Facebook users began a new posting trend: sharing senior photos \u2014 no matter how recent they are \u2014 to show support for the year\u2019s graduating seniors who are finishing high school at home.\n\nWith the #ClassOf2020 hashtag, the posts quickly became a popular way for people to not only show how they\u2019ve aged but also commiserate with high-schoolers who were missing popular commencement festivities, such as senior prom, graduation parties, and athletic competitions. \u201cThese kids are resilient and tough. They\u2019re the September 11 babies, and now they\u2019re the COVID-19 graduates,\u201d one Facebook user posted. \u201cThey\u2019re nervous that they may not be able to walk the stage and get the diploma they have been working hard on for 13 years.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some users came across reports that the consumer-protection organization the Better Business Bureau (BBB) was advising against the practice, and those users asked Snopes to verify the claim.\n\nThe BBB, an internationally recognized nonprofit that investigates scams and complaints against businesses, has indeed warned people to \u201cthink twice\u201d before posting their senior high school photos.\n\nOn April 13, 2020, the Virginia-based group posted an advisory on its website, urging Facebook users to \u201cresist the temptation to play along\u201d in the portrait-posting movement. The advisory reads:\n\nWatch out, scammers or hackers who surf through social media sites will see these #ClassOf2020 posts, and will now have the name of your high school and graduation year, which are common online security questions. All it takes is an internet search to reveal more information about you, such as family members, your real name, birthdate or even where you live. Better Business Bureau (BBB) cautions everyone to be aware of what they are sharing. Even if you think it\u2019s just going to your friends, it could also be going somewhere else.\n\nOther types of popular posts \u2014 listing cars you\u2019ve owned, favorite athletes, preferred TV shows \u2014 could make Facebook users vulnerable to hackers and scammers, too, according to the BBB. \u201cWhat most people forget is that some of these \u2018favorite things\u2019 are commonly used passwords or security questions,\u201d the advisory read. \u201cIf your social media privacy settings aren\u2019t high, you could be giving valuable information away for anyone to use.\u201d\n\nAfter the warning was published, news media outlets including CNN and CBSNews published stories with the headlines, \u201cHere\u2019s why you probably shouldn\u2019t share your old senior photos on Facebook\u201d and \u201cHave you shared your old senior photo on Facebook? Hackers may be using your post against you,\u201d respectively. In the CNN story, Dan Patterson, a producer for CNET, said information in such posts is traded by advertisers, hackers, cybercriminals, and data brokers. \u201cIt\u2019s highly probable information used in this social media trend will be weaponized or co-opted by bad actors and in the future. Once your data is in the wild, it stays in the wild and can be used by any number of unscrupulous characters.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the marketplace watchdog is urging people to reconsider posting senior high school photos on Facebook. Given the advisory on the BBB\u2019s website, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
