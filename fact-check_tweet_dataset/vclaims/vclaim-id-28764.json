More recent history shows Russia not only as destabilizing influence in Europe but an occupying power in Crimea and questionable initiatives in Syria and Africa.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "March 09, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28764", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/is-russia-a-guarantor-of-stability-and-security-fact-check/29811254.html", "vclaim": "On March 7, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said during a briefing that Russia had \u201crepeatedly reaffirmed its role as a state that is the guarantor of stability and security,\u201d and \u201ca party that brings peace, not aggression.\u201d By way of example, she cited the Soviet Union\u2019s role in the Second World War.\n\nThis claim is, of course, highly controversial, particularly given the Soviet Union\u2019s collaboration with Nazi Germany during the period of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact from August 23 1939 to June 22 1941 (the day Nazi Germany and its allies invaded the USSR). The Soviet role in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany is part of the historical record, and can be judged by historians and others. We\u2019ll look at more recent history.\n\nThe most obvious example is the invasion, occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014, followed by its use of force to control parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. In both cases, the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that these actions constitute an international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In fact, the ICC used the word \u201ccrime\u201d in describing the conflict in 2016. The Donbas conflict has claimed the lives of nearly 13,000 people.\n\nRussia withdrew its signature from the statute founding the court, a day after the ICC said Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea constituted occupation of the Ukrainian territory.\n\nRussia has also played the role of a spoiler in the Balkans, most notably in 2016, when it was accused of aiding an attempt to overthrow the government of Montenegro in order to keep it from joining NATO. In a long bid to keep another nation out of NATO, Russia invested considerable time and attention to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where last year it opposed a referendum on officially changing the country\u2019s name to Northern Macedonia, a compromise with Greece that would potentially end that country\u2019s opposition to Macedonia\u2019s membership in the European Union and NATO.\n\nIt is questionable that Russia\u2019s recent initiatives outside of Europe have contributed to peace and stability. Russia\u2019s involvement in the Syrian uprising on the side of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria had the effect of prolonging the war and exacerbating that country\u2019s refugee crisis. In Libya, Russia has been backing Libyan National Congress leader General Khalifa Haftar, who is feuding with the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. While the extent of Russian military support to Haftar isn\u2019t entirely clear, he has visited Moscow several times.", "lang": "en"}
