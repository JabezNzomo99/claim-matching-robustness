Christie\u2019s campaign pointed to his prosecution of the suspect charged in the case of Daniel Pearl, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and murdered in 2002. The grand jury indictment charged Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh of being affiliated with radical militant organizations, fought with al-Qaeda forces and led co-conspirators to take Pearl hostage and kill him. An investigation by the Pearl Project confirmed that the former journalist was kidnapped and killed in connection with al-Qaeda operatives.\n\nThe Hemant Lakhani case (2005). The prosecution of Lakhani, suspected of being a major weapons trafficker to terrorist groups, was another major post-9/11 terrorism-related case. Lakhani did not end up in an actual smuggling plot, but federal officials believed that \u201cthey had taken a deadly threat off the street,\u201d the Baltimore Sun reported in 2003. Christie handled the prosecution, as Lakhani was believed to be helping export weapons to New Jersey. Christie often points to his use of the Patriot Act in this case.\n\nIn 2007, This American Life reexamined this case, calling into question the use of informants, and whether Lakhani really was a threat. None of the claims that the informant made about the arms deal plot checked out, according to the report. Christie said in an interview with This American Life that Lakhani was \u201ca bad guy\u201d and that he was not willing to take the chance that Lakhani was not actually a threat.\n\nBut some accuse prosecutors and the FBI of using dubious paid informants to entrap the men \u2014 three brothers and their two friends \u2014 and falsely accuse them of a crime they would not have committed. In an extensive 2015 article re-examining this case, the Intercept called into question the FBI\u2019s use of informants, and whether the men truly conspired to commit the attack. The Intercept interviewed the FBI informant in the case, who described the three Duka brothers as \u201cgood people,\u201d and claimed they were innocent.\n\nOperation Arabian Knight (2010). Two New Jersey men, Carlos Eduardo Almonte and Mohamed Mahmood Alessa, were convicted of conspiring to kill join al Shabaab, kill people who did not believe in extremist ideologies and recruit Americans and other Westerners. The men were arrested at JFK International Airport while trying to fly from New York to Egypt, intending to join al-Shabaab in Somalia. The men were charged in 2010, when Christie began serving as New Jersey governor.\n\nChristie noted the Lakhani and Fort Dix cases in his resignation letter, but also declared that he brought \u201ca new level of attention\u201d to political corruption in New Jersey. Christie had touted that he pursued convictions of 130 public officials, which became a widely-known number associated with his record as federal prosecutor. (The Record in North Jersey recently reported that Christie sometimes exaggerates his crime-fighting record as U.S. attorney.)\n\n\u201cAt the time he was U.S. attorney, this was not something that office was putting out there as their major effort,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThe big focus [ahead of Christie\u2019s gubernatorial campaign] was over 130 corruption convictions or guilty pleas. That\u2019s not to say that he didn\u2019t highlight Fort Dix and other things when he did them. But in terms of quantity, they paled in comparison to the very frequent corruption stories that were coming out of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office at the time.\u201d\n\nThe duties of a federal prosecutor are broad enough that they conveniently allow Christie to highlight different parts of his record depending on the political campaign. When he resigned as U.S. attorney and was eyeing a gubernatorial run, he highlighted the anti-corruption part of his record that would resonate the most with voters in New Jersey. Now, on the presidential campaign trail, he touts his record prosecuting terrorism cases.\n\nThis talking point seemed to come out of nowhere, but it\u2019s rooted in actual experience. His office was involved in prosecuting two high-profile post-9/11 terrorism cases, though it\u2019s Christie-esque exaggeration to call them \u201ctwo of the biggest terrorism cases in the world\u201d (especially when the use of informants in both cases are now under question). While the FBI does identify the Fort Dix and Lakhani as two of the most significant terror cases in the United States, the Major Terrorism Cases list gives context to how many major terrorism cases (40) there have been since 9/11. He also goes too far saying he spent his \u201clife\u201d focused on anti-terrorism cases.", "lang": "en"}
