So I divested from fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tom Steyer, at the Democratic presidential primary debate in January\n\nThis is exaggerated. Mr. Steyer, the billionaire businessman who has emphasized climate change as a presidential candidate, has repeatedly faced questions over how investments in oil, gas and coal companies helped him amass his fortune. Since 2014, Mr. Steyer has vowed to free his vast holdings from investments in fossil fuels. On the campaign trail, he has said that he has \u201cdivested from all of that stuff\u201d though he has conceded that \u201cthere\u2019s probably some dregs left.\u201d\n\nA review of Mr. Steyer\u2019s financial disclosure form reveals some of those \u201cdregs\u201d \u2014 and, more broadly, just how difficult it is to disentangle investments from carbon-emitting industries altogether.\n\nMost directly, Mr. Steyer has assets worth between $1,001 and $15,000 in Direct Petroleum Exploration Inc., a Colorado company that \u201coperates oil and gas field properties,\u201d according to Bloomberg. (The form lists assets in ranges, not exact amounts.) The Steyer campaign said these assets are valued at less than $4,500.", "lang": "en"}
