This is how the authors of that hefty volume recounted it:\n\nThe following well-known story of Edward Mordake, though taken from lay sources, is of sufficient notoriety and interest to be mentioned here: \u2014 \u201cOne of the weirdest as well as most melancholy stories of human deformity is that of Edward Mordake, said to have been heir to one of the noblest peerages in England. He never claimed the title, however, and committed suicide in his twenty-third year. He lived in complete seclusion, refusing the visits even of the members of his own family. He was a young man of fine attainments, a profound scholar, and a musician of rare ability. His figure was remarkable for its grace, and his face \u2013 that is to say, his natural face \u2013 was that of Antinous. But upon the back of his head was another face, that of a beautiful girl, \u2018lovely as a dream, hideous as a devil.\u2019 The female face was a mere mask, \u2018occupying only a small portion of the posterior part of the skull, yet exhibiting every sign of intelligence, of a malignant sort, however.\u2019 It would be seen to smile and sneer while Mordake was weeping. The eyes would follow the movements of the spectator, and the lips would \u2018gibber without ceasing.\u2019 No voice was audible, but Mordake avers that he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his \u2018devil twin,\u2019 as he called it, \u2018which never sleeps, but talks to me forever of such things as they only speak of in hell. No imagination can conceive the dreadful temptations it sets before me. For some unforgiven wickedness of my forefathers I am knit to this fiend \u2013 for a fiend it surely is. I beg and beseech you to crush it out of human semblance, even if I die for it.\u2019 Such were the words of the hapless Mordake to Manvers and Treadwell, his physicians. In spite of careful watching he managed to procure poison, whereof he died, leaving a letter requesting that the \u2018demon face\u2019 might be destroyed before his burial, \u2018lest it continues its dreadful whisperings in my grave.\u2019 At his own request he was interred in a waste place, without stone or legend to mark his grave.\u201d\n\nDespite the credulous reception the story has frequently received, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. For one, the entire passage about Mordrake was quoted from what the authors describe as \u201clay sources\u201d (more about which later), which sets it apart from other entries (such as their account of the life of Joseph Merrick, the \u201cElephant Man\u201d) drawn from actual medical case histories. For another, it is heavy on melodrama (e.g., \u201che was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his \u2018devil twin,\u2019 as he called it\u201d), while giving only the slightest nod to science (apart from applying the now-antiquated medical classification \u201cbicephalic monsters,\u201d there is really no scientific verbiage at all). And although it purports to cite two attending physicians, \u201cManvers and Treadwell,\u201d a critique of the entry in the 1906 edition of The Theosophical Review reported that the names appeared nowhere in the Dict. of National Biography (a Victorian-era Who\u2019s Who).\n\nThe origin of the black-and-white photograph purporting to show Mordrake and his \u201cdevil twin\u201d in profile (which has appeared in Internet postings since 2007) is unknown. Despite its \u201cvintage\u201d appearance, the image exhibits greater resolution and clarity than what is typically seen in photographic reproductions of the mid-to-late Victorian era (e.g., the 1889 photograph of Joseph Merrick published in the British Medical Journal). It appears, in fact, to be a retouched photo of a wax figure in the Panoptikum Wax Museum in Hamburg, Germany:\n\nThere does exist a real medical condition, Craniopagus parasiticus, whose symptoms bear a very basic resemblance to those described in this case. It\u2019s an extremely rare complication in conjoined twins wherein one of the pair is underdeveloped and less than fully functional (hence \u201cparasitic\u201d), and takes the form of a vestigial head attached to the cranium of the \u201cautositic\u201d (dominant) twin. According to a 2016 case report, there have only been ten or fewer recorded cases of Craniopagus parasiticus in history, \u201cof which only three survived past birth and were documented in the literature.\u201d Of those three, two died before the age of two, despite surgical attempts to save the life of the autositic twin. The third, known famously as the \u201ctwo-headed boy of Bengal,\u201d lived to be four years old and was reported to be in good health until he was bitten by a cobra and died.\n\nMost significantly, as regards the Mordrake case, conjoined twins are by definition genetically identical, so they are always of the same sex. The \u201cdevil twin\u201d described in that case was female, while the autositic twin was male (though it could be argued, of course, that the vestigial face was misidentified as female).\n\nThat the \u201csneering\u201d face had no audible voice comports with such information as we have on real cases of Craniopagus parasiticus, but the claims that it exhibited \u201cevery sign of intelligence\u201d and taunted the poor man with \u201chateful whispers\u201d do not. Accounts of the two-headed boy of Bengal said the vestigial face in that case could \u201cgrimace\u201d and its eyes were observed moving, for example, but though there could have been some sort of rudimentary consciousness present there were no signs of intelligence.\n\nAlternatively, it has been suggested that Mordrake might have suffered instead from a congenital defect known as Diprosopus (or craniofacial duplication), in which facial features are duplicated to a greater or lesser extent on other areas of the head (in the rarest cases, the full face is duplicated). The mechanisms behind this deformity aren\u2019t fully understood, although many researchers believe it to be another rare form of conjoined twinning. Although somewhat more common than Craniopagus parasiticus (with just under 50 instances documented since the mid-nineteenth century), Diprosopus has a similarly poor survival rate, with most cases ending in stillbirth.\n\nIn short, although science does offer theoretical explanations for Mordrake\u2019s condition, they are few and only marginally plausible.\n\nGould and Pyle reported in 1896 that the \u201cwell-known story of Edward Mordake\u201d they quoted was taken from \u201clay sources\u201d \u2014 plural \u2014 despite the fact that there was really only one. Science historian Alex Boese has traced the quoted text, verbatim, to a syndicated newspaper article written in 1895 by Charles Lotin Hildreth, a poet and author of speculative fiction:\n\nThe article, titled \u201cThe Wonders of Modern Science: some half human monsters once thought to be of the Devil\u2019s brood,\u201d describes a variety of remarkable \u201chuman freaks\u201d whose cases Hildreth claims to have found in old reports of the \u201cRoyal Scientific Society\u201d (the \u201cmusty old pages\u201d of which, he tells us, are characterized by their \u201clong S\u2019s and their turgid phraseology\u201d). Among the cases Hildreth details are the \u201cFish Woman of Lincoln\u201d \u2014 a young girl whose legs, from the hips downward were \u201ccovered with shining scales and terminated in the most exact tails of fish.\u201d There\u2019s a \u201chalf human, half crab\u201d whose hands and feet end in enormous, hard-shelled claws. The \u201cmelon child of Radnor,\u201d we learn, had a head the size and color of a melon, with no perceptible organs of sense except a vertical slit for a mouth. Mr. Pewness of Stratton had feet where his hands should be, \u201cand vice versa.\u201d The \u201cfour-eyed man of Cricklade\u201d had two sets of eyes, one above the other. \u201cJackass Johnny\u201d was cursed with \u201ca pair of enormously long, furry ears, exactly like those of an ass.\u201d The \u201cNorfolk spider\u201d was a monstrous thing that crawled upon its belly with six hairy jointed legs with claws and a human head.\n\nWhat all these \u201cwonders of science\u201d had in common, Boese points out, is that no mention of them is to be found in any previous sources. None. It appears, in other words, that Hildreth simply made them up. Albeit couched as nonfiction, the article was actually a work of speculative fiction in the spirit of other scientific hoaxes of the time, such as the infamous life-on-the-moon hoax of 1835 and the Cardiff Giant hoax of 1869.\n\nBoese concludes \u2014 convincingly, we find \u2014 that Edward Mordrake was the literary creation of Charles Lotin Hildreth. He never really existed.", "lang": "en"}
