Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the notice and claims made in the video.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Indian government\u2019s affiliate, Crime Prevention Council of India has released a notice asking online users to abstain from posting political propaganda content before the elections 2019. Fact: The notice is issued by the Crime Prevention Council of India, an NGO that works towards reducing crime in the country through awareness programs and workshops. The government of India has nothing to do with it. Hence the claims made in the video are quite MISLEADING.\n\nThe name of the organisation \u2018Crime Prevention Control of India\u2019 might make one think that it is affiliated to the government but it is actually the name of an NGO. When visited the website address in the notice \u201ccpcindiaonline.com\u201d, a letter addressing this issue was found in the \u2018News and Events\u2019 section. In the letter, its Chairman S K Pandey has clearly mentioned that CPCI is an NGO that works towards reducing crime in the country. He further went on to clarify that the notice with reference no. 0322 was not issued by the organisation but by a faulting officer Narendra Singh, who had been sacked for doing so.\n\nLastly, the notice is not issued by any affiliated organisation of the government of India but it\u2019s from an NGO.", "lang": "en"}
