On October 30, 2016, [Trump attorney] Michael Cohen received a text from Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze that said, \u2018Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there\u2019s anything else. Just so you know \u2026 .\u2019 Rtskhiladze said \u2018tapes\u2019 referred to compromising tapes of Trump rumored to be held by persons associated with the Russian real estate conglomerate Crocus Group, which had helped host the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Russia. Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the issue after receiving the texts from Rtskhiladze. Rtskhiladze said he was told the tapes were fake, but he did not communicate that to Cohen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence,\u201d the report said. \u201cKilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was a \u2018backdoor\u2019 way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate Trump\u2019s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort\u2019 s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
