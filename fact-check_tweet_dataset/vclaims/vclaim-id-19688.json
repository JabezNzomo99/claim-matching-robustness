The meme was shared over 23,000 times in two days -- but the event in question never took place. Even the name of the supposed principal, Mamasai Mamakusa, was taken from a Michael Jackson song and the photo illustrating the meme came from a stock image database.\n\nThe meme depicts a woman wearing a hijab and sitting at a desk, presenting her as the principal from a Richmond, Virginia school who expelled children for wearing crucifixes.\n\nThe meme was posted on the Facebook page America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, or LLOD, a satirical page whose content often goes viral. \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives,\u201d warns the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the page.\n\nHowever, since LLOD\u2019s content often blurs the line between satire and reality, those sharing its content often do not realize the satirical nature of what they are posting.\n\nTherefore, the reactions prompted by this particular post are more often anger than laughter, as many of those sharing the image assume that it is serious news.\n\nA closer look at the meme quickly reveals the fraud.\n\nFirstly, the original picture\u2019s watermark was not erased, showing a photo agency\u2019s name, Alamy. Alamy sells stock images of all sorts on the internet, and the one used by America\u2019s Last Line Of Defense is called \u201cSmiling young Muslim female entrepreneur wearing a hijab sitting in her home office working online with a laptop.\u201d\n\nThe woman in the photo is therefore not the principal of a Virginia school called Mamasai Mamakusa. A search in the Richmond Public School online staff registry does not yield any results for Mamasai Mamakusa at all. Nor is anyone in the US Yellow Pages registered under this name.\n\nMamasai Mamakusa is a fictional name taken from Michael Jackson\u2019s 1982 song \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin.\u201d The phrase, spelled in a variety of ways, was also used by Rihanna in her 2007 song \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Stop The Music,\u201d and originally came from the 1972 song \u201cSoul Makossa\u201d by Manu Dibango. The page\u2019s administrators hint to this in the comments section of the meme with a screenshot.\n\nPrincipal Mamakosa does not exist and so didn't expel anybody from any school.", "lang": "en"}
