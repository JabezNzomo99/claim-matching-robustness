Joseph Stalin said, \u2018If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.\u2019 We, the people, can stop that decline.\"\n\nThe problem is that in all likelihood, this is not a real quote from the former Soviet leader. Stalin led the communist nation from the 1920s until his death in 1953, and it is believed that millions died during his regime.\n\nSearches for the quote do not turn up in any history books, scholarly works or primary sources. Mostly it\u2019s just social media sharables with the quote text next to a picture of Stalin.\n\nOur friends over at Snopes looked into a similar quote and concluded that it\u2019s \"highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words.\" It seems dubious that Stalin would say something like this, as the quote, in a sense, compliments America for its strengths, Snopes noted.\n\nWe searched through an online Stalin Archive and an online library compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our searches came up empty.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where this quote originated. The earliest use of the quote Snopes found was in a 1983 letter to the editor in a Kansas newspaper.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Stalin said this quote in a speech or in a letter that was never translated into English or never put on the Internet. But the burden is on Carson to back up his words with evidence.\n\nIf new evidence pops up to the contrary, we\u2019ll revisit this article.\n\nWe reached out to Carson\u2019s campaign but haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nCarson quoted Stalin as saying, \"If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.\"\n\nAll signs point to this being a fake quote that has made its way around the Internet.", "lang": "en"}
