Elise Stefanik giving the middle finger after former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe image of Stefanik was taken from news coverage of the impeachment hearings and doctored to show her giving the middle finger.\n\nStefanik, a congresswoman from New York, is the only Republican woman on the House Intelligence Committee. She and other members of the committee questioned Yovanovitch during the second day of public hearings in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Facebook post features a screen grab of a tweet from George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. He quote tweeted a viral picture allegedly depicting Stefanik making an obscene gesture to the camera following Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cThis woman doesn\u2019t deserve to hold public office,\u201d tweeted Conway. \u201cPlease retweet this and give what you can to her opponent, @TedraCobb.\u201d (RELATED: Did Four Republicans Vote To Impeach Trump?)\n\nThe viral image has, however, been digitally manipulated. It seems to have come from a CNN video of the impeachment hearing that shows people applauding Yovanovitch as she leaves the room. Stefanik approaches the camera and then turns away, without making any obscene gesture, according to the video.\n\n\u201cThe photoshopped picture that the Leftist Twitter mob led by George Conway is circulating is FAKE \u2013 I\u2019ve been so busy exposing Adam Schiff\u2019s #regimeofsecrecy that I haven\u2019t had time for a manicure in weeks! Proof from yesterday,\u201d Stefanik tweeted, along with photo evidence that she wasn\u2019t wearing nail polish that day.\n\nSome social media users who shared the image later corrected their posts to reflect that the image had, in fact, be doctored. For instance, writer Brian O\u2019Malley, whom Conway quote tweeted, apologized to Stefanik and noted it had been manipulated by a graphic artist.\n\n\u201c@EliseStefanik I erroneously posted an image of you that I believed was real. I deleted the image after it was exposed as a fake,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote. \u201cI take full responsibility for what I did.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
