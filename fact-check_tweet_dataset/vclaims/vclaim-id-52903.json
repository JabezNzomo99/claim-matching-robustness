Why are they here? Distribute so much liquor in the state that people just drink and lie around (Translated to English),\" Chouhan seemingly says in the video.\n\nCongress leader Digvijay Singh had also posted the same video. The tweet was later deleted.\n\n The video clip went viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMadhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has ordered officials to distribute liquor in the state in a viral video clip.

It's a very unfortunate situation and we have just begun the fight, we will fight... Does the government want the youth of Madhya Pradesh to sink in a sea of alcohol? (Translated to English)\".\n\n \"What is the excise department doing? What are they for? Why does not it stop the selling of illegal liquor? Will you send the alcohol to everybody's home. It will make the youth hollow and destroy the state. But the farmers should not ask for loan waivers, youth should not ask for unemployment allowance, the poor should not talk about Sambal Yojana, nobody should ask for money from the chief minister, and that's why spread the alcohol in the state to such an extent that people drink and stay drunk (Translated to English),\" Chouhan added. In connection to the viral video clip, the Bhopal police crime branch registered a case against Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. Based on a complaint by BJP leaders, the case was registered for sharing the tampered video of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on social media.
