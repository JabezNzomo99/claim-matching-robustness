This is often a sign that they will not develop to their full potential physically and mentally, the UN health agency\n\nPoor feeding, genetics and diseases were some of the reasons for stunting in children, said Prof Adebayo Onajole, a public health physician and epidemiologist at the\n\nIn Nigeria, poor nutrition was the most common reason, Onajole told Africa Check.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best source of data?\n\nwas the best source of data to verify the claim,\n\nThe most recent survey, released in June 2018, looked at 18,781 children aged under five. It was conducted from February to June 2018 by the\n\n(MICS), released in October 2017, also has information on the health of children.\n\nSaid Akande: \u201cThe reasons why I chose the national nutrition survey over the MICS is because it focuses on nutrition whereas MICS focuses on several health issues. Secondly, the nutrition survey was compiled by nutritionists who are experts in their field. It is also more recent than the MICS.\u201d\n\nWhat did the nutrition survey find?\n\nfor children aged under five years was 32% (or a range of between 30.7% and 33.4%).\n\nNigeria\u2019s most recent official population estimate for this age group is 31.1 million, in 2016. This would mean 9.95 million children were stunted (32/100 x 31.1 million = 9.95 million).\n\nDr Isiaka Olarewaju is a director of statistics at Nigeria\u2019s\n\n. He told Africa Check that multiplying the share of stunted children by the estimated population in that age group for that year would be the best way to work out the number of stunted kids.\n\nBut there has been no population estimate since 2016.\n\nThe nutrition survey is done annually. The 2015 edition estimated the stunting prevalence in children under five\n\nchildren, this works out to about 10 million affected kids.\n\nStunting had dropped in some parts of the country, such as the south west, but was still a major issue in rural areas, the\n\n\u201cIn places where famine, war, displacement and food taboos exist, stunting is likely to be high.\u201d But reducing stunting wasn\u2019t only the responsibility of the government, he said.\n\n\u201cEnsuring a child has a balanced diet is the responsibility of parents. Families should consume nutrient-rich foods within their area.\u201d Onajole added that nutritious food didn\u2019t have to be expensive.\n\nA national newspaper said Nigeria\u2019s economy would not grow if the country didn\u2019t overcome the problem of stunted development in children under five.\n\nIt claimed there were 11 million stunted children in Nigeria \u2013 nearly the most in the world.\n\nDifferent data sources produce different estimates of stunting, from 9.95 million to 13.9 million kids. They all struggle with uncertain population data in Nigeria, which last held a census in 2006.\n\nWhile the number of affected children can\u2019t be precisely determined, stunting is a profound problem that could indeed hold back Nigeria\u2019s development.", "lang": "en"}
