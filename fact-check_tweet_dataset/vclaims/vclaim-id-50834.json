Many of the people sharing this image did so with the claim that these women were supporting U.S. President Donald Trump and they were \u201cproud\u201d to be racists:\n\nThis is not a genuine photograph of a group of women wearing \u201cI\u2019m a Racist Bitch\u201d T-shirts but a digitally altered image. The original photograph featured the slogan \u201cI\u2019m a Trump Girl.\u201d\n\nThis photograph was taken during a Trump rally in Greenville, North Carolina. Gerri McDaniel, the director of Trump\u2019s campaign efforts in South Carolina, shared it on Twitter.\n\nA second photograph featuring these same women in the same \u201cI\u2019m a Trump Girl\u201d shirts at the Trump rally in Greenville is available via Alamy.\n\nThis doctored image was likely created to promote a genuine product. We\u2019ve come across several other \u201cfake shirt\u201d photos that featured real products available for sale. Typically, these fake shirts are photoshopped onto celebrities such as Aaron Rodgers or Bill Murray. In this case, a photograph of a group of Trump-supporting women wearing \u201cI\u2019m a Trump Girl\u201d shirts was doctored in an apparent attempt to promote an \u201cI\u2019m a Racist Bitch\u201d shirt that was genuinely available on the website Teespring:\n\nAs of this writing, it seems that this shirt is no longer available for sale on Teespring.", "lang": "en"}
