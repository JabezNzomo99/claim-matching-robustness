Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\u201d\n\nWhile Copeland did say that people who failed to vote in the 2016 presidential election would be \u201cguilty of murder,\u201d there is no evidence he ever made the statement in question.\n\nCopeland, one of the wealthiest preachers in the country, is the founder of Kenneth Copeland Ministries near Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe quote attributed to him seems to have first appeared in an August 2016 article from The Business Standard News, a self-described satirical site.\n\nAn investigation by The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence Copeland ever actually made these remarks.\n\nHowever, the pastor has been vocal about politics in the past.\n\nIn October 2016, he appeared on a television program titled \u201cFaith for Our Nation\u201d in which he implored viewers to vote in the upcoming presidential election. If they failed to do so, he warned that they would be guilty of murder.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be held seriously \u2013 seriously \u2013 to account by God if you don\u2019t vote,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be guilty of murder. You\u2019re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You\u2019re going to be guilty for every baby that\u2019s aborted from this election forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean we could have another eight years of Hillary Clinton and the worst mess that anybody could make out of a nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nCopeland, who participated in Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board, is associated with a branch of Christianity that espouses the \u201cprosperity gospel,\u201d which teaches that true believers can become wealthy through faith.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
