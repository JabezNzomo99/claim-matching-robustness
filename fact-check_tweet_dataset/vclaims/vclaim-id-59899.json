Vishvas News. A viral video on social media features a woman expressing gratitude over the success in Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple case with a claim that she is the owner of the temple and maybe the richest lady in the world. We spotted the claim first on twitter. The video is viral on other social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook. Vishvas News investigation revealed the claim to be false and the temple\u2019s ownership does not belong to anybody and would remain the public property. However, the Travancore Royal family has won the shebait rights of the temple.\n\nA viral video on social media featuring a woman thanking advocates on the success of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple case comes with a claim that she is the owner of the temple and maybe the richest lady in the world. The archived post can be accessed here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video is also available on YouTube with false claims.\n\nWhen we searched on the Internet, we found several news reports on the end of nine-year-old controversy over the administration and management of the historic temple.\n\nThe Supreme Court in its verdict on 13 July 2020 upheld the rights of Travancore Royal family in the administration of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.\n\n\u201cThe administrative and advisory committees shall do well to discharge all their functions including performance of the worship of the deity and maintenance of its properties, diligently and in the best interest of the temple, and provide adequate and requisite facilities to the worshippers and more..,\u201d the Judgment stated in Page no. 214.\n\nAn article in the Indian Express stated, \u201cThe Supreme Court upheld the right of the Travancore royal family to manage the property of deity at Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple\u2026 The court said that, as per customary law, the shebait rights (right to manage the financial affairs of the deity) survive with the members of the family even after the death of the last ruler.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, there was no information on the ownership of the temple as in the viral claim that had over 2,000 viewers.\n\nWhen we contacted the Travancore family over the viral claim, they clarified to us that they don\u2019t hold the ownership of the temple.\n\n\u201cThe person in the video did not claim to be the owner and even we don\u2019t hold the ownership of the temple. The temple is a public property and nobody can claim ownership. We are a part of the administration and the eldest male member of the family will perform the duties as directed by the Supreme Court,\u201d said Travancore Prince Aditya Varma Thampuran.\n\nWe found the narrator in the video is Shilpa Nair, the president of the People of dharma, an organisation that gives legal support on temple related issues.\n\n\n\nWe accessed the original video that Nair posted on her twitter expressing gratitude to the SC, Justice UU Lalit and Indu Malhotra.\n\nNair herself had tweeted the screenshots of the false claims and objected to the descriptions that stated her as the \u2018owner of the temple\u2019. \u201cI do not belong to the Travancore Royal family nor I am the owner of any temple wealth,\u201d she said.\n\nOur further investigations revealed that Nair had filed a police complaint against the false claims.\n\nConclusion: The viral video featuring a woman expressing gratitude over the success in Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple case with a claim that she is the owner of the temple and maybe the richest lady in the world is fake.", "lang": "en"}
