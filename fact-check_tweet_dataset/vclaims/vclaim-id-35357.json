Lijian Zhao, shared the same image with similar claims. The Global Times and Zhao have since taken theirs down.\n\nThe image actually shows a modular apartment building in China.\n\nThe 1,000 bed Huoshenshan Hospital built in just 10 days started accepting its first coronavirus patients on Feb. 3, according to The Associated Press. It is located on the outskirts of Wuhan, the central Chinese city in which the outbreak is believed to have originated.\n\nThe image, however, doesn\u2019t actually depict part of that hospital. It shows a modular apartment building that seems to have been taken from either an online listing for it or the manufacturer\u2019s website. The online listing places the apartment building nearly 600 miles away in Qingdao.\n\nAnother prefabricated, 1,600-bed hospital also completed construction this week, reported the New York Post.

It has spread from China to 24 other countries around the globe, according to the same report.\n\nOn Jan. 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency, reported The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
