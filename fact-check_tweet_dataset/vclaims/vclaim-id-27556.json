Please do check their all Indian account information with their IT returns, their business profile, business background. Check the below account holders complete details and revert us their complete clear business details before 31st March, 2012.'\n\nThe statement then lists supposed account details of Rajiv Gandhi, \n\nAndimuthu Raja, Harshad Mehta, Sharad Pawar, P Chidambaram, Suresh Kalmadi, Muthuvel Karunanidhi, Ketan Parekh, Chirag Jayesh Mohini and Kalanithi Maran.\n\n''The above accounts have been blacklisted in our system docks, if we do not get clear details of their funds deposited in our banks 31st March, 2012 their accounts will be impede.' - it further states.\n\nThe most damaging proof that the letter is fake is that it uses a letterhead of Swiss Bank Corporation for a letter intended to be sent in 2011.\n\nSwiss Bank Corporation was merged with the Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS in December 1997. A basic Google search for 'Swiss Bank Corporation' shows it has been defunct since 1998.\n\nBOOM found a 1997 news article by the New York Times on the merger.\n\n\"Two banking giants, Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, announced early today that they planned to merge, creating the world's second largest bank,\" the New York Times reported.\n\n\"The combined bank is to be called United Bank of Switzerland, with corporate and consumer banking operations headquartered in Zurich, while the private banking unit will be based in Basel,\" it further said.\n\nBOOM reached out to UBS to verify the document.\n\n\"It is a clear forgery because Swiss Bank Corp did not exist in October 2011,\" Mark Panday, Corporate Communications, UBS told BOOM in an email.\n\nA search for the message online shows it has existed on social media since at least 2011.\n\nThe same document was called out as fake by Quora users in 2016. (Read about it here)\n\nThe message is replete with grammatical mistakes. It uses the Indian numbering system of crores unlike European organisations which use millions and billions.\n\nMartin de Sa'Pinto is a former Reuters business news journalist based out of Switzerland. He currently works as a financial investigations and business intelligence consultant, as per his LinkedIn profile.\n\nWe did a Google search of his name and stories on Swiss banks.", "lang": "en"}
