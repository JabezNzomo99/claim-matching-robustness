Upon investigating we found out that NASA did not confirm any such news that Marijuana contains Alien DNA from outside our solar system.\n\nA Facebook post claims that Marijuana contains \u201cAlien DNA\u201d from outside of our solar system, as per NASA. The viral post is also supported by a caption that states: I agree with Baba Ramdev\u2019s suggestion of legalizing Marijuana in India as it has medicinal properties. I agree with Baba Ramdev\u2019s suggestion of legalizing Marijuana in India, as it has medicinal properties. As per Ayurveda, marijuana helps in curing knee pain and also maintaining proper blood circulation. As per NASA, marijuana is one such plant whose DNA doesn\u2019t match with any other plant of the earth. Marijuana belongs to some other planet. The viral post is shared by the Facebook user \u2018A.K.Mishra\u2019 on May 29, 2019.\n\nWe started our investigation by looking at the comments on the viral post. Many users commented questioning the authenticity of the claim.\n\nWe performed a Google search using the keywords \u2018NASA confirms Marijuana has Alien DNA\u2019 and added the time filter.\n\nWe found a tweet dated 26 Apr 2019 by a Twitter user \u2018Dacia J. Ferris\u2019. The user had retweeted another tweet of \u2018Physics & Astronomy Zone\u2019 with a caption \u2018As someone made entirely star stuff, I am shocked by this revelation\u2019.\n\nWhen we clicked on the tweet of \u2018Physics & Astronomy Zone, we were redirected to a website link dated April 20, 2019.\n\nOn the website, we found the same image that was shared by the Facebook user.\n\nWhen we read the article it stated that: \u201cSince you\u2019re now reading, you\u2019ll almost certainly be interested in this research that looked into the clicking and sharing behaviors of social media users reading content (or not) and then sharing it on social media.\u201d Which means, people on social media doesn\u2019t read the entire thing and simply falls prey to the click-bait headlines.\n\nThe article further reads that: \u201cLast April, NPR shared an article on their Facebook page which asked, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t America read anymore?\u201c. The joke, of course, is that there was no article. They waited to see if their followers would weigh in with an opinion without clicking the link, and they weren\u2019t disappointed.\n\nWhen we clicked on the link mentioned in the article we landed to the website of National Public Radio, U.S. in which an article posted on April 1 (April Fool\u2019s Day) stated: Why Doesn\u2019t America Read Anymore? The article further reads: Congratulations, genuine readers, and happy April Fools\u2019 Day! We sometimes get the sense that some people are commenting on NPR stories that they haven\u2019t actually read. If you are reading this, please like this post and do not comment on it. Then let\u2019s see what people have to say about this \u201cstory.\u201d\n\nWe further investigated and found that NASA did not confirm any such claim.\n\nWe also found an article on Forbes titled: 59 Percent Of You Will Share This Article Without Even Reading It.\n\nThe article stated: IFLScience.com recently conducted a similar experiment, publishing an article titled Marijuana Contains \u201cAlien DNA\u201d From Outside Of Our Solar System, NASA Confirms. The article, as of now, has over 141,000 shares, and it isn\u2019t about marijuana or alien DNA at all \u2013 it\u2019s an experiment to see how many shares it could attract with an outrageous headline alone. IFLScience states within the post that \u201cWe here at IFLS noticed long ago that many of our followers will happily like, share, and offer an opinion on an article \u2013 all without ever reading it.\u201d Forbes also mentioned about the fake story that Marijuana contains Alien DNA and how people fall prey to such stories without reading it completely.\n\nThe viral post is also supported by a caption that states: I agree with Baba Ramdev\u2019s suggestion of legalizing Marijuana in India as it has medicinal properties. As per Ayurveda, marijuana helps in curing knee pain, maintaining proper blood circulation. As per NASA, marijuana is one such plant whose DNA doesn\u2019t match with any other plant of the earth. It belongs to some other planet.\n\nIn an interview given to Quartz, Acharya Balkrishna of Ramdev-led Patanjali said: \u201cIn Ayurveda, since ancient times, parts of cannabis (hemp), for instance, have been used for medicinal purposes. So, we are looking at various formulations. We should ponder over the benefits and positive uses of the cannabis plant.\u201d\n\nAs per a news report on Indiatimes: At a TEDx event, held recently in Panchkula, Balkrishna put his weight behind legalizing cannabis for medical purposes, and for opening business and employment opportunities in India.\n\nAnother claim from the Facebook user is: \u201cAs per NASA, marijuana is one such plant whose DNA doesn\u2019t match with any other plant of the earth. Marijuana belongs to some other planet.\u201d We investigated and found that NASA did not release any such report or statement.\n\nNo, NASA did not confirm any such news that Marijuana contains Alien DNA from outside of our solar system.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
