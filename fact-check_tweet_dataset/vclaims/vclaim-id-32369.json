Scientists have suggested it may have originated in bats, but the exact source of the outbreak is still unknown.\n\nMisinformation about the novel respiratory virus, known as COVID-19, has spread widely across social media. In this case, a viral Facebook post alleges the use of rhino horns \u201cpossibly\u201d caused the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of myths like the ones you refer to currently circulating,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the Daily Caller. \u201cWe call it an \u2018infodemic.'\u201d\n\nWolfgang Preiser, the head of medical virology at Stellenbosch University, told AFP that the virus couldn\u2019t have come from a rhino horn. (RELATED: No, The WHO Did Not Officially Designate Coronavirus As A Plague)\n\n\u201cViruses need live cells, live organisms for themselves to replicate, so even the rhino horn as such, even if it\u2019s still on the rhino, would not be able to be infected with the virus because the rhino horn is dead,\u201d Preiser told AFP.\n\nThe outbreak\u2019s exact source remains unknown, but health officials believe it may have originated in a seafood and live animal market located in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe virus, the Centers for Disease Control website explains, comes from the same family of betacoronaviruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which both have origins in bats. Scientists suggest the novel coronavirus may also have originated in bats and gotten transmitted to humans through an intermediary host species, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe WHO reports a total of 78,811 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been found globally, with 77,042 documented in China and 1,769 documented in 28 other countries, as of Feb. 23.", "lang": "en"}
