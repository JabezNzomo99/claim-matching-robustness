But just why was Facebook able to collect records of who its users were contacting \u2014 and when \u2014 in the first place?\n\nWell, it's complicated. But users had to opt in to make it possible.\n\nThe social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 \u2014 first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings.\n\nThe revelation that Facebook kept users' logs, first reported by Ars Technica, raises new questions about the company's use of personal data. The social media network is under fire after political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 50 million of its users, with the goal of influencing the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFacebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. But the company released a statement on Sunday detailing its call logging feature. \"People have to expressly agree to use this feature,\" the statement said, in part, and noted: \"We never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.\"\n\nSince the data-privacy scandal emerged, some consumers have jumped on the #DeleteFacebook movement in order to protest Facebook's data collection issues. But some data may remain with the service even after consumers delete their accounts.\n\nFor instance, data about consumers posted by friends and family members will remain with the service as long as they remain on the social-media service, according to Facebook's Help Center. \"Keep in mind that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account,\" Facebook says in its data policy.\n\nAnd messages you've sent to a friend on Facebook would remain stored on Facebook's computers, the company said.\n\nThere's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis.\n\nBut Android has long been more indulgent.\n\nUntil recently, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed to grant access, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories.\n\nFacebook's access to those logs required user consent. But it wasn't always clear what they were consenting to\u2014and whether the users knew Facebook would keep that information indefinitely.\n\nStarting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs. But it required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work.\n\nIt wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories.\n\nThat's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it.\n\nApple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions.\n\nThere are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly.\n\nAs of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.)\n\nJust over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android.\n\nHow widespread is the issue?\n\nAll that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup?\n\nExperts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which \u2014 like Facebook \u2014 depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music.\n\nAnother possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive \u2014 as Facebook did.\n\nExperts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible.\n\n\"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\"\n\nA Google spokesperson was unable to say how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. The company declined to comment further.\n\nThe role of manufacturers of Android phones for protecting user privacy remains unclear, South Korean mobile device maker LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement.\n\n\"Privacy is everyone's responsibility - software providers, carriers, as well as device manufacturers,\" said LG, whose smartphones run on the Android operating system.\n\n\"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" it said. \"If hardware played a role in the breach then we will certainly look into solution options.\"", "lang": "en"}
