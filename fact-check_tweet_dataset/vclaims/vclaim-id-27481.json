Foster was neither arrested nor booked.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared a video, originally posted by Foster, with the headline \u201cCop arrests black male for eating a sandwich on a BART platform.\u201d The video shows a confrontation between Foster and a BART transit officer, identified as D. McCormick, after the officer saw Foster eating a sandwich on a BART platform near Concord, California. It went viral over the weekend.\n\nFoster was briefly detained and later received a citation for eating on the platform, according to a statement from BART General Manager Bob Powers. He admitted to cursing at and making homophobic slurs to the officer, reports ABC 7.\n\nNumerous online media outlets, including NowThis and We The People, shared videos of the incident online with similar claims.\n\nHowever, a BART spokeswoman told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that Foster was \u201clawfully handcuffed for repeatedly refusing to provide his identification,\u201d not for eating his sandwich. Identification is required for a transit officer to give a citation and, according to the BART spokeswoman, failure to comply with a citation can result in detention.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the officer observed an infraction and proceeded to attempt to issue a citation,\u201d said Rabin Nabizadeh, an attorney at the California-based Summit Defense law firm, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cOnce the individual refused to provide his identification, the officer was within his rights to detain the individual and even formally arrest him for a violation of the far more serious Misdemeanor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce he provided his identification he was given the citation for violation of the penal code (eating in the paid area) and released,\u201d said Alicia Trost, the chief communications officer for BART, in an email. \u201cHe was not arrested or booked.\u201d\n\nBoth state law and BART policy prohibits the consumption of food and drink in the \u201cPaid Area\u201d of stations, which former BART Police Chief Gary Gee defined in a statement as \u201cthe places where you need a ticket such as inside the fare gates of a station, on platforms or on any train.\u201d Violators face up to a $250 fine and up to 48 hours of community service, according to the state statute.\n\nTransit officers typically have no need to write citations as commuters usually stop eating when asked, according to Trost. The transit officer in the video proceeded to cite Foster after the man refused to stop eating his sandwich.\n\nPowers later issued an apology to \u201cMr. Foster, our riders, employees, and the public who have had an emotional reaction to the video.\u201d BART\u2019s independent police auditor is currently investigating the incident.\n\nFoster has said that he is considering taking legal action against the transit agency, according to ABC 7.\n\nFoster did not return the DCNF\u2019s request for comment.\n\nUPDATE (11/13/19): A comment from criminal defense attorney Rabin Nabizadeh of Summit Defense has been added to the article.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
