This is not what happened. The image was doctored using an old photo, taken long before the pandemic.\n\nThe image was used in several Facebook posts, including this one by Scannews, which has been shared more than 400 times since it was published on March 21, 2020.\n\nAFP has debunked multiple Facebook posts from Scannews in the past (see here, here, here, and here).\n\nIn this post, the text accompanying the image called on Nigerian health officials to educate the president on precautionary measures against the spread of the virus that has claimed nearly 20,000 lives since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe text reads: \u201cBuhari: What is the role of his doctors and officials of the Federal Ministry of Health? You cover your nose, but shake hands. They should properly educate President Muhammadu Buhari on the precautionary measures to be taken.\u201d\n\nThe image also appears in posts shared here, here and here on Facebook, here on Instagram, and here and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nBut the photo has been doctored. AFP ran a reverse image search and traced the original photo, which does not include face masks. It was shot during an event in May 2019, months before the start of the pandemic.\n\nIn a news report published May 27, 2019, Nigerian newspaper The Punch captioned the photo: \u201cBuhari receives asset declaration form from Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Prof. Muhammad Isa.\u201d This photo was slightly cropped, but an uncropped version can also be found in a Facebook post published by Buhari\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the two images shows the viral image has been manipulated to add masks to both Buhari and Isa\u2019s faces.\n\nKey phrases such as \u201cCode of Conduct Bureau\u201d, and \u201cAsset Declaration Form for Public Officers\u201d that were written in bold letters on the cover of the document held by the two men in the original photo were blacked out in the doctored version.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rising to 46, including one death, as of March 25, 2020, the nation\u2019s centre for disease control urges Nigerians to adopt the use of \u201cno-touch greetings\u201d as a form of social distancing to reduce the spread of the virus.", "lang": "en"}
