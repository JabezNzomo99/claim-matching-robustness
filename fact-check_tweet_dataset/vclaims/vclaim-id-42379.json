Suman Harpriya, a legislator in the northeastern state of Assam claimed that cow urine and cow dung could be effective in treating COVID-19.\n\n\"Coronavirus is an airborne disease and it can be cured by using 'gaumutra'(cow urine) and cow dung,\" Haripriya had said.\n\n\"Performing yagna with ancient Vedic rituals of Hindu religion would help in killing the deadly coronavirus in the air,\" Sanjay Gupta, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Laksar area in Haridwar said.\n\nOur community members also reached out to us on our WhatsApp Fact Check Number asking us to verify this claim.\n\nA study titled \"Evaluation of antidiabetic, antioxidant effect and safety profile of Gomutra ark in Wistar albino rats\" has revealed that cow's urine has a significant anti-diabetic effect which is comparable to standard drug glibenclamide. This activity may be due to the presence of sulfur in the cow urine or due to its antioxidant activity.\n\nBut beyond that, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that cow urine can cure or prevent COVID-19 or any other disease.\n\n\n\nOn February 24, The American Association For The Advancement of Science reported that more than 500 scientists have asked the Indian government to withdraw a call for research proposals on the \"uniqueness\" of indigenous cows and the curative properties of cow urine, dung, and milk, including potential cancer treatments.\n\nIn an online letter, the researchers say the call is \"unscientific\" and a misdirection of public money at a time when research in India is already facing a financial crunch.\n\nIn their letter, scientists note that the call presumes \"special physiological status to select breeds of only one species,\" adding that \"to begin a project with such presumptions is prima facie unscientific.\" Money under the scheme could be \"wasted to 'investigate' imaginary qualities derived from religious scriptures,\" they said.\n\nWhile cow urine and cow dung might be used in several medicines, it can certainly not cure coronavirus. No such scientific evidence exists.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
