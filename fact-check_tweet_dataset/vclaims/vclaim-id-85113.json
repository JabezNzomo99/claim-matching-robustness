Trump in The New York Times. The front page headline on Oct. 16, 1973, said: \u201cMajor Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias in City.\u201d Regarding the charges, Trump was quoted: \u201cThey are absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kranish and Fisher, the Justice Department lawsuit was \u201cone of the most significant racial bias cases of the era.\u201d It was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Commission, who documented that black people were told no apartments were available in Trump properties while white testers at the same time were immediately offered apartments. In a sampling of 10 Trump buildings, only 1 to 3.5 percent of the occupants were minorities, making it one of the strongest cases the Justice Department had ever seen for violations of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nAll the Justice Department wanted was to obtain a settlement in which Trump and his father would promise not to discriminate. But Trump instead hired Roy Cohn, a notoriously combative attorney, and countersued the Justice Department for $100 million ($500 million in today\u2019s dollars) for making false and misleading statements. But his allegations were dismissed by the courts, and two years of litigation later, Trump decided in 1975 to settle before the case went to trial.\n\n\u201cThe settlement was much like what the Trumps could initially have gotten,\u201d the book says. As part of the deal, the Trumps were required to place ads assuring minorities that they would have equal access to housing. Trump initially balked at paying for the ads but ultimately was forced to do so.\n\nNewspapers at the time declared it was a victory for the government, with headlines such as \u201cMinorities Win Housing Suit.\u201d The Justice Department said the decree was \u201cone of the most far-reaching ever negotiated.\u201d A New York Times article determined that the agreement had \u201cstronger teeth\u201d than a settlement reached with another real estate firm, the Lefrak Organization, in 1971.\n\nThe book notes that Trump, in an interview, falsely claimed \u201cthere were many, many landlords that were sued under that case.\u201d Similarly, in the debate, Trump claimed \u201cthat was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms.\u201d But the suit was squarely aimed at the Trumps and their company; it was titled: United States of America v. Fred C. Trump, Donald Trump and Trump Management, Inc.\n\nDonald Trump: Yeah, that was, yeah. But I meant that was one of many cases. Michael Kranish: What other cases? The LeFrak case was settled, and you were upset about the Lefrak case being settled, the Sam Lefrak case. Donald Trump: Oh, I see. You mean they settled it sooner? Michael Kranish: He settled previously, and you had cited in your book that, you know, this other landlord, Sam Lefrak, settled the case. You didn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nMoreover, the Trumps were back in court three years later, as the Justice Department in 1978 alleged that they had reneged on the agreement to allow minorities to rent properties. The case was not formally closed until 1982.\n\nOn several levels, Trump\u2019s debate answer was misleading. This was not a case brought against many real estate firms; it was brought against Trump and his father. Trump did not get a better deal; he got essentially the same deal, or possibly worse, than the deal he would have gotten if he had settled before spending legal fees for two years. He also failed to live up to the deal and found himself back in court. While Trump touts there was no admission of guilt, that\u2019s rather typical in these sorts of settlements. The Justice Department simply wanted to get the Trumps to agree to rent to African American tenants \u2014 which they failed to do even after agreeing to settle the case.", "lang": "en"}
