Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, for example, wrote:\n\nConservative Daily Wire editor Ben Shapiro implored Attorney General Jeff Sessions to \u201cget cracking\u201d on the case, saying: \u201cBribery is illegal under federal law.\u201d Both Hannity and Shapiro cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(1) of the U.S. Code as the relevant statute:\n\n(1) directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent\u2014 (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing, or collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person;\n\nWhile a cursory reading of the statute may seem like a slam-dunk case against O\u2019Donnell, it is highly unlikely that such a case would make it very far, as the standard of evidence for conviction \u2014 based on federal jury instructions provided for trials involving violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(1) \u2014 require proof of what is known as \u201ccorrupt intent,\u201d a high legal bar.\n\nIn more simple terms, this would mean that a court would need to prove O\u2019Donnell intended the statement as a serious offer, and not as some other expression of her own free speech as a comedian, as reported by The Hill:\n\nIf Rosie were serious about breaking federal law, a stronger case could have been made if these \u201cbribery\u201d discussions had been carried out in secret and not in front of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s more than one million Twitter followers.", "lang": "en"}
