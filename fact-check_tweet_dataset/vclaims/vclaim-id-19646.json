It describes itself as the world\u2019s largest database of user-contributed data, and grades cities on indicators such as the cost of living, traffic and crime.\n\nTo rank traffic in cities, Numbeo provides \u201conline software which allows users to compare their time and distance spent in traffic\u201d.\n\nNairobians typically spend 56.43 minutes in traffic, according to the website\u2019s\n\n. This places it first in Africa, and eighth out of 208 cities.\n\nIn the last three years the city has ranked between third and 12th globally.\n\nWhen Africa Check asked about his data, Mladen Adamovich, the website\u2019s chief executive officer, said 7,791 people across all cities took the survey in 2017.\n\nFor Nairobi, there were \u201c\n\nonly 29 contributions in the past three years,\u201d he said, 10 of them in 2017. T\n\nhis \u201csample is indeed very small\u201d, Adamovich added.\n\nBasing the traffic index on an online survey would create inaccuracies,\n\n, a public health and statistics expert, told Africa Check. She is an associate professor at the\n\n\u201cAny ranking based on a non-random sample of 10 (or even 29) will be subject to a great deal of random noise and is not likely to be accurate,\u201d Lesosky said.\n\nWithout a large sample, an online survey would be a poor way to collect commuter data, she said. This was because the sample was \u201cnon-random, meaning only those with an internet connection and interest in the topic will fill in the survey\u201d.\n\nLesosky said traffic congestion was usually measured using indicators like the ratio of cars to people, the average distance travelled and the time spent below a certain speed.\n\n\u201cTo accurately rank cities, one would need to collect quite a lot of [this] data,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople often overestimated the time spent in traffic, Prof Zachary Abiero-Gariy, the dean at the\n\nHe suggested Nairobi both review its land use and current radial road layout \u2013 where all the main transport routes flow into the city centre \u2013 and improve its public transport.\n\n\n\n Other attempts to rank Nairobi\u2019s traffic have also run into data trouble. In 2018, the analysis firm ranked Nairobi 186th of 231 cities in its survey. Although the survey considered traffic jams, it did not publish a specific traffic congestion ranking for Nairobi. \n\n\n\n covered 38 countries in 2017. Its information was drawn from anonymous GPS data provided by major car makers as well as data purchased from other sources, marketing director, Steve Dobson, told Africa Check. But such data on Africa is limited, he said, with South Africa the only country in the region surveyed. A key reason for this is the cost. \n\n\n\n \u201cAlternative data sources require either investment and maintenance of a network of loop car sensors, or a robust network of cameras to provide number plate recognition and analysis,\u201d Dobson explained. \n\n\n\n ranked Nairobi fourth of 20 cities in its . That survey was the most recent, IBM told Africa Check. \n\n\n\n The research was dated and would not be \u201cused to support any current points or policies\u201d, Kal Gyimesi, an executive with the firm, said. Gyimesi said he had \u201crecommended to our communications team that we remove this study from our sites\u201d.\n\nConclusion: No data supports claim Nairobi has the world\u2019s second worst traffic\n\nAs Kenya\u2019s capital city Nairobi explores ways of easing congestion, the media often report that its traffic is among the worst in the world.\n\nA main source of this claim has been a traffic index run by the Serbia-based website Numbeo.com. The site\u2019s owner told Africa Check that its ranking of Nairobi was based on an online survey of only 29 people over three years.\n\nThis sample was too small, an expert said. It was also not randomly selected as only people with an internet connection and an interest in the topic would likely have participated.\n\nComparable data on Nairobi\u2019s traffic remains limited, adding to the city\u2019s headache of finding solutions to the gridlock.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
