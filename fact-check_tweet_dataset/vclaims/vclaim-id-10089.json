It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.\n\nSome media reports quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist.\n\nBut the fake news article\u2019s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a \"domestic situation.\"\n\n\"There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him,\" Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting \"wasn't over religious beliefs.\"\n\nThe fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as \"a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea\" who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter \"was on the DNC payroll,\" in reference to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nFreedumjunkshun aims to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its satire for truth. \"Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,\" its disclaimer reads. \"Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won\u2019t find any of it here.\"\n\nThe fake story was wrong to say that Kelley was on the DNC payroll, and authorities said his religious beliefs do not appear to have been a factor in the shooting.
