The Presidential and National Assembly elections were postponed to February 23, 2019 (a week later) while the Governorship and the State Assembly elections were also postponed to March 9, 2019.\n\nThe announcement was made by the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, at the Commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja citing logistics challenges in some parts of the country.\n\nDespite this wide reportage on postponement, propagators of false news still found \u2018pleasure\u2019 in spreading misinformation to discredit the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nA Nigerian Facebook blog, Dailymail Gist took to its Facebook page at exactly 11:14 a.m. after the election postponement to upload Mr Buhari\u2019s picture with the caption: \u201cBreaking News: Buhari Just Arrived His Unit for Accreditation, Saying He Is Not Aware That The Election Has Been Postponed\u201d\n\nLike every fake report or photo, Dailymail Gist got over 1000 likes, 810 comments and the news was shared by nearly 4000 Facebook users. As part of our duties to correct wrong information, Dubawa did a Google Image Reverse of the picture and it turns out that the original picture was taken far back in 2015 during the presidential election at Buhari\u2019s polling unit in Katsina.\n\nAlso, that same day, a press statement was released by the president and he says \u201cI am deeply disappointed that despite the long notice given and our preparations both locally and internationally, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) postponed the Presidential and National Assembly elections within hours of its commencement\u2026I have decided to move back to Abuja to ensure that the 14.00 hrs meeting called by INEC with all stakeholders is successful.\u201c\n\nAlthough the president had traveled to Daura to vote, he was well aware of the election postponement and did not go to the polling unit as claimed!\n\nIn 2015, the original picture which was taken by Ben Curtis read: \u201cOpposition candidate Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (centre) arrives to validate his voting card using a finger print reader, prior to casting his vote later in the day in his home town of Daura, Nigeria. Saturday, March 28, 2015\u201c\n\nThis looks very much like a case of disinformation (deliberate propagating of false information with an intent to cause harm), and is out-rightly FALSE!", "lang": "en"}
