The posts included a screenshot of a segment from an Australian breakfast television show as evidence for the claim. But the claim is false; an Australian legal expert said as of August 18, 2020, he was not aware of any legislation that banned discussions of COVID-19 conspiracy theories; the Attorney General's Department also said it was not aware of any legislation banning such discussions; the television show pictured in the posts, Nine Network\u2019s Today Extra, said it had been reporting the results of a viewer poll about conspiracy theorists, rather than a piece of legislation.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook by a New Zealand-based user here on August 17, 2020. The post has been shared more than 750 times.\n\nThe Facebook post includes an image that features the logo of Australian TV network Nine Network on the bottom right-hand corner. It also includes a logo for Nine\u2019s breakfast TV show Today Extra in the bottom left-hand corner. A banner, circled in red at the bottom of the image, reads: \u201cCOVID-19 CONSPIRACY FINE\u201d and \u201c56% OF AUSSIES SAY POLICE SHOULD FINE VIRUS CONSPIRACY THEORISTS\u201d.\n\nThe text superimposed above the image states in part: \u201can entire news segment just played on a breakfast / morning news show on Australian TV, talking about how you could be FINED for discussing \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 around COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption adds: \u201cAussies will be fined if they are found to be talking about conspiracies to do with covid like WTF!\u201d\n\nA similar claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nThe image in the misleading post corresponds to the one-minute 33-second mark of this August 6, 2020, episode of Today Extra. During the episode, the show's hosts David Campbell and Sylvia Jeffreys discussed the results of a viewer poll with two guests. The question posed was: \u201cShould the Police be allowed to fine Australians who intentionally spread chaos-inducing conspiracy theories during a pandemic?\u201d\n\n9News, the news service of Nine Network, also reported on the poll results in this August 5 article titled; \u201cGrowing number of Aussies believe police should be able to fine COVID-19 conspiracy theorists\u201d.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, a Nine spokesperson told AFP the August 6 segment was \u201ctalking about poll results and not something that was before Parliament or being considered by police\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that Australians are able to be fined for discussing Covid-19 conspiracy theories based on the Today Extra segment is false,\u201d the Nine spokesperson said in an email on August 18.\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Eburn at Australian National University\u2019s College of Law told AFP in an August 18 email that he was not aware of any legislation that made it illegal for people to talk about COVID-19 conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cThey could be fined or otherwise dealt with if they promoted an unlawful response to the COVID-19 response, e.g. advocated violence against those enforcing public health orders or conspired with or encouraged others to act in breach of public health orders, but that is not the same thing as \u2018talking about conspiracy theories\u2019,\u201d Associate Professor Eburn said.\n\nIn an email to AFP on August 19, the Attorney General's Department said: \"The Attorney-General\u2019s Department is not aware of any current laws which specifically penalise talking about COVID-19 associated conspiracy theories.\"", "lang": "en"}
