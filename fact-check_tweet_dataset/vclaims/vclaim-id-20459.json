But that doesn\u2019t mean that those claiming these benefits are all better off.\n\nPIP was intended to apply to 20% fewer people than DLA when it was introduced. More people have been awarded PIP than expected, but the Office of Budget Responsibility still predicts it has saved 5% in government spending.\n\nComparisons between the older and newer benefits are tricky because PIP is still being rolled out and the eligibility criteria have changed.\n\nMore people on PIP receive the higher rate of living allowance than those on DLA\n\nThe main non-means tested disability benefit is in the process of changing from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP).\n\nBoth benefits have two main parts: one to help with daily living and one to help with mobility. The criteria for claiming each benefit is different, but people can be eligible for either or both parts, and can get different levels of payment depending on their assessed level of need.\n\nTheresa May is talking about the daily living component of PIP and comparing this to the equivalent part of DLA.\n\nThe highest payment available for help with daily living is \u00a382.30 for both DLA and PIP.\n\nThe categories of \u2018main disabling condition\u2019 are different between the two benefits, so it can be difficult to directly compare them. For example, the DLA data includes a category for \u2018psychoneurosis\u2019, while PIP data separates out anxiety disorders, mood disorders and mixed anxiety and depressive disorders. The data tells us only about the \u2018main\u2019 reason someone has for claiming the benefit. Some people have multiple physical and mental conditions but only one is recorded.\n\nThe criteria for claiming the benefit has also changed.\n\nWe can say that 66% of those claiming PIP mainly for mental health conditions received the higher payment in the most recent data from April 2017. Only 22% of DLA claimants for mental health conditions in May 2013 (when PIP was introduced) received this higher payment.\n\nFewer people are claiming PIP than DLA as the new benefit is still being rolled out. The share of people receiving the higher rate may change as more people move from DLA to PIP. 741,000 people with a mental health condition were claiming DLA in May 2013, and just under two thirds of that number\u2013476,000\u2013were claiming PIP for a mental health condition in April 2017.\n\nHowever people who have been moved from DLA to PIP are more likely to be awarded the higher rate than new claimants. We compared working age people claiming DLA to those claiming PIP as that is the condition for receiving the newer benefit.\n\nFewer than half of those who have moved from DLA to PIP have been given more money than they were receiving under DLA\n\nThe government originally assumed introducing a new assessment would reduce the number of people claiming DLA by 20%. PIP has been introduced more slowly than planned, and the number of people being awarded the higher rates of the benefit has been higher than predicted.\n\nSpending on PIP will be 5% lower by 2017/18 compared to DLA continuing, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility.\n\nOn average 73% of all people moving from DLA and 41% of new people claiming were awarded PIP from April 2016-2017. This suggests that fewer people are eligible for PIP.\n\nWe have older detailed statistics on how people moving from DLA to PIP have been assessed, but they combine the daily living and mobility payments.\n\nWhat we can say is that 193,000 people with mental health conditions were re-assessed between October 2013 and October 2016. 39% were awarded more money, 14% given the same amount, 22% were awarded less money and 25% no longer received the benefit.\n\nSo while more people on the PIP payments may be receiving the higher living allowance, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean claimants with mental health conditions are receiving more money in total under the new form of payment.\n\nAnd the move from DLA to PIP has removed the lower level of living allowance\n\nMoving from DLA to PIP removed the lowest care bracket (\u00a321.80). The Government says that PIP \u201cis designed to focus more support on those who are likely to have a higher level of need, and higher costs associated with their disability\u201d.\n\n24% of all people receiving the lower rate for care under DLA did not qualify for PIP at the assessment stage. 4% were awarded the mobility part of the benefit but not the daily living part.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to compare DLA and PIP because they have different criteria for receiving the higher rate of living allowance\n\nTo receive the higher rate for care under DLA a person had to show they needed:\n\u2022 Frequent attention with bodily functions throughout the day; or continual supervision throughout the day to avoid substantial danger to themselves or others\n\u2022 Prolonged or repeated attention at night in connection with bodily functions; or someone to be awake during the night for a prolonged period or at frequent intervals in order to avoid substantial danger to themselves or others.\n\nThey had to have needed help for at least three months and expect to need it for another six months.\n\nTo receive the \u2018enhanced daily living allowance\u2019 under the new benefit, PIP, a person has to score 12 points from a list of ten areas of daily activities.\n\nFor example, someone with a mental health condition might need:\n\u2022 supervision or assistance to either prepare or cook a simple meal. (4 points)\n\u2022 prompting or assistance to be able to make complex budgeting decisions. (2 points)\n\u2022 supervision, prompting or assistance to be able to manage medication or monitor a health condition. (1 point)\n\u2022 to show they cannot engage with other people due to such engagement causing either \u2013\n\n(i) overwhelming psychological distress to the claimant; or\n\nThey must have had these difficulties for three months and expect them to last for at least nine months.", "lang": "en"}
