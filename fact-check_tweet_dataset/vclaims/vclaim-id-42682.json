In terms of numbers, U.S. hunters may be able to stack up against the world\u2019s military units (more on that later), but owning a hunting license is not the same as being trained for combat in the military. Furthermore, this comparison doesn\u2019t take into account that world armies typically have access to more ammunition, equipment, planes, tanks, submarines, and military-grade weapons than your average hunter.\n\nWhile this meme may be comparing apples to oranges (or maybe a better analogy, shotguns to drones), let\u2019s take a look at the numbers.\n\nThe Number of Total Military Members in the World\u2019s 10 Largest Armies? Approximately 25 Million\n\nAccording to The Military Balance for 2018 from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, China has the world\u2019s largest army in terms of active members, with a little over 2 million soldiers. The United States is third (1.3 million) and Egypt is 10th, with just under 500,000. The 10 largest armies in the world have about 10 million active duty members combined. This number jumps to over 25 million when reserve members are included, and close to 50 million if we add in paramilitary members.\n\nThis meme does not specify the criteria it used to count members in the world\u2019s armies. For the purposes of this article, we\u2019ll use the number of total members (active and reserve) in the world\u2019s militaries, which amounts to approximately 25 million.\n\nSo how does that compare to the number of hunting licenses sold in the U.S.? According to the US Fish And Wildlife Service, 33,476,898 resident hunting licenses, tags, permits, and stamps were sold in 2018. Another 3.5 million licenses, tags, permits and stamps were sold to non-residents, totaling approximately 37 million hunting licenses sold.\n\nWhile 37 million hunting licenses is indeed more than 25 million military members, again, as we noted earlier, this is a misleading comparison. A single hunter, for example, may possess multiple hunting licenses.\n\nThe Number of Hunters in the United States? Approximately 15 Million\n\nHunting licenses are issued by the state. If a hunter travels from one state to another, that person must purchase (at least) two hunting licenses. The figure cited above also includes \u201ctags,\u201d which many states require for each \u201cbig game\u201d animal harvested. A federal duck stamp is also required to hunt migratory birds.\n\nThe U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service reported in 2018 that while there were approximately 37 million licenses, tags, permits and stamps sold, there were only approximately 15 million paid hunting-license holders.\n\nOutdoor Life Magazine reported in October 2019 that the number of hunters in the U.S. peaked in 1982 \u201cwhen nearly 17 million hunters purchased 28.3 million licenses\u201d but since then has been in a steady decline.\n\n\u201cIf you watch the demographic shift of license purchases by age, what you find is that when people hit their late 60s and early 70s, regardless of how much you incentivize them, they stop hunting and fishing,\u201d says Matt Dunfee, director of special programs at the Wildlife Management Institute (WMI). He\u2019s been studying hunter recruitment and retention for the last decade. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. They just get too old.\u201d The baby boomer bubble is going to burst, but boomers aren\u2019t entirely to blame for this mess. Hunters should have been recruiting enough new license buyers to, if not increase ranks, keep them stable. So what gives? Shifting demographics play a big part. Hunters have historically been white men; today, more than 90 percent of hunters are Caucasian, and more than 70 percent are male. But soon\u2014by 2044, according to U.S. Census projections\u2014Caucasians will make up less than half the U.S. population. Plus, the rural population is staying relatively stable, while urban populations are increasing.\n\nIn sum, the number of hunters in the United States (about 15 million) is slightly above the number of active military members (about 10 million), and slightly below the total number of military members (about 25 million) in the world\u2019s 10 largest armies. So what does this tell us about the capabilities of hunters to form a militia in order to fight against government armies? Perhaps not much, but it\u2019s (apparently) something to think about.", "lang": "en"}
