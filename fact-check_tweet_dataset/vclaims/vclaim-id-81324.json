So we wanted to set the record straight on the DOJ\u2019s findings, especially after The Washington Post\u2019s opinion writer Jonathan Capehart wrote that it was \u201cbuilt on a lie.\u201d From time to time, we retroactively check statements as new information becomes available. In this case, the Justice Department has concluded that Wilson acted out of self-defense, and was justified in killing Brown.\n\nIn November 2014, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson after finding that witness reports did not match up with evidence. Other witnesses recanted their original accounts or changed them, calling their veracity into question. In particular, the grand jury could not confirm the \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d narrative the way it was told after the shooting. By then, however, the phrase had taken on a message of its own.\n\nSome witnesses who claimed they saw Brown\u2019s hands raised had testimonies that were inconsistent with physical and forensic evidence. Some admitted to federal investigators they felt pressured to retell the narrative that was being spread after Brown\u2019s shooting. Others recanted their initial testimonies saying they had heard it through media reports or via social media. A few witnesses said Brown had his hands out to his side with his palms up, as if saying \u201cWhat?\u201d Others said Brown\u2019s hands were not raised, as he was charging at Wilson. A few said Brown\u2019s hands were \u201cballed up.\u201d\n\nInvestigators narrowed down the \u201chands up\u201d claim to a witness \u2013 Witness 128 \u2013 who had told his family and neighbors his inaccurate version of events as crowds gathered minutes and hours after the shooting, the report says. Another witness could not confirm what she saw because of her poor vision, but she heard a man running around the apartments along the street where Wilson shot Brown. The man was saying something to the effect of, \u201cThe police shot my friend and his hands were up.\u201d The witness said that \u201cquickly became the narrative on the street, and to her frustration, people used it both as an excuse to riot and to create a \u2018block party\u2019 atmosphere.\u201d\n\nInvestigators tracked down several individuals who, via the aforementioned media, claimed to have witnessed Wilson shooting Brown as Brown held his hands up in clear surrender. All of these purported witnesses, upon being interviewed by law enforcement, acknowledged that they did not actually witness the shooting, but rather repeated what others told them in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \u2026 Witness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence, are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies, or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence. In contrast, Wilson\u2019s account of Brown\u2019s actions, if true, would establish that the shootings were not objectively unreasonable under the relevant Constitutional standards governing an officer\u2019s use of deadly force.\n\nIn August 2014, after Brown\u2019s death, members of the Congressional Black Caucus delivered speeches about law enforcement\u2019s excessive use of force against black youth. In December 2014, members again spoke about Ferguson killing and those of three others killed by police between August and Dec. 1, 2014: Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Akai Gurley in Brooklyn and Eric Garner in Staten Island. Four members of Congress\u2013 New York Democrats Hakeem Jeffries and Yvette Clarke, and Texas Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee and Al Green \u2014 raised their hands during their speeches in solidarity with the \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d movement. The grand jury had questioned this characterization by then.\n\u2022 None Clarke: \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot. \u2026 I first want to once again offer my condolence to the family of Michael Brown, whose efforts to secure justice on behalf of their son were undermined by the decision of the grand jury. The killing of Michael Brown, and attacks by the Ferguson Police Department on protesters, demonstrate an assumption that young women and men who are African American are inherently suspicious \u2014 a false assumption with deadly consequences.\u201d\n\u2022 None Green: \u201cThis has become the new symbol, a new statement \u2014 a statement wherein people around the country now are calling to the attention of those who don\u2019t quite understand that this is a movement that will not dissipate. It will not evaporate. It\u2019s a movement that is going to continue because young people \u2014 a new generation \u2014 has decided that they\u2019re going to engage themselves in the liberation movement.\u201d\n\u2022 None Jeffries: \u201c\u2018Hands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u2019 is a rallying cry of people all across America who are fed up with police violence \u2014 in community, after community, after community, fed up with police violence in Ferguson, in Brooklyn, in Cleveland, in Oakland, in cities and counties and rural communities all across America.\u201d\n\u2022 None Lee: \u201cI also admire the young St. Louis Rams players who raised their hands, to be able to share in the dignity of those young, peaceful protesters. If we don\u2019t affirm non-violence, then who will?\u201d\n\nThe same day the DOJ released the shooting report, it also published the results of its investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. This report highlighted systemic exploitation and racial profiling of black residents in Ferguson. Jeffries said that report underscored the importance of the message of \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d He said: \u201cThe issue of dealing with the police use of excessive force, often directed at unarmed African American men, in the absence of subsequent accountability through the criminal justice system, remains just as important today as it was the day before the Department of Justice report was filed.\u201d\n\nJustin Hansford, St. Louis University professor who has been organizing legal and community advocacy after Brown\u2019s death, said the DOJ report on Brown\u2019s shooting did not prove that Brown never had his hands up at any point during his confrontation with Wilson. The DOJ could not find evidence to conclusively say that he did, which is an important legal distinction, he said.\n\nHansford said his Facebook profile photo remains an image of \u201cHands up\u201d because the message is consistent regardless of the positioning of Brown\u2019s hands: \u201cI don\u2019t feel any way that I was somehow duped or tricked or that my picture was based on a lie. I think it is a very symbolic gesture that really speaks to the experiences of a lot of us, a lot of youth of color.\u201d\n\nWe care about facts, how they\u2019re used and the context in which the facts are portrayed. In this case, it is important for us to note that the initial \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d chant after Brown\u2019s shooting has evolved into a message that is no longer connected solely to the Ferguson event. A series of other fatal shootings by police occurred following Brown\u2019s death, and the \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d came to symbolize the need to hold law enforcement accountable. And the DOJ report on Ferguson Police Department confirmed the agency systemically profiled black residents.\n\nBut we also care about setting the record straight. Investigators have overwhelmingly rejected witness accounts that Brown had his hands up in a surrender before being shot execution-style. The DOJ has concluded Wilson did not know whether Brown was armed, acted out of self-defense and was justified in killing Brown. The majority of witnesses told federal investigators that the initial claims that Brown\u2019s hands were up were not accurate. \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d did not happen in Brown\u2019s killing, and it is a characterization that deserves Four Pinocchios. Politicians should step carefully if they try to highlight this expression in the future.", "lang": "en"}
