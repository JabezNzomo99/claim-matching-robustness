In his book, \u2018Stories from Indian Football\u2019, journalist Jaydeep Basu has also quoted a statement from BD Chatterjee, Indian football coach.\n\nChatterjee said, \u201cthey had boots with them in case they prone too yielding in which case they would wear them but they prefer to play in their bare feet\u201d.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hindu, this statement was given to Reuters during one of the pre-Olympics friendly matches that India played against the Metropolitan Police on 16 July 1948.\n\nAlt News contacted Basu to confirm the reference of this quote. In a conversation with Alt News, Basu said, \u201cIn one of the chapters in my book, which dealt with barefoot football, I had cited a Reuters report to quote BD Chatterjee. Whatever you have been hearing about the rumours that they (Indians) didn\u2019t have boots to play, it\u2019s absolutely rubbish. Indians used to play barefoot those days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey played the 1948 Olympics, 1951 Asian games and 1952 Olympics barefoot. After the 1952 Olympics where India was beaten by Yugoslavia 10-1, All India Football Federation realised that they should use boots. In India, nobody used to play in boots except for a few. Also, the FIFA regulation came later which said that anyone who has to play International football has to play in boots. Even in 1911, when Mohun Bagan won the historic IFA shield, all but one of the players were barefoot. Indians used to play barefoot that\u2019s all. If they can travel to London, they can also buy boots. It is simple logic,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
