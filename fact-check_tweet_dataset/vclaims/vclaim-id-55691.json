Press Information Bureau Fact Check, the fact-checking branch from the government of India has unequivocally rubbished the claim on Twitter.\n\n\"Messages circulating on Social Media reading 'WhatsApp info regarding \u221a tick marks' is #FAKE.#PIBFactCheck : No! The Government is doing no such thing. The message is #FAKE,\" read the tweet.\n\nOn the WhatsApp's website, there is no mention of any red tick or three ticks anywhere. The website contains a description of all its features and lists all the read receipts explaining each checkmark.\n\nThere is a separate section called 'Checking Read Receipts' which lists just three read receipts.\n\nAccording to this section, the first one shows one checkmark which means message successfully sent. The second one shows two checkmarks which means that the message has been successfully delivered to the recipient's phone. The third one shows two blue ticks which means that the recipient has read the message.\n\n\n\nThere is also a special mention for group chats which says that the second checkmark appears when all the participants have read the message and the blue checkmarks appear when all the participants in the group have read your message.\n\nAll the messages on the app are secured with end to end encryption. Which essentially means that the platform will prevent anybody from reading or secretly modifying the data being shared other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender and nobody else can decrypt them. The data is stored in an encrypted format.\n\nWhatsApp is limiting frequently forwarded messages to one chat time in attempts to curb the spread of COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nAccording to a report by Hindustan Times, the instant messaging application has said the latest change to this feature comes as a part of the company's efforts to curb misinformation on COVID-19.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Viral WhatsApp Forward Wrongly Claims No Citizen Is Allowed To Post Any Coronavirus Update", "lang": "en"}
