All 28 female players sued the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) \u2014 their employer \u2014 in U.S. District Court in March, alleging they are paid less than the men and are provided with less support, despite their consistent outstanding performance. The lawsuit also argues the team\u2019s success has \u201ctranslated into substantial revenue generation and profits\u201d for USSF and \u201cduring the period relevant to this case, the WNT earned more in profit and/or revenue than the MNT.\u201d\n\nThere was a long-standing gap between revenue generated by the men and women, but that has disappeared in recent years. The women\u2019s team contributed close or more than half of the federation\u2019s revenue from games since fiscal 2016. Overall, from fiscal 2016 to 2018, the women\u2019s games generated about $900,000 more revenue than the men\u2019s games. In the year following the 2015 World Cup win, women\u2019s games generated $1.9 million more than the men\u2019s games. And in recent years, the men\u2019s revenue tally also includes the fees that opposing teams pay in order to play the United States.", "lang": "en"}
