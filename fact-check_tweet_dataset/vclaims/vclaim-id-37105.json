No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on May 24, 2019 titled \"Governor's Conference Votes 32-18 to Impeach Nancy Pelosi\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe United States Constitution calls for three steps to remove a Speaker of the House from power. First, the White House has to file impeachment papers in court, which RUDY GIULIANI DID already. Next, the Conference of American Governors has to enter a supermajority vote of \"no confidence\" in the public record. This morning, that vote was entered as 2 Democrats joined 30 Republicans in securing the needed numbers. The vote will be recorded by the Secretary of State and delivered to the Senate for the third and final step in the impeachment process. New Hampshire Lieutenant Governor Art Tubolls said it was \"awe-inspiring\" to be a part of such a historic event.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere is a satire disclaimer in the very thumbnail image of the post and there are several more on the page itself. The article was posted under the category \"The Fictional Impeachment of Nancy Pelosi\". The name \"Art Tubolls\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the owner of the site. And of course members of Congress are not subject to impeachment. So every reasonable person should understand that the story was just a joke.\n\nHowever on June 3, 2019 links to the story were posted on several pro-Trump Facebook groups and the article went viral again because many people believed it was real.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up. That happened promptly with this story too, it was copied by a Macedonian-run fake news site and presented as real news:\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pelosi Did NOT Insult Melania, Did NOT Call Her 'The Hired Help Wife'\n\u2022 Fake News: Ocasio-Cortez And Omar Did NOT Vow To Remove Senior's 'Entitlements', Social Security/Medicare\n\u2022 Fake News: Ocasio-Cortez Does NOT Want to Take Guns Away From Cops\n\u2022 Fake News: Pelosi's Office Did NOT Spend More on Alcohol Last Year Than Food\n\u2022 Fake News: Robert DeNiro Did NOT Lose $40 Million Reunion Contract, Did NOT Blame Trump", "lang": "en"}
