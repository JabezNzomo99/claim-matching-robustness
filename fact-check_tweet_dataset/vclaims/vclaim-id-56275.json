In the tweet dated Oct 20, 2015, he addressed Chinese President Xi Jinping as his \u2018boss\u2019.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be fake.\n\nFirstly, we ran a keyword search on Twitter and did not find any such tweets by Sitaram Yechury.\n\nWe then noticed that he joined Twitter in October 2015. We checked on a website, Twitter Join Date, and found that he joined Twitter on October 29, 2015.\n\nOnce, we knew the date, we ran another advance search on Twitter to check all the tweets done in October and found that his first tweet was a congratulatory message to Bidya Devi Bhandari, who took the office as Nepal\u2019s President on October 28, 2015.\n\nWe also noted that the alignment of the tweet in question is different than the original tweets.\n\nThus, based on the above information, we can conclude that the tweet in question is morphed and fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
