He shared an eye-popping statistic: Since the shooting at Sandy Hook, there has been one school shooting on average per week. Is that really the case \u2014 that there have been somewhere around 128 school shootings since December 2014?\n\nIncidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented by the press or confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included. Over the course of two years, we identified a total of three incidents in which a private citizen discharged a firearm at a school that was ultimately determined to be self-defense \u2014 February 4, 2013 at Martin Luther King, Jr., High School in Detroit, MI, January 30, 2014 at Eastern Florida State College, and April 7, 2014 at Eastern New Mexico University. These three incidents were not included in the analysis.\n\nThe Fact Checker analyzed each case included in the updated list. Of the 126 cases, 25 were attempted or committed suicides. The majority of the shootings on this list were targeted attacks against individuals stemming from altercations or ongoing conflicts. Below is a sample of non-suicide incidents included in the list that shows a range of the type of events:\n\nThere were at least 10 incidents that were similar to shooting in Newtown, with one shooter opening fire with the intent to kill or injure multiple victims. A separate incident in June 2015 involved a couple that shot and killed a cat on a school campus, but had told law enforcement officials they would have shot students if it were \u201cGod\u2019s will.\u201d We did not include that in the list of 10 incidents.\n\nIn the period between 2000 and 2013, the FBI identified 160 active shooter incidents, where one or more shooters \u201cactively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.\u201d It used this definition to describe instances like Sandy Hook or the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. This study did not include gang or drug violence or other shootings that did not generally put other people in peril (e.g., accidental discharge of a firearm in a school building or a person committing suicide in a parking lot).\n\nKen Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, said he has not seen an authoritative data source or universal definition on \u201cschool shootings.\u201d Trump noted the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 annual \u201cIndicators of School Crime and Safety\u201d report, which defines School Associated Violent Deaths as \u201ca homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Murphy believes that schools are no place for deadly weapons. Any and all gunfire in or around the classroom is unacceptable and must be stopped. Others can quibble over what amount of gunfire in a school they want to call a \u2018shooting,\u2019 but Sen. Murphy remains focused on stopping such events altogether,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThere are many ways to define school shooting. But applying the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, as is the standard at The Fact Checker, it is difficult to see how many of the incidents included in Everytown\u2019s list \u2014 such as suicide in a car parked on a campus or a student accidentally shooting himself when emptying his gun and putting it away in his car before school \u2014 would be considered a \u201cschool shooting\u201d in the context of Sandy Hook.\n\nLawmakers have a responsibility to check out the facts in the reports they use, especially ones that come from advocacy groups. If they are aware there are definitions that are disputed, or that are defined in other ways depending on who uses them, it is incumbent on lawmakers to clarify exactly what they are talking about and not mislead the public. In particular, lawmakers should rely more on official government statistics, such as from the FBI, rather than misleading metrics cobbled together by interest groups.\n\nWe wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. But this is a definition of \u201cschool shooting\u201d that was widely disputed a year ago, and lawmakers need to present information \u2014 especially for such a controversial topic as gun control \u2014 in a clear, responsible and accurate way. Murphy\u2019s failure to do so tipped the rating to Four.", "lang": "en"}
