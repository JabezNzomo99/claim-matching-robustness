Nathan Deal in the Nov. 4 general election has previously voiced concern about the shrinking income of the middle class.\n\nAt a press conference in January, when 2012 figures were the most recent available, Carter said the income of an average Georgia family, adjusted for inflation, is about $6,000 less than it was 10 years ago.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia rated that statement True, albeit on the conservative side.\n\nCarter was relying on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe data showed that the median household income in Georgia fell by an estimated $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 in 2012, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nNationally, in that same period, the median household income dropped from $54,127 to $51,017, or $3,110, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s data.\n\nCarter\u2019s new ad cites a $6,500, 10-year drop in household income. That\u2019s even more on target with the Census Bureau data.\n\nStill, we decided to go a little further since, after Carter\u2019s ad aired, the Census Bureau came out with new data for 2013.\n\nThe middle-class income number also provides one more measure for trying to assess what\u2019s going on with Georgia\u2019s economy. It can be a cloudy picture.\n\nDeal says nearly 300,000 jobs have been created in his tenure. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says Georgia\u2019s unemployment rate jumped from 6.9 percent in April to 8.1 percent in August.\n\nSo what\u2019s the latest info on median household income?\n\nIn the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s just-released 2013 American Community Survey, Georgia had a median household income of $47,829 in 2013, inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nThe state ranked 34th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, with Maryland the highest at $72,483, Mississippi the lowest at $37,963.\n\nThe survey said the median household income for the nation was $52,250 \u2014 $4,421 higher than Georgia\u2019s.\n\nThe numbers, however, showed metro Atlanta\u2019s median household income at $55,733. That is above the national average. And more than half of all Georgians live in or near metro Atlanta.\n\nMedian household income is down for metro Atlanta and Georgia since 2010, the first year after the government says the recession ended and the year Deal was elected governor.\n\nMetro Atlanta\u2019s median household income was $56,850 for 2010, and in inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia\u2019s was $49,412, according to the survey. (Note: Some estimates in the American Community Survey differ from prior estimates.)\n\nIn inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia\u2019s median household income was $47,536 in 2011 and $47,811 in 2012.\n\nWesley Tharpe, a policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said income and wages have been basically stagnant in the state for the past two to three years.\n\n\"What we saw with the Great Recession, starting around 2007, was employment and income just really fell through the floor due to the collapse of the housing market, the collapse of the stock market,\" Tharpe said. \"Those really hurt Georgia because of our reliance on the housing industry and construction jobs.\"\n\nSince that crash, the economy has been gradually moving in the right direction, he said.\n\n\"But incomes and the ability for families to make a living and make ends meet is really lagging behind,\" Tharpe said. \"We haven\u2019t really seen that much growth since we hit that floor.\"\n\nIn summary, Carter\u2019s ad says middle-class income has dropped $6,500 in 10 years.\n\nHe bases this on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That shows Georgia\u2019s median household income, in inflation-adjusted dollars, fell by $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 to 2012.", "lang": "en"}
