The images show Policemen holding posters of \u2018NO NRC NO CAA\u2019. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of those images.\n\n\n\nFact: The images in the post are photoshopped. The original images do not show Policemen holding placards of \u2018NO NRC NO CAA\u2019. They are from the protests by Delhi Police in November, against the attack by lawyers on police personnel at the Tis Hazari Court complex. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the above images in the post are subjected to Google Reverse Image Search technique, they are found to be related to Delhi Police protests, in November, against the attack by lawyers on a few police personnel at the Tis Hazari Court complex. But those images do not show Police holding placards of \u2018NO NRC NO CAB\u2019.\n\nFrom a November 2019 article of \u2018The Hindu\u2019, it can be found the image is that of Delhi Police officers holding placards at the Police headquarters (New Delhi) while protesting the attack by lawyers on Police. In that image, it can be seen that the placards do not have \u2018NO NRC NO CAB\u2019 on them. Another article of \u2018The Hindu\u2019 which reported about that incident had a video of that protests with the above photo as a thumbnail and it can be seen here.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018LiveMint\u2019, the image was found to be that of Police personnel displaying placards during a protest against the repeated incidents of alleged violence against them by lawyers. In that image too, it can be seen that the posters do not have \u2018NO NRC NO CAB\u2019 on them.\n\nTo conclude, the images of Policemen holding placards of \u2018NO NRC NO CAA\u2019 are photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
