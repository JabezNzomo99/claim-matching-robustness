In a post titled \u201cGlobal Warming Disaster,\u201d Pence wrote: \u201cGlobal warming is a myth.\u201d\n\nBut more recently, on Sept. 27, Pence said \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that human activity has \u201csome impact on climate.\u201d\n\nKaine has made similar claims on at least eight occasions between Oct. 10 and Nov. 2.\n\nIn one instance, at a campaign rally in Davidson, North Carolina, on Oct. 12, however, Kaine correctly used the past tense, claiming, \u201cMike Pence said climate change is a myth.\u201d\n\nBut in many other cases, Kaine misleadingly claimed Pence currently says climate change is a myth.\n\nFor example, on Nov. 2 in Dubuque, Iowa, Kaine said, \u201cDonald Trump says, and this is a quote, \u2018Climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese.\u2019 And his running mate, Mike Pence, says, \u2018It\u2019s a myth.'\u201d\n\nTrump did tweet on Nov. 6, 2012: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,\u201d but later said it was a joke, as we wrote in our report on the first presidential debate. However, Trump also has a record of calling global warming a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nIn an allusion to the 12-step program designed to help people recover from alcohol and other addictions, Kaine went on to say that the \u201cfirst step is you have to admit you have a problem.\u201d Kaine added that, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve a problem if you don\u2019t admit you have a problem.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pence has acknowledged \u2014 on at least one occasion \u2014 that humans are affecting the climate.\n\nPence told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Sept. 27, \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate.\u201d He added, \u201cDonald Trump and I say, let\u2019s follow the science, but for heaven\u2019s sakes let\u2019s not go rushing into the kind of restrictions on our economy that are putting Americans out of work and, frankly, are driving jobs out of this country.\u201d\n\nBut Trump still doesn\u2019t \u201cfollow the science.\u201d\n\nTrump told Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly on July 26 he \u201cprobably did\u201d call climate change a hoax, adding \u201cthey\u2019re saying [climate change is] man-made and I say it could have a minor impact, but nothing to what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota on Sept. 27 that Trump believes that \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d are \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d and not man-made.\n\nWhen we asked Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for evidence more recent than 2000 to back-up Kaine\u2019s claim, spokesperson Josh Schwerin pointed us to other past instances where Pence has questioned the validity of climate change \u2014 the most recent instance occurring in 2014.\n\nOn Feb. 21, 2014, Pence told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd that he didn\u2019t know if humans\u2019 role in climate change \u201cis a resolved issue in science today.\u201d Todd then responded, \u201ca lot of scientists out there\u201d do believe humans are impacting the climate. Pence then said, \u201cI know we\u2019re talking about climate change. Just a few years ago we were talking about global warming. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of warming lately. I remember back in the \u201970s we were talking about the coming Ice Age.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve addressed all three of Pence\u2019s claims before.\n\nFirst, when Sen. Ted Cruz similarly claimed in January, \u201cnone of the alarmists say \u2018global warming\u2019 anymore \u2014 now it\u2019s \u2018climate change,\u2019\u201d we found that to be inaccurate. We explained, \u201cScientists still use both terms, but tend to use \u2018climate change\u2019 more often because, in addition to warming, it refers to phenomena such as sea-level rise and changes in precipitation patterns.\u201d\n\nSecond, in March 2016 and November 2015, we addressed Rep. Lamar Smith\u2019s claim that data show there\u2019s been a \u201chalt\u201d in global warming \u2014 it\u2019s false. Some research has found that there\u2019s been a warming \u201cslowdown,\u201d and other research suggested there hasn\u2019t been. Still, no research supports \u201ca halt in global warming,\u201d as we wrote.\n\nThird, we wrote about the \u201cglobal cooling\u201d myth in March 2015, when Cruz cited an article on the topic published in Newsweek in 1975. That article did warn of \u201cominous signs\u201d of a \u201ccooling world,\u201d but it has been criticized since then \u2013 including by its author, Peter Gwynne.\n\nWriting for Inside Science in 2014, Gwynne wrote that \u201cwhile the hypotheses described in that original story seemed right at the time, climate scientists now know that they were seriously incomplete. Our climate is warming \u2014 not cooling, as the original story suggested.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, there was no scientific consensus in the 1970s about global cooling when Gwynne wrote his story in 1975, but today there is scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is real.\n\nRegardless of Pence\u2019s past remarks, he more recently has admitted that humans play a role in climate change. However, Pence and his running mate have outlined no policies designed to specifically address climate change, and, in fact, the GOP ticket would undo steps President Obama has taken to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nFor more information on both the Democratic and Republican candidates\u2019 positions and policies regarding climate change, please see our article, \u201cThe Candidates on Climate Change.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
