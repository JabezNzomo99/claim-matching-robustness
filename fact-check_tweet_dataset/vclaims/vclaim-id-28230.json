As per IPC 233, if a girl is suspected to be raped or getting raped, then she has a supreme right to kill that person or harm that person as dangerously as she can and girl won\u2019t be blamed for murder\u2019. Let\u2019s check to what extent the information in the message is true.\n\n\n\nClaim: Modi\u2019s government has passed a new law \u2018IPC Section 233\u2019, that allows a girl to kill rapists. Fact: Modi\u2019s government hasn\u2019t passed any new law which allows a girl to kill rapists. \u2018IPC Section 233\u2019 mentioned in the message has nothing to do with self defence provisions available to a girl in case of rape. That section deals with \u2018Making or selling instrument for counterfeiting coin\u2019. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched if the Modi\u2019s government has passed any law that allows a girl to kill rapists, no such law was found to be enacted by the Central government. In that message, it is mentioned about IPC (Indian Penal Code) 233, but in the Indian Penal Code that section deals with \u2018Making or selling instrument for counterfeiting coin\u2019. So, \u2018IPC Section 233\u2019 has nothing to do with self-defence provisions available to a girl in case of rape.\n\n\n\nA similar message was found to have been shared in 2012, in the context of the Delhi gangrape incident and it is again now being shared in the aftermath of Hyderabad veterinary doctor Disha\u2019s rape incident.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, Modi\u2019s government hasn\u2019t passed any new law that allows a girl to kill rapists. IPC 233 is regarding \u2018offences related to coins and government stamps\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
