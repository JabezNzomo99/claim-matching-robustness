(That\u2019s Mostly False.) Bernie Sanders said that \"40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.\" (That\u2019s False.)\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic state Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro recently tweeted statistics that emphasize America\u2019s obsession with guns.\n\n\"The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership,\" Harrison tweeted on Feb. 15. She has about 4,000 Twitter followers.\n\nShe continued: \"We must change the gun culture to gun violence prevention. NC Dems have filed comprehensive gun safety bills repeatedly since the Sandy Hook tragedy w/zero movement.\"\n\nShe\u2019s roughly correct about the United States accounting for 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Experts agree that Americans have more guns than citizens of any other country in the world.\n\nBut, globally speaking, is Harrison right about the United States\u2019 share of gun ownership?\n\nShe cited a story on Vox.com \u2013 \"America\u2019s gun problem, explained in 5 facts\" \u2013 as the source for her tweet. Vox, for its part, cites a 2007 study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey.\n\n\"... in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people,\" the writer, German Lopez, explained.\n\n\"Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms,\" Lopez wrote.\n\nThe Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to \"roughly 35-50 percent\" of the world\u2019s civilian-owned guns.\n\nLopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range.\n\n\"It's pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range,\" he said. \"So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That's with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it's just a shorthand for what the research finds.\"\n\nThe Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study \"Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries,\" published in 2016.\n\nThe Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that\u2019s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments. The project compiles data using a \"worldwide network\" of researchers.\n\nLankford agreed with Lopez\u2019s methodology. If you take the survey\u2019s average total of civilian firearms in the U.S. (270 million) and compare that with the survey\u2019s average total globally (645 million), you get 41.8 percent.\n\nA 2009 National Institute of Justice report found the number of civilian-owned guns in the United States to be about 310 million, but didn't provide comparable global data.\n\nPew Research Center, one of the world\u2019s leading nonpartisan research firms, recently published a study on guns in America that found 42 percent of Americans live in a household with a gun. But the center hasn\u2019t collected data from other countries, \"so we can\u2019t compare our US gun data to the rest of the world,\" spokeswoman Haley Nolan said.\n\nGovernments don\u2019t track firearms across the board. And many surveys rely on people to self-report guns.\n\n\"We only have a rough guess of what there is in the U.S. We have no idea how many guns are in South America,\" said Philip J. Cook, professor of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the book \"Gun Violence: The Real Costs.\" South America has a lot of guns that were bought underground, he said.\n\nDavid Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University and author of the book \"Private Guns, Public Health,\" agreed that global estimates are squishy.\n\n\"It\u2019s very, very hard,\" Hemenway said. The best way to estimate the number of firearms in each country would be to have every country track guns that are bought and sold, he said. \"Even then, you only get the legal guns.\"\n\nThat said, he thinks Harrison\u2019s claim is generally accurate compared to other estimates.\n\n\"That sort of number is thrown around all the time,\" Hemenway said. \"It\u2019s pretty high validity. This seems to be in the ballpark of the figures I\u2019ve seen.\"\n\nHarrison said that the United States has approximately 5 percent of the world's population and 42 percent of civilian gun ownership. Those numbers are based on a study that\u2019s now 10 years old. And experts say tracking guns is very difficult. But Harrison\u2019s claim is on roughly par with the information available. We rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
