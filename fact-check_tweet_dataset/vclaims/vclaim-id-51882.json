Besides, the coronavirus referred to in the referenced article was not SARSCov2. More so, the pH attributed to the fruits by the author, suggesting they were alkaline was wrong; our findings show that they are acidic.\n\nRecently, Dubawa came across a viral message on WhatsApp, which claimed that the pH of coronavirus is between 5.5 and 8.5. It further referred to a study quoted, \u201cjournal of virology published in April 1991, Page 1961\u201d. The message also listed several fruits with a pH range that suggests it can neutralise the activities of coronavirus in the body.\n\npH or Potential of Hydrogen is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale of 0-14; where seven represents as neutral and figures lower are acidic while higher values are alkaline.\n\nFurthermore, in humans, the blood is the solution that regulates the acidity and alkalinity of the body, thereby maintaining a pH balance with normal blood having a pH scale of 7.40.\n\nIt is a large family group of viruses scientifically known as Coronaviridae causing illnesses ranging from cold to severe diseases. They are responsible for two human conditions \u2013 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Similarly, the latest disease caused by this group known as COVID-19 is the current ongoing pandemic.\n\nFirstly, Dubawa initial checks revealed the author (source of the claim) misappropriated information. We found that the referenced journal \u201cRESEARCH: JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY, APRIL 1991, PAGE 1916\u201d, titled \u201cAlteration of the pH Dependence of Coronavirus-Induced Cell Fusion: Effect of Mutations in the Spike Glycoprotein\u201d. As it turns out, the article published by the American Society of Microbiology and authored by one Thomas M. Gallagher had nothing to do with the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn the matter of the research article, the paper, in truth, focused on coronavirus, albeit a different type- Mouse Hepatitis Virus type 4 (MHV4). Still, it did not refer to and was certainly not about the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 that caused the current pandemic. Further, while the study in its first sentence mentioned pH, it was alluding to the pH of the infected host cell and not the pH of coronavirus -MHV4.\n\nWorse still, not only does the claim refer to a different type of coronavirus (MHV4 not COVID-19), but the statement above shows that one cannot measure pH in isolation. What do we mean by this? To ascertain the pH of a material, it has to be in a medium (a solution). And for the case of a virus, it needs a living host to survive to fulfil this measurement.\n\nFurthermore, Dubawa\u2019s investigation found that the list of fruits the author suggested will neutralise the acidity of COVID-19 was wrong! A publication by Clemson University and the United States Food and Drug Administration shows the accurate values we incorporated in the table below:\n\nIncidentally, this table shows that all fruits the author displayed as alkaline is, acidic, save for dandelion. This revelation further negates what the chain message propagates. Besides, garlic with the scientific name of Allium Sativum is botanically classified as a vegetable, not as a fruit.\n\nMeanwhile, there are no official values for Dandelion. However, some research does suggest that Taraxacum officinale (otherwise called Priest\u2019s crown) thrives in a highly acidic to slightly alkaline soil, i.e. pH level 4.2 to 8.3. While some studies suggest Dandelion to be alkaline for its acid neutralising properties, its pH cannot be 22.7pH. This value- 22.7 greatly exceeds the pH max range of 14!\n\nCoronavirus does not have its own pH\n\nFurther, Dubawa sought expert advice for added verification. David Olaleye, professor of virology at the University of Ibadan told Dubawa that generally, viruses do not have pH, and the same thing applies to coronavirus:\n\nProfessor Oyeleye also warns against depending on such information to venture into the prevention of coronavirus as it can lead to some other health complications as two people cannot have the same pH level at the same moment:\n\nIn summary, our best bet is to continually follow the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO). This sentiment was also shared by David Olayele and Oyewale Tomori, the professors of virology who spoke to Dubawa and AfricaCheck.", "lang": "en"}
