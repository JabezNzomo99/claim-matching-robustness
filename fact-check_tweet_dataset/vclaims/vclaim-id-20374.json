Local spend is required to meet the requirements of South Africa\u2019s\n\nThe South African government\u2019s policy of broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) aims to\n\nhave been set to increase the participation of black people in the\n\nEnterprises doing business with government or an organ of state are required to be compliant and verify their level of transformation.\n\nOf the R14.9 billion spent locally, R14.2 billion was spent on B-BBEE compliant companies. \u201cThis represented 95% of local spend,\u201d Tlali said.\n\nHowever, not all B-BBEE compliant companies are \u201cblack-owned\u201d, as defined in the B-BBEE Act.\n\nincludes African, Coloured and Indian people. Companies with \u201cover 50% black voting rights are considered to be\n\nTlali told Africa Check that R252 million of SAA\u2019s total local procurement was spent on companies that met the black ownership requirement.\n\nThis works out to 1.7% of the company's total eligible spend of R14.9 billion, close to Mbalula\u2019s figure of 2%. The airline\n\nof 8% for the year.\n\nBarriers to entry in aviation are high,\n\n\u201cIt might be possible for SAA to contract some of its indirect black suppliers directly, [but] this may be difficult logistically or on a supply chain management basis,\u201d said De Vos.\n\nHe said that while Mbalula\u2019s claim of black-owned companies getting 2% of local procurement was correct it was misleading.\n\n\u201cIf B-BBEE compliance cannot be the measure, then the whole B-BBEE edifice is effectively treated as a non-existent factor,\u201d De Vos said.\n\nHe said SAA\u2019s 95% B-BBEE compliance figure was a \u201csignificant achievement\u201d.\n\nThis part of Mbalula\u2019s claim is incorrect.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to say 98% went to white-owned companies,\u201d\n\nYuneal Padayachy, deputy director of B-BBEE procurement, transformation and verification at the department of trade and industry, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cA portion of that would have gone to state-owned enterprises.\u201d\n\nUnlike private companies, state-owned enterprises are measured against a specialised B-BBEE scorecard which excludes the assessment of ownership, Padayachy explained\n\n\u201cThey are not white, black or Indian-owned,\u201d said Padayachy, \u201cThey are owned by government.\u201d\n\nFor example, the\n\nwould have accounted for \u201ca significant amount\u201d of SAA\u2019s costs,\n\nfrom SAA shows that it expects to spend R1.5 billion with the Airports Company South Africa.\n\nof the company is owned by the South African government.\n\nSAA\u2019s Tlali told Africa Check that in 2015/16 the company spent R4.1 billion on state-owned enterprises. This would have accounted for 27.5% of their R14.9 billion local procurement.\n\nAfrica Check sent questions to Tlali to verify the share but he declined to comment. Questions sent to the airline\u2019s acting chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chairman went unanswered.\n\nSo did the remaining balance (70.8%) go to companies that had less than 50% black ownership? We asked SAA but they wouldn\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible but very difficult to get that level of information,\u201d Padayachy told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe only way to get that information would be to speak to [SAA\u2019s B-BBEE] verification agency or get it from SAA.\u201d\n\nWithout this information from SAA, it is impossible to confirm exactly how much of their local procurement went to white-owned companies. However, it is not the 98% Mbalula claimed, as 27.5% was spent on other state-owned enterprises which are not considered white or black-owned.", "lang": "en"}
