This is false; US regulators say it is not safe for use against any disease.\n\n\u201cColloidal Silver kills the Coronavirus! I take it every morning & give it to my pets,\u201d says one post.\n\n\u201cColloidal silver beats the corona virus: clinical documentation,\u201d says another post, which links to a website advertising colloidal silver products.\n\nThe post also includes an image that says \u201ccolloidal silver kills over 650 pathogens including the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nOther posts, such as this one, advertise a colloidal silver product and allege that it can be used as \u201ca shield against the COVID-19 virus,\u201d referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide.\n\nBut Dr Helene Langevin, director of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) division, said these claims are inaccurate.\n\n\u201cThere are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects,\u201d Langevin said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cIf you believe you have been exposed to, or infected with, the coronavirus, immediately contact a medical professional.\u201d\n\nThe NIH website warns against taking the substance as a dietary supplement.\n\n\u201cIn fact, colloidal silver can be dangerous to your health,\u201d the website says.\n\nSide effects can include a bluish-gray skin discoloration and poor absorption of some medicines, including antibiotics, according to the NIH.\n\nOn March 9, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission filed joint warning letters to seven companies for selling fraudulent products claiming to treat COVID-19, including a vendor peddling colloidal silver.\n\nThe companies were given 48 hours to correct their violations and report back to the agencies.\n\nThe toxic properties of silver are outlined on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, which says that people who breathe or consume silver for long periods of time can be susceptible to skin discoloration.\n\nAFP Fact Check has investigated more than 100 false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
