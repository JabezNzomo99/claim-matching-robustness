They reported the CIA officer\u2019s body was taken by the militants, along with a stash of top secret CIA documents. They identified the \u201cdead\u201d official as \u201cMike de Andrea,\u201d misspelling the name of Michael D\u2019Andrea, chief of the CIA\u2019s Iran Mission Center.\n\nOne of the sites, VeteransToday.com, wrote: \u201cIt has been reported that Mike de Andrea [sic] responsible for the assassination of the martyr Major General Qassem Soleimani was killed in the accident of the American plane that was shot down in Afghanistan. He is the most prominent figure of the CIA intelligence in the region.\u201d\n\nWhile Iranian media cited sources in the Taliban in their stories about the incident, VeteransToday.com said its report about D\u2019Andrea\u2019s death in Afghanistan was \u201coriginal\u201d and confirmed by \u201cRussian intelligence sources.\u201d\n\nThis version of events surrounding the crash gradually made its way to the British newspapers the Daily Mail and The Independent, but other media, including Time magazine, called it \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is likely false.\n\nAfghan, NATO and U.S. officials said the plane, identified as a U.S. Air Force Bombardier E-11A electronic surveillance aircraft, was not shot down, but crashed.\n\nSeveral media reports citing interviews with witnesses support that scenario.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that residents near where the aircraft crashed in Afghanistan\u2019s Ghazni Province said they did not believe claims that militants had shot down the plane. One witness told RFE/RL he watched a plane \u201crotating in the air as it fell down.\u201d\n\nA witness told Al Jazeera that the plane was heading from the location of Gazhni city \u201ctowards this place\u201d and suddenly \u201cbegan flying a little lower\u201d for no apparent reason, after which it \u201ccrash-landed.\u201d\n\nNone of the witnesses mentioned seeing or hearing blasts while the plane was aloft. Likewise, there were no reports that the plane was on fire before it crashed.\n\nThe Pentagon said the incident remains under investigation but there were no indications the plane crashed as a result a \u201chostile action.\u201d It said \u201conly two people\u201d were aboard, both of whom died.\n\nA local journalist told the Associated Press he saw \u201ctwo bodies\u201d near the \u201cbadly burned\u201d plane.\n\nOn Jan. 27, a U.S. defense official said the bodies of the two American service members were recovered. The bodies were \"treated with dignity and respect by the local Afghan community, in accordance with their culture,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nA U.S recovery team \u201cmet no Taliban resistance in reaching the site,\u201d the official said, adding that there were \u201cno indications the plane was downed by a hostile action.\u201d The recovery team \u201csecured\u201d the flight data recorder and destroyed the remaining wreckage.\n\nOn Jan. 28, the U.S. Defense Department identified the two officers killed in the E-11A crash as Lt. Col. Paul K. Voss, 46, and Capt. Ryan S. Phaneuf, 30.\n\nAsked about reports of D\u2019Andrea\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d in the crash, the U.S. Defense Department told Polygraph.info: \u201cThere were only two people on the E-11A aircraft that crashed in Afghanistan on January 27. They were the two U.S. Air Force officers identified by the Defense Department on January 29.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reported on Jan. 28 that Iranian state TV \u201cspread a wild theory\u201d claiming that a senior CIA official killed in the E-11A crash had been behind the killing of Soleimani. Multiple Iranian and Russian media outlets picked up the story.\n\nThere was a red flag in the Iranian reports.\n\nTo identify D\u2019Andrea, Iran\u2019s state TV used a screenshot from the Hollywood movie \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d about the U.S. operation to kill Osama bin Laden in May 2012. The screenshot was a photo of Frederic Lehne, the actor who played \u201cThe Wolf,\u201d a top CIA official in the film whose character was reportedly based on D\u2019Andrea.\n\nIn 2012, the Washington Post published a profile of the chief of the CIA\u2019s Counter terrorism Center, identifying him only by his code name \u201cRodger.\u201d\n\nThree years later, in April 2015, the New York Times identified him as Michael D\u2019Andrea.\n\nAccording to more recent reports, D\u2019Andrea was appointed head of the CIA\u2019s Iran desk in 2017 by the agency\u2019s then director, Mike Pompeo. There has been no confirmation that D\u2019Andrea oversaw or was involved in the operation that killed Soleimani.\n\nAnalysts have disputed the claim that D\u2019Andrea died in the E-11A crash.\n\n\u201cThis is pure propaganda,\u201d John Sipher, a former senior official in the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service, told Polygraph.info. \u201cObviously, I do not know for certain, but I would bet my home that it is totally false.\u201d\n\nSipher, who runs Spycraft Entertainment, a firm consulting movie directors and authors, added: \u201cUnlike in the movies, senior CIA officers do not rush into the field to handle issues. Nor do they often fly in military planes.\u201d\n\nOne of the few articles to question the U.S. official account of crash was written by Philip Giraldi, a former CIA counter-terrorism specialist, and published in the American Herald Tribune.\n\nGiraldi\u2019s analysis, however, contains information that\u2019s been challenged, including the claims that hostile fire prevented the U.S. recovery team from getting to the crash site and that the Pentagon never revealed how many people were aboard.\n\nMedia Metrics website, which rates news organization bias, described the American Herald Tribune as a \u201cconservative-pseudoscience\u201d website; a CNN investigation suggested the site \u201coriginates in Iran.\u201d\n\nThe CIA did not respond to Polygraph.info inquiry about D\u2019Andrea.", "lang": "en"}
