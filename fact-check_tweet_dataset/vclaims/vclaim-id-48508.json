A reader emailed Rappler the link to the post for fact checking.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found that the original photo was taken by Rappler photographer Ben Nabong in October 2015, when Arroyo arrived at the St Luke\u2019s Medical Center for a check-up.\n\nDe Lima\u2019s camp also confirmed that the senator was not rushed to the hospital on October 16. \u201cMy health is in perfect shape and this edited photo was obviously made by paid trolls hell-bent to ruin, make fun of and discredit me,\u201d said De Lima in a press release on October 18.\n\nOn February 24, 2017, De Lima was arrested over drug charges filed against her by the Department of Justice. She was granted a one-day medical furlough to undergo a CT scan at the Philippine Heart Center in March 2018.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when I was granted a one-day medical furlough last year, I made sure to inform everyone about my condition and even reminded the public that there was nothing to worry about me. As a public servant, I have always been transparent,\u201d the senator added. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
