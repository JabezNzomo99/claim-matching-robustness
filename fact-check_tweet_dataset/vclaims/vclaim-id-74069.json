On zooming in the viral photo, one can notice that it is blurry at the edges of the billboard which indicates that it has been edited. Secondly, the poster is very bright compared to the background.\n\nOn searching with the coaching centers mentioned on the building in the viral image, we found that the name of the building is KK Plaza in Maharana Pratap Nagar, Bhopal.\n\nBOOM then contacted a local from the area, Musa Ahmed, whose office in the building, shared with us photos from the location which showed that there was no Congress poster present at the spot. Instead, there was an advertisement of Bandhan Bank.\n\nWe were also independently verify that there was a Bandhan Bank ad on the billboard with photos from different angles taken at the location and photos taken by different sources.\n\nOn comparing the fake image with the other photos taken at the spot, we observed that in the edited image one cannot see the billboard frame at the edge of the poster that holds it.\n\nWe also contacted RK Publicity, that puts up billboards at that spot, who denied that there was any Congress poster and said that before the Bandhan Bank ad, there was a poster with the advertising agency contact number.\n\n\"The Bandhan Bank ad has been there for three to four days, and my contact number was on the hoarding, there was no political hoarding put up,\" a person at RK Publicity told us.\n\nAlso Read: Also Read:Video Of A Flying Billboard Injuring Bikers In Karachi Shared As Hyderabad", "lang": "en"}
