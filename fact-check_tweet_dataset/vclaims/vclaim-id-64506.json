The claim is misleading; both clips correspond to visuals of a fire at an oils and grains company in Shanghai that were released by Chinese fire service in December 2019.\n\nThe video was published here on Twitter on July 5, 2020. It has been viewed more than 5,600 times.\n\nThe video consists of two clips: the first clip shows a bird\u2019s-eye view of a burning structure and the second shows a ground-level image of a similar structure fire.\n\nThe text overlaid at the top of the video translates from simplified Chinese to English as: \u201cFire scorched a groceries and food company in Shanghai / Shanghai Fire Service dispatched 12 teams of firefighters, 46 fire engines and 322 commanders to the scene\u201d.\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption of the Twitter post translates to English as: \u201c[Food reserves] Fires have been reported at grain depots in Guizhou and Shanghai, but similar fires that occurred at various grain warehouses across the country are not news. People with a clear mind would know what\u2019s going on. To quote a person who worked at a grain depot half their life: \u2018Grain depots don\u2019t catch fire under normal circumstances, even if there is a short circuit, because their walls and roof are made of inflammable materials. Also, there were cases where wooden houses were burned to the ground, but the grains inside only had their surface scorched. I have never seen thick smoke and roaring fire like this, so don\u2019t believe in information from the government about food reserves.\u201d\n\nComments under the tweet can be translated as \u201cthe food reverse warehouse is on fire, there must be something sketchy in it! Nothing can be found after the fire! The greedy officials are very tricky!\u201d and \u201cDestruction of the national food reserve evidence\u201d.\n\nThe video also circulated here on Twitter; here on Facebook, here on YouTube and here on a Hong Kong online forum with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse Google Image search of keyframes extracted from the video found a higher-definition version of the first clip in this report published by Storyful, a social media news and intelligence agency, on December 13, 2019.\n\nThe footage, credited to \u201cChina Fire Service\u201d, shows an industrial fire in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong district, according to the report.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the first clip in the misleading post (L) and the footage published by Storyful (R) with similar features circled in red:\n\nA subsequent keyword search found the same video published here on the verified Weibo account of China Fire Service on December 13, 2019.\n\nThe simplified Chinese-language caption states: \u201c[Shanghai: groceries and food company fire under control] A fire broke out at Shanghai Kerry Oils & Grains Industrial Co on 118 Gaodong Road, Pudong, Shanghai, at 11:56 December 13. Shanghai Fire Service\u2019s rescuers responded to calls for help and dispatched 12 teams of firefighters, 46 fire engines and 322 commanders to the scene. The fire has now been brought under control. No casualties were reported.\u201d\n\nThe second clip corresponds to a photo published here on the Chinese internet portal Sohu.com on December 14, 2019.\n\nThe photo, the second down from the top, is credited to Shanghai Fire Service.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the second clip in the misleading post (L) and the Sohu photo (R) with similar features circled in red:\n\nThe headline of the Sohu article reads: \u201cFire broke out at Shanghai oils and grains company midday December 13\u201d. The article reports on a fire at the same company mentioned in the China Fire Service Weibo post.\n\nThe misleading claim has also been debunked by the University of Hong Kong Journalism & Media Studies Centre\u2019s fact-checking project Annie Lab here.", "lang": "en"}
