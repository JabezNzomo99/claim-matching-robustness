{"title": "Is Buhari Supporting A Notorious Herdsman?", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-08-23T07:00:46+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19276", "url": "https://dubawa.org/is-buhari-supporting-a-notorious-herdsman/", "vclaim": "CLAIM: Buhari\u2019s Govt Flies Injured Herdsmen Leader, that Killed 371 In Numan For Treatment.\n\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE: We just don\u2019t know \u2013 there are no reports that Buhari\u2019s government flew herdsmen leader for treatment, or any report about the alleged herdsmen attack that killed 371 people in Numan Local Government in 2018. More so, the pictures attached to the post on Facebook cannot be verified.\n\nOn August 6, 2018, the Hope for Nigeria Facebook page posted an inciting headline which was soon after reposted by Radio Biafra Facebook page. They both alleged that Buhari\u2019s government flew injured herdsman, Mallam Nura, for treatment in the capital city, Abuja. The herdsman has been a subject of contention as he is apparently responsible for the demise of 371 souls in Numan.\n\nHope for Nigeria\u2019s Facebook page does not have the best track record with respect to the veracity of content and by extension, reliability. Consequently, it has been flagged by Dubawa for consistently publishing misleading and unverifiable content. This was very evident pre and post the 2019 elections. Hence, Dubawa had to source for relevant credible information pertaining to the incident.\n\nTo begin, there were no media reports that Buhari\u2019s government transferred victims of the herdsmen/farmer\u2019s clash in Numan from the hospital in Adamawa to Abuja. Hope for Nigeria never mentioned the hospital in Adamawa nor the name of the hospital he was transferred to in Abuja. Also, a reverse image search on the pictures accompanying the post revealed that the pictures only exist on Hope for Nigeria and Radio Biafra Facebook Page; thereby calling to question the truth of the message\n\nAlso, the post claims that the leader was responsible for 371 lives. After a search of Nigeria media reports, we found June 28, 2018 to have been the date with the most recent attack in Numan LGA and that was reported by The Punch Newspaper. The altercation resulted in two dead people and 29 others sustaining injury. Moreover, early August 2018 was a time the media was awash with news about Buhari\u2019s 10-working days holiday, the siege on National Assembly and all the drama that followed. Thus, there was no attack during the period when the claim was made.\n\nFurther, the 2018 report of Amnesty International records a total of 540 deaths in the whole state of Adamawa and not just Numan village. The report titled Harvest of Death: Three Years of Bloody Clashes Between Farmers and Herders in Nigeria used the timeline January 2016 to October 2018. There is no other media report on any other attack in Numan village alone.\n\nThere are no reports that Buhari\u2019s government flew herdsmen leader for treatment as well as any reports on any herdsmen attack that killed 371 people In Numan Local Government in 2018. More so, the pictures attached to the post on Facebook cannot be verified.", "lang": "en"}
