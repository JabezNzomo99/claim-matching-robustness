In the video, a woman films an encounter at a dentist, where she refuses to let staff take her children\u2019s temperature using an infrared thermometer.\n\nThese have been used widely during the coronavirus pandemic to measure temperature while avoiding contact which could spread Covid-19.\n\nIt is incorrect to say that these devices can have any harmful effect on a person\u2019s pineal gland.\n\nInfrared is a form of radiation that is invisible to the naked eye but can be sensed by humans as warmth or heat. The pineal gland is a small part of the brain that produces and regulates hormones.\n\nNon-contact infrared thermometers work by measuring the infrared radiation given off by an object or person and converting this into a temperature. As these devices measure infrared rather than emitting it, the person whose temperature is being taken isn\u2019t subject to any extra infrared radiation. The red light seen on these devices is just that, a beam of light to help the user aim it correctly.\n\nOverexposure to infrared radiation can cause health problems such as skin burns and eye damage, but this is not an issue with infrared thermometers.", "lang": "en"}
