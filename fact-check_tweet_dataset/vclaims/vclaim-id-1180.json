Trump railed against \u201cangry mobs\u201d trying to tear down statues of Confederate leaders and warned thousands of supporters that protesters were trying to erase U.S. history ( here ).\n\nAs seen in these photos here , Melania Trump wore a dress from Alexander McQueen\u2019s Spring/Summer 2020 collection ( here ).\n\nThe dress was mocked by some social media users saying Trump himself may have drawn on the fabric with a Sharpie marker ( here , here ).\n\nAs described by Paper Magazine, \u201cthe white sleeveless midi dress featured abstract line motifs of \u2018dancing girls\u2019\u201d drawn by masters\u2019 students studying design at Central Saint Martins (CSM) in London ( here , here ).\n\nThe Stitch School, a group promoting community through embroidery ( here ), provided the teams for London and Paris Fashion Weeks with specialist tables and looms allowing every person involved in the design to play a part in the making of the dress ( www.stitch-school.com/mcqueen ).\n\nMelanie Bowles, co-founder of the Stitch School, told Reuters via email that the dress was \u201c100% NOT stitched as the claim makes,\u201d and that the drawings were \u201cdone by CSM art students and stitched in-house at the McQueen studio.\u201d Bowles added that the false claims surrounding the making of this dress are \u201csuch a shame as this is a good piece of community work.\u201d\n\nVogue also described the process behind the design, writing that the McQueen \u201cstaff sat together and chain stitched and silk knotted over the line drawings of Central Saint Martins students, who had sketched on a single giant sheet during a life drawing class at the McQueen store in London. All of those students were credited in the show notes.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. Art students in London designed the drawings on the Alexander McQueen dress worn by Melania Trump on July 3 at Mount Rushmore.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
