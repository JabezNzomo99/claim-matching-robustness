But the ad fails to mention that the administration tried several times soon after the outbreak, although without success, and an international team with two U.S. members was admitted in mid-February.\n\nThe narrator of the ad, called \u201cUnprepared,\u201d says, \u201cBiden told Trump he should insist on having American health experts on the ground in China.\u201d\n\nIt then plays an excerpt from the Democratic presidential debate on Feb. 25 in Charleston, South Carolina, in which Biden says, \u201cI would be on the phone with China and making it clear, \u2018We are going to need to be in your country. You have to be open. You have to be clear. We have to know what\u2019s going on.'\u201d\n\nThe day after the debate, during a CNN town hall, Biden said, \u201cWhat I would do were I president now, I would not be taking China\u2019s word for it. I would insist that China allow our scientists in to make a hard determination of how it started, where it\u2019s from, how far along it is. Because that is not happening now.\u201d This is not in the ad.\n\nLater in the ad, the narrator says, \u201cTrump never got a CDC team on the ground in China.\u201d That is true. But the ad doesn\u2019t mention that in mid-February \u2014 before the former vice president\u2019s remarks in the debate \u2014 two Americans were part of a World Health Organization team that visited China, including Wuhan, where the pandemic broke out late last year.\n\nThe 25-member team, which visited China for nine days from Feb. 16 to Feb. 24, included one official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and another from the National Institutes of Health. The team issued a 40-page report on Feb. 28 \u2014 about two weeks before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Biden campaign, the ad is aimed at the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida, and runs statewide there on Facebook and Instagram. The ad is also running on YouTube in some markets in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Campaigns can target online ads to voters in specific states based on users\u2019 account information, such as demographic information and search history.)\n\nAll of those states will be critical in determining the next president.\n\nHaving American officials in place to take a first-hand look has emerged as an issue of growing importance with widespread concern that China was not candid about the scope of the novel coronavirus problem.\n\nAs we have written before, Biden was wrong last month when he asserted that the Trump administration had made \u201cno effort\u201d to get American health officials to the place where the coronavirus began.\n\n\u201c[W]hen we were talking \u2026 early on in this crisis, we said \u2014 I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said at a CNN virtual town hall on March 27. \u201cThere was no effort to do that.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn fact, the CDC tried to get into China just one week after China reported the outbreak to the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cOn January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a Jan. 28 press conference. \u201cI reiterated that offer when I spoke to China\u2019s Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today. We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.\u201d\n\nMore than a week later, Azar said again at a Feb. 7 press conference that \u201cour longstanding offer to send world-class experts to China to assist remains on the table.\u201d\n\nAt a briefing of the White House coronavirus task force last month, Trump said that he brought the issue up with Chinese President Xi Jinping personally.\n\nWe cannot confirm whether Trump did bring it up with the Chinese leader or, if he did, how hard he pushed Xi to admit Americans. But according to the president, he did make the offer, on more than one occasion. And it is by no means certain that insistence would have led the Chinese to change their minds.\n\nWhen we asked about the ad, Biden campaign spokesman Michael Gwin said, \u201cVice President Biden warned Donald Trump against taking the Chinese government at its word on the coronavirus, and repeatedly called on Trump to insist to President Xi that he allow American experts on the ground so we could determine the facts for ourselves. Instead of heeding Biden\u2019s call, Trump blithely bought the Chinese government\u2019s spin \u2014 ignoring warnings from our own intelligence community \u2014 and wasted precious weeks praising their response instead of preparing America to combat the virus.\u201d\n\nGwin did not address the fact that the Trump administration did send two of its top health officials to China in mid-February.\n\nIt seems clear that China-related issues will play a big role in the upcoming presidential campaign. As we have written, the Trump campaign on April 9 launched a misleading attack ad on YouTube that misrepresents Biden\u2019s statements on the Trump administration\u2019s travel restrictions regarding China. The ad attracted attention because it leaves the false impression that former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, a Chinese-American, is a Chinese official.\n\nThe ad says that Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was opposed to the travel restrictions \u2014 the Biden campaign says he was for them \u2014 and generally strives to portray Biden as far too soft on the Chinese regime, using some of Biden\u2019s positive statements about the Chinese.\n\nMuch of the Biden campaign\u2019s new ad focuses on positive statements Trump has made about China and its handling of the pandemic. And it is true that Trump has repeatedly praised the Chinese.\n\nFor example, at a business roundtable in New Delhi, India, on Feb. 25, the president said, \u201cChina is working very, very hard. I have spoken to President Xi, and they\u2019re working very hard. And if you know anything about him, I think he\u2019ll be in pretty good shape. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019ve had a rough patch, and I think right now they have it \u2014 it looks like they\u2019re getting it under control more and more.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also has on occasion criticized China for its lack of transparency, a fact that is not addressed in the Biden ad.\n\nFor example, at a White House coronavirus briefing on March 21, the president said, \u201cI wish they could have told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn\u2019t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could have told us earlier about it because we could have come up with a solution\u2026. China was very secretive, okay? Very, very secretive. And that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the ad, Biden addresses the travel restrictions on China that the Trump administration announced on Jan. 31.\n\nWhile Trump \u201cbrags about\u201d the restrictions, the ad says, in fact 40,000 people arrived from China after the restrictions went into effect. That claim is based on this New York Times story. As we have reported, while Trump repeatedly calls what he imposed a \u201ctravel ban,\u201d that is a misnomer. The policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. In addition to those family members, American citizens weren\u2019t covered by the restrictions.\n\nTo sum up, we find Biden\u2019s claim about getting U.S. health experts into China misleading. While Biden is right that the U.S. didn\u2019t get a CDC team into China, the Trump administration made efforts to do so, and there were two Americans on the WHO team that went to China in February.", "lang": "en"}
