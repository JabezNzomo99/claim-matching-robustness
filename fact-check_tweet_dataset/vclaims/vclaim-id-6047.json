The article also claimed the artist was captured by both Metropolitan Police and City of London Police, despite the purported arrest\u2019s having occurred outside the jurisdiction of both departments, in Hertfordshire. The National Report quoted non-existent Police Chief Lyndon Edwards on the sting that led to Banksy\u2019s arrest, as well as the long-awaited public revelation of the artist\u2019s true identity:\n\nWe had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky\u2019s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.\u201d Edwards continued, \u201cHorner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of implausible claims in the Banksy arrest report article, the most glaring that a quick reverse image search instantly dates the \u201cperp walk\u201d picture back to \u201cOperation Razorback\u201d in July 2011:\n\nOne need not be all that observant to note the man the article identified as Horner in a mugshot has a notably different skin tone from the man whose face is obscured in the \u201carrest\u201d photo displayed above:\n\nMostly, however, the story is easily identifiable as a bit of fiction because National Report is a well-known fake news outlet, publishing click-baiting, completely false stories such as \u201c15 Year Old Who \u2018SWATTED\u2019 Gamer Convicted of Domestic Terrorism,\u201d \u201cSolar Panels Drain the Sun\u2019s Energy, Experts Say,\u201d and \u201cVince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6.\u201d London\u2019s Metropolitan Police confirmed on 20 October 2014 that the story about Banksy\u2019s arrest was a hoax.\n\nA nearly identical version of this rumor was published in September 2017 on the fake news web site NewsExaminer.net. Although that article featured a new location (Banksy was reportedly arrested in Palestine) and an updated \u201cperp walk\u201d photograph (this time showing a rape suspect in 2016), it also included the same fake quote from the non-existent Police Chief Lyndon Edwards.", "lang": "en"}
