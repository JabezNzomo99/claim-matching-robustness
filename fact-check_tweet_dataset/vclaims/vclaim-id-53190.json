Kamala Harris\u2019 real name is: Maya Harrison. Ilha [sic] Omar real name is: Ilhan Esmi. Bill Deblazio\u2019s [sic] real name is: Warren Wilhelm Jr. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s real name is: Liz Herring. Pete Buttigeig\u2019s [sic] real name is: Paul Montgomery. Bernie Sanders\u2019 real name is: Bernard Gutman. Donald J. Trump\u2019s real name is: Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe list consists of maiden names, middle names, relatives names and nicknames.\n\nLet\u2019s take this person by person.\n\nPresident Obama - Post says his real name is \"Barry Soetoro.\"\n\nAs stated in his birth certificate, President Barack Obama\u2019s real, full name is Barack Hussein Obama, II.\n\nWe previously fact-checked where the names Barry Soetoro and Barack Hussein Obama intersect.\n\n\"Barry\" was a childhood nickname for \"Barack.\" He went by Soetoro, the last name of his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, when he was young and growing up in Indonesia. At the age of 10, Obama moved back to his birthplace of Hawaii and stopped using the last name.\n\nKamala Harris - Post says her real name is \"Maya Harrison.\"\n\nThis is wrong. California Sen. Kamala Harris was named Kamala Devi Harris when she was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, Calif. She has a younger sister named Maya Harris.\n\nIlhan Omar - Post says her real name is \"Ilhan Esmi.\"\n\nNo. U.S. Rep. Ihan Omar\u2019s \"real\" name is Ilhan Abdullahi Omar. The Minnesota congresswoman married, and divorced, a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. (Not Elsi, as the post spells it).\n\nBill de Blasio - Post says his real name is \"Warren Wilhelm Jr.\"\n\nBill de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. on May 8, 1961, in Manhattan. But in 1983, he petitioned a New York court to change his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm because he said his father was largely absent and he wanted to embrace his mother\u2019s Italian heritage. He formally adopted the name Bill de Blasio in January 2002.\n\nElizabeth Warren - Post says her real name is \"Liz Herring.\"\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s real name is Elizabeth Warren. She was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City to parents Donald and Pauline Herring. \"Liz,\" of course, is a common shortened nickname for the name Elizabeth. (Her childhood nickname, Betsy, is what her mother called her.)\n\nShe kept the last name Warren after she and her first husband, Jim Warren, divorced in 1980.\n\nPete Buttigieg - Post says his real name is \"Peter Montgomery.\"\n\nThis is weird cherry-picking. The South Bend, Ind., mayor\u2019s full name is Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg (not \"Buttigeig\" as the post spells it). He is the only child to Joseph Buttigieg and Jennifer Anne Montgomery Buttigieg.\n\nBernie Sanders - Post says his real name is \"Bernard Gutman.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 real name is Bernard Sanders. His parents were Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg. The misconception that the senator\u2019s surname is actually Gutman appears to come from a 1921 U.S. immigration record when his father arrived from Poland. The record lists Sanders\u2019 father as Eliasz Gitman, though he was naturalized under Elias Sanders. The recording lists Bernie Sanders\u2019 grandmother as Jetti Gutman, which was her married name.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims a list of prominent Democratic politicians are concealing their true identities from the public and shares what it says are their \"real names.\"\n\nThe names the candidates are accused of faking are, in fact, their legal names. The Facebook post pulls pulls their maiden names, married surnames, nicknames, middle names and in one case a sibling\u2019s name to make the candidates seem nefarious.", "lang": "en"}
