If it ends in a 4, it's the lowest it will be. Target's mark down schedule: MONDAY: Kids' Clothing, Stationery (office supplies, gift wrap), Electronics. TUESDAY: Women's Clothing and Domestics. WEDNESDAY: Men's Clothing, Toys, Health and Beauty. THURSDAY: Lingerie, Shoes, Housewares. FRIDAY: cosmetics.If you're like me, you probably love shopping at Costco, hoping to find a great deal on everything from TV's to bulk diapers. But shopping at the big box megastore can be a bit overwhelming. Did you know there is actually a \"Costco Price Tag Code\" that can let you know if you're getting the best deals? The key to the code is not the dollars but the cents. Those last two digits of the price tell you everything. A price ending in .99 is much different than one ending in .97 or .49. Check it out ... Price ending in .99 \u2013 the product is full price Any time you see the price ending in .99 you know that item is full-priced and has not been marked down. It still may be a good deal though, this is Costco after all. Price ending in .97 \u2013 a deal decided by the manager A price that ends in .97 is what we are looking for. Usually this is a special price you're not going to find again. Once it's gone it's gone. These can be some great deals. Price ending in .49 or .79 \u2013 manufacturer's special A price ending in .49 or .79 is a manufacturer's special. This is a product the manufacturer is testing out at Costco, usually at a lower price than Costco would sell the item at. Price ending in .00 \u2014 the goods are about to go! A price ending in .00 is probably the best deal you will find in the store. It means the manager wants the item out. And once it's out, the product is gone for good. A price tag with an asterisk \u2014 it's discounted and done Be on the lookout for price tags with an asterisk. This means the product is discontinued. A combination of a .97 and an asterisk means you are getting a last chance good deal. We all know Costco has the lowest prices in town but now you can use these tricks to get deeper discounts inside the warehouse. Share this with anyone you know who shops\n\nThis item about how to determine if, and on what days, stores in the Target retail chain will mark down their prices has been shared widely on social media sites such as Pinterest and Tumblr for several years now. Expanded versions of this item offer additional details:\n\nThe upper right hand corner of the price tag will tell you the percentage off. Item will remain at a percentage off for usually two weeks before progressing to the next level. Consumable items, furniture, and electronics are generally the only things that go 15%. Target\u2019s full prices end in 9. Thereafter each price drop will reduce the final digit in the price to either an 8, 6, or 4. (e.g., A $9.99 item at 30% off will be priced $6.98) The lowest the last digit will drop is to 4. If you see something you want and the price ends in 4, buy it. The price won\u2019t go any lower.\n\n\n\nThis \u201csecret\u201d isn\u2019t accurate, however: various Target employees and a Target representative we\u2019ve talked to have told us that there\u2019s no regular \u201ccoding\u201d to their prices, nor does every Target store mark down prices for particular departments on specified days of the week. Target\u2019s prices are based on a variety of factors, they say, and they\u2019re subject to change at any don\u2019t necessarily know in advance which prices may be marked down further, price markdowns aren\u2019t uniform across the chain, and markdowns for various classes of merchandise don\u2019t occur only (or regularly) on certain days of the week.\n\nOther news outlets who have covered this item have reported similar information:\n\nKnowing better than to take the [list] at face value, we asked Target to confirm if it\u2019s real. According to spokesperson Jessica Deede, product mark-downs vary by store and \u201cthe only real indicator is the red clearance sticker.\u201d Sadly, the [list] is an Internet hoax. \u201cTarget uses a variety of different factors when detecting the price and level of a discount for an item,\u201d she [says], \u201cso just because the price ends in four or eight, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s an indication as to how many times or whether the item will be marked down again.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis item\u2019s lack of veracity is also attested to from empirical evidence contributed by regular Target shoppers, such as the following:\n\nI just went to Target this morning and employees were actively marking down items in the toy dept., and it\u2019s not Wednesday. As for the prices, I wanted to buy three variations of the same toy from clearance that were originally $9.99. Two were marked $4.98 and one was marked $6.98, so I asked the employee marking stuff if the third one was now 50% off and she scanned them and said, \u201cThey\u2019re all $2.98.\u201d And then she slapped new price tags on them all. So clearly prices ending in 8 are not the last markdown. I go to two different Target stores regularly and what is clearanced out at one store and at what price varies widely just between those two stores. I\u2019m an avid Target clearance shopper so I have a pretty good idea of what is on clearance at each store and what % it\u2019s selling at. Once there were things that I found at one store for 70% off that I really liked, so I went to the other store and they were only 30% off. I waited for them to get marked down to 70% or at least 50% off over the next few weeks and they never did. Finally I went back there and found them taking the items off the shelves to send to salvage without their ever getting marked down again.\n\n\n\nThe similar item circulated about a \u201cprice tag code\u201d at the Costco chain of warehouse discount stores derives from the web site RatherBeShopping.com and the information it imparts has also been covered in detail at sites such as AddictedtoCostco.com:\n\n1. The last two digits in the price can tell you a lot. Regular priced items usually end with a .99 ending; though sometimes this might not be the case. However, the ones with the .97 endings are those items that did not sell and must be cleared out. The markdowns on closeout items might not be huge, but at least you\u2019ll know that they are somewhat discounted and that they won\u2019t be in stock much longer. Once they sell out, that\u2019s it. Also, look for prices ending in .79, .49, .89 (or similar, except for .99). These types of prices indicate special deals that Costco was able to obtain from the vendor or manufacturer. 2. Is there an asterisk (*) in the upper right hand corner? The asterisk in the upper right hand corner of the pricing sign indicates items that will not be restocked. So, once they\u2019ve sold out of the current stock this item is gone, gone, gone. If it is something you really like, this is your tip off to buy extra because chances are it will not be on the shelf the next time you\u2019re at Costco. These items may, or may not, be marked down, but now you\u2019ll be able to tell that from the the price, right? 3. Are there special rebates on this item? If there is an instant rebate or a manufacturer\u2019s rebate, you\u2019ll see a line for it on the sign here. If there\u2019s a coupon deal for a product it might show up here too (this isn\u2019t always the case and seems to vary by location). The instant rebates will be taken off at the register automatically as you check out; no muss, no fuss. 4. The little date in the lower right hand corner, below the price, is the last time the price changed. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the price is lower now (however that is probably the case), but there was a price change of some type.\n\n\n\nThis \u201cprice tag code\u201d has also been featured on the local news in Costco\u2019s home area:\n\nThe reporter for this segment, Jesse Jones, maintained that Costco fact-checked his story and said it \u201cwas on point,\u201d but other Costco employees have reported that while true in the main, some parts of it are not wholly accurate:\n\nAs a buyer for Costco, [I can say that] some of this is correct and some is not. All of our price points end in .09, so the section regarding manufacturer specials is incorrect. For example, an item can be 9.49 and simply be full priced. But the .97 and .00 examples are in most cases correct. It\u2019s not really a code, more just a set of rules that we follow to track pricing and be consistent throughout the region. It\u2019s also very likely you won\u2019t see a manager\u2019s special because Costco makes sure to get good buys that people won\u2019t want to pass up. Most of the one-time special buys are already priced aggressively to give members more bang for their buck, so you\u2019re not likely to see .97 cent signs unless you\u2019re really looking. An asterisk means that product has been \u201cdeleted\u201d and it won\u2019t be restocked on a regular basis. Sometimes that means Costco couldn\u2019t get the same product at the same purchase price, or it didn\u2019t sell very well, or a repackaging is coming. After the warehouse sells the product it has on hand in the store it won\u2019t be restocked, so the average shopper should take it as \u201cget it now because that\u2019s all there is.\u201d HOWEVER, in some cases these \u201cdeleted\u201d items will reappear, particularly if they are seasonal items like holiday wrapping paper, beach towels, or potato salad. The items will sell out from current stock at the warehouse and be deleted, but they will probably reappear next year during the appropriate season. So if you want it before another year rolls around, then get it now. Or else you can risk that it will be back next year. It all depends how well the product sold that season.", "lang": "en"}
