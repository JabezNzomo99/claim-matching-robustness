Chinese authorities have clamped down on its publication.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s false FB post has been viewed over 9,800 times and has received over 200 comments and reactions and over 800 shares.\n\nLast February, two other fact-checking media organizations -- Snopes and Factcheck.org -- also debunked similar online posts suggesting conspiracy theories on Lieber\u2019s arrest and its connection with the COVID-19 outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
