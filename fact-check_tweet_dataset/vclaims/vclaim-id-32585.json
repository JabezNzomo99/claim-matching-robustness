Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law were killed in a plane crash. Kennedy, then the founder and publisher of George magazine, was piloting the single-engine Piper Saratoga when it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. Then-President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton attended the memorial mass.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determined that the crash probably happened after Kennedy, who was inexperienced at flying his plane alone at night, became disoriented in haze.\n\nKennedy was not a candidate for any public office when he died. But a few days after this death, the New York Daily News ran a story citing two anonymous friends who said they thought Kennedy would have run for office some day.\n\n\"Earlier this year, in one of the best-kept secrets in state politics, Kennedy considered seeking the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) in 2000, the friends confirmed yesterday,\" the story says. Though a private poll in 1997 found that JFK Jr. was the state\u2019s most popular Democrat by far, according to the story, \"the idea became moot once First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled her interest in running, but the two friends said they expected the son of the slain president eventually would have jumped into politics as a candidate.\"\n\nA 1999 Washington Post story says that a \"Kennedy insider\" claimed leading Democrats had unsuccessfully approached Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run for Moynihan\u2019s seat.\n\nHillary Clinton was elected to Moynihan\u2019s vacated seat on Nov. 7, 2000.", "lang": "en"}
