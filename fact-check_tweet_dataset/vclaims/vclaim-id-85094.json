He gets 1 crore as royalty/year for his book \u2018Concepts of Physics\u2019 and he gives it to PM\u2019s Relief Fund and to charity. He pays fees of poor students with the salary he got as a senior professor at IIT Kanpur. And he still rides his Bajaj Priya. #RealHeroes\u201d. This tweet by a handle called Real Heroes (@IndianRealHeroes) has been shared close to 4000 times. Professor Verma is a familiar name and it was not surprising that the tweet struck a chord with social media users.\n\nThe viral news took Prof. Verma by surprise and he took to Facebook to categorically deny the claim made in the tweet about him earning and donating Rs.1 crore. He also denied ever owning a scooter of the said colour that is shown in the picture.\n\nDespite the Professor\u2019s clarification, the twitter handle has neither deleted the tweet nor issued any explanation for the patently false tweet. Many Twitter users have shared his denial in response to the Real Heroes\u2019 tweet but to no avail. \u201cI am just one of you, a common man and a physics learner\u201d, clarified Prof Verma. The Twitter handle however is undeterred and seems determined to use the professor\u2019s name to get maximum mileage out of its fake post.\n\nThe Real Heroes Twitter handle claims that its \u201caim is to make known the great deeds of those people who are ignored or talked of in passing by the mainstream media.\u201d It also invites stories from its followers. Unfortunately it did no fact check before making the fake story about Prof. Verma viral.\n\nSocial media users must be careful before they believe everything they come across on various platforms.", "lang": "en"}
