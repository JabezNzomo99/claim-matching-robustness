Hindu sisters, there is still time, stay away from these people. Jai Shri Ram\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim in the post to be misleading. The girl seen in the viral picture is a Muslim, who was attacked by a white man in London in 2017.\n\nMany Twitter users have also shared the collage with claims of love jihad. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nUsing reverse search, we found the viral collage in a photo gallery of \u201cThe Times of India\u201d.\n\nThe photo gallery was about Reshma Khan, an aspiring model, who along with her cousin Jameel Mukhtar, was attacked by a white man named John Tomlin on June 21, 2017 in Beckton, London. It was Reshma\u2019s 21st birthday. John threw acid on the two as they were waiting in their car in traffic.\n\nA BBC report says that in 2018, John was jailed for 16 years after he \u201cadmitted intentionally causing the pair grievous bodily harm\u201d.\n\nThe incident was widely covered by the international media. As per news website \u201cIndependent\u201d, Reshma\u2019s cousin Jameel said that the attack on them was the result of growing Islamophobia in London.\n\nA few months later, Reshma shared some of her pictures of recovery on social media. Her recent photos can be seen on her Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the love jihad claim along with the girl\u2019s disfigured face is false. The acid attack victim was a Muslim, who was attacked by a white man in London.", "lang": "en"}
