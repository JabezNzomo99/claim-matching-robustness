And it\u2019s especially tricky if you have to decide in the middle of the campaign whether it\u2019s better to leave the race to run for another office.\n\nThat\u2019s the situation that faced former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who quit the presidential field on Aug. 15 and is keeping his options open about a 2020 run for Senate, where he could challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. An early exit also enabled U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell time to defend his California congressional seat in 2020.\n\nWhat about the other candidates?\n\nThe most attention has focused on Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. Democrats around the country have urged both candidates to shift from the presidential race \u2014 where they haven\u2019t progressed very far in the polls \u2014 to potentially competitive races for Senate in their home states. Another presidential candidate, Julian Castro, would also be able to enter the Texas Senate race if he wished. And several current House members need to decide whether to stay in the presidential race or run again for their current congressional seat.\n\nIt\u2019s not unheard of for a presidential candidate to leave the race and file to run for another office. Since 2000, Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Orrin Hatch of Utah have all done it, as have Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Ron Paul of Texas, and John Kasich of Ohio, plus Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio.\n\nWe decided to run down each of the Democratic presidential candidates and whether they face a choice about what to run for in 2020, or whether they are blessed with a \"free shot\" for the presidency by keeping their current offices beyond 2020. We did not include the three non-elected officials in the field: Tom Steyer, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang.\n\nSome candidates are in a sweet spot: Their re-elections aren\u2019t scheduled until after 2020, giving them the option to stay in the race until the end. If they lose, they can still ask voters to send them back to their current job.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., greet each other before the first of two Democratic presidential primary debates (AP).\n\nElizabeth Warren: Next up for re-election as senator from Massachusetts in 2024.\n\nBernie Sanders: Next up for re-election as senator from Vermont in 2024.\n\nKamala Harris: Next up for re-election as senator from California in 2022.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: Next up for re-election as senator from Minnesota in 2024.\n\nMichael Bennet: Next up for re-election as senator from Colorado in 2022.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand: Next up for re-election as senator from New York in 2024.\n\nNew Jersey Democrats passed a law in 2018 allowing the same person to run for Senate and either president or vice president at the same time. That means Cory Booker can run for both president (or vice president) and senator in 2020.\n\nElected officials who will have to make a choice at some point\n\nAll members of the U.S. House of Representatives have to run every two years, and one governor is up for re-election in 2020. Filing deadlines vary by state.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., speaks to media during a campaign event held at the Liberty House in Manchester, N.H., on April 23. (AP)\n\nTulsi Gabbard: Next up for re-election as the member for Hawaii\u2019s 2nd district in 2020. The filing deadline is June 2, 2020.\n\nSeth Moulton: Next up for re-election as the member for Massachusetts\u2019 6th district in 2020. The filing deadline is May 5, 2020.\n\nTim Ryan: Next up for re-election as the member for Ohio\u2019s 13th district in 2020. The filing deadline is Dec. 11, 2019.\n\nJay Inslee: Next up for re-election as governor of Washington in 2020. The filing deadline is May 15, 2020.\n\nThose not seeking re-election 2020 but with other options\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian Castro speaks during the Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News in June in Miami. (AP)\n\nSteve Bullock: Not seeking re-election as governor of Montana because of term limits. Democrats have speculated he could run in 2020 for the Montana Senate seat currently held by Republican Steve Daines. For that race, the filing deadline is March 9, 2020.\n\nJulian Castro: the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as well as the former mayor of San Antonio.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas\u2019 16th district.\n\nEither Castro or O\u2019Rourke could challenge Republican John Cornyn for the U.S. Senate, a race with a filing deadline of Dec. 9, 2019. Or either could run for Texas governor in 2022. Cornyn has already drawn Democratic opponents, including military veteran M.J. Hegar and Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards.\n\nBill De Blasio: De Blasio is term limited as mayor of New York, but he isn't scheduled to leave office until January 2022.\n\nFormer elected officials not currently holding office and with no clear options for other office\n\nJoe Biden: We were unable to find any suggestions that Biden, a former vice president and longtime U.S. senator, would run for another office if he did not win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nPete Buttigieg: Buttigieg announced he would not run for a third term as mayor of South Bend, Ind., and another Democrat has already been selected in a primary for the mayoral race in November. No one thinks Buttigieg\u2019s career in politics will be over if he loses the presidency, but since he is a Democrat in a generally red state, there are no obvious openings for his next move.\n\nJohn Delaney: Former congressman from Maryland\u2019s 6th district. We found no indication he will run for another office in 2020.\n\nJoe Sestak: Former congressman from Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th district. We found no indication he will run for another office in 2020.\n\nCorrection: Bill de Blasio holds office until 2022, but he cannot seek re-election in 2021 to a third term, as this article originally stated. The law was changed to allow New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for a third term in 2008, but it was changed again to restrict future mayors to two terms.", "lang": "en"}
