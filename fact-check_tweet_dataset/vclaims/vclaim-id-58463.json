An ad criticizing Sweeney claims the South Jersey Democrat\u2019s \"Obama-style policies\" are responsible for high unemployment in the state.\n\n \n\n \"How? Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs. Sweeney backs cap and trade and raising electric rates, which will drive out more jobs. And Sweeney backs Obama\u2019s job-destroying government health care plan and Obama's failed stimulus schemes,\" the ad says.\n\n \n\n High taxes. Fewer jobs. We\u2019ve heard -- and checked -- similar claims before, but never specifically on income tax rates.\n\n \n\n So, did Sweeney give New Jersey the nation's highest income tax rate, driving jobs out of state?\n\n \n\n Sweeney took office as a state Senator in 2002. Since then, New Jersey has never had the the highest income tax rate in the nation.\n\n \n\n The state Legislature increased the top income tax rate in 2004 and 2009. Sweeney voted for both measures, but he\u2019s just one vote among many and the governor signed both bills.\n\n \n\n In 2004, New Jersey\u2019s top income tax rate went from 6.37 percent on those making more than $75,000 to 8.97 percent on those making more than $500,000 with the so-called \"millionaires\u2019 tax.\" Several other states, including California, Montana and Vermont, all had higher income tax rates that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy.\n\n \n\n In 2009, the state\u2019s top income tax rate increased to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million. Even then, Hawaii and Oregon had slightly larger top income tax rates of 11 percent.\n\n \n\n The tax expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year. He has tried twice since then to reinstate the \"millionaires\u2019 tax,\" but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed both measures.\n\n \n\n Steve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, argued that all taxes, whether they are sales taxes or property taxes, \"conspire to be a tax of everyone\u2019s income.\"\n\n \n\n But the ad clearly says New Jersey has the \"nation's highest income tax rate,\" while showing a photo of a New Jersey residential income tax form. So, on that point, the ad is wrong.\n\n \n\n But are New Jersey\u2019s income tax rates responsible for job loss?\n\n \n\n Lonegan referred to a Tax Foundation study that ranked New Jersey as the worst in the nation for state and local tax burdens. And according to the tax research group, the Garden State ranks number one in that category.\n\n \n\n But when it comes to the destruction of jobs, taxes may be one factor, but they aren\u2019t the only factor.\n\n \n\n \"Everything matters,\" said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. \"But taxes also matter.\"\n\n \n\n Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the argument that increasing the top income tax rates discourages people from taking risks and starting businesses \"really overstates the effect of the tax rates. There are a lot of other factors that come into play.\"\n\n \n\n Those factors, according to Alt, include: the level of education in the state, how close the business is to its market and suppliers, who the business is selling to and the overall cost of doing business in the state.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic incumbents running for re-election. One television spot said, \"Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs.\"\n\n \n\n During Sweeney\u2019s tenure the top income tax rate in New Jersey increased twice. Neither of those tax hikes bumped New Jersey into the top spot in the nation for income taxes -- and you can\u2019t solely blame Sweeney for either increase. And the ad\u2019s larger point that high incomes tax rates decreased jobs is overstated.\n\n \n\n We rate this statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
