Government advice states that you are allowed to remove your face-covering in mandatory areas to help someone who may need to lip-read. This is also reflected in health protection legislation which says that assisting someone who needs to lip-read is a reasonable excuse for not wearing a mask. However, the legislation does not say that someone has to remove their mask for someone who lip-reads.\n\nThe group behind the post, the Deafness Resource Centre, told Full Fact that it has recognised that the post is misleading, and will be updating its website and social media with a similar post that contains the correct information.", "lang": "en"}
