While the footage does show flooding in the southern city, it was already circulating online in 2017, a year marked by a deadly storm.\n\nThe short clip shared in a Facebook post on June 11, 2020, has garnered more than 900 shares. It was shot from a moving car, showing severe weather and a massive wave coming from the sea.\n\nThe video was also shared in posts here and here on June 11, 2020, with claims that it showed recent flooding.\n\nA cold front brought snow, gale-force winds and flooding to the Western Cape region earlier this month, leaving several residents of informal settlements in Cape Town homeless.\n\nHowever, this video is not recent. AFP ran a reverse image search on the footage using the InVid WeVerify tool and found various versions of the same video posted in June 2017.\n\nWe also ran a keyword search of the phrase \"Sea Point flood\" on Facebook and traced the earliest post to June 7, 2017.\n\nAn intense storm claimed nine lives, including a three-year-old, when it battered the Western Cape region on June 4, 2017. The severe weather, which followed one of the worst droughts for 100 years, triggered flash flooding and fires, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe earliest version of the video AFP Fact Check found was posted on the Storm Report SA Facebook page and is credited to Gareth Paul Randall. We contacted Randall, who said he received the footage from a friend and \"spent weeks\" trying to contact the person who shot it.\n\n\"The original was sent to me by a friend. One of his friends was the original camera man. He never responded to any messages or calls about the clip,\" he said via Facebook Messenger.\n\nOne photo essay published on June 8, 2017 features a picture with a Shell Select petrol station in the background. The same station can be seen in the video.\n\nAFP also captured some of the bad weather in the region in June 2017 in this photograph below.", "lang": "en"}
