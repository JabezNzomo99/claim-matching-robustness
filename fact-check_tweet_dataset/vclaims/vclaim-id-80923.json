The claim is false; the Twitter handle in the picture is different to Shorten\u2019s verified account and there is no record of Shorten posting such a tweet.\n\nThe misleading screenshot can be seen in this post which has been shared hundreds of times since it was uploaded to Facebook on May 5, when Ramadan started in Australia in 2019.\n\nThe post contains a screenshot of what appears to be a tweet from Shorten saying: \u201cImmigration of people from the Middle East is the future Australia needs\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cHere it is, straight from the horses mouth\u2026 Just rember this come election time, god help us if he gets in!! #aussieseyeonaustralia\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nScreenshots of the apparent tweet have also been shared here on a Facebook page called Australian Conservative Capitalist, gaining nearly 500 shares within 24 hours, as well as on a page called \u201cMake Australia Great Again\u201d, which has more than 10,000 followers.\n\nThe purported tweet has also been shared on multiple other platforms, for example here on microblogging site Gab.\n\nBut the purported tweet is fake; the Twitter account in the image is not the same as Shorten\u2019s verified account.\n\nLabor\u2019s election website features information about Shorten\u2019s background and links to his social media accounts. Clicking on \u201cBill on Twitter\u201d leads to a Twitter account with the handle @billshortenmp.\n\nThe account, started in April, 2010, carries Twitter\u2019s verified blue badge, which the social networking service says \u201clets people know that an account of public interest is authentic\u201d.\n\nThe tweet included in the misleading Facebook post was apparently tweeted from this account with the handle @Billshorten at 12:55 pm on May 4, 2019.\n\nAs of May 6, 2019, the account has been suspended by the social networking company for violating its rules.\n\nBelow of a screenshot of the suspended account:\n\nWhile both accounts show the same profile picture of Shorten and carry Twitter\u2019s blue verified badge, the gap between the account name and the badge is wider on the fake account than the authentic one.\n\nAlso, the badge shown on the fake account sports a lighter shade of blue than the real one.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the fake (L) and real (R) Twitter accounts:\n\nA search of Shorten\u2019s tweets posted between May 3 and 6, 2019, using the formula \u201cfrom:billshortenmp since:2019-05-03 until:2019-05-06\u201d, shows no evidence that the Labor leader posted the tweet included in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nNo tweets were deleted from Shorten\u2019s verified Twitter account @billshortenmp from April 1, 2019 to May 6, 2019, according to record here on Politwoops, an online tool that tracks deleted tweets by public officials.", "lang": "en"}
