The Trump administration has placed the blame squarely on Iran.\n\nFacebook posts shared by tens of thousands tell of an elaborate \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy by top Democrats to \u201cdrag\u201d President Donald Trump into a war with Iran \u2014 despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim. The posts further allege that Trump \u201crecorded\u201d the scheme.\n\nWe found examples of the claim dating back to June 2019, around the time two oil tankers and an unmanned U.S. drone were attacked in the Middle East. Various posts attribute the text to a Facebook user who has shared other claims about the \u201cDeep State.\u201d One post \u2014 a meme with the text and a photo of former Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy that was published in October and is still being circulated \u2014 has more than 28,000 shares.\n\n\u201cDeep State hits two tankers and then shoots down an American drone, which is an act of war,\u201d the text alleges. It then claims that Trump invited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to a White House meeting and relayed the \u201cAmerican response to them which is retaliation using military force.\u201d\n\nIt accuses Pelosi and Schumer of celebrating after the meeting because \u201cthey are deep state and they finally dragged Trump into war.\u201d The false narrative continues by saying Pelosi and Schumer contacted \u201cBrennan\u201d \u2014 presumably former CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 who in turn \u201calerted\u201d Iranian \u201coperatives\u201d to move \u201cas many woman and children into the hit zone as possible.\u201d\n\nThe text concludes: \u201cOnce all this played out and President had it all recorded, President called off the strike.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy theory lacks factual merit and is contradicted by statements by Pelosi and Schumer at the time showing the Democrats were cautioning Trump from becoming entangled militarily with Iran after the drone strike \u2014 not encouraging it.\n\nStill, some users commenting and sharing in recent days expressed belief in the tale. One argued that it was proof that Pelosi \u201ccouldn\u2019t be trusted.\u201d Another said \u201c[t]hese people are completely immoral, hate thier country and the AMERICAN PEOPLE they are supposed to serve.\u201d Some questioned why the purported evidence collected hadn\u2019t been released.\n\nHere is what actually happened, based on known facts:\n\u2022 Two oil tankers, one Japanese and one Norwegian, were attacked on June 13 \u2014 an assault that the U.S. and other countries concluded was carried out by Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. assessment was \u201cbased on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.\u201d Germany said it had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that Iran was responsible.\n\u2022 Days later, on June 20, a U.S. drone was shot down by Iran over the Strait of Hormuz between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Iran claimed the drone was in its airspace, which the U.S. denied.\n\u2022 The same day, Pelosi and Schumer visited the White House for a briefing on the tensions with Iran. A video showed Schumer leaving the White House and doing a celebratory gesture while speaking with Pelosi. A spokesperson for the senator said in a statement that Pelosi had asked Schumer about his mother, who was \u201crushed to the emergency room\u201d a day earlier, and that \u201c Schumer told her he was overjoyed because his mother had just been released from the hospital and is OK.\u201d\n\u2022 Schumer said after the briefing that \u201cthe president may not intend to go to war here, but we are worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war. We told the room that the Democratic position is that Congressional approval must be required before funding any conflict in Iran.\u201d\n\u2022 Trump that day approved military strikes against Iran in retaliation for the drone attack, but then withdrew the plans. On Twitter, Trump said the U.S. was \u201ccocked and loaded to retaliate\u201d on \u201c3 different sights\u201d before he pulled back because a potential death toll of 150 Iranians was not\n\u2022 Pelosi in a June 21 statement said the U.S. \u201cmust calibrate a response that de-escalates and advances American interests.\u201d Her statement added: \u201cWe have no illusions about the dangerous conduct of the Iranian regime. This is a dangerous, high-tension situation that requires a strong, smart and strategic approach.\u201d\n\nWe could find no evidence of the Trump administration ever claiming to have any recordings of Democrats like those described in the viral posts.\n\nIn the months since the drone attack, the conflict between Iran and the U.S had further escalated \u2014 increasing after the U.S. killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani by airstrike in January \u2014 and then tempered.\n\nThe Senate on Feb. 13 approved a resolution to rein in Trump\u2019s ability to go to war with Iran without approval from Congress. The measure is expected to pass the House but to be vetoed by Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
