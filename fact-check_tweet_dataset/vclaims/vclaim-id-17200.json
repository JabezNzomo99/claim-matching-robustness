Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has threatened that if Muslims in India are forced to say \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019, then he would convert all the Hindus in his country to Muslims and also cancel their visas. Fact: Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Salman hasn\u2019t made any such comments. Information from no credible source was found to authenticate the claim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE .\n\nWhen Googled if Saudi Arabia Crown Prince has made any comments as alleged in the post, no relevant information was found. If Prince Salman has made any such bizarre remarks, it would have been reported by all the major newspapers in India and also in Saudi Arabia. But nothing concrete was found on the internet to solidify the claim. It was also checked if he had posted any such news on any of the social media platforms, it was found that he doesn\u2019t have any Facebook or Twitter accounts.\n\nFinally, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince hasn\u2019t threatened to convert all the Hindus in his country to Muslims and also cancel their visas if Indian Muslims are forced to say \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 slogans.\n\nDid you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
