The image is from a 2013 rally in Iran.\n\nFacebook users have spread a meme that falsely presents an anti-America image as if it were taken in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Middle-East where America is hated and terrorists are born,\u201d the meme erroneously claims. \u201cTHIS IS MICHIGAN.\u201d\n\nActually, the image was taken in the Middle East.\n\nThe photo \u2014 depicting several young women in head coverings showing the palms of their hands, on some of which was written \u201cDown with USA\u201d \u2014 was taken at a rally more than five years ago in Iran, reverse image searches make clear.\n\nTaken by Abedin Taherkenareh for the European Pressphoto Agency, the picture appeared in multiple news stories covering the November 2013 rally in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran.\n\nThe protest was one that occurs annually to mark the anniversary of the 1979 start of the Iran hostage crisis, when Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy and held more than 50 Americans hostage for 444 days. The episode derailed diplomatic relations between the countries.\n\nIt is not the first time the image has been presented as if taken domestically.\n\nIn early March, the actor James Woods shared the image in a tweet that suggested it showed people in the U.S. Referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he wrote: \u201c#ICE should roll through this district with every available agent and deport every single #IllegalAlien. Every. Single. One.\u201d\n\nThe tweet earned nearly 10,800 retweets and 23,800 likes.\n\nMichigan is home to one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and the state previously has been targeted by other fictitious stories about Muslims. Last year, for example, a social media post falsely claimed that the city of Dearborn \u2014 home to the largest mosque in the U.S. \u2014 had \u201ccancelled\u201d all Christmas permits. It hadn\u2019t. Dearborn has also publicly refuted false rumors about the existence of Sharia, or Islamic law, in the city.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nCity of Dearborn, Michigan (@cityofdearborn). \u201cThere is no Sharia Law or \u2018Sharia-compliant\u2019 Law in Dearborn. We are proud of our diversity, our community, the State of Michigan our country. We invite you here to visit the real Dearborn!\u201d Twitter. 11 Jul 2018.\n\n\u201cThousands protest at former U.S. embassy in Iran.\u201d Associated Press. 4 Nov 2013.\n\nWoods, James (@RealJamesWoods). \u201c#ICE should roll through this district with every available agent and deport every single #IllegalAlien.
