One such video being shared is of a huge crowd of women protestors taking to the streets and chanting Azadi.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from last year.\n\nFacebook user FB News TV uploaded the protest video with a caption in Hindi that translates to, Thousands of Kashmiris protested on the streets of occupied Kashmir to free their land.\n\nThis post has been shared more than 400 times till the time of filing this report. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Many other Facebook users shared the video with the same claim.\n\nAFWA did a reverse search of the video and found that it was uploaded on Twitter and YouTube in March this year. Putting the YouTube video through InVID fake video debunker, AFWA found that the video was first uploaded on YouTube on December 12, 2018.\n\nAFWA took a closer look at the video and found that towards the end of the 39-second video, a hoarding on a bank says Baramulla Central Co-operative Bank Ltd, Hajin. Looking through a map, AFWA found that this bank is located on the Baramulla-Srinagar highway near Baramulla police station.\n\nThus, it is clear that though the video is from Kashmir, it has no relation with the recent developments in the Valley.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Pak journalist shares misleading pics to claim atrocities on Kashmiris\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: No, Indian Army didn\u2019t burn down houses in Kashmir", "lang": "en"}
