An archived version can be seen here. Santhosh\u2019s tweet had 2.5k retweets and over 13k likes at the time this story was published. Many others shared the same photo and the claim on Twitter and Facebook. An archived version can be seen here. While the photo and the incident is true and the Indian Tricolour was actually projected onto the Matterhorn, the claim shared with the photo is false. The gesture was meant to express solidarity with all Indians in the fight against COVID-19 and had nothing to do with HCQ supply at all.\n\nWe also came across a news article by Financial Express which spoke about the fact that the Matterhorn was being illuminated with flags of major countries everyday. According to the report, Swiss light artist Gerry Hofstetter is responsible for lighting up the mountain with flags of different countries and messages of hope as part of a series to show solidarity with nations fighting COVID-19. As it can be seen, the gesture was one of solidarity and had no relation to the supply of HCQ, although it is true that India will be supplying the drug to countries hit by the coronavirus pandemic. On 7 April, Tuesday, the Government of India decided to partially lift the ban on export of the anti-malarial drug, paving the way for its supply to the US and other countries hit by the coronavirus pandemic, saying India would export Hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol on a case-by-case basis to the countries which have already placed orders for them, after meeting domestic requirements.
