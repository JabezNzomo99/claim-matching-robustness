Claire McCaskill\u2019s campaign says he has broken another. McCaskill campaign manager David Kirby released a statement in response to Hawley\u2019s announcement for Senate, addressing a vow to prosecute public corruption .\n\nDemocrats have accused Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley of breaking more than one promise.\n\nEditor's note, Dec. 7, 2017: The Missouri Democratic Party asked us to take another look at the evidence after this fact check ran in November. The party\u2019s spokeswoman provided us with examples of other units that Josh Hawley created with dedicated staffs. She argued again that the attorney general\u2019s reference to a public corruption \"team,\" rather than \"unit,\" showed Hawley had not fulfilled his promise. We have added those examples, as well as more information from Hawley\u2019s camp. After further review, our rating remains the same.\n\n\"In addition to a public corruption unit, my ethics reform plan would prevent public officials from getting rich off the system, increase transparency, attack the pay-to-play politics of Jefferson City and ban lobbyist gifts to employees within the A.G.\u2019s office \u2014 a ban that should be extended to the Missouri Legislature.\"\n\nWe couldn\u2019t verify that ourselves because that passage no longer exists on Hawley\u2019s website, but the party also pointed us to a quote from a debate Hawley did on 93.9, the Eagle.\n\n\"I have a plan to clean it up. I've announced that I would create a public corruption unit in the office of the Attorney General to coordinate local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, to prosecute, investigate and prosecute these public corruption crimes that have come to characterize Jefferson City and it's time that we took these measures,\" he said on May 17, 2016.\n\n\"There is absolutely no reason he would call the Public Corruption Team a \u2018team\u2019 rather than a \u2018unit,\u2019 other than the fact that it is different than a unit,\" Bernstein said.\n\nHere\u2019s where we have to go back to the original promise. Hawley did not promise to create a public corruption unit \"with dedicated staff.\" He promised to create a public corruption unit to \"take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption.\" Whether he calls it a team or a unit, Hawley\u2019s office provided substantial evidence proving he has done that.\n\nAt the time of Kirby\u2019s statement, the website page listed three cases the team has worked on. It now lists four cases, with the most recent press release dated December 1, 2017. Paradise said there are several other ongoing investigations that are not yet public.\n\nHawley\u2019s office said they find these public corruption cases in three primary ways. They receive tips from government officials and law enforcement, find cases themselves by actively looking for them and receive complaints issued by the Missouri Office of Constituent Services.\n\nBernstein said the party made a Sunshine Request on July 12 for any emails regarding a public corruption unit. The next day, according to the Democratic Party\u2019s timeline, Hawley sent a request that a page be created on his official website.", "lang": "en"}
