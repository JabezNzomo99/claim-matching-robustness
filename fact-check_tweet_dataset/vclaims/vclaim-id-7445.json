Gomez in Chicago posing as a doctor and performing colonoscopies and genital exams on people? No, that's not true: the story was invented by a website that makes up tales about weird crimes and bizarre sex act for entertainment purposes. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on August 21, 2018 titled \"Chicago man who posed as doctor performed colonoscopies, genital exams on patients\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nChicago, IL | A Chicago man who authorities say impersonated a doctor has been arrested and now faces charges of fraud and sexual assault. According to the official police report, Eduardo H. Gomez, 49, disguised himself as a doctor and performed colonoscopies and genital examinations on unsuspecting patients. Gomez apparently wore a white lab coat and a stethoscope and approached patients in various hospitals of the region.\n\nOn social media the story looked like a regular news article:\n\nThis is one of the few cases where reality is even stranger than the hoax: the picture used to illustrate the story actually shows Christopher Pagano, nicknamed \"The Swiss Cheese Pervert\" according to news reports:\n\nSurely that's a better story than a fake doctor?\n\nAnyway, the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: British Man NOT Suffering From Rare Medical Condition, Does NOT Defecate Through His Mouth\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Choke To Death After Fiance Hides Ring In Cake To Propose\n\u2022 Fake News: Vegan Lion Tamer NOT Arrested For Feeding His Animals Only Carrots", "lang": "en"}
