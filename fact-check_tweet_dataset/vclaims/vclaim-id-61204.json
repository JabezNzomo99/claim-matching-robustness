Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin.\n\nWalker, meanwhile, prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes.\n\nIn September 2013, we rated Half True a Minnesota lawmaker\u2019s claim that the Gopher State is \"kicking butt relative to Wisconsin\" on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings.\n\nBut we haven\u2019t, until now, tested claims of an income gap.\n\nGubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 remarks to delegates gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention.\n\n\"As you know,\" Burke said, \"our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin.\"\n\nShe added: \"But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We\u2019re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota.\"\n\nLet\u2019s see if Burke\u2019s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up.\n\nBurke\u2019s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others.\n\n-- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available.\n\n-- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin\u2019s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers\u2019 wages and salaries but \"proprietor\u2019s income\" from self-employment.\n\n-- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor\u2019s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota\u2019s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.\n\nMore about the numbers\n\nIn her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker\u2019s policies are linked to the wage gap.\n\nGiven all the factors that influence a state\u2019s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke\u2019s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker.\n\nThe Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs.\n\nWhen we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker\u2019s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase.\n\nBy any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker\u2019s first two years.\n\nIt grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods.\n\nThe average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent.\n\nThe gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker\u2019s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Wisconsin\u2019s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It\u2019s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase.\n\nBut Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap.\n\nIn combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs.\n\nMinnesota ran up part of its lead on these:\n\nWisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including:\n\nAccording to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area\u2019s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area.\n\nBurke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that \"the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota\" under Walker\u2019s policies.\n\nThe gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it. The gap has grown or held steady in Walker\u2019s time depending on the measuring stick used.\n\nBurke didn\u2019t say Walker created the gap, but the disparity is a longstanding one, and one that existed and grew under governors of both political stripes.\n\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
