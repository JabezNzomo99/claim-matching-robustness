The post is fake and Armstrong is alive, he\u2019s already indicated.\n\n\"Ha, ha,\" Armstrong texted in response to an Austin American-Statesman reporter today. \"Yeah, weird.\"\n\nThe fake story claims Armstrong has died of stage 4 colon cancer. The news allegedly was announced on Facebook by Armstrong\u2019s daughter, Anna.\n\nArmstrong, though, took to social media to debunk the post. As noted by news organizations including the American-Statesman, a May 12, 2017, video post on the one-time world-class bicyclist\u2019s Instagram account shows Armstrong seated behind a car steering wheel and showing, on a phone, the announcement of his death by the fox-news24.com website, and then smiling and shaking his head back and forth, meaning \"naw.\"\n\nBefore noon the same day, Armstrong tweeted out a web link to the video with this message: \"The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.\"\n\nAs our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington noted in April 2017, the fox-news24.com site attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network.\n\nThe fox-news24.com story's citation of Anna helps raise a red flag. Armstrong has no children who go by that name, at least according to a December 2016 Daily Mail news story about an Armstrong family Christmas card.\n\nJust before we completed this fact check, an Armstrong representative, Mark Higgins, answered our inquiry by email: \"I can confirm that he is indeed alive.\"\n\nThe once world-class and still world-famous cyclist remains alive.\n\nWe find this claim (bike) Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
