George Wallace both used the phrase, \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nFormer Alabama Gov. George Wallace made a similar statement in regards to looters, saying, \"Shoot 'em dead on the spot [...] That may not prevent the burning and looting, but it sure will stop it after it starts.\" However, we found no record of Wallace saying, \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" A Miami police chief, however, did use the latter phrase in 1968.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump did use the phrase, \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" in a tweet posted in May 2020.\n\nAround midnight on May 28, 2020, as protests in Minneapolis against police violence and racial discrimination spun out of control, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a pair of tweets on Twitter. The first insulted the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, as \u201cvery weak\u201d and stated that Trump was considering sending the National Guard to the area. The second tweet labeled the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s second tweet came under fire. Many saw the message as an attempt to incite violence or as tacit approval for law enforcement to use lethal force on people committing property crimes. Twitter even placed a warning over Trump\u2019s second tweet saying it violated the social network\u2019s policy on \u201cglorifying violence.\u201d\n\nMany social media users, including former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, also claimed the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who famously tried to stop desegregation of schools in the 1960s, also said in 1968, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump truly used that phrase on May 28, 2020, after people in Minneapolis rioted in protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the days following the killing of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer, we have been unable to verify that Wallace also made the remark in 1968.\n\nReich pointed to a 2005 article published in the Post-Gazette as evidence that Wallace once made the comment. News outlets such as NPR also cited this article when stating that Wallace had also used the phrase, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the Post-Gazette article quoting Wallace reportedly saying it:\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve been unable to find any contemporaneous reports of Wallace using the phrase. News reports about Wallace\u2019s trip to Pittsburgh\u2019s Civic Arena in 1968 did say that the event was contentious and that Wallace verbally sparred with hecklers and protesters. However, these articles did not report that Wallace made this comment about looters.\n\nAlthough we found no news articles from the 1960s reporting Wallace had uttered this exact phrase, we did find two items of note. First, Wallace made a similar statement in which he called for looters to be shot dead on the spot. Second, we found that a Miami police chief, Walter Headley, also used the phrase.\n\nIn September 1967, Los Angeles Times published an article entitled \u201cWallace Would End Rioting With Bullets,\u201d which quoted the former governor saying: \u201cBam, shoot \u2019em dead on the spot! Shoot to kill if anyone throws a rock at a policeman or throws a Molotov cocktail. Don\u2019t shoot any children, just shoot that adult standing beside the kid that throws the rock. That may not prevent the burning and looting, but it sure will stop it after it starts.\u201d\n\nAccording to another news clipping, Headley once said that he had let the word trickle down to his officers that, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the claim that Wallace said, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d stems from a single article published in 2005 about something the former Alabama governor supposedly said four decades prior. However, we have been unable to find any contemporaneous reports quoting him to that effect. Because Wallace truly made similar statements about using lethal force on looters, and because a police chief once used the phrase around the same time in the 1960s, it seems reasonable to assume that the Post-Gazette misremembered Wallace\u2019s statement and incorrectly attributed Headley\u2019s remark to the former Alabama governor.", "lang": "en"}
