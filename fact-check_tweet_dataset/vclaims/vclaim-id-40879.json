We contacted Danik Jagran who confirmed that the article in the viral clipping is fake.\n\nAlok Mishra, Editor of Dainik Jagran, Patna edition told BOOM that no such news had been published by the paper saying, \"someone has falsely attributed it to Dainik Jagran's name. Neither our masthead is like this nor this font is being used in our newspaper. The viral paper also shows the dateline in English which is not according to Dainik Jagran's style sheet. This baseless news has nothing to do with Dainik Jagran.'\"\n\nBOOM has previously fact-checked fake newspaper clippings that had been created using a newspaper generator tool.
