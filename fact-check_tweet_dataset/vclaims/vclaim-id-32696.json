Many thought that Aamir, who always makes meaningful movies with a profound message, was an atheist and wanted to discourage people from wasting time in religion, worships etc.\n\nNo. He has no problem with religion. He is just as religious as you and me, perhaps more. He has problems with Mandir-going religion and Shiva, Hanuman and Krishna.\n\nBut this behavior is not communal. Keep eyes shut and hail secularism.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Don\u2019t believe this picture of Swara Bhaskar holding placard on CAA\u2026\n\nWe fact-checked the picture as well as the elements listed in the original picture. The picture that shows Aamir Khan at Hajj in Mecca is from 2012 when he went there with his mother.\n\nThat picture, from his real life, is compared to pictures of him as an actor in the movie PK.\n\n The post also states that Aamir Khan has presented himself as an atheist \u2013 to which we found no truth. In an interview with The Times of India, Khan\u2019s wife says she is an atheist.\n\nHence the images have been collaborated in a misleading way with a communal angle and contains factually incorrect information.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
