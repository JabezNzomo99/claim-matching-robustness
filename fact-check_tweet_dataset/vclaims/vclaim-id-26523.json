Duque or Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez is the current President of Colombia.\n\nAnother clue in the video is a can that has the word \u201cTronador D\u201d imprinted on it. We found that Tronador D is a herbicide developed for the control of broad herbaceous and semi-woody broad weeds in pastures. Details about the herbicide were found on the website of a Colombian company that produces agricultural products.\n\nA reverse-search of one of the frames of the video on Google led us to a Spanish website that had penned an article on the video. Though the website does not confirm the location of the incident, it says that water from Magdalena River in Colombia was mixed in milk.\n\nAlt News, however, also found that other claims suggesting that the alleged adulteration of milk took place in Manaus, Brazil. This was asserted by Roma News, a Portuguese website which said that the incident happened in the municipality of Autazes in Amazonas, Brazil.\n\nWhile the exact location of the video could not be ascertained, it is clear that the incident did not take place in India due to the presence of the Tronador D container. The pesticide is not available for sale in India. Furthermore, there is also no conclusive evidence which proves that the man was mixing the dirty water in milk and not some other white coloured liquid.\n\n[This article was updated on August 20, 2019 to include the false claim viral in Punjabi.]", "lang": "en"}
