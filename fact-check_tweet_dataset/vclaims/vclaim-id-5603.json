The idea that there's going to be a European air force, a European army, it is simply not true.\" \"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of a European army\" \"The EU has a long record of creating institutions through the 'back door' and the creation of a EU Army will be no different. All of a sudden, the British public will be presented with a 'done deal' and British troops will find themselves operating under the EU flag rather than the Union flag.\"\n\nThe EU doesn\u2019t currently have an army. It does encourage military co-operation between member countries, which already run joint operations under an EU banner, and some European politicians would like to see this take the form of stand-alone EU armed forces.\n\nMember countries would have a veto on any such plans, so the UK would only take part if it chose to.\n\nEuropean military force is still a matter for national governments\n\nThe EU doesn\u2019t have the legal power to act in this area unless member governments actively give their permission.\n\nThe EU treaties do allow for \u201cthe progressive framing of a common defence policy that might lead to a common defence\u201d.\n\nBut this \u201ccommon defence\u201d will only come about \u201cwhen the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides\u201d. Unlike in other areas of EU decision-making, the European Commission can\u2019t propose laws about security and defence, and any decisions in these areas must be made unanimously.\n\nThat means that the UK effectively has a veto.\n\nUK law also states that no such common EU defence powers can be handed from the UK to the EU without the approval of parliament and a referendum on the decision. So the government would need the support of both the public and MPs before they could make such a decision.\n\nThe treaties don\u2019t say what \u201ccommon defence\u201d means exactly. Presumably, while you could have a \u201ccommon defence\u201d without an EU army, creation of an EU army couldn\u2019t happen without a \u201ccommon defence\u201d being formally approved by each individual government.\n\nSo while UKIP is correct to say that there\u2019s supposed to be a gradual development of shared responsibilities in this area, an EU army couldn\u2019t be brought into existence without the agreement of the UK (and other EU member countries, many of which reportedly don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea).\n\nThe UK\u2019s position on an EU army\n\nThe government\u2019s position is that: \u201cThe Prime Minister has been clear that the UK will never be part of a European Army. We have consistently said that we will oppose any measures which would undermine member states' competence for their own military forces, or lead to competition and duplication with NATO, which is the cornerstone of our defence\u201d.\n\nThe EU already runs military operations, based on armies working together\n\nWhen people talk about an \u201cEU army\u201d, they seem to mean armed forces recruited by, and under the central command of, an EU organisation which could deploy them as it sees fit.\n\nMilitary operations are already managed at EU level. The first of these began in 2003 in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under the control of the EU Political and Security Committee of member countries\u2019 ambassadors. Other operations followed in the Congo, and Bosnia Herzegovina in 2004\u2014that one is still going on.\n\nThe EU currently has six ongoing military operations in non-EU countries, and another dozen \u2018civilian missions\u2019.\n\nAn important difference between these operations and an \u201cEU army\u201d is that they rely on member countries to provide the boots on the ground. The Union doesn\u2019t directly employ soldiers.\n\nIts military operations, and stand-by \u2018Battlegroups\u2019, are formed from various armies working together.\n\nOn a practical level, this shows up in soldiers on EU missions wearing EU badges on their regular army uniforms.\n\nIn terms of high-level organisation, the EU Military Committee is made up of Chiefs of Defence from each country. The EU Military Staff reporting to it are on secondment from the armed forces of member states\u2014the European Commission told us that the dozen UK military personnel on the Military Staff \u201cremain employees of the UK Government\u201d.\n\nEU military operations are also financed from a separate pot of money from the centralised EU budget.\n\nEU member states can have closer cooperation between their armies\n\nMember countries who want greater defence cooperation can work together without the involvement or backing of all members. This is referred to as \u2018permanent structured cooperation\u2019.\n\nThese countries can then coordinate on a number of areas including operational planning, training and sharing equipment.\n\nLeave campaigners have claimed that the UK would be forced into an \u2018EU army\u2019 under the rules allowing for these activities.\n\nBut even if you think this kind of cooperation amounted to an EU army, which isn\u2019t clear, it\u2019s entirely optional. Member countries also have the option to leave these agreements further down the line if they wish to.\n\nSo far no EU countries have taken up this option.\n\nSome people would like an EU army, but there aren\u2019t concrete plans for one\n\nProposals reported in May 2016 as \u201cthe first step towards an EU army\u201d referred to a push for permanent structured cooperation, to be tabled after the UK membership referendum.\n\nThere are plenty more examples of EU politicians pushing for more defence integration.\n\nProposals put forward in 2013 involved \u201cassets directly purchased, owned and operated by the Union\u201d, although the EU said that this referred to non-military equipment.\n\nThese mirror the desire of the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for \u201cat least some integrated defence capacities\u201d. He\u2019s also made a more specific call for a joint EU army, in an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.\n\nA paper published by his European People\u2019s Party political grouping called for \u201can EU strategic civilian and military headquarters\u201d and, in the long run, \u201cEuropean stand-by forces under Union command\u201d.\n\nSo we know that some players on the EU political scene would like the Union to be able to use military force on its own. Accordingly, experts in European issues and defence policy have been debating whether or not it\u2019s realistic and a good idea.\n\nBut, politically, it seems a fairly distant prospect at present. The 2013 proposals we mentioned, for instance, were welcomed by the European Council of national leaders on the pointed condition \u201cthat the capabilities are owned and operated by the Member States\u201d.\n\nThe European Council has given defence and security policy more attention recently. After a recent meeting, it said that the EU should be doing things like \u201cfostering greater and more systematic European defence cooperation to deliver key capabilities, including through EU funds\u201d.\n\nWhile this suggests that countries will work more closely together in future, it\u2019s not a resounding call for an EU army.", "lang": "en"}
