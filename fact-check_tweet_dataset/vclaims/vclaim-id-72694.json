The video does show a raid on illegal workers, but the footage is four years old and has no connection to the polls.\n\nThe five-minute video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here where it has been viewed nearly 650,000 times since it was posted January 18.\n\nIt has also been viewed nearly 200,000 times since it was posted here on the \u201cPendukung#2019GantiPresiden\u201d page, which supports Prabowo Subianto, the sole challenger to incumbent Joko Widodo, in Indonesia\u2019s upcoming presidential elections.\n\nThe post\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cA raid on illegal workers from China carried out hastily just ahead of the presidential election to disprove what has been publicly declared a hoax.\u201d\n\nWidodo has repeatedly rejected claims that Indonesia has been flooded with millions of undocumented workers from China, according to this Jakarta Post report.\n\nOne comment on the Facebook post said: \u201cEverything done by the current administration is only aimed at attracting voters because the election is imminent. Why did the government not do this raid in previous years? Many people have reported similar cases yet nothing was done by the government to respond. For sure, I will vote for Prabowo on April 17.\u201d\n\nBut the video does not show a recent raid on illegal Chinese workers.\n\nAFP used multiple keyframes from the video obtained using digital verification tool InVid and found the footage was taken from this clip uploaded by Indonesia\u2019s manpower ministry to their official YouTube channel on March 18, 2015 and titled: \u201c[ANGRY..!!] When manpower minister Hanif Dhakiri nabs illegal foreign workers.\u201d\n\nThe clip\u2019s description says it shows a team from the ministry arresting five undocumented workers from China at a mining site in South Kalimantan province on March 14, 2015.\n\nAt 1:22 in the video, a blue banner appears with text saying: \u201cA raid by the manpower minister at the PT Merge Mining Industry\u2019s mining site in Banjar regency, South Kalimantan, Saturday, March 14. The arrested illegal workers are from China.\u201d\n\nThe banner can also be seen at 1:22 in the clip featured on the false Facebook posts.\n\nBelow are the screenshots comparing the exact moment from the two clips.", "lang": "en"}
