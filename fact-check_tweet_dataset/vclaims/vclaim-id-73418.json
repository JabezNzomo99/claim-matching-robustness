Eighteen people died in the mishap and over 150 others were injured. Malayalam channel Manorama News, during its August 10 bulletin, played a video claiming that it shows the cockpit of flight IX-1344. The relevant portion can be watched onward 15:13 minutes.\n\nA Twitter user claimed that the video is widely circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News has also received verification requests for the video on its official mobile application and WhatsApp number (+917600011160).\n\nFacebook page ALIF News \u2013 India shared the video with the caption, \u201cReality of Kerala Plane Crash,\u201d drawing over 19,000 views.\n\nThe video is not genuine but a simulation clip. A keyword search \u2018Air India Express flight crash\u2019 takes one to the original video uploaded by YouTube channel \u2018MPC Flight Recreations\u2019 on August 7. The description of the video reads, \u201cThis is a video simulation with real data of Air India Express flight 1344, a Boeing 737 registration VT-AXH from Dubai to Calicut Airport, on august 7, 2020.\u201d\n\nThe part aired by Manorama News can be seen at 1:43 minutes.\n\nThe top right corner of the video carries the words \u2018academic license\u2019 which indicates that the video was created using a software. Academic licenses are for educational products and are generally given to students or educational institutes.\n\nTherefore, Malayalam daily Manorama News played a simulation video claiming that the channel \u201creceived visuals\u201d of the cockpit of the Air India Express flight that crashed on August 7. Earlier, Mathrubhumi had reported that 40 passengers of the flight tested COVID positive. This was denied by Malappuram Collector.\n\nUpdate: Manorama News sent a clarification on their broadcast after Alt News Fact Check was published. The same has been added below.\n\n\u201cWe had collected various visuals/simulations as models and filed them for reference. On the 10th of August, we got a still from the cockpit of the ill-fated plane. The news was based on this still. The news also clearly has details about the still like the position of the thrust lever, flap, the engine still functioning etc. We only intended to give details in the news based on this still. But inadvertently a visual which was stored for reference was used in the story. The oversight was immediately noted by our own team after the story went on air and it was withdrawn. Also, a fresh story was aired from the next bulletin. A link to the news story aired is attached for reference.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
