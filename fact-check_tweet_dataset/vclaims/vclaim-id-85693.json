BOOM found that the photo is from 2017 when a man identified as Osiur Rehman, a Rohingya Muslim walked for days, carrying his mother on his back, from Myanmar to Bangladesh.\n\nThe photo is being shared in India at a time when hundreds of migrants workers in the country are walking back to their home states. Workers are walking thousands of kilometres from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu to their homes mostly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa. The Union and the state governments have received heavy criticism for not providing timely assitance and transport arrangement to the workers. In a shocking incident in Aurangabad in Maharashtra, a freight train ran over 15 migrant workers who reportedly fell asleep on the tracks, exhausted after having walked for days. Recently, the central government announced special trains from major states to ferry migrant workers.\n\nThe viral image of an old man walking with his mother on his back and weeping while he does so, was shared on Twitter with captions claiming the photo is of migrants workers from India who have been ignored by the governments.\n\nThe Indian National Congress' Scheduled Caste wing tweeted the photo with a caption asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi whether he could see their 'helplessness'\n\n\n\nEconomist Rupa Subramanya and journalist Swati Chaturvedi shared a collage of three photos with two pictures of migrants from India and the third being the photo of the Rohingya Muslim.\n\nFACT CHECK\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the photo is of a Rohingya Muslim man carrying his mother, having fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh during the crisis in 2017.\n\nA reverse image search showed results from a story published on Pressenza, an international news site on November 8, 2017 titled about Rohingya Muslims.
