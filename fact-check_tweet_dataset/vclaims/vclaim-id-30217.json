Calvin and Hobbes follows a six-year-old boy, Calvin, and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, as they explore the world around them. Bill Watterson, the creator of the comic, drew 3,160 strips over ten years and notably refused to license his characters for commercial purposes.\n\nOften, when world events prompt scenarios under which U.S. troops may be sent into harm\u2019s way, one particular \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d strip related to the issue of military conflict is circulated online, typically followed by queries about its authenticity:\n\nEven viewers familiar with \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d have sometimes questioned the legitimacy of this particular cartoon, feeling it to be atypical of Watterson\u2019s work. And since it\u2019s not uncommon to see comic strips that have been altered to replace the original dialogue with political messages, such skepticism is not out of place.\n\nHowever, in this case the panel seen above is neither altered nor out of character with the artist\u2019s body of work \u2014 it is an accurate reproduction of a \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d strip originally published on Feb. 18, 1991.", "lang": "en"}
