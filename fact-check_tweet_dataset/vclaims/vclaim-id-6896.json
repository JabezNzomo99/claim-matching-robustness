Ten UN Security Council members voted for resolution recognizing these atrocities as an act of genocide. Russia vetoed the resolution. Serbs made up one-fourth of the deaths in the 1990\u2019s Balkans conflicts.

Security Council resolution proposed jointly by Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland and the United States in 2015 calling for the actions of Serbian troops during the war in the Balkans to be recognized as \u201cthe crime of genocide, proven war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nOn July 8, 2015, ten out of fifteen U.N. Security Council members voted for the resolution, four abstained and Russia vetoed it.\n\nBased on documentary evidence, including photos and videos, the U.N. estimated that there were thousands of cases of sexual violence -- with victims on all sides --during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including at Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb troops executed 8,372 boys and men in just five days in July 1995. This happened despite the fact that Srebrenica was declared a \u201csafe area\u201d for refugees under United Nations protection.\n\nThe events described in the draft resolution took place in the Balkans during the series of violent conflicts in the 1990s, amid the breakup of Yugoslavia into independent states. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions from their homes. It was followed by the Kosovo conflict, which broke out after the province\u2019s majority Albanian population called for independence from Serbia.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress adopted resolutions describing the Srebrenica crimes as genocide.\n\nIn 2010, the Serbian Parliament issued a declaration apologizing for the Srebrenica massacre.\n\nAleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s description of the Serbs as the victims who suffered the most is not new: in fact, it echoes ex-Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, whose nationalist propaganda reportedly played a major role in the mass atrocities Serbian troops committed during the war.\n\nAs for Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s description of the Serbs as the \u201cthe people who suffered the most over the last century,\u201d according the \u201cBosnian Book of Dead,\u201d an independent study conducted by the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo in the mid-2000s, 97,207 people were killed in the Bosnian war, 25 percent of whom were Serbs, 8 percent Croatians and 65 percent Bosnian Muslims.\n\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholars estimate 169 million people were victims of mass atrocities worldwide in the 20th century and Serbs were among the victims.\n\nAt the epicenter at beginning of World War I, there is little doubt the Serb population was one of many that suffered among the worst atrocities committed by invading armies. The World War I encyclopedia managed by Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin in Germany reports on the brutality of the Austro-Hungarian invaders who \u201ctreated the entire Serb civilian population as combatants or participants.\u201d While the scholars say the extent of atrocities is not fully researched, estimates of the civilian death toll ranged from 3,500 up to 30,000.\n\nDuring World War II, the fascist Ustasa government of Croatia slaughtered, by some estimates up to 2 million Serbs, Roma, and Jews in Croatia \u2013 \u201ckillings that were so brutal they appalled even the Nazis,\u201d according to Globalsecurity.org, an oft-cited compilation of scholarship and military information and history. In Serbia, the German puppet regime tried to \u201creign in the violence,\u201d though Nazi reprisals continued against the resistance.\n\nThe 1990\u2019s wars over the breakup of Yugoslavia are considered to be \u201cthe bloodiest\u201d since World War II. The Bosnia Serb push to create the Republika Srpska began \u201cwith the idea of creating an ethnically pure Serbian enclave in northern and eastern Bosnia.\u201d The \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Muslim enclaves resulted in \u201cEurope\u2019s first concentration camps since World War II.\u201d While Croat and Muslim forces committed similar acts, there were \u201cmassive counts of rape and sexual assault of Muslim women\u201d and \u201cmass executions of Muslim men and boys of military age.\u201d The Srebrenica massacre is the \u201cmost infamous\u201d of these reports.\n\nIt is with this background context that Vu\u010di\u0107 thanked the Putin government for it\u2019s 2015 veto of the U.N. genocide resolution.", "lang": "en"}
