It is being claimed that Indian Army \"thrashed the boy with sticks and broadcast his sobbing through a loudspeaker to terrorise villagers\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the viral photo is misleading. The photo is actually of a five-year-old girl named Asma Jaan who was shot by militants in Kashmir.\n\nFacebook page \"Green Battalion\" uploaded the image with the caption, \"The #IndianArmy soldiers smashed his body with sticks, kicked him in the ribs & broadcast his sobbing please for mercy from #loudspeakers on the road, terrorizing his village. They ransacked his house & dumped his supply of rice, flour & kerosene into a water tank. #Kashmir.\"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nTo verify the claim, we ran a reverse search on the viral photo. We found a news article published on September 15, 2019, detailing the incident. As per media reports, four masked men entered a house in Kashmir's Sopore town carrying pistols and took three men into the sitting room. Furious over the violation of their ban on wealthy apple traders doing business, they shot them in the leg.\n\nOn hearing the screams of her father, five-year-old Asma Jaan ran into the room, but militants shot her too. She is out of danger but will take months to recover.\n\nThus it is clear that the claim of Indian Army thrashing this \"boy\" is not true; the girl was shot by militants in Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
