The document comes with the lines, \"In the said notification, for the words and figures \"the 1st day of April 2020, the words, figures and letters \"the1st day of July 2020\" shall be substituted.\"\n\nThere are also users of Twitter who are asking, and even tweeting about this.\n\nSeveral arms of the government took to Twitter to clarify that the notification issued was being misinterpreted, and that the financial year is not being extended to July 1.\n\nThe finance ministry clarified through a series of tweets clarified that the gazette pertained to postponing the implementations of certain amendments of the Indian Stamp Act is being misquoted as an extension of the financial year.\n\nThe amendments to the stamp act puts in place a mechanism to collect stamp duty on security market instruments through stock exchanges and clearing corporations. This amendment was initially supposed to come into effect on April 1 - the start of the fiscal year. But keeping the circumstances created by the lockdown in mind, these initiatives have been postponed to July 1.\n\nThe gazette can be found with the central government's gazette repository here. \n\n\n\nEarlier, the finance ministry also gave respite to compliance ending on April 1, and announced \u20b91,70,000 crore relief package, outlining food and monetary support for the stakeholders of the economy.", "lang": "en"}
