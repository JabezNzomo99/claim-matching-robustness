Thanks thanks.\u201d\n\nThe facts: There is still no confirmed case of the 2019 nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH).\n\nHowever, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing that there are a total of 27 persons under investigation as of 1:30 pm, January 28. Three of them have already been discharged as they tested positive not for 2019-nCoV but for other diseases.\n\nThe Makati Medical Center reiterated the DOH warning against posting unconfirmed information about the novel coronavirus in a post on its official Facebook account. It was shared at 1:36 pm on January 27, or when the message about an alleged confirmed case started to spread.\n\nRappler has so far debunked 3 claims since the novel coronavirus outbreak. On January 15, a false claim about a \u201cSARS case\u201d reported in a clinic at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong City came out. More than a week later, another false claim circulated, that there are \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d of coronavirus at the PBCom Tower in Makati. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
