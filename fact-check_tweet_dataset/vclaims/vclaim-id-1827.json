It also covers things like treating people who are here on holiday and have broken a leg, or an expat who has come back to the UK to see a trusted doctor.\n\nSo is \u00a3500 million being spent every year treating health tourists?\n\nNo. It\u2019s estimated that \u00a3100 to \u00a3300 million a year is spent on patients who come to the UK to use the NHS deliberately.\n\nAnother \u00a31.8 billion a year is estimated to be spent on people who happen to end up needing medical treatment when they are here.\n\nBut there are certain services which the NHS can\u2019t charge for at the moment, even if you don\u2019t normally live in the UK. This includes emergency treatment or going to visit a GP. So even if the NHS charged for all the services it possibly could and received the money, it wouldn\u2019t cover the full amount health tourism is estimated to cost.\n\nLooking at the services that can be charged for, the government aims for about \u00a3500 million a year to be recovered by 2017/18. That\u2019s from both the people who deliberately come to the UK to use the NHS, and those who just happen to use it when they\u2019re in the UK.\n\nThe most senior civil servant at the Department of Health told a committee of MPs in November that the \u00a3500 million figure represented \u201cthe expectation of the sort of step change we wanted the system to make. As I say, the ultimate target is, as various people said, to pay what should be paid\u201d.\n\nWhere will the \u00a3500 million come from?\n\nThe \u00a3500 million can be broken down into three separate bits. There is \u00a3200 million which the government wants to recover by more effectively identifying citizens of countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) who use the NHS and charging their home countries through schemes like the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).\n\nAnother \u00a3200 million would come from a \u2018health surcharge\u2019 for non-EEA citizens. This was introduced in 2015 and is paid by students or temporary immigrants when they apply for visas lasting longer than six months.\n\nFinally, \u00a3100 million would come from improving the way non-EEA immigrants are charged for any non-emergency hospital care they receive. This would only apply to those who hadn\u2019t paid the surcharge. Such patients are usually invoiced after treatment.\n\nAround \u00a3289 million was charged to people not eligible for free NHS treatment in 2015/16. Of this, \u00a3164 million came from the new \u2018health surcharge\u2019, \u00a356 million was charged to EEA countries on behalf of their citizens and \u00a369 million was charged to non-EEA citizens. We don\u2019t know how much of these last two amounts has actually been received yet.\n\nHow much will be charged next year?\n\nThe government has estimated the NHS will actually be able to charge \u00a3346 million to patients not eligible for free treatment in 2017/18. The National Audit Office says that the difference between this estimate and the \u00a3500 million aim \u201cis mainly because income through the EHIC scheme has not increased as fast as the Department expected\u201d.\n\nThe government announced on 6 February that it would be changing the rules this year to ensure that hospitals have to find out if patients are eligible for free treatment and charge them up front if not.", "lang": "en"}
