Coffman really is a \u2018combat veteran\u2019", "subtitle": "Coffman's background as combat veteran checks out, but many others who use that term haven't fought in open fire.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-02-23T08:00:25Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81304", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/23/rep-coffman-really-is-a-combat-veteran-despite-dispute-over-the-term/", "vclaim": "When grilled by Coffman on whether progress has been made since McDonald took office and whether he has changed the culture of mismanagement and unethical behaviors at the VA, the new chief responded in defense of his record: \u201cI ran a large company, sir, what have you done?\u201d\n\nThis \u201cOh, snap!\u201d moment went viral, and Coffman issued a statement about his own credentials in response, including that he is a Marine Corps combat veteran. Coffman\u2019s spokesman Tyler Sandberg noted again to our colleagues at In the Loop that Coffman is a combat veteran who served in both Iraq wars, and took another jab at McDonald\u2019s performance in his first six months on the job. Veterans groups also criticized McDonald for being disrespectful to a 22-year veteran who served in two wars. (McDonald himself is an Army veteran.)\n\nA reader asked The Fact Checker to confirm Coffman\u2019s combat experience. The reader, who identified himself as a veteran, wrote: \u201cThe usage of the term \u2018combat veteran\u2019 was normally only applied to a soldier who actually directly engaged the enemy and received fire as a member of a unit assigned to combat operations. The remaining veterans served in a combat zone, but were not actual combat veterans.\u201d\n\nThe question piqued our interest. Coffman has repeatedly been described a combat veteran. Others who have done so, like Joni Ernst, recently have been criticized for using the term while not having engaged in firefights.\n\nFor his first deployment, Coffman earned the Combat Action Ribbon, awarded to Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard members who participated in ground or surface combat and \u201crendered satisfactory performance under enemy fire.\u201d In short, people who receive this award have been shot at and had the opportunity to fire back. (In 2012, the requirements were changed to include those who had direct exposure to or worked to disable improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.)\n\nDan Caldwell, legislative director for Concerned Veterans for America and former Marine, said the generally accepted use of the term is for those who were \u201cwith a unit, in the military, on the ground, and you were supporting or directly engaged in military effort against an enemy in Iraq or Afghanistan or another combat zone.\u201d\n\nFor tax purposes, the term technically can apply to any veteran who served in a combat zone, which are established through executive order. The designation allows military members to exclude military pay from federal income taxes. The Combat Zone Tax Exclusion was created to exempt members from income tax increases to fund World War I and II, according to a Defense Department report.\n\nWhen it comes to VA benefits, the definition is narrower. The VA provides health benefits for veterans who confirm they served in theater combat, by showing documentation that shows they received a combat service medal, hostile fire pay, imminent danger pay or tax benefits. But the veteran also must meet other criteria, such as serving at least 24 continuous months or being discharged under honorable conditions.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is, did somebody blatantly misrepresent their service \u2014 i.e., ribbons they didn\u2019t rate, lying about things they didn\u2019t actually experience, and even the larger issues of, \u2018What are the larger strategic implications behind the combat that they supposedly are engaging or aren\u2019t\u2019?\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cWe, as a veteran community, sometimes get hung up on these things that, at the end of the day, don\u2019t make a big difference.\u201d\n\nThere are many uses of the term \u201ccombat veteran.\u201d The broadest sense of the word \u2014 that a member served in active duty in a geographical area designated as a combat zone \u2014 is used for tax exemption purposes. A narrower definition is used for veterans to receive health benefits. It is a vague title that can be interpreted in different ways within the veteran community.\n\nBut when it comes to Coffman\u2019s record, he is a combat veteran in the most literal and widely-understood use of the term. The criteria for the Combat Action Ribbon that Coffman received requires proof he was in actual combat operations. Without having been there with him, this is the best measure to confirm his experience. We award Coffman the elusive Geppetto Checkmark.", "lang": "en"}
