He wasn\u2019t talking about the U.S. using nuclear weapons in war.\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cPresidential,\u201d comes from Priorities USA Action, a liberal super PAC supporting presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The multimillion-dollar ad buy, set to air in eight swing states, says that Trump is \u201ctoo dangerous for America.\u201d\n\nTrump did say that he \u201cloves war, in a certain way,\u201d at a campaign rally in Iowa last year. He made the comment after he said that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claimed to have weapons of mass destruction as a strategy \u201cto scare\u201d Iran.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s \u201cincluding with nukes\u201d comment was unrelated to that and came several months later. He said that during an April 3 interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace. Trump suggested that Japan might need to acquire nuclear weapons to defend against neighboring North Korea, which does possess nuclear weapons.\n\nWallace, April 3: You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula? Trump: In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes. Trump: It\u2019s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea. Trump: Maybe they would be better off \u2014 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes. Trump: South Korea is right next door, just so you understand. Wallace: But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula. Trump: You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, in that exchange, that Trump wasn\u2019t talking about the U.S. using nuclear weapons, and he wasn\u2019t saying that he \u201cloves\u201d nuclear war.\n\nBut Trump has previously said that he wouldn\u2019t ever rule out using nuclear weapons as president. That\u2019s a point that Priorities USA Action spokesman Justin Barasky made in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nAt an MSNBC town hall in March, when asked by moderator Chris Matthews about the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State terrorist group in the Middle East or even in Europe, Trump said that \u201cI\u2019m not going to take it off the table\u201d even though \u201cnuclear should be off the table.\u201d\n\nTrump, March 30: Look, nuclear should be off the table. But would there be a time when it could be used, possibly, possibly? Matthews: OK. The trouble is, when you said that, the whole world heard it. David Cameron in Britain heard it. The Japanese, where we bombed them in \u201945, heard it. They\u2019re hearing a guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons. Nobody wants to hear that about an American president. Trump: Then why are we making them? Why do we make them? We had (inaudible). Matthews: Because of the old mutual assured destruction, which Reagan hated and tried to get rid of. Trump: (inaudible) I was against Iraq. I\u2019d be the last one to use the nuclear weapon. Matthews: So can you take it off the table now? Trump: Because that\u2019s sort of like the end of the ballgame. Matthews: Can you tell the Middle East we\u2019re not using a nuclear weapon on anybody? Trump: I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table. Matthews: How about Europe? We won\u2019t use it in Europe? Trump: I \u2014 I\u2019m not going to take it off the table. Matthews: You might use it in Europe? Trump: No, I don\u2019t think so. But I\u2019m not taking \u2026 Matthews: Well, just say it. \u201cI will never use a nuclear weapon in Europe.\u201d Trump: I am not \u2014 I am not taking cards off the table.\n\nIt\u2019s not our place to say whether a potential U.S. president should or should not talk about using nuclear weapons in war. However, Trump saying that he would not rule out using nuclear weapons as president is not the same thing as saying, \u201cI love war, in a certain way \u2026 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\u201d That\u2019s what someone might wrongly think Trump said, given the way the ad uses the two quotes one after the other.\n\nBarasky disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to anyone that these are different clips and there\u2019s no suggestion all 5 are one statement,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nViewers can be the judge of that. But the two Trump quotes come in quick succession in the ad, and there\u2019s no context given for the \u201cnukes\u201d comment.", "lang": "en"}
