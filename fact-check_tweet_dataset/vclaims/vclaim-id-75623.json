The state\u2019s crime rate\u2013crimes registered per 100,000 population\u2013against SCs was fifth of 26 states and union territories that registered such atrocities (Madhya Pradesh topped the list at 45.1%).\n\nGujarat\u2019s conviction rate for atrocities against SCs was 4.7% in 2016, substantially below the national average of 27.3% and 60% in Uttar Pradesh, the state that reported most atrocities against SCs.\n\nFour Dalits attacked in less than 10 days\n\nA 17-year old Dalit boy was stabbed by unidentified men in Gujarat\u2019s Gandhinagar on October 3, 2017, for sporting a moustache, Indian Express reported on October 3, 2017.\n\nThis is the third such incident in less than 10 days.

By population, the state ranks 14th among these provinces.\n\nGujarat is home to four million scheduled castes or 7% of the state\u2019s population.\n\nAs many as 1,321 atrocities against SCs were reported in Gujarat in 2016, or almost four every day, according to this reply (unstarred question 1170) to the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) on July 26, 2017, based on data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).\n\nAtrocities reported against SCs in Gujarat increased 31%\u2013from 1,009 cases in 2015 to 1,321 in 2016, the data show.\n\nNote: Figures for 2016 are provisional; *Crime Rate is incidence of crime per 100,000 SC population; crime rate calculation is on method used by NCRB based on Census 2011.\n\nAtrocities reported against SCs across the country increased 6%\u2013from 38,564 in 2015 to 41,014 in 2016.\n\nUttar Pradesh topped the list with 10,457 cases, followed by Bihar (5,701), Rajasthan (5,134), Madhya Pradesh (5,123) and Andhra Pradesh (2,343). The top five states accounted for 70% of all atrocities reported against SCs.\n\nThe NCRB classifies crimes against SCs and Scheduled Tribes (STs) under three heads: Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955; SC/ST(Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Indian Penal Code crimes against SCs (in which SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act not applied).\n\nNCRB also records crime under \u201cThe Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1923\u201d and \u201cOther Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes\u201d.\n\nIn other words, \u2018atrocities against SCs\u2019 is a sub-head under \u2018crimes against SCs\u2019 which covers all crimes reported against SCs under various sub-heads.\n\nCrimes against SCs in India down 4% in 2015; down 7% in Gujarat\n\nCrimes against SCs declined 4% to 45,003 in 2015 from 47,064 in 2014 in India, NCRB data show.\n\nAs many as 1,046 crimes against SCs were reported in Gujarat in 2015, of which 1,009 were reported under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 36 under other SLL crimes and one under Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.\n\nThe crime rate for atrocities against SCs in Gujarat was 24.8% in 2015, above the national average of 19.2%.\n\nGoa reported the highest crime rate at 51.1%, followed by Rajasthan (48.4%) and Bihar (38%).\n\nThere was a correction in figures submitted by Gujarat to National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) on crime against Dalits last year, The Hindu reported on July 25, 2016.\n\nCrimes against Dalits increased from 1,130 in 2014 to 6,655 in 2015, which made the NCSC official suspicious, the report said. The state later shared corrected figures, The Hindu reported.\n\n\u201cGujarat\u2019s officials, sources said, were worried that \u201cinflated\u201d data would further damage the state\u2019s record on Dalit atrocities when at a time it is in the eye of storm over the Una incident of public beating of Dalits and the subsequent suicide attempts by Dalits in the state,\u201d the report said.\n\nAtrocities on SCs (in India) are on the rise every year, despite laws present for their prevention, PL Punia, then chairman of NSCS, said in a meeting on monitoring the implementation of constitutional safeguards for scheduled castes held in July 2015.\n\n\u201c\u2018Campus related atrocities, denial of temple entry, hate speeches, discrimination in mid day meals etc.,\u2019 were some of the atrocity trends,\u201d Punia had said.\n\nThis story was first published on Factchecker.in.", "lang": "en"}
