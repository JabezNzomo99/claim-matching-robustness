Social media users are also sharing a photo of a woman with bruises and cuts on her face, claiming it\u2019s Henriquez.\n\nHere, the photo appears on Instagram. We won\u2019t repost the text or image here, because the photo is not of Henriquez, and several of the details about the robbery are either made up or exaggerated.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe woman in the photo is Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was assaulted and raped in Madrid in 2018. Sicignano posted the photo on her Facebook page and Spanish news outlet El Pais published a story about the incident.\n\nOn June 12, 2020, Sicignano took to Facebook and said her photo is being misused to spread misinformation about Floyd.\n\n\"There has been a photo of me circulating around on the internet since yesterday. The photo was taken of me in a hospital bed in Spain after being violently beaten and raped by a stranger,\" Sicignano wrote in the post. \"I posted my story over a year ago to use my voice to spread awareness and encourage other women to speak out about the injustices they've faced. Today my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die. I am disgusted and humiliated, not for myself, but for my country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some of the assertions made about the details of the robbery are not accurate.\n\nFloyd was arrested in 2007 for his involvement in an armed home robbery and was sentenced to five years in prison, but court records do not indicate that Henriquez was pregnant at the time of the incident, or that Floyd threatened to kill her baby.\n\nAccording to the police\u2019s probable cause report, Henriquez, another woman and a toddler were home at the time of the incident and Floyd was one of multiple men who forced their way into the home, during which he threatened her with a gun.\n\nShe was injured during the home invasion, but the report says her injuries were inflicted by another man, not Floyd.\n\nAn Instagram post claims an image of a woman with bruises on her face is Aracely Henriquez, the victim of an armed home robbery that Floyd was involved in.\n\nBut the image isn\u2019t of Henriquez. It shows an American student who was assaulted in Madrid in 2018 .\n\nFloyd served five years in prison for the armed robbery, but there is no evidence that Henriquez was pregnant at the time, and her injuries were inflicted by another man.", "lang": "en"}
