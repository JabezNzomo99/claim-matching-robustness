The Bengali Hindu is now rising.\n\nIt doesnt matter how passionately different political parties and their leaders are trying to divide the country, Indians will gradually understand. Spread this message further so that the entire country knows the truth of this anti-national Chief Minister.\n\nA video of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has gone viral on social media and messaging platforms, along with the above message. The video shows a livid Mamata Banerjee yelling at those standing around her. This is followed by visuals of people ransacking the place. It has been claimed that Banerjee had called a meeting of party workers, where a row over Vande Mataram broke out, and the party workers, in defiance of their supremo, ransacked the party office and raised Vande Mataram slogans.\n\nSeveral individual users have uploaded the video on Facebook with an identical message.\n\n\n\nThe video has been shared in droves on WhatsApp as well. Some users had requested Alt News for verification of the video and the accompanying claim.\n\nThe claim circulating along with the video clip is absolutely false. The video in question was shot in 2006. The place is the West Bengal assembly. It may be recalled that protests had taken place in West Bengal that year over the proposal by Tata Motors to set up a manufacturing plant in Singur for the Tata Nano car. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by Mamata Banerjee, which was then in the opposition, had been at the forefront of the agitation. TMC workers had ransacked the West Bengal assembly building as part of the protest.\n\nThe same had been broadcast by NDTV in a video report of December 1, 2006. A screenshot of the same is posted below.\n\nAlt News found that the same video has also been shared with the false claim that it portrays an angry Mamata Banerjee, following demonetization which took place in November 2016.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the video in question was shot in 2006 and pertains to the protest over the Singur controversy. It has nothing to do with Vande Mataram. The claim circulating on messaging and social media platforms is false.", "lang": "en"}
