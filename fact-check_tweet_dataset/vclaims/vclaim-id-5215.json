Trump visited Moscow in 2013 to attend the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned.\n\nHere\u2019s what Putin said at the July 16, 2018, press conference, according to the translation provided:\n\n\"Yes, I did hear these rumors that we allegedly collected compromising material on Mr. Trump when he was visiting Moscow. Well, distinguished colleague, let me tell you this: When President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn't even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow.\"\n\nNikolay Lakhonin, press secretary of the Russian Embassy in Washington, told PolitiFact that \"we have no reason to doubt President Putin's statement.\"\n\nThere are two accounts that contradict what Putin said, but we can't independently confirm them.\n\nThe first piece of evidence is testimony provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee by Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump's who served as an intermediary between Russian figures and Trump\u2019s circle.\n\nGoldstone\u2019s testified under oath that a meeting between Putin and Trump was in the works at high levels during the Miss Universe trip:\n\n\"During that trip, there was a lot of talk about whether Mr. Trump would meet with Mr. Putin, whether Mr. Putin would attend the pageant. It was a very big deal both for Russia and for the Miss Universe Organization. It came down to the wire, and on the day of the contest, we still didn't know whether there would be a meeting or whether there would be a call. It transpired, in the end, that there would be neither, but that Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called through Aras (Agalarov, a Russian billionaire whose son Emin was an associate of Goldstone) to speak to Mr. Trump and gave his apologies that, due to the tardiness of the King of Holland, he was unable to schedule a meeting for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThis account is supported by an interview with Aras Agalarov conducted by the Washington Post: \"Putin canceled at the last minute, but he sent a decorative lacquered box, a traditional Russian gift, and a warm note, according to Aras Agalarov.\"\n\nSo if Goldstone and Agalarov are to be believed, then Putin\u2019s circle, at least, was aware of Trump\u2019s presence in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s theoretically possible that Peskov could have been deciding on his own whether Putin should meet with Trump, without telling Putin.\n\nThe argument against this scenario is that Putin\u2019s government is highly centralized, and Putin had a long career as an intelligence officer before becoming the Russian leader. In other words, knowing about things is deeply embedded in Putin\u2019s DNA.\n\nOn the other hand, the nature of Putin\u2019s regime makes it hard to say with certainty that he would have known, said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist with a specialty on Russia.\n\n\"Common sense would suggest that Putin knew the Miss Universe pageant was happening in Russia, and that he would have surmised that Donald Trump was in the country or in Moscow, but I don\u2019t know how closely he followed it,\" she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s possible, she said, \"is that Peskov or other underlings for Putin were working with the Trump people to set up a meeting and Putin didn\u2019t know about that. And it\u2019s possible that the gift is from the underlings in Putin\u2019s administrations and not Putin himself. My guess is that a lot of intermediaries try to set up meetings with Putin unsuccessfully, but tell their clients that they were very close, whether they were or not, and whether or not Putin knew about the attempts.\"\n\nAs for Putin, Herrera added, he doesn\u2019t have much incentive to acknowledge any awareness that Trump was in Moscow in 2013, because it would raise even more red flags about possible coordination between Russia and Trump prior to Trump\u2019s election as president.\n\n\"I would not expect Putin to admit knowing Trump was in Moscow or that there was an attempt to meet, even if that were 100 percent true,\" she said.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE, July 16, 2018: This article has been updated to incorporate a comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington.", "lang": "en"}
