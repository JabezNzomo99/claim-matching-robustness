In the video itself, one can hear a person saying that it\u2019s KEM hospital. The video was shot on May 26, 2020. BJP leader Ram Kadam tweeted it on May 27 and claimed that dead bodies of patients who died due to coronavirus are kept in the same ward as the patients.\n\nMaharastra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant quote-tweeted Kadam and posted screenshots of a clarification issued by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to the clarification, the video was shot during a sudden strike of KEM employees. It justified the lack of medical staff and unhygienic conditions inside hospital wards due to the strike. It also stated that normalcy returned after the strike was called off. The government clarified that these videos do not represent the current condition at KEM hospital.\n\n\u201cClaiming they were working in harsh conditions, Class III and IV employees of the KEM hospital in Mumbai staged a protest Tuesday after a fellow colleague died, and his body remained in the mortuary for two days.\u201d reported The Indian Express on May 26, 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, a video showing the poor condition of KEM hospital ward during a strike by staff members was shared with the false claim that it is from Delhi.", "lang": "en"}
