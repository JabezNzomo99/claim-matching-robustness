There is no evidence they kill over 500 people in the U.S. every summer.\n\nA viral image of a bluegill fish is being shared on Facebook along with the claim that the fish is related to the piranha and is one of the most dangerous fish in North America.\n\n\u201cWhen the blugill (sic) are feeding in a school, they can completely dismantle a human body in less then (sic) 15 minutes,\u201d text in the image reads. \u201cBluegills are responsible for over 500 deaths in the United States ever summer.\u201d\n\nBut bluegill fish appear to be non-threatening to humans. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service states on its website that their diets consists of insects, insect larvae, small crustaceans and worms, not mammals. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about bluegill fish killing people, only fact-checkers debunking the claim.\n\nBluegills are also not related to piranhas. Native to North America, bluegills are part of the sunfish, or Centrarchidae, family, while piranhas, native to South America, are part of the Serrasalmidae family.

In fact, the bluegills\u2019 teeth are very small,\u201d Flyer Fish Pro\u2018s website reads. \u201cEven if bluegills did try to bite humans, they would struggle to break the surface of the skin. So people have nothing to fear from the harmless bluegill.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
