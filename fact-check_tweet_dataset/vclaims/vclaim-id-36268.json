The video is viral with the claim it is from Ahmedabad, Gujarat.\n\nOn February 13, @RK_Insight tweeted, \u201cDon\u2019t the poor have a right to live in this country under @narendramodi?? Look how #Ahemdabad is getting ready to welcome @realDonaldTrump @vijayrupanibjp is this part of #GujaratModel ?\u201d The user deleted the tweet but not before it garnered over 400 retweets. It noteworthy that a wall is being constructed in Ahmedabad to apparently hide slums ahead of Trump\u2019s visit. The city municipal corporation has however denied the allegation. A Facebook user posted the viral video with the text, \u201cShare it to expose the Hipocracy of BJP. Just for a Trump visit of 2 days look what sort of Shameful act being unleashed on Poor\u2019s. A state where this Shamless CM buy 190Crs luxury plane for himself from tax payers money. Don\u2019t the poor have a right to live in this country under @narendramodi?? Look how #Ahemdabad is getting ready to welcome @realDonaldTrump. @vijayrupanibjp is this part of #GujaratModel ?\u201d Share it to expose the Hipocracy of BJP. Just for a Trump visit of 2 days look what sort of Shameful act being unleashed on Poor\u2019s. A state where this Shamless CM buy 190Crs luxury plane for himself from tax payers money. Don\u2019t the poor have a right to live in this country under @narendramodi?? Look how #Ahemdabad is getting ready to welcome @realDonaldTrump. @vijayrupanibjp is this part of #GujaratModel ? Around the first week of February, the viral video was circulating with the claim that it is from UP. Alt News published a fact-check report on February 8. We performed keyframe analysis using InVID and did a reverse-image search on Yandex. The first result was of a YouTube video with the hashtags #Utkalkhabar #odisha #bhubaneswar. However, the video was removed by the user.\n\nUsing the hashtags as a clue, we performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that the viral video was uploaded by OTV, an Odisha-based news channel, on January 24. This video has a higher resolution and is shot from a different angle.\n\nWe analysed both the videos and spotted three common elements in the viral video and the one uploaded by OTV.\n\nAlt News noticed that the crane has the logo of Terex in both the videos.\n\nA man in half-sweater can be spotted in both the videos.\n\nIn both the videos, a red truck was present at the demolition site.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the viral video shows events from Ahmedabad ahead on President Trump\u2019s visit is false. The video is from Bhubaneshwar Municipal Corporation\u2019s eviction drive near Unit 1 Market on January 24.", "lang": "en"}
