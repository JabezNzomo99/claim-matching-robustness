Certain ones,\" Carson said. \"The ones that would prevent death or crippling. There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.\"\n\nWe contacted Carson\u2019s campaign to see what vaccines he meant and his source but did not receive a response.\n\nBased on context, in which the candidates were talking about the shots given to children, we decided to look at the vaccines on the childhood schedule supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and our neighbors at the .\n\nThe CDC recommends a series of shots to protect children against 15 infectious diseases. They are measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), polio, influenza (flu), rotavirus, and pneumococcal disease.\n\nMost everyone likely knows about measles, the flu and the two types of hepatitis \u2013 and that all of those diseases can be deadly.\n\nBut of the others, are any not lethal or, at the least, not crippling?\n\nHardly. Several experts told us no such disease is prevented by those on the childhood immunization schedule.\n\n\"Every one of those can kill or cripple or maim you,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and one of three inventors of the rotavirus vaccine.\n\nAnd just what is rotavirus? Think of it as a particularly nasty stomach flu \u2013 one estimated to have killed 453,000 children under the age of 5 in 2008, most in developing countries, according to the .\n\nMumps \u2013 Death is rare, and happens usually in adults. But mumps include deafness and sterility in both genders.\n\nRubella \u2013 A relatively mild virus that usually leads to severe birth defects and blindness and can cause miscarriage and stillbirth in expectant mothers.\n\nChicken pox \u2013 Another relatively mild virus that annually before vaccines.\n\nDiphtheria \u2013 Once a major cause of death among U.S. children \u2013 including a and the terror behind the original in Alaska, this powerful disease in Spain last year.\n\nTetanus \u2013 This bacteria kills up to 20 percent of those infected , with many suffering from spasms severe enough to break bones.\n\nWhooping cough \u2013 A brutal disease that too young for the vaccine. The World Health Organization estimates it caused 89,000 deaths worldwide in 2012.\n\nHPV \u2013 The more controversial of all vaccines, largely because it prevents a sexually transmitted virus that can cause several types of cancer which can be deadly, .\n\nHiB \u2013 A bacteria that can cause several invasive diseases, including meningitis, which that annually before vaccines. In 2008, it killed an estimated .\n\nPneumococcal disease \u2013 One of the leading causes of illness in children that of those infected and leaves some survivors with permanent injury.\n\n\"I would bet that any single one of these vaccines have saved more children than the number of lives Ben Carson has saved as a neurosurgeon,\" said Dr. Adam Lauring, a professor at the University of Michigan medical school who specializes in infectious diseases.\n\n\"Because we don\u2019t see many of these diseases anymore, they are almost perceived as inconveniences,\" Lauring continued. \"But fact is, people do die of these diseases and we have forgotten that because we haven\u2019t seen them.\"\n\nWhen they do appear, such as with last year\u2019s measles outbreak, they are far less lethal disease than in year\u2019s past.\n\nBut that is likely a testament to technology and more ready access to healthcare than the fact the diseases remain incapacitating, said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU\u2019s Langone Medical Center and director of a project on vaccine ethics and policy.\n\n\"High-tech medicine to pull you through but you still wouldn\u2019t want to try to survive pneumonia in an artificial respirator in an ICU for weeks,\" Caplan said. \"It\u2019s still devastating.\"\n\nBen Carson, one of two medical doctors running for the GOP nomination, said during the second Republican debate that there is a \"multitude\" of vaccines for diseases that are not deadly or disabling.\n\nThe diseases targeted by the vaccines recommended for children on a set schedule, however, are nearly universally lethal.\n\nThe one obvious exception, rubella, is a disfiguring disease that can lead to birth defects.\n\nA medical doctor would surely know that.", "lang": "en"}
