Her arrest for driving under influence turned violent, resulting in the bruises on her face.\n\nSeveral pictures show victims of ambush in England.\n\nAnother woman has been identified as Helen Greaves who was attacked by a group of 10 men. One of the women is Mary Brandon who was assaulted for confronting a man who groped her. Amy Rae Ferris was beaten up for carrying a large amount of cash on her, and a 70-year-old woman was assaulted during a hand-bag robbery.\n\nThe collage also shows pictures of Rebecca Beattie from England and Emily McCaffery from USA, both victims of domestic abuse.\n\nOne of the photos, is actually of man, identified as Paul Kohler, who was mugged at his house in Wimbledon, London.\n\nAnother picture has been taken from Dublin-based author, Roddy Doyle's book, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors, which explores the lives of victims of domestic abuse.\n\nThe collage is evidently of unrelated incidents and does not show victims of the recent violence in Sweden.", "lang": "en"}
