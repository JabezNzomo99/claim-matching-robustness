The other side shows supposedly the same woman with an injured nose, she has applied turmeric on her bleeding nose and seems to be crying. \"THE RSS goons has attacked on a Hindu woman who attempt sehri for a Muslim Kashmiri girl in recent days. India is occupied by RSS. They have full control over media, judiciary, law enforcement & national securities. Would this country remain stable if this remains carried on.!!!!,\" reads the caption of the viral posts.\n\nThe two photos are unrelated. A keyword search on social media platforms led to several posts with the first picture from the above posts. The woman from the first photo helped the Kashmiri Muslim girl but she was not attacked. The other woman did get injured but in communal violence in Gujarat's Khambat in February this year. One of these, a Twitter user named, \"Rafqat Sonwaire\" had credited the photo to \"Preduman Goja\".\n\nSpeaking to The Logical Indian, Goja clarified that the woman from the first photo is his wife and that the injured woman in the viral post is someone else, he said.\n\n He informed that the girl seen in the picture is a resident of Kashmir's Sopore who is currently lodged with them. \"Due to lockdown she could not join her parents on the occasion of Ramzan, the holy month of fasting,\" Goja said. She had visited Jammu for a medical entrance examination and but got stuck due to the lockdown. According to Goja, they wake up early to serve 'sehri' to the girl because it's the month of Ramadan and she is not with her family. As for the other photo, a reverse image search led to tweets which date back to February 2020 and seems to be related to the Gujarat riots that occurred in Khambat.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hindu, more than 30 houses and as many shops and vehicles were burnt down while members of two communities engaged in stone-pelting and arson, in Khambat, Gujarat. The photo of the injured woman predates the beginning of Ramadan which occurred on April 23, 2020. Therefore, the two women are unrelated and the claim with which the collage is being circulated is false.\n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Are Leopards Roaming Streets Of Punjab Amid Lockdown?", "lang": "en"}
