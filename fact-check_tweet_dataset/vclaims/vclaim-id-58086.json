He advises drinking clean semen or using it as a hand sanitizer.\n\nAs of writing, the video has had 118,672 views on YouTube. Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool Claim Check flagged the video for verification. It has been reported at least 35 times for containing false content.\n\nThe facts: To date, there is still no authorized or official cure for COVID-19. The study cited by Millendez in the description of his video also did not mention COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said in its frequently asked questions page that some specific treatments are under investigation and are undergoing clinical trials, but medicines that can prevent or cure COVID-19 have yet to be authorized.\n\nMoreover, the study cited by Millendez does not support his claim that semen can be used to cure COVID-19. That study by scientists of the Pasteur Institute in France was published in 2016 \u2013 way before the novel coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n\nInstead, the scientists studied how spermine and spermidine, which are both present in human semen, can affect Zika and Chikungunya viruses in human bodies. The study is available here.\n\nZika and Chikungunya are not coronavirus strains but are transmitted through mosquitoes. Both WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the novel coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes.", "lang": "en"}
