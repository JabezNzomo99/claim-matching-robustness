The claim is false; the blog post was copied from a satirical article; an online search of Trump\u2019s tweets and recent statements from the White House found he has not made any public statements about Ressa. \n\n\n\nThe blog post was published in this Facebook post on July 14, 2019, where it has been shared more than 200 times after being posted by a Philippines based Facebook page with more than 336,000 followers.\n\nIt includes a link to an article which shows US President Donald Trump and Filipino-American journalist Maria Ressa, the CEO of Philippine news site Rappler.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s Tagalog language caption translates to English as: \u201cUS President Donald Trump joins call to revoke Maria Ressa's dual citizenship.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo what will you do now Ressa? Pay your taxes and apply legally, anyway you're being paid by the Americans. Your adviser is also brave.
