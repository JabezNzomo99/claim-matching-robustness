(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you may be wondering: Is there some truth to the claim?\n\nWe reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven\u2019t heard back. We could find nothing in Biden\u2019s platform or independent assessments of his tax plan that would indicate he supports imposing an annual federal tax on homes.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s briefly review which kinds of taxes apply to property owners.\n\nTaxes are divided between federal, state and local governments. One common type is property tax, which is determined at the state and local levels.\n\nThe effective property tax rate varies from state to state and city to city. Property taxes are a key source of revenue for cities and counties, and school districts tend to rely on them. Homeowners can pay these taxes as part of their monthly mortgage payments or to a local tax assessor on an annual basis.\n\nThe main federal tax that the Internal Revenue Service imposes on real estate is the capital gains tax. A capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the \"basis,\" and what they sold it for.\n\nFor example, if you purchased a house for $250,000 and sold it for $300,000, your capital gain would be $50,000. However, the IRS typically lets sellers deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains if they\u2019re single and $500,000 if they\u2019re married and file joint tax returns, so you probably wouldn\u2019t owe anything.\n\nBiden has not proposed a nationwide property tax \u2014 nor has he advocated raising taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as we\u2019ve previously reported.\n\nAn analysis from the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says Biden\u2019s plan would primarily raise income and payroll taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations. The tax hikes would increase federal revenues by $4 trillion over the next decade, according to the analysis.\n\n\"Under his plan, the highest-income households would see substantially larger tax increases than households in other income groups, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes,\" the report says.\n\nOther independent groups have also examined Biden\u2019s tax plan, including the Tax Foundation, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the American Enterprise Institute and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Here are a few of the plan\u2019s specific components:\n\u2022 Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.\n\u2022 Raise the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%.\n\u2022 Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\nNone of those reports say Biden wants to impose a \"3% annual federal tax on your home,\" as the Facebook post claimed.\n\n\"Based on our review of the campaign materials and our conversations with the campaign to try and clarify what their proposals are \u2026 there\u2019s nothing there,\" said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate in the Tax Policy Center. \"We haven\u2019t encountered anything that could be construed as a tax on homes.\"\n\nOn his campaign website, Biden says he supports creating tax credits for first-time homebuyers and low-income families who rent. We could find no mention of a nationwide property tax.\n\nWe reached out to the campaign for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate.
