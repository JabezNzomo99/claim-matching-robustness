Glenn Chong said Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., who narrowly lost to Leni Robredo in the 2016 vice presidential race, lost 1.7 million votes to cheating.\n\n\n\n This claim is not supported by news reports nor the three-hour footage of the Senate\u2019s July 31 probe, where Chong was a resource person, on \u201cirregularities\u201d in the 2016 polls.\n\u2022 That an unnamed American \u201cIntel\u201d officer, alias \u201cJohn,\u201d said Marcos lost 1.5 million votes.\n\n\n\n The claim is unproven and based on a March 15 Facebook post by a certain Adolfo Mortera. Mortera\u2019s post shows the \u201ctranscript\u201d of a supposed conversation between blogger and presidential adviser Jose Alejandrino with \u201cJohn,\u201d who \u201cconfirmed\u201d some 1.5 million votes -- not 1.7 million as the headline claims -- for Marcos had been \u201cfiddled with\u201d and given to Robredo. No reputable news outfit has reported such an exchange.\n\nThe Daily Sentry\u2019s false story, which could have reached over 3.6 million people, was revived two days after senators conducted a probe July 31 on the 2016 elections.\n\nThe probe was the result of Senate President Vicente \u201cTito\u201d Sotto III\u2019s privilege speeches on March 6 and 14, while still Senate majority leader, where he raised concerns about questionable activity of some vote-counting machines.\n\nHe introduced the 1.7 million figure but did not directly relate it to votes for Marcos.\n\nSotto questioned why only 96.14% of election returns were received by the Commission on Elections Transparency Server, leaving 3.86% or some 1.7 million votes untransmitted.\n\nTraffic to the false story was largely generated from social media by The Daily Sentry\u2019s official Facebook page and The Filipino News.\n\nThe Daily Sentry, which has previously shared false and misleading content, was created January 10.", "lang": "en"}
