Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of NRIs dancing ahead of the \u2018Howdy, Modi!\u2019 event scheduled to take place on September 22 at Houston. Fact: The video is an old one that shows NRIs dancing during a campaign to support \u2018Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019 for the General Elections- 2019 in April-May. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the \u201cNDTV\u201d article, it was found that the event \u2018Howdy, Modi!\u2019 will take place on September 22, 2019, at Houston, USA.\n\nIn the video, along with the flags of the USA and BJP, people can be spotted holding posters with the text \u2018NRIs4MODI\u2019. When searched on YouTube with keywords \u2018NRIs 4 Modi dancing\u2019, many search results were obtained. The same video was also found in the search results and had the title, \u2018Now NRI\u2019s 4 MODI American Indians Free campaign For Modi 2019 JOIN NAMO LAHAR (\u0928\u092e\u094b \u0932\u0939\u0930) JOIN TODAY\u2019. When looked for the timestamp of the video, it was found to be uploaded on April 15, 2019. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the video in the post doesn\u2019t show NRIs dancing ahead of the upcoming \u2018Howdy, Modi!\u2019 event at Houston. It is a pre-election video that shows NRIs leading a campaign in support of \u2018Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019 for the General Elections- 2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
