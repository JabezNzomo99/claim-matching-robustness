After the chants died down, Trump kept criticizing Omar.\n\nJuly 14: Trump tweets: \u201cSo interesting to see \u2018Progressive\u2019 Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly ... and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d\n\nJuly 15: Addressing reporters at the White House, Trump says: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, if you hate our country, if you\u2019re not happy here, you can leave. And that\u2019s what I say all the time. That\u2019s what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it. But if you\u2019re not happy in the U.S., if you\u2019re complaining all the time, very simply, you can leave.\u201d\n\nA reporter asks Trump, \u201cDoes it concern you that many people saw that tweet as racist and that white nationalist groups are finding common cause with you on that point?\u201d The president responds: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern me because many people agree with me. And all I\u2019m saying: They want to leave, they can leave. Now, it doesn\u2019t say leave forever. It says leave if you want.\u201d\n\nAfter a minute or so, Trump resumes the attack: \u201cOmar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying \u2018some people did something.\u2019 I don\u2019t think so. Some people did something. Yeah, some people did something, all right. ... Omar laughed that Americans speak of al-Qaeda in a menacing tone and remarked that, \u2018You don\u2019t say America with this intensity. You say al-Qaeda. It makes you proud. Al-Qaeda makes you proud.\u2019\u201d (The claim about al-Qaeda is a Four Pinocchio distortion of what Omar actually said in a 2013 interview.)\n\nA few minutes later, Trump again suggests Omar and the other congresswomen leave the United States: \u201cThey never have anything good to say. That\u2019s why I say, \u2018Hey, if they don\u2019t like it, let them leave, let them leave.\u2019 Right? Let them leave. They\u2019re always telling us how to run and how to do this. How do \u2014 you know what, if they don\u2019t love it, tell them to leave it.\u201d\n\nJuly 18: At the White House, a reporter asks Trump about the chant. The president says, \u201cI was not happy with it. I disagreed with it. ... I think I did [try to stop it]. I started speaking very quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump got this ball rolling with his tweets and remarks telling Omar and other lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Video of the rally shows Trump did not try to stop the \u201cSend her back!\u201d chants about Omar. He stood passively onstage and waited for the chants to die down on their own before resuming his speech. Within seconds, he was back to criticizing Omar. Minutes later, he suggested again that Omar and other critics leave the United States.", "lang": "en"}
