It\u2019s difficult to be exact, because the available data doesn\u2019t allow us to pinpoint childcare costs over a specific period of time.\n\nThe picture varies across regions, and for children of different ages. Under-two nursery costs in London rose around seven times faster than the average wages of parents of one year-olds. The overall picture is one of costs rising significantly faster than wages across the country.\n\nThroughout this piece, discussions of nursery costs refer to children under two, whilst the wages figures refer to parents of one-year-olds. For simplicity\u2019s sake we\u2019ll use the term \u201cone-year-olds\u201d throughout.\n\nThe average cost of a nursery place for a one-year-old in London rose by 59% between 2008 and 2016, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) reports. In that same period, the average wages of those with a one-year-old in London rose by 8%. This means that nursery costs increased over seven times faster than wages for those parents.\n\nThis picture varies across the country, but all regions saw costs rise faster than wages. Taking England as a whole, nursery costs rose by 49% between 2008 and 2016\u2014four times faster than parental wages, which increased by 12%.\n\nOutside London the fastest rate of increase was in the East Midlands (seven times faster than wages), and the slowest rate was in the East of England (three times faster).\n\nThe TUC calculated the average hourly earnings of parents of one-year-olds in each region by using an average of quarterly figures from the Labour Force Survey. The hourly cost of nursery in each region was then worked out, using figures from the Family and Childcare Trust\u2019s (FCT) 2016 Childcare Survey. The TUC then compared the change between the two sets of figures between 2008 and 2016. We\u2019ve not seen the exact calculations behind this.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the FCT\u2019s 2016 report actually reflects childcare costs in 2016. The FCT told us that they asked local authorities to report their childcare costs in November 2015. They expect that respondents\u2019 figures will actually reflect a range of different time periods.\n\nThis means the TUC\u2019s calculations aren\u2019t necessarily exact but provide an indication of how much childcare costs have risen in comparison to wages over the time period in question.\n\nDepending on which FCT surveys most accurately reflect costs between 2008 and 2016, nursery costs for one-year-olds in England overall could have risen three or four times faster than wages.\n\nHow much is this costing parents?\n\nThe TUC\u2019s findings mean that on average parents of one-year-olds today spend a larger portion of their income on childcare than in 2008. The impact of this varies depending on the exact conditions of their work, with single parents most affected.\n\nThe TUC found that single parents working full-time, with a one-year-old in nursery for 21 hours a week spent an average of 21% of their wages on childcare in 2016. That\u2019s an increase of 4 percentage points since 2008.\n\nA couple working full-time, with the same childcare needs, spend an average of 11% of their wages on childcare in 2016. That\u2019s up 3 percentage points since 2008.\n\nThe TUC report focuses specifically on the wages of parents with one-year-old children. It says this is because, \u201cWhile there is government support for childcare for children aged two and older, most working parents with one-year-olds do not get any state help with childcare costs\u201d.\n\nThere are around 950,000 working parents with a one-year-old child in the UK, according to the TUC\u2019s calculations (based on the Labour Force Survey). It is correct that these parents receive less government support for childcare costs than those of children aged two to four.\n\nThe government currently provides 15 hours of free childcare a week (for up to 38 weeks a year) to all parents of three- and four-year olds. These parents get another 15 hours on top of this if they work at least sixteen hours and earn \u00a3115 a week, and earn less than \u00a3100,000 a year.\n\nParents of two year-olds also receive 15 hours a week of free childcare if they are in receipt of certain benefits.\n\nWhat support can parents of one-year-olds get?\n\nParents of under-twos can get some government help with childcare costs. If they are in work, they may be eligible for \u201ctax-free childcare\u201d. This means the government pays 20p for every 80p spent by a parent on childcare, up to a value of \u00a32,000 a year.\n\nParents on tax credits or Universal Credit are not eligible for tax-free childcare. These benefits have their own separate elements to help with childcare costs.\n\nPeople aged over 25, or over 16 and with a disability, earning below a certain threshold may be entitled to Working Tax Credit. If they are parents they may then be able to claim back 70% of their childcare costs up to a certain level.\n\nParents on Universal Credit can claim back up to 85% of their childcare costs, up to a certain value.", "lang": "en"}
