In the 9-second clip, the Congress President can be heard saying \u2013 \u201cI have no proof so far, but I am very clear that the Prime Minister is directly involved.\u201d This gave the impression that Gandhi was accusing PM Modi of corruption without any evidence. At the time of writing this article, Know The Nation\u2019s video had nearly 1 million views. An archived version of its tweet can be accessed here.\n\nThe clip is also viral on Facebook in varied languages. A page called Youth 4 BJP shared it in Hindi, gaining 67,000 views in just a couple of hours. Another page Hindustan shared the clip in Tamil.\n\nThe 9-second clip is viral on Twitter, circulated by many users followed by senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janta Party. One Mohan Sinha, who is followed by PM Modi, quote tweetedKnow The Nation\u2019s video saying that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u201cbrain is missing a few vital screws.\u201d\n\nAnother user who is followed by BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga shared the same video, attracting over 53,000 views.\n\nSeveral handles followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office also tweeted the 9-second clip (1, 2, 3). A few others took a jibe at the Congress President based on the purported quote (1, 2, 3).\n\nKnow The Nation tweeted 9 seconds of a much longer video and placed Rahul Gandhi\u2019s statement out of context. If one listens to his entire speech, Gandhi does not say, \u201cI have no proof so far, but I am very clear that the Prime Minister is directly involved.\u201d In fact, his statement was directed at Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. He says that he does not have any proof so far of her involvement, but the Prime Minister is directly involved in the scam.\n\nAt 4:26 minutes in the full video, Gandhi can be heard saying \u2013 \u201cDefense Minister said that we are accusing her\u2026Madam I am not accusing you and I am not accusing Mr Parrikar. I am accusing Mr Narendra Modi. Let it be absolutely clear that you have done nothing other than try to defend a lie. So I do not think that you are involved in the Rafale scam. I have no proof so far to say that you are involved but I am very clear that the Prime Minister is directly involved in the Rafale scam.\u201c\n\nKnow The Nation picked the last portion of Gandhi\u2019s statement (highlighted above), clipped the part where he said \u2013 \u201cto say that you are involved\u201d \u2013 and presented his assertion as, \u201cI have no proof so far, but I am very clear that the Prime Minister is directly involved.\u201d\n\nKnow The Nation has been around on Twitter since December 2017. Despite a meagre follower count of a little over 2,500, it boasts a few prominent political personalities like Office of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga among its followers.\n\nThe craftily trimmed video of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s speech owes its existence to the organisation behind the Twitter handle.\n\nLast year, a company named BlueKraft Digital Foundation was linked for running a website called The True Picture, which is ironically described as a \u2018data journalism and fact-checking portal\u2019. It is a go-to website for several Union Ministers, including Textile Minister Smriti Irani, however, has been found spreading misinformation in the past.\n\nThe Indian Expresshad found that the website shared its landline telephone number with BlueKraft, which was the \u201ctechnology and knowledge\u201d partner to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s book \u2018Exam Warriors\u2019. The company also published a book about PM Modi\u2019s monthly radio broadcast, \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019, terming it a \u201csocial revolution on radio\u201d.\n\nIn an April 2018 report, Boomlivehad found several of BlueKraft\u2019s employees directly associated with The True Picture.\n\nBlueKraft is headed by Akhilesh Mishra, the former director of the BJP government\u2019s online citizen engagement initiative \u2018MyGov India\u2019. When contacted by The Indian Express, Mishra had denied any links between his company and The True Picture.\n\nBlueKraft\u2019s association with the BJP seems to extend further. There is evidence of the company\u2019s connection with three other pro-BJP propaganda platforms \u2013 New India Junction, Awemazing Worldand the protagonist of this story, Know The Nation.\n\nA Senior Creative Director at BlueKraft, Nilesh Mistry, listed the handles as part of his responsibilities along with The True Picture and called them \u2018in-house blogs\u2019. His LinkedIn profile read \u2013 \u201cWorking on \u2013 Government of India\u2019s various schemes print, outdoor and social media advertising. Inhouse blogs: New India Junction, Know The Nation, AwemaningWorld, The True Picture.\u201d After the same was revealed on social media, he removed these references (except New India Junction) from his profile.\n\nThe evidence at hand exhibits the company\u2019s links with multiple propaganda platforms, some of which also disseminate misinformation. Therefore, its apparent closeness with the BJP and the Prime Minister himself is a matter of concern. Alt News has reached out to Akhilesh Mishra for his comments. We will update our story upon receiving a response.", "lang": "en"}
