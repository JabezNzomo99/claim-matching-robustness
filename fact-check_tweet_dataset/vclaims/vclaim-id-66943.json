No, this chant of \u2018Islam Zindabad\u2019 is being raised in Kolkata, the capital city of #MamataBanerjee-ruled West Bengal!\u201d \u2014 he wrote. While Fatah has since deleted this tweet, we have archived it here. The writer is known for sharing false information on several occasions over the years.\n\nA user named Md. Sujon Rana posted the video on August 21 on Facebook. In his caption, Rana wrote, \u201cIslam is the religion of the state!\u201d God willing, it will remain Islamic. This wish of atheists will never be fulfilled. If you do not like that Islam is the state religion, then leave Bengal! The state religion was, is and will remain Islam. Inshallah!\u201d In the clip, it is apparent that a large number of the people protesting in the video are from the Muslim community.\n\nIn a brief moment in the video, one of the protestors can be seen holding the flag of Bangladesh.\n\nApart from this, many of the protestors are seen carrying placards and signs. One of these placards says \u2018Islami shasantantra chhatra andolan\u2019. This is the name of a student outfit of a Bangladeshi political party called Islami Andolon Bangladesh.\n\nWhen we did a keyword search on YouTube based on this information, we found the same video which had been uploaded three years ago on September 13, 2017. The video is titled, \u201cBangladesh Islami Andolon Bangladesh enclose myanmar Embassy\u201d and was uploaded by a channel called Spice InfoTube.\n\nAnother YouTube channel called The Rohingya Post had uploaded a similar video on September 13, 2017. Its description reads, \u201cThousands of Islami Andolon Bangladesh marched towards the Myanmar Embassy in Dhaka demanding an end to the atrocities on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state. As per the previous declaration, thousands of supporters of the Islamist party started their protest march in front of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque around 12.30 PM on Wednesday. Police barred the protesters at Kakrail Mor but the agitating party men managed to shatter the barricade and continued marching forward until they encountered another police barricade at Shantinagar intersection.\u201d\n\nOn September 13, 2017, The Financial Express reported, \u201cThousands of people in capital Dhaka have rallied in protests against the violence like killings and arsons against Rohingya Muslims in the northern Rakhine state of Myanmar.\u201d Apart from this, Bangladesh news website Bangla News 24 had also published a report about this demonstration.\n\nTherefore, a 3-year-old video from Bangladesh was shared online with claims that it was from West Bengal. The Kolkata Police had shared a screenshot of Tarek Fatah\u2019s tweet clarifying that it was fake news. They also mentioned that they are taking the necessary legal action on the matter. A few hours after their tweet, Fatah issued a tweet apologizing for sharing misleading information.\n\nFollowing the video\u2019s revival two months later, West Bengal police tweeted a clarification.", "lang": "en"}
