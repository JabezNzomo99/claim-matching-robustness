Recently \u2018Coronil\u2019 and \u2018Shwashari\u2019 were launched by Patanjali\u2019 claiming it to be an Ayurvedic cure for treating COVID-19. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: In the letter, it is nowhere mentioned that AYUSH Ministry has approved Patanjali\u2019s medicine \u2018Coronil\u2019 as a cure for treating COVID-19. The ministry said that they will evaluate the research related documents submitted by Patanjali regarding \u2018Coronil\u2019. The letter was also posted by Patanjali MD Acharya Balakrishna on his social media accounts but he did not mention anything about getting approval. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn 23 June 2020, \u2018Patanjali\u2019 launched the medicine \u2018Coronil\u2019 and \u2018Swasari\u2019 claiming it to be an Ayurvedic cure for treating COVID-19. But AYUSH Ministry asked \u2018Patanjali\u2019 to stop advertising the medicine as a cure for COVID-19 as it does not know the facts related to the claim and details of the studies carried out to test the new medicine. The Ministry asked Patanjali to provide the names and compositions of the preparations being claimed as cures for COVID-19, details of the sites where the research was carried out, protocol followed, the sample size used, the clearance obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) to conduct the research, registration with CTRI and the results data of study.\n\nIn the letter seen in the post, the AYUSH ministry wrote to \u2018Patanjali\u2019 MD Acharya Balakrishna acknowledging the receipt of the documents it had asked for. In the letter, the ministry said that it will evaluate the studies of \u2018Patanjali\u2019 regarding the medicine \u2018Coronyl\u2019. It is nowhere mentioned that the AYUSH Ministry has approved Patanjali\u2019s medicine \u2018Coronyl\u2019 as a cure for treating COVID-19. The letter was also tweeted by \u2018Patanjali\u2019 MD Acharya Balakrishna on his social media accounts but he did not mention anything about getting approval.\n\nTo sum it up, Patanjali Ayurved Ltd has not received approval from Ministry of AYUSH for its COVID-19 medicine \u2018Coronil\u2019 and \u2018Swasari\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
