While Dettol and other disinfectant products may kill the new coronavirus on surfaces, the makers of Dettol says \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route)\".\n\n\n\nA photo of the back of a Dettol bottle, which mentions that it kills \u201chuman coronavirus\u201d, has been shared on Facebook over a thousand times.\n\nThe implication seems to be that the new coronavirus observed in Wuhan, China is not new, or was somehow anticipated.\n\nThe image does seem to be a genuine label on a Dettol spray product. Several Dettol products mention that they are \u201cproven to kill\u2026Human Coronavirus\u201d. However, some comments under the Facebook post note that \u201cSalmonella\u201d is misspelled on the label. We don\u2019t know why that is, although the brand\u2019s Australian website also seems to misspell it.\n\nThe key point here is that coronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes a number of different respiratory illnesses. One is the common cold, but the category also includes SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004), and the new coronavirus identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe \u201chuman coronavirus\u201d mentioned on the back of the Dettol bottle is almost certainly referring to the common cold.\n\nThe coronavirus identified in Wuhan is a new virus, which hadn\u2019t been identified in humans before the first cases at the end of 2019.", "lang": "en"}
