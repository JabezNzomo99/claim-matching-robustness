This time it\u2019s about Carly Fiorina, a rival for the Republican nomination whom Trump mocked by saying \"Look at that face!\" in front of a Rolling Stone reporter who published his remarks.\n\nAppearing on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, Trump contended that his remarks were not about her appearance, but about \"her persona\" and her track record as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.\n\n\"She hasn\u2019t done a good job in, you could call it, the private sector. The companies, take a look at the record,\" he said Sept. 13. \"The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report. She\u2019s one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company.\"\n\nTrump rarely cites his sources, so we were curious about the \"raging report\" by a top dog at Yale University\u2019s law school.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not get back to us by deadline, but we think he is likely referring to an Aug. 14, 2015, column in Fortune by Yale\u2019s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.\n\nThe piece did criticize Fiorina\u2019s record at HP, but Trump misstated a few things.\n\nFirst, Sonnenfeld is a professor and senior associate dean for leadership programs at the Yale School of Management, not \"the top man\" at Yale Law.\n\nSecond, Sonnenfeld didn\u2019t name Fiorina as one of the worst executives in his memory. But he told PolitiFact in an interview that \"these complaints over her leadership are facts, which she cannot erase by attacking messengers.\"\n\n\"Fired in 2005, after six years in office, several leading publications titled her one of the worst technology CEOs of all time,\" he wrote in Fortune.\n\nHere\u2019s a laundry list of Fiorina\u2019s failings, according to Sonnenfeld (which includes a nod to Trump himself):\n\u2022 Forcing through a \"massive, ill-conceived, controversial\" merger with Compaq Computer in 2002 by using \"hardball tactics that would make Donald Trump wince,\"\n\u2022 Completely reversing her stated strategy to emulate competitor IBM\u2019s move into IT services,\n\u2022 Slicing shareholder wealth in half in five years,\n\u2022 Pocketing in $100 million despite everything.\n\n\"She was not a criminal nor one of the rogue CEOs of another era and may deserve another chance, but it is telling that in a decade, she has never been given another major company to lead,\" Sonnenfeld told us. \"Experience can be a badge of honor or a badge of shame.\"\n\nSonnenfeld\u2019s assessment of Fiorina is echoed by several others, but he stands out as one of her most prominent critics (so much so that Fiorina dismissed him as a Clinton adviser on NBC, which Sonnenfeld denies, and her Super PAC has featured him and his \"disreputable past\" in a blog post). He deemed Fiorina\u2019s tenure at HP a \"colossal failure\" in Bloomberg in April 2015 and \"a reign of terror and poor performance\" in a 2006 Associated Press story.\n\n\"You couldn\u2019t pick a worse, non-imprisoned CEO to be your standard-bearer,\" he told the New York Times in 2008.\n\nA Fiorina spokeswoman contended that Fiorina \"was a successful CEO by any metric\" and said that Sonnenfeld \"is a Clinton ally with dubious motives.\"\n\n\"This is a blatantly absurd statement which holds no factual or empirical basis,\" Leslie Shedd, press secretary for Fiorina\u2019s Super PAC, said. Shedd also pointed out that Trump has disparaged Sonnenfeld in the past (and got his title right) when the latter criticized his NBC reality show, The Apprentice, in 2004.\n\n\"I would have to say that he lacks the insight required to understand the architecture of a corporation, and his review reflects that lack of knowledge,\" Trump wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. \"Perhaps that is why he is a professor at Yale instead of the Wharton School of Finance (my alma mater).\"\n\nSince Sonnenfeld and the real estate mogul traded jabs, Trump apparently invited Sonnenfeld to lunch at Trump National Golf Course and charmed Sonnenfeld's wife and colleague, much to the Yale professor\u2019s horror.\n\nTrump said, \"The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report\" about former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, saying she is \"one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company.\"\n\nTrump misses minor points about the Yale man and his message. Sonnenfeld teaches at Yale\u2019s business school. He is not the law school\u2019s \"top man. And Sonnenfeld doesn\u2019t exactly say Fiorina is the worst HP CEO in \"his memory.\"\n\nHowever, the gist of Trump\u2019s claim is accurate, as Sonnenfeld has been a vocal critic of Fiorina\u2019s HP record for years.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is missing some detail but is overall on point about Sonnenfeld\u2019s long-running critique of Fiorina. We rate Trump\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
