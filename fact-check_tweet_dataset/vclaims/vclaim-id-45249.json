A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department said the claim \u201cappears to be misinformation.\u201d\n\nProtests and riots have erupted in D.C. and other major U.S. cities following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to USA Today.\n\nThe image, which appears to be a screen grab from the Twitter account associated with the hacker group Anonymous, claims that the nation\u2019s capital experienced a communications blackout in the early hours of June 1, saying, \u201cThe US government cut all communications in D.C. from 1AM to 6AM the fate of the protestors or events during this period is currently unknown.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that a communications blackout occurred, and the hashtag \u201c#DCblackout\u201d appears to be a viral hoax that spread on Twitter.

We continue monitoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t rule out cell tower jamming of the kind one might see around Capitol buildings in the onset of a national security incident,\u201d Alps Toker, executive director of NetBlocks, told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cSuch restrictions would fade out as you walk away over the range of a few hundred meters and get reconnected. To be fair, we didn\u2019t see descriptions clearly matching a jamming scenario either but that doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for Verizon and AT&T confirmed their phone networks operated normally that night, according to local CBS affiliate WUSA.\n\nAlaina Gertz, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department, told the Caller in an email, \u201cThis appears to be misinformation. We have no confirmation of a cell phone blackout.\u201d\n\nYahoo News reporter Hunter Walker and CBS News reporter Christina Ruffini, among others, also pushed back on the claim.

None of this is true,\u201d Ruffini tweeted. \u201cEventually, even TV crews need to sleep, but ours and many others were out late into the night. Their phones worked. Live signal was strong. Many of these tweets are the same wording. Don\u2019t fall for whatever is happening here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t experience anything like that and \u2013 though I didn\u2019t try streaming \u2013 had no issue with phone as I tweeted and worked until 2:30 am at least,\u201d Walker said on Twitter.\n\nThe account associated with Anonymous later tweeted that it suspected that a botnet spread the hashtag \u201c#DCblackout.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are investigating #DCblackout. We suspect it is misinformation spread by a botnet using BLM IDs and KPop / Anime profiles in order to incite panic and confusion,\u201d the account tweeted.\n\nBloomberg reported that a Twitter spokesperson said the platform suspended hundreds of accounts perpetuating the baseless claim about a communications failure during D.C. protests. The move was part of an active investigation into the \u201c#DCblackout\u201d hashtag, the spokesperson told Bloomberg.\n\nThe hashtag originated with a Twitter account that had only three followers, according to the Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
