The government has told AFP it is not making such a ban, nor did it ever make such an announcement that it would, and there is no public record of it.\n\nThis article published in November 2017 on the website Zoneknowledge.com said the culture and education ministry announced it would block anime and some popular online games like Mobile Legends that contained \u201celements which are bad for one\u2019s physical and spiritual health\u201d. An English translation of the headline reads: \u201cCulture and Education Ministry: we will block some games and all anime.\u201d\n\nThe article claims the ministry made the announcement in a Facebook post. It also said the government had made the decision because some games and anime contained \u201celements\u201d of pornography, violence, and radicalism.\n\nAnime refers to hand drawn or computer-generated animation usually based on Japanese graphic novels.\n\nThe claims about the ban have continued to be shared by Facebook users, such as in this post from July.\n\nA Facebook user asked the Indonesian Hoaxes Community -- which specialises in debunking fake news -- in July if the story was true.\n\nThe government says the original article\u2019s claims are false.\n\n\u201cThere has been no policy to ban [games and anime]. We only called on parents to accompany their children while choosing which games to play,\u201d Adi Irawan, an official at the culture ministry\u2019s directorate for family education management, told AFP.\n\nThe cultural ministry\u2019s website and official Facebook page also have no record of it making such a statement.", "lang": "en"}
