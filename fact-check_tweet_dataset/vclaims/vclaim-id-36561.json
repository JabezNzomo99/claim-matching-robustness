But Trump never said that \"people are dying who have never died before,\" despite what a number of social media posts have claimed.\n\nOne Facebook post, which said Trump made the comment on March 18, was flagged as part Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe searched Google, Nexis and Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracks Trump\u2019s public comments. We found no mention that \"people are dying who have never died before.\"\n\nWe also checked the official White House and C-Span transcripts for Trump\u2019s midday press briefing with the White House task force and his afternoon press briefing following a meeting with nurses, both of which occurred March 18. We saw nothing there, either.\n\nFinally, we found no tweets on the president\u2019s account that included the made-up quote in question. Nor did we find any deleted Trump tweets on Politwoops, a database of deleted political tweets maintained by ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism organization.\n\nOther fact-checkers also found no proof that Trump made the comment.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
