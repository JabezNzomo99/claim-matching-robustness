The claim is false; the photo has been doctored from an original that shows the politician uninjured.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, including this one published May 8, 2019, and shared more than 300 times since, contain the doctored image.\n\nA caption in Hindi alongside the photo in the post translates to English as: \u201cRahul Gandhi was given a great welcome in Amethi. He was thrashed badly.\u201d\n\nAmethi is a constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh where Gandhi is standing for reelection in India\u2019s six-week election. Here are details of his canditature on the Election Commission of India website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image has also been shared elsewhere on Facebook with the same claim, for example here \u2013 where it has been shared more than 200 times since being published May 8, 2019 \u2013 and here, and on Twitter, for example here and here.\n\nA Google reverse image search led to this report dated September 5, 2018, on the website of Indian broadcaster Republic TV.\n\nIt contains a video that starts with a static image in which Gandhi appears on the right.

Its picture is widely available online, for example here.\n\nIndian fact-check organisation Alt News has previously debunked this misleading image here.", "lang": "en"}
