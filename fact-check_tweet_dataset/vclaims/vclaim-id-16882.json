Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\"\n\nThe quote is fake.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a Change.org petition to stop such \"waste\" garnering 85,000 signatures, and a fictional bill to do the same getting the support of \"38 White House conservatives,\" all of whom are women.\n\nThe petition is also fake, although the story is popular on Facebook. Users flagged the suspicious post as part of Facebook\u2019s attempt to stop the spread of fake news.\n\nWhile the sensational headline no doubt draws in readers to share the link, the story itself goes on to admit it is fake. Someone clicking through the pages of the story would see the infamous Trollface meme:\n\nThere\u2019s no indication on ThatViralFeed.net that anything on the site may be fake, but in this case, the site makes it clear if you get to the end. Some Facebook users posting the link seem to understand the story is fake, but many others do not.\n\nThe site acknowledges the premise of the headline is made up, although you have to keep reading to get there. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
