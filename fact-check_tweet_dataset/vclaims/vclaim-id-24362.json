Its current franchise was approved via Republic Act No. 7966 on March 30, 1995 and is set to expire on March 30, 2020.\n\nIn April 2017, Duterte first warned the network that he would block its franchise renewal. He accused the network of \"swindling\" him for not airing his paid political advertisements in 2016.
