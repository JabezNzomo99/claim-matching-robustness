The claim is misleading; the photographer told AFP the photo was taken using a macrophotography technique, not using an electron microscope.\n\nThe photo was shared this a Facebook post here on November 7, 2019.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 19,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cThis is the face of an ant under an electron microscope.\u201d\n\nThe same photo was published with a similar claim on Facebook here and here and on Twitter here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the photographer told AFP that he did not use an electron microscope to take the photo.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the image in the misleading posts found the original photo published here on January 22, 2018 on the Instagram account for Indonesia-based photographer Abdul Latif.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Latif\u2019s post:\n\nLatif told AFP he did not use an electron microscope to take the photo, which he called \u201cblack ant\u201d in January 2018.\n\n\u201cThe photo was not taken under an electron microscope but with a mirrorless camera and an additional lens so that it gets the desired magnification,\u201d he said via email on January 1, 2020.\n\n\u201cI took the photo using a Canon EOS M3 camera with EF-M 55-200 MM lens, and the addition of Raynox DCR-250 lens at the tip to get the maximum focus distance to the subject.\n\n\"The ants are about 10-15mm in length and about 2-3mm in size for the head.\"\n\nLatif added that this stacking of lenses was a technique typical to macrophotography.\n\n\u201cI used the stacking technique to get a wide enough depth of field\u2026 so that the details are more visible. This photo is macrophotography.\"\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines macrophotography as \u201cthe making of photographs in which the object is either unmagnified or slightly magnified up to a limit often of about 10 diameters\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading Facebook post (L) and Latif\u2019s Instagram post (R):\n\nLatif also shared a side view macro photo he took of the same ant here.\n\nThe same misleading claim was also debunked here by fact check Twitter account HoaxEye on November 12, 2019. The tweet states: \"That\u2019s not an electron microscope image. Macro photo of ant by Abdul Latif. Instagram source: https://instagram.com/p/BeQVDqjgQ2s/\".", "lang": "en"}
