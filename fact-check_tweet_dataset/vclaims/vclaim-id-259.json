The claim \u2013 which allegedly lists \u201cthe truth\u201d about the species \u2013 is mostly accurate but requires some explanation. The claim has been shared over 18,700 times on Facebook as of May 10, 2020.\n\nExamples of the post are visible here , here , here and here .\n\nMost of the posts feature an authentic old photo of four deceased Asian giant hornets, specifically queen Japanese giant hornets. According to Snopes the photograph was first published in 2011 ( here ).\n\nThe claim says calling the Asian giant hornet \u201cmurder hornets\u201d is \u201cfear-mongering\u201d. It goes on to say that only one nest was found in North America in British Columbia and was destroyed, and one dead hornet was found in Washington state, in 2019.\n\n\u201cOn the off chance they do manage to spread,\u201d the post adds, \u201cthese insects aren\u2019t any more deadly than many of our American wasps and hornets, and the death rate in their native range equals that of deaths by dogs in the US. The only real threat they might pose is to our native wasps, honey bees, and hornets. But, since there are no breeding populations of these Asian Giant Hornets in the US that threat is not there either.\u201d\n\nIt concludes by urging people to report any sightings.\n\nThe post correctly states the authentic name for these hornets is the Asian giant hornet (AGH). The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is the world\u2019s largest species of hornet ( here ). It can grow as large as 2-1/2 inches (6.4 cm) in length and is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan. ( here ).\n\nWhile some specialists have expressed concern about the impact of the nickname \u201cmurder hornet\u201d ( here ), others confirm the \u201cearned nickname\u201d is in response to aggressive group attacks and fatal stings ( here ), as well as the hornets\u2019 \u201cwell-deserved reputation\u201d as destructors of bee colonies ( here ).\n\nThe Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) told Reuters via email that as of April 7, 2020 there have been no confirmed sightings of the AGH in the U.S. since 2019. It is also true the insects have not yet been found outside of the Pacific Northwest. While the WSDA has received hundreds of reports, there have only been two confirmed sightings in Washington State ( here ). See map of reported AGH sightings here .\n\nThe AGH is responsible for an estimated 30 to 50 deaths a year in Japan ( bit.ly/2YRXQZj ). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated an annual average of 62 deaths from hornet, wasp and bee stings between 2000-2017 in the U.S. ( here ).\n\nIt is not possible to compare whether the AGH is deadlier than other wasps and hornets in the U.S., but the significant size of its stinger and the amount of venom in its body make them a cause for concern ( here ).\n\n\u201cAlthough not typically aggressive toward humans\u201d, the AGH will attack people if threatened ( here ). The WSDA also warns that while mass attacks are rare, they could be \u201cmuch more significant and serious\u201d than an attack from any other Hymenoptera (insect order including bees, ants and wasps here ) in North America ( youtu.be/36TFu_W1Vio?t=1142 ).\n\nAGHs have the ability to decapitate pray, which is recorded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ( bit.ly/2YRXQZj ).\n\nNo breeding populations in the U.S. \u2013 no evidence\n\nThe post states there are currently \u201cno breeding populations\u201d in the U.S. The WSDA told Reuters this cannot be verified.\n\n\u201cWe are attempting to determine that (if there are breeding AGH) this year through trapping and reports from the public. If we do find any colonies our plan is to eradicate them\u201d, a WSDA spokesperson said. AGH a threat to honey bees \u2013 true\n\nSpecialists agree that the AGH represents a potential threat to honey bees in the U.S. The WSDA told Reuters the extent of that threat is not yet known.\n\nSven-Erik Spichiger, managing entomologist at the WSDA, said that aside from the danger to humans, the AGH presents a danger to agriculture and the apiary industry ( here ).\n\nThe WSDA warns on its website that if established, the AGH \u201cwill have negative impacts on the environment, economy, and public health of Washington State\u201d ( here ).\n\nTim Lawrence, Washington State University (WSU) County Extension Director also confirmed this to Reuters. \u201cA few hornets \u2013 20-30 \u2013 are capable of wiping out 30k honey bees\u201d, Lawrence told Reuters via email.\n\nRegarding native wasps and other hornets, Lawrence added that the AGH \u201cwill hunt other bees and wasps (native and introduced)\u201d. National Geographic notes that while the Japanese honey bee, for example, has developed defense mechanisms against the AGH by evolving alongside them, European honey bees (\u201cthe most widespread commercial pollinators\u201d) have not ( here ).\n\nPartly true. \u201cMurder hornets\u201d are called Asian giant hornets. There were confirmed sightings in the Pacific North West in 2019, although not yet in 2020. It is unclear if AGH are deadlier than other hornets per se, but they pose a risk to the environment, economy and native populations, especially for honey bees. It is unknown if AGH are breeding in the U.S.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
