The area's fire department added staff to each shift, police are gearing up and public works is ready to pre-treat the roads.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect along the Atlantic coast from Virginia Beach to Maine.

The Norfolk, Virginia, blizzard warning is only the second one since the 1980s.\n\nVirginia will see the most flurries overnight and into Thursday morning.", "lang": "en"}
