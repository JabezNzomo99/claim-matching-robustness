The claim is false; animation experts told AFP the video was created using a flight simulator programme; Lufthansa told AFP the video did not show a real plane.\n\nThe 39-second video was published in this Twitter post on October 21, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s Spanish-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA Lufthansa plane, in an accident while trying to land, the cunning pilot avoids a big tragedy\u201d.\n\nThe clip purports to show an aircraft operated by German flag carrier Lufthansa.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video has been viewed millions of times in multiple tweets, including here and here in English; here and here in Italian; here in French and here in Turkish alongside a similar claim. It was also shared here on Facebook in Turkish with a similar claim.\n\nThe videos have the watermark and the account name of TikTok user @kelvinklayn. The same video has been viewed tens of thousands of times in this post on social media video app TikTok after it was uploaded by user @kelvinklayn without a caption.\n\nComments on the video suggested some TikTok users believed it showed a real-life incident. Below is a screenshot of the some of the comments:\n\nThe claim is false; the video has been created using a flight simulation programme.\n\nA Lufthansa spokesperson told AFP by email on October 25, 2019, that the video was \u201cNOT a real life scenario.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of keyframes extracted from the clip using video verification tool InVID found it consists of computer-generated imagery.\n\nThis still from the video shows parts of the Lufthansa flight\u2019s engines sinking into the ground upon contact, leaving no visible damage to the runway. This would not be possible in a real-life event.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the specific moment in the video:\n\nThe aircraft also remains intact following the hard landing, while fire, sparks and smoke are common in news reports about similar bumpy landings. Below is a screenshot of the plane at the end of the video:\n\nThe Washington Post reported here on November 1, 2011, that sparks flew after a Boeing 767 skidded to a stop in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPete Wright, who runs a YouTube channel about flight simulation videos, told AFP in an email dated October 24, 2019: \u201cThere\u2019s no damage at all to any part of this aircraft through the impacts - in Microsoft FSX this is achieved by a setting called \u2018Ignore collisions\u2019. Instead the aircraft will continue moving after a crash, no parts of the aircraft will detach, no debris will be seen, no fire, etc.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft FSX, or Flight Simulator X, is a flight simulation programme published by the tech giant.\n\nWright said the video in the misleading tweet appears to have been created using the X-Plane 11 flight simulation programme.\n\nMarty Arant, marketing consultant at X-Plane creator Laminar Research, told AFP in an email dated October 26, 2019: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a video made from a flight simulator recording and not a real aircraft touching down. And it does look like X-Plane but I can\u2019t declare with all certainty that it was made using X-Plane without seeing more of the local environment (buildings, etc).\u201d\n\nMultiple YouTube channels specialised in flight simulation have used X-Plane 11 to demonstrate the virtual flying experience with a Lufthansa aircraft.", "lang": "en"}
