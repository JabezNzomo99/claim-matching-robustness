So do your duties, if you can\u2019t just say so, others will do the job!\u201d he said in a video meeting with the officials.\n\nLukashenko then scolded Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, who stood and listened with his head down.\n\n\u201cIn the foreign ministry everybody just sits and waits for the president\u2019s orders! Why do you tolerate them? You\u2019ve accredited them here, so don\u2019t wait for an end of the election campaign, expel them!\u201d Lukashenko said.\n\nThat was after claiming the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) \u201cgo beyond biased reporting\u201d and \u201ccall for mass riots.\u201d\n\nIn their extensive coverage of the protests and upcoming presidential election in Belarus, neither the BBC nor RFE/RL has \u201ccalled for mass riots.\u201d\n\nAd Fontes Media, an independent group that monitors media bias, rated BBC \u201cneutral/balanced\u201d in terms of bias and \u201cmost reliable\u201d in terms of trustworthiness.\n\nThe Media Bias/Fact Check website, a partner in the Poynter Institute\u2019s global fact-checking network, rated RFE/RL as \u201cleast biased\u201d in terms of using \u201cneutral language\u201d and \u201cbalance of coverage.\u201d The website rated RFE/RL\u2019s reporting as mostly factual, though at times tilting pro-USA.\n\nLukashenko, 65, a former communist and political officer in the Soviet army, has been ruling Belarus since 1994, when the office of president was established after the country regained its independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nLukashenko\u2019s popularity has diminished over the last several years as the country struggled with economic stagnation and low wages. In May, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to protest his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said could not cause harm if people drank vodka every day and took a sauna more often.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, July 28, Lukashenko announced that he was an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier. \u201cNinety-seven percent of Belarusians who contract the virus will recover without showing any symptoms,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, Belarus had 67,366 confirmed COVID-19 infections and 543 reported deaths as of the day Lukashenko revealed his infection.\n\nExperts the tally puts Belarus is among the worst counties in eastern Europe in terms of its government\u2019s response to coronavirus.\n\nThe \u201ccoronavirus protests\u201d that started in the capital Minsk in May, became known as the \u201cslipper revolution\u201d after a leading opponent referred to Lukashenko as a \u201ccockroach\u201d and called on voters to \u201csquash the pest\u201d in the Aug. 9 presidential election.\n\nAuthor Daniel Kalder, who has written books about the literature of dictators, describes the genesis of the revolution in a recent analysis published by the online magazine UnHerd.\n\n\"[T]he dam seems to have burst when a popular YouTuber, Sergei Tikhanovsky, cracked a gag about Lukashenko\u2019s moustache, comparing it to a cockroach, and then took to driving around in a van with a giant slipper \u2014 the most popular form of pest control in the country \u2014 on it. All of a sudden, protestors took to the streets of Minsk with slippers in hand and foreign analysts were talking up a potential \u201cslipper revolution.\"\n\nLukashenko has said he personally ordered Tikhanosvsky\u2019s arrest. In mid-June, he also accused his leading rival, Viktor Babariko, of corruption. Reuters reported that the accusation came the day after local offices of Russia\u2019s Gazprombank, headed by Babariko, were raided in a tax evasion case. Babariko, who gathered 400,000 signatures for his candidacy, was jailed.\n\nA third candidate, former ambassador to the United States Valery Tsepkalo was disqualified after officials rejected most of the 160,000 signatures his campaign collected, a ruling Tsepkalo said was political. He has since fled to Moscow with his children.\n\nWith his male political rivals barred from registering as candidates and/or arrested, Lukashenko now faces an unexpected challenge: an all-female trio representing the united opposition. The front-runner is Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, the wife of the jailed blogger and mother of two, who first stepped in as a placeholder for her husband. Also, in the group is Tsepkalo\u2019s wife, Veronika.\n\nOn May 29, during a meeting with the workers at the Minsk tractor factory, a man asked Lukashenko his opinion about political opponents. Lukashenko mentioned \u201cthese men who do nothing but brag on the Internet,\u201d then, turned to the women candidates.\n\n\u201cNobody will vote for a woman. The Belarusian society is not mature enough to vote for a woman. Our constitution is not fit for a woman because it gives the president a lot of power. The president will be a guy, I am absolutely sure of it.\u201d\n\nAnger over Lukashenko\u2019s comments was the reason they \u201cturned into politics,\u201d Belarusian women interviewed by BBC explained. Many joined opposition protests for the first time because the president\u2019s sexism reflected the overall marginalization of women in society, and that needs to change, they said.\n\nOn June 20, when speaking at the WWII memorial in the city of Mogilev, Lukashenko\u2019s attempt at damage control backfired. \u201cThere are attempts now to push me against the women. Remember, I said once that in Belarus a woman can\u2019t become a president yet,\u201d he complained to the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat I meant was that our Constitution is such that even for a tough guy it is hard to carry its burden. If you load that on a woman, she will collapse, poor thing. That\u2019s what I meant, not because I don\u2019t respect women.\u201d\n\nTikhanovskaya, described initially as a \u201creluctant candidate,\u201d has since spoken to crowds of thousands, delivered a TV address and received endorsements from across the political spectrum, becoming Lukashenko\u2019s main challenger. According to the Guardian newspaper, it was her interview with the BBC that caused Lukashenko\u2019s anti-media outburst.\n\n\u201cWe have a dictator as a head of our country. You can\u2019t say anything, do anything, everything is forbidden,\u201d Thikhanovskaya told BBC in a July 22 interview. She was \u201cafraid\u201d because the state \u201ccan do anything\u201d to her, she said, even take her children away and place them in an orphanage.\n\nAsked whether she believed if she can win the presidential bid, Tikhanovskaya said, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in honest elections. But I still believe that our president will understand, that his time is over. People don\u2019t want him anymore.\u201d\n\nNone of the past five presidential elections in Belarus has been rated free and fair. International observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe accused Lukashenko of abusing administrative powers to forge the votes and secure his victory.\n\nObservers are skeptical the Aug. 9 vote will be any different, with Lukashenko holding a \u201cmonopoly on violence and control of the ballot box,\u201d Markos Kounalakis, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in an analysis of the situation.\n\nThe constitution of Belarus sets one presidential term at five years. Initially, it included a two-term limit for the same person to serve as president. That was lifted in 1996.", "lang": "en"}
