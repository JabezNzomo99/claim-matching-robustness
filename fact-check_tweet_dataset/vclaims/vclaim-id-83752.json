This claim is false. A text search of a transcript of his speech finds the president did not mention mental health at the Paris Peace Forum. His speech focused on illicit financial flows and corruption.\n\nA video containing the majority of Buhari\u2019s speech was also posted on YouTube.\n\nThe president's spokesman, Garba Shehu, also confirmed to AFP in a phone call that Buhari had not mentioned mental health during the forum in Paris.\n\nAt 8:52am on November 14, a tweet by Ibu Thomas, an \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201ccommentator\u201d, claimed that Buhari had made the statement in France. The tweet has been retweeted more than 1000 times.\n\nIn the tweet, he tagged a number of profiles, including those belonging to opposition political figures such as Femi Fani Kayode, an ex-government minister and spokesman for former president Goodluck Jonathan's re-election campaign in 2015.\n\nOn his Facebook page later that morning, Kayode posted the claim, and it was shared more than 600 times.\n\nThe false claims have been shared widely on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, as well as on numerous websites.\n\nOn November 12, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health, Abdulaziz Mashi Abdullahi, said, \u201cIn Nigeria, an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of our populations are believed to suffer from mental disorders.\u201d\n\nHe said this was a significant proportion of Nigeria\u2019s estimated 200 million people.\n\nThe false claims appear to be a misattribution of the minister\u2019s statements, to President Buhari. The claims also disparage mental health illness by describing them as \"mad\".", "lang": "en"}
