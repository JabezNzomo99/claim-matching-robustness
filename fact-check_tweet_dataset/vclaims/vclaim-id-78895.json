Kelly, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Ciara, Kelly Rowland and other groups.\n\nTimberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused \"TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO\u2019S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!\"\n\nThe PSA first caught PolitiFact Florida\u2019s eye when it was shared in Instagram. Then the list got more attention when versions of it trickled into mainstream coverage.\n\nWe are skeptical of chain emails and the like that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose their sources. The meme we\u2019ve seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy.\n\nWe decided to investigate whether dozens of high-profile acts are really joining Wonder and boycotting Florida. Our synopsis: Just because it\u2019s in the news does not make it true.\n\nTalk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman\u2019s \"not guilty\" verdict in the death of Trayvon Martin. Wonder announced then in Quebec City that he will never again perform in Florida until the 2005 \"stand your ground\" law is abolished.\n\nHe took it a step further: \"As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.\" (More than 20 other states have similar \"stand your ground\" laws.)\n\nSeveral musical artists and celebrities reacted to the verdict with anger and disbelief. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including Beyonc\u00e9, Young Jeezy, Jay Z and Justin Timberlake, Patti LaBelle, Bruce Springsteen, and Wyclef Jean.\n\nBut none of the artists on the Instagram list -- even those who have spoken out against the verdict -- publicly announced they are joining Wonder\u2019s boycott. We checked social media accounts, websites and news reports and found no declarations of support for the boycott from the people on the list.\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited \"sources close to Stevie Wonder camp\" for her July 22 report that claimed a similar slate of artists are joining him in support of changing \"stand your ground.\" Some have already called off concerts, she wrote.\n\nHer AURN report was picked up by congressional newspaper The Hill and the Huffington Post on July 22, read and shared by thousands. The next day, even more newspapers picked it up but tried to add a little more caution (including the Tampa Bay Times).\n\nRyan\u2019s list contained two groups that were not on the Instagram roundup: Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&B group The O\u2019Jays, and gospel duo Mary Mary\n\n\"We love our fans but we MUST do something!!\" Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. \"We understand a No from us isn\u2019t as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!\"\n\nThese are the only artists from Ryan\u2019s list of 23 artists who have announced they are joining Wonder\u2019s effort.\n\nRyan has since updated her post with a disclaimer: I obtained from multiple sources early Monday a list of artists and entertainers who my sources told me had committed to a boycott of Florida following the George Zimmerman acquittal. Since publishing that list I have heard from several representatives of the artists named who say, on behalf of their clients, they are uncomfortable being identified on that list and are seeking additional information.\n\nThe Huffington Post, hearing from artists' reps that the list was not true (but not willing to go on the record), later wrote a story discrediting its original post.\n\nThe shows still go on\n\nWe did our own reporting. Most of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. Rihanna, for example, was just in Tampa in April. Madonna is not on tour.\n\n\"This leg of Rod Stewart's tour hasn't ever included Florida dates so that isn't accurate,\" said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart.\n\nMadonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Alicia Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, \"We question the validity of this list since Alicia's name along with many others has appeared erroneously.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told Mother Jones no one in the band had \"heard anything about this.\"\n\nTimberlake and Jay Z do have their shared \"Legends of the Summer\" concert on Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in Orlando.\n\nIf the show is off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist\u2019s website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium tweeted us that the concert \"is on as scheduled.\"\n\nFunk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to play in Tallahassee on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed to tbt*, a daily tabloid published by the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nThe Internet is rife with claims of Stevie Wonder\u2019s beefed-up Florida boycott. It\u2019s short on proof.\n\nMost of the stars identified in social media lists may have spoken out against the verdict or in support of Trayvon, but we haven\u2019t seen them go the extra mile and call off shows until the \"stand your ground\" law is abolished. With the exception of two smaller acts that aren\u2019t included in some iterations of the meme, we could not find evidence to back up the notion that scores of acts are joining up with Wonder's boycott.\n\nWe updated this check after publishing with comments from representatives for Madonna and Alicia Keys.", "lang": "en"}
