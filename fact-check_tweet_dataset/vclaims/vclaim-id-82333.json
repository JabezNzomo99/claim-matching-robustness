The article claimed that Union Minister Smriti Irani appeared to question Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u2018purushartha\u2019 (\u2018manhood\u2019) while comparing it with that of BJP President Amit Shah. In the article, Smriti Irani is quoted saying, \u201cThe BJP president earned his post through his manhood, Rahul got his thanks to his mother\u2019s blessings\u201d.\n\nThe Siasat Daily, an Indian Urdu newspaper from Hyderabad, has also published a report claiming that Irani had questioned Gandhi\u2019s manhood while referring to \u2018purushartha\u2019.\n\nThe statement ascribed to the textile minister said,\u201c\u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0936\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092c\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph translated the word \u2018purushurtha\u2019 to manhood,while the appropriate translation should have been, \u201cThe BJP President earned his post through his industriousness/hard work, Rahul got his thanks to his mother\u2019s blessings.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has also used the term \u2018purushartha\u2019 on several occasions. In a recent speech given at Car Nicobar, Modi had used the word to suggest that due to the hard work/efforts of people in Car Nicobar, the island which was destroyed in the 2004 tsunami has been rebuilt today.\n\nThe word also has a philosophical meaning in Hinduism. In Hinduism, \u2018purushartha\u2019 literally means \u2018an object of human pursuit\u2019 or \u2018human aims\u2019. It is a composite word in Sanskrit formed by two words: human, who is a rational being and aim, which means a purpose or an objective. According to the Vedas, there are four \u2018purusharthas\u2019 (aims of human life) \u2013 Dharma (righteousness/moral values), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire/love) and Moksha (salvation/liberation).\n\nOn page 159 of Contemporary Hinduism by author Robin Rinehart, it is mentioned, \u201cHindu ethicists have arrived at these four goods because they are the most general goods all human beings seek. All humans aim at economic prosperity, political power, satisfaction of sexual instincts, and desire to live in society governed by moral rules and ideals.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, The Telegraph rather embarrassingly misinterpreted \u2018purushartha\u2019 by crudely translating it to \u2018manhood\u2019 whereas the meaning of the term in Hinduism has philosophical significance and in the context of the statement made by Ms. Irani, simply meant industriousness/hard work.", "lang": "en"}
