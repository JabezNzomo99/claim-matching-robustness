Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\n\nThe story said that on behalf of the U.S. Education Department, Trump\u2019s legal team petitioned the court to make America safer. The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that public schools \"will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.\"\n\nHowever, Nowtrump.com (a play on the \"never Trump\" movement) wrote that according to USA Politics Today, students will learn about Islam, as they do about other religions, in history. (Snopes fact-checked the USA Politics Today story in 2017, which is similar to the Nowtrump story.)\n\nThe Nowtrump.com story then made up inflammatory quotes by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\"We certainly shouldn\u2019t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a \u2018religion of peace\u2019 when they see the carnage on the news almost every day,\" Gorsuch said, according to the article.\n\nWe found no actual quote by Gorsuch, and the timing of the alleged court ruling makes no sense based on when Gorsuch joined the court.\n\nFactCheck.org fact-checked a similar story on another website on April 11, 2017, and noted that Gorsuch didn\u2019t hear his first case until April 17 -- about a week after the fake news story first appeared.\n\nIt is worth noting that public schools can teach about religion, according to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In Abington vs. Schempp, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court:\n\n\"It might well be said that one\u2019s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.\"\n\nNowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States \"will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.\"\n\nThere has been no such ruling banning schools from teaching about Islam or Sharia law. The story includes made-up quotes by Gorsuch.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
