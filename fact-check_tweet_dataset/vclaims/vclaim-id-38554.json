The viral message blamed \u201cIslamic jihad\u201d for the incident and claimed that this occurred in Paris. \u201cAfter burning India\u2019s capital, the terrorist community has burnt the French capital as well. #IslamicJihad Now tell did the riots happen because of @KapilMishra_IND\u2019s speech. There is only one solution #EconomicBoycott,\u201d reads the message.\n\nTwitter user @Satynistha posted the viral video (archive link). It was quote-tweeted (archive link) by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief, Sudarshan News and the host of \u2018Bindas Bol\u2019. Chavhanke\u2019s tweet has been retweeted over 3,700 times and @Satynistha\u2019s video has gained over 40,000 views.\n\nSimilarly, several users posted the viral video on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google and found a February 29 report by UK-based The Express which includes screenshots from the viral video. According to the report, a railway station in Paris, Gare de Lyon, was set ablaze by protesters opposing a concert by Fally Ipupa from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported that the fire was started by political opponents of the DR Congo government. They accused Ipupa of being too close to the Congolese government.\n\nAccording to BBC, \u201cFor years parts of the Congolese diaspora have condemned musicians they view as too close to the political elite they blame for destroying the country. As a punishment they have used direct action to effectively ban musicians from performing in Europe and thereby prevent them [from] making money. For about 10 years, some members of the diaspora would try to beat up any musician \u2013 and anyone who was part of the regime \u2013 whenever they visited Europe. It happened to some senior officials in the past few years. Some musicians have had concerts targeted. Fally Ipupa is the first Congolese artist to perform in Europe since then.\u201d\n\nThe BBC report also added that police has arrested 30 people and fined 54 for participating in a banned protest.\n\nTherefore, social media claims attempted to communalise a case of arson by political opponents of the Congolese government in Paris. This wasn\u2019t an attack orchestrated by the Muslim community, as claimed.", "lang": "en"}
