As Snopes and others have pointed out, the authentic photograph was taken in 2002 and can be found on several online archives.\n\nThe caption for the actual photograph, as described on the U.S. Navy\u2019s website, reads as follows:\n\nAt sea aboard USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Sep. 11, 2002 \u2014 In response to the President\u2019s message, \u201cBe Ready,\u201d USS Abraham Lincoln Sailors spell out \u201cREADY NOW\u201d as the Lincoln Battle Group reports on station to conduct combat missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Lincoln and her embarked Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW 14) are currently deployed and will join the Washington Battle Group, which is scheduled to return to its homeport of Norfolk, Va, in the near future.
