The image claims that in 2014 Soros said he is \u201cgoing to bring down the United States by funding Black Hate groups\u201d. The claim is false; the quote does not exist in any BILD publication and Soros\u2019 philanthropic foundation denied it nor Soros pays protestors.\n\nThe image was published on Facebook here on May 31, 2020.\n\nThe purported quote reads: \u201cI'm going to bring down the United States by funding Black Hate groups. We'll put them into a mental trap and make them blame white people. The Black community is the easiest to manipulate.\"\n\nSimilar claims appear on Facebook here, here, here, here, here and here; on Instagram here, here, here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA search of the BILD website and a keyword Google search for 2014 articles only resulted in one mention of Soros in a BILD article here about swear words being used by Bulgarian politicians.\n\nAnother Google search of the alleged quote -- \u201cI'm going to bring down the United States by funding Black Hate groups\u201d -- in English and German did not result in any published Soros interviews that include such remarks.\n\nIn response to the post, a BILD spokesperson told AFP via email on June 12, 2020 that \u201cthere was no interview with George Soros in BILD or BILD.de in 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso in other articles or Interviews in BILD with or about George Soros I cannot find this quote. This meme is definitely a fake,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook on June 1, 2020, Open Society Foundations -- Soros\u2019 philanthropic grantmaking organisation -- denied it or Soros have paid any protesters.\n\n\u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances,\u201d the statement reads.", "lang": "en"}
