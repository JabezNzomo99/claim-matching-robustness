In the caption, the user references 5G towers: \u201cGoogle radiation pneumonitis, bit fishy to me? Are we being kept in so they can install these towers or?\u201d\n\nPublic health agencies such as the World Health Organisation and Public Health England say current research has not definitively linked wave frequencies used by 5G technologies with adverse health effects (here, here).\n\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNRP) has said that while 5G frequencies are higher than those used by previous networks, it \u201cwill not cause any harm\u201d if the commission\u2019s guidelines are followed (here).\n\nRadiation pneumonitis is a form of lung inflammation that can manifest itself in the weeks and months after a person has undergone radiation treatment for cancer. It does have similar symptoms to COVID-19, including shortness of breath, a cough and a fever (here, here, here).\n\nRadiation oncologists Narek Shaverdian and Annemarie Fernandes Shepherd, from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, told Reuters that any similarity ends there.\n\n\u201cThey are caused by very different etiologies,\u201d Shepherd said, with Shaveridan adding that radiation pneumonitis \u201chas nothing to do with the virus\u201d.\n\nAccording to Shepherd, it can sometimes be \u201cchallenging\u201d to diagnose radiation pneumonitis against COVID-19 because of the similar symptoms and findings on CT scans, so extra caution is recommended.\n\nA study authored by both oncologists encourages COVID-19 testing on patients who are suspected to have radiation pneumonitis (here).\n\nBut this is not unusual, or a new development, according to Shaverdian: \u201cBefore COVID-19, whenever anyone had symptoms of radiation pneumonitis they were often checked to make sure it wasn\u2019t just a cold or another lung infection. Now, we also have to make sure it is not COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFalse. Radiation pneumonitis is a possible side effect of cancer treatment but it is not linked to 5G or COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
