The agenda and minutes of these meetings are not publicly available so the details of these discussions remain unknown. However, US objectives in any trade negotiation are quite clearly set out in a report from a body appointed by the White House.\n\nThe report from the Council of Economic Advisers outlines how US drug companies will reduce domestic prices in return for the administration ensuring they can sell their drugs to foreign countries at higher undiscounted prices in any future trade deals. The summary of the report is quite clear:\n\nIndeed, the chair of this committee, Tomas Philipson has been a long-time critic of single-payer collectively funded healthcare systems, such as the NHS, and has been a vocal critic of the way the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), makes decisions about the use of new drugs and considers confidential discounts offered by manufacturers to make them affordable to the NHS.\n\nThe estimate of extra costs the NHS will have to find following any deal that would provide US manufacturers with wider access to the NHS at undiscounted prices is uncertain. But evidence suggests that every \u00a3100m that the NHS must find could have been used to avoid over 500 deaths and save more than 2,300 years of life, mainly in cancer, circulatory, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Also, we would expect to see large impacts on quality-of-life outcomes in mental health, and respiratory and neurological diseases.\n\nInstead of prices, a deal might focus instead on restricting how NICE evaluates new drugs and considers confidential discounts to make them affordable for the NHS. Or it might remove the rebates that are currently paid at a national level to control the growth in the UK drugs bill.\n\nSome have estimated that a deal that matched the US stated objectives could mean spending an extra \u00a3400m on drugs each week \u2013 a truly catastrophic outcome for NHS patients. Yet even if the impact was more modest and removed only the rebates paid as part of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, the impact would still be significant.\n\nIn 2018, rebates of \u00a3614m were paid under this scheme and \u00a3215m has already been paid in the first quarter of 2019. Any deal that removes these rebates is likely to lead to between 3,000 and 4,400 additional deaths, the loss of between 14,000 and 20,000 years of life and between 47,000 and 67,000 quality-adjusted life years (a measure of health that captures the impact on length and quality of life) each year.\n\nMichael Gove\u2019s statement that drug prices are not on the table in a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal is very probably false.\n\nChecking the Facts is a series by The Conversation in which experts review claims made on the 2019 general election campaign trail.
