It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing,\" said the post about the grocery stores. \"People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege.\"\n\nSITE Intelligence Group reported on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting \"lone-wolf jihad in Western countries.\"\n\nFreedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 story on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE\u2019s report. Newsweek also published a story Sept. 7 headlined, \"ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe.\" But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma\u2019s path across the Caribbean and Florida.\n\nFreedom Daily\u2019s story uses a photo of a woman in a blue blouse pushing a shopping cart past empty shelves in a grocery store. That photo was shot on Sept. 5 at a Publix supermarket in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. by the Palm Beach Post \u2014 two days after SITE\u2019s report came out.\n\nThe Miami Herald and several other outlets also reported on Sept. 5 about empty shelves at stores as Floridians prepared for Hurricane Irma. The New York Times on Sept. 4 also noted there were bare water shelves in Puerto Rico as they also braced for the storm.\n\nFreedom Daily\u2019s story itself contains true information, but the headline ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
