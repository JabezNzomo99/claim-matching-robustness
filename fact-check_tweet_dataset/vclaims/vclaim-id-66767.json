And in typical drive-by-media fashion, he said, reporters rushed to spread lies when the news broke and were just as quick to exit when the facts emerged.\n\n\"MSNBC went to paid programming while they had editorial conferences to figure out how to deal with this!\" Limbaugh said, and emphasized the point later in his program. \"MSNBC, like I said, practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation.\"\n\nWe wondered did MSNBC interrupt their programming for an extended commercial break after the details of Brown\u2019s theft were released?\n\nWe should note that the timeline of the revelations is fragmented. Information was released incrementally during three press conferences on Aug. 15.\n\nIn the first press conference, which lasted from 9:43 to 9:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Ferguson police chief Jackson Wilson\u2019s name, gave a timeline of the events surrounding the shooting and robbery and announced he would take no questions. Members of the media received documents on the case and still images from surveillance footage of the robbery in press packets.\n\nThe police report said that \" Brown is the primary suspect in the robbery ,\" and Jackson\u2019s comments seemed to suggest that the encounter between Brown and Wilson was related to the robbery.\n\nLater that afternoon, the entire video of the robbery was released, around the time of a separate press conference by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Johnson expressed his frustration at the Ferguson police\u2019s handling of the case. That press conference lasted from 12:09 p.m to 12:45 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAs for the surveillance video Jackson alluded to in his morning briefing, the exact timing of the full footage release is unclear, with dissonance between the three major cable networks.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was one of the first -- if not, the first -- news outlet to the video at noon Eastern. MSNBC led with the footage minutes later on Andrea Mitchell, after the show began at noon. Fox News aired it 40 minutes later. On CNN\u2019s Wolf, reporter Don Lemon said at 1:13 p.m. that the network still didn\u2019t have the tape in its hands. By 1:25 p.m., host Wolf Blitzer said CNN had the tape but is \"vetting it before we put it on air.\"\n\nIn a later press conference from 3:05 p.m. to 3:14 p.m., Jackson that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery case when he stopped the 18-year-old. Jackson also said that the matter is under investigation and that he released the documents because of Freedom of Information requests.\n\nUsing a software called Critical Mention, we found when the three major cable news networks released the materials related to Brown\u2019s death and robbery and when they went to commercial break on Aug.15. Here\u2019s a timeline (all times Eastern):\n\nAs you can see, MSNBC was actually the first of the three cable networks to show the full video of Brown in the convenience store. It also aired all three press conferences that day, and for longer than either CNN or Fox News. There were no longer-than-usual commercial breaks and certainly no extended commercials or infomercials as Limbaugh's comments suggest. In fact, MSNBC was on air for 54 straight minutes after first airing the surveillance video.\n\nLimbaugh said, \"MSNBC practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation,\" rolling paid advertising in lieu of programming.\n\nThe release of information by the Ferguson police in the morning left Brown\u2019s ties to the robbery unclear. Still MSNBC did not go to commercial break immediately. Nor did it go to break after showing frames from the video police alluded to. And certainly MSNBC never aired an extended commerical or infomercial as Limbaugh's statements suggest.\n\nThough when exactly the entire surveillance video was released is hard to say, MSNBC was one of the first news outlets to air it. After, MSNBC did not go to commercial break and had pundits discuss the video on air until a live press conference began.", "lang": "en"}
