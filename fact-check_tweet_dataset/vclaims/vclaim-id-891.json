The irony of that turn-down was amplified by the letter\u2019s criticism of Einstein\u2019s now-famous theory of special relativity as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cmore artistic than actual physics\u201d:\n\nAlthough Einstein\u2019s initial application for a doctorate at the University of Bern (he had previously been awarded a PhD by the University of Z\u00fcrich in 1905) was indeed rejected as insufficient in 1907, and it was not until the following year that he completed a new dissertation that resulted in his being awarded a doctorate by the University of Bern and given a position as a lecturer at that school, this image depicts a modern creation and not an actual letter sent to Einstein in 1907.\n\nFor starters, the letter exhibits a glaringly erroneous choice of language. The University of Bern, a school located in a country (Switzerland) where the predominant language was German, would not have sent the German-speaking Einstein, who published his academic work in German, a letter written in English. (Even today, Switzerland boasts four official languages, none of them English.)\n\nAs well, the letterhead seen in this image is anachronistic, as it bears the address of what is now the Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics on Sidlerstrasse and references the modern postal code for Bern (3012). But a letter written in 1907 wouldn\u2019t use that form of address, as Sidlerstrasse was named Sternwartsstrasse prior to 1931, and Switzerland didn\u2019t adopt their four-digit postal code system until the 1960\u2019s.\n\nAlso, there never was a dean (or professor) named Wilhelm Heinrich at the University of Bern, the circular stamp seen at the bottom of the letter has no connection to the University whatsoever (it appears to show the coat of arms of Hungary), and there would be no \u201cDean of Science\u201d at the school in 1907 the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Humanities had not yet been separated.\n\nAlthough this image may reflect (at least in part) the essence of a communication Einstein once received from the University of Bern, what is actually pictured here is a modern fabrication, possibly an item used as a prop or offered for sale at a souvenir shop. Curiously, the full version of the image also includes an apparently fabricated reproduction of a U.S. postage stamp featuring Einstein (whose visage actually appeared on an eight-cent stamp issued in 1966, not a 25-cent stamp):", "lang": "en"}
