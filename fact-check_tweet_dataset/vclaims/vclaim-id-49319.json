And the crime was not about cosmetics theft at all.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the earliest traceable copy of the photo of the woman wearing a red shirt was from Dec. 16, 2018 on Facebook (FB) page Zonehistoric fulbe.\n\nThere is no information on the Web describing her as a pageant winner, but her selfie has been used in various accounts on Twitter, Instagram and FB.\n\nThe hoax blog post is scant of information apart from the misused photos, and a link to a \u201cvideo\u201d that when clicked leads to a suspicious domain (profitablegate.com) before landing on another website that claims to offer free bitcoins (freebitco.in).\n\nCalabar Blog\u2019s fake story\u2014the only one on the site\u2014could have reached over 26 million people. Its top traffic generator is a local FB page pretending to be national housing loan agency Pag-IBIG.\n\nThe selfie and burning man combination of images has been used in similar hoaxes published earlier this year. Websites Information NG (informationng2334.blogspot.com) and Xbitgh (xbitgh.com) published on April 23 and May 8, respectively, their versions of the girl\u2019s death.\n\nInformation NG wrote that the beauty queen stole food items, while Xbitgh claimed the woman was a princess who stole makeup kits and an iPhone.", "lang": "en"}
