Many of his works, like \u201cRepublic\u201d and \u201cSymposium,\u201d are still cited today.\n\nYet, while Plato\u2019s works remain eminently quotable, the statement attributed to him the Facebook post appears to be apocryphal. The DCNF searched Plato\u2019s complete works for the expression but found nothing matching or similar.\n\nTwo experts also confirmed in emails to the DNCF that the quote does not come from Plato, with Cornell University professor Charles Francis Brittain writing, \u201cAs quoted there\u2019s no way that\u2019s by Plato.\u201d (RELATED: Did Plato Say, \u2018Be Kind, Everyone You Meet Is Fighting A Hard Battle\u2019?)\n\n\u201cI have thoroughly studied all of the dialogues of Plato and he never wrote this,\u201d Sara Ahbel-Rappe, a professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Michigan with expertise in Plato\u2019s work, said in an email to the DCNF.\n\n\u201cNor had he expressed any interest in \u2018discovering more about a person,\u2019 as his interest was always in the truth of views, not in ad hominem queries,\u201d Ahbel-Rappe continued. \u201cHe did not share our contemporary cult of personality and was not a strategist or politician.\u201d\n\nAn early precursor to the expression appeared in Richard Lingard\u2019s 1696 pamphlet entitled \u201cA Letter of Advice to a Young Gentleman Leaving the University Concerning His Behaviour and Conversation in the World,\u201d according to the website Quote Investigator. In the pamphlet, Lingard wrote, \u201cIf you would read a mans (sic) Disposition, see him Game, you will then learn more of him in one hour, than in seven Years Conversation.\u201d\n\nQuote Investigator found other, more concise variations of the saying appearing after that early instance, with the first known attribution to Plato occurring in the 1950s.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
