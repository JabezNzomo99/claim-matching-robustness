And while we\u2019ve encountered a few postings of this meme, we\u2019ve yet to find any information about where and when this comment allegedly was made.\n\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump passed away in 2000, so she certainly didn\u2019t make the comment recently. We searched a newspaper archive for any mentions of this alleged quote but turned up no news articles containing the remark. In fact, we were unable to find this quote in any books, magazines, or interviews. It appears that this quote was created and exists solely for the purpose of this meme.\n\nWhile this meme features a photograph of President Trump\u2019s mother, another relative in the family goes by a similar first name: Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump. We looked to see if she might have made the remark, but again we came up empty-handed.\n\nTo sum up, the president\u2019s mother did not call him \u201can idiot with zero common sense.\u201d We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
