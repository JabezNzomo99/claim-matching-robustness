Many doctors assume, patients who have been discharged from the hospital, the nucleic acid test returned positive, this is not a recurrence, but has not fully recovered. This has to do with the characteristics of Covid-19. / 2. The immune system is almost completely damaged. SARS only attacks the lungs, does not attack the body's immunity.
