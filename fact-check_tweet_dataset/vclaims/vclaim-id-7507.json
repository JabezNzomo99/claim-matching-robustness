No, that's not true, the story was made up by a website that invents tales about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes, it didn't really happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 24, 2018 by World News Daily Report which was titled \"Babysitter arrested for auctionning the kids under her care on eBay\" (archived here) and which opened:\n\nSt-Louis, Missouri | A babysitter was arrested by the FBI this morning after she tried to sell the three children under her care on the online auction site eBay. According to the FBI, 37-year old Janet Miller was hired to watch over three young children aged between 2 and 6 years old while their mother was working. The children's usual babysitter was undergoing a surgery so their mother hired Ms. Miller through an online agency to act as a replacement for the day. Less than an hour after the mother left for work this morning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a report from the Missouri Department of Social Services reporting about an auction on eBay.\n\nBut the woman in the picture was actually 33-year-old Kisstal Killough, who threatened kids with an axe in Las Vegas, possibly under the influence of drugs or suffering from mental impairment:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
