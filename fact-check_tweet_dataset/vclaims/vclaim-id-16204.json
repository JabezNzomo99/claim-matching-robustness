It was Podesta who was sent out to talk to Hillary\u2019s dejected supporters shortly before Hillary called Donald Trump to concede, with Clinton nowhere to be seen until the following day. When asked about rumors that Hillary was drunk on election night, Kincannon responded, \u201cShe was. I posted about that too. She was in a \u201cpsychotic drunken rage\u201d according to my reporter friend. Doctor added sedatives to the mix.\u201d\n\nThe only source for the story, and versions being shared on other unreliable sites, are the tweets of Todd Kincannon, a controversial figure who has gained notoriety by trolling on Twitter, famously opining in 2013: \u201cThis Super Bowl sucks more dick than adult Trayvon Martin would have for drug money.\u201d On 14 November 2016, Kincannon celebrated the death of PBS journalist Gwen Ifill, then responded to resulting ire by saying, \u201cI trigger liberals for fun and profit. You should try it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the tantrum story was more \u201ctriggering\u201d or a claim Kincannon intended to be taken seriously. He tweeted that an unnamed CNN journalist was blocked from reporting the tantrum by his editors. There is no video provided and no other witnesses corroborating the account:\n\nInfoWars attempts to shore up Kincannon\u2019s claim by citing Crisis of Character, a book written by former Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne, which the Association of Former Agents blasted as being politically motivated and possibly untrue because Byrne\u2019s rank wouldn\u2019t have allowed him close enough access to the Clintons to see what he claims he saw.\n\nThis is not the first time an unsupported claim that Clinton threw a temper tantrum has surfaced. Various unreliable web sites claimed Clinton went into a curse-filled tirade and threw a glass at a staffer after becoming enraged at NBC host Matt Lauer\u2019s questions during a 2016 forum. While the Clinton camp was reportedly unhappy with Lauer\u2019s questions, there are no reliable reports Clinton became violent or profane.", "lang": "en"}
