The gap has been falling almost consistently over time, although there was a slight increase in the provisional data for 2017.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t show differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs, as they are affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women in different occupations. For example, a higher proportion of women work in occupations such as administration and caring, which tend to offer lower salaries.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at this measure of median hourly earnings.\n\nWe looked at this issue in more depth last year.", "lang": "en"}
