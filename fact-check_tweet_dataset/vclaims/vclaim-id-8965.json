{"title": "Deaths during military training: worse than Iraq?", "subtitle": "It's correct that there have been almost as many armed forces deaths on training as in Iraq, although not all could necessarily have been prevented.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-8965", "url": "https://fullfact.org/news/deaths-during-military-training-worse-iraq/", "vclaim": "\"Try this on for size, this figure truly shocked me. Since 2000, 135 military personnel have died while taking part in training and exercise\u2026 In Iraq, we lost only slightly more than that, just over 150 lives. We're killing almost as many of our own with training.\"\n\nThese figures are mostly correct, although not all deaths recorded during military training could necessarily have been prevented. Causes include things like medical conditions and car crashes that also cause fatalities in civilian life.\n\n\u201cBetween 1 January 2000 and 31 October 2015, 134 UK Armed Forces personnel died whilst on training and exercise\u201d, according to the Ministry of Defence.\n\nIn addition, Joshua Hoole, a corporal in the Army, reportedly died during a training exercise in Wales on 19 July.\n\nThe number of deaths \u201cas a result of hostile action\u201d in Iraq is almost exactly the same (136). Including all causes of death, 179 members of the armed forces died in Iraq. This was, however, over a shorter period of time, as UK military operations began in 2003 and mostly ended in 2009.\n\nThe reason for Corporal Hoole\u2019s death isn\u2019t yet known. But the reasons for most other training deaths are recorded.\n\nThey include causes specific to armed forces exercises, such as \u201clive fire\u201d and various types of \u201cadventure training\u201d, but also crashes and deaths from diseases that may not be a direct result of how the training is carried out.", "lang": "en"}
