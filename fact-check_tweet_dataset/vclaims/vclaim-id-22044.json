India-born Mittal is Chairman of ArcelorMittal, world\u2019s largest integrated steel and mining company. The speaker in the audio file can be heard airing his views on topics like PM Modi, secularism, Hindu identity of India, and Ram Janambhumi. The file has been circulated with the message \u2013 \u201cThis speech was given by Mr Laxmi Mittal (second biggest steel manufacturer of India.)\u201d\n\nHere are a few statements from the audio clip:\n\n\u201cIt was Nehru\u2019s fault to have declared India as a secular country. Today 99% of the politicians are bending backwards to appease the minorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho the f*** cares if we are a secular state or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the one PM we have had who thinks of India first and we are accusing him because he is a Hindu.\u201d\n\n\u201cRam Janambhumi has been hanging fire for 350 years. Can you imagine the same thing happening in Rome?\u201d\n\n\u201cHindus are one community that has been subjugated, humiliated, massacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndia was left behind because British ruled us at a time when industrial revolution was happening the world over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they have found a messiah in Modi, why is everyone up in arms?\u201d\n\nThe full audio clip can be heard here:\n\nA number of readers have forwarded the clip to Alt News to verify if the comments were indeed made by Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nThere are a number of clues in the clip that give away the fact that Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman of the ArcelorMittal group, is not making these statements.\n\nTo begin with, the voice and the accent in the audio do not match with the available samples of Lakshmi Mittal\u2019s voice.\n\nThere are other clues that point out that the speaker is not Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nThe person in the audio narrates:\n\n\u201cMy grandfather was one of the second largest steel manufacturers in the country after Tatas. And we were so heavily restricted by the British government, not to allow, not to manufacture more. We were not even allowed to manufacture screws and nails which used to be imported from Sheffield and Manchester and Bristol.\u201d He further says, \u201cI have friends in UK and Germany. I worked for 3 1/2 years in Munich.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s steel business was established by Lakshmi Mittal\u2019s father, Mohanlal Mittal post-independence and there are no records of his grandfather running India\u2019s second-largest steel company during British rule. According to the listing of the Mittal family in Forbes richest families list, Mittal\u2019s father Mohan Lal started the family\u2019s steelmaking business in the 1950s. Facing constraints at home, he sent Lakshmi to Indonesia in 1976 where he set up a plant.\n\nMoreover, an official handle of ArcelorMittal has itself has clarified that the speaker in the audio file is not Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nIt is clear that the audio clip is being circulated with a false narrative in an attempt to give it credibility by portraying it as views of one of the most successful businessmen in the world.", "lang": "en"}
