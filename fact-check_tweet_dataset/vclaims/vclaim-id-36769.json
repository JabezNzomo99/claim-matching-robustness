But Boosie Badazz, the rapper formerly known as Lil Boosie, has a message in the wake of rumors that he got into an altercation with George Zimmerman, the man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in 2012.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" he said in a video posted to his Instagram account on Jan. 15. He described the video as a \"service announcement,\" and then announced that he\u2019s never seen George Zimmerman in his life except on television.\n\n\"George don\u2019t know me, talking about I did something to him at Walmart \u2014 that is a lie,\" he said.\n\nA Jan. 13 Facebook post shows an image with what looks like this headline: \"Lil Boosie and Zimmerman allegedly get into it outside of Florida Wal-Mart.\"\n\nBelow a photo of Lil Boosie and a photo of Zimmerman, the post continues:\n\n\"According to witnesses, Boosie spotted Zimmerman and said, \u2018Hey, you that fat a*s n*gga who killed Travyon right?\u2019 Boosie violently approached Zimmerman. Zimmerman appeared to be \u2018reaching for his gun\u2019, according to witnesses. Although Zimmerman is being hospitalized, Boosie suffered injuries as well, including a busted lip and nose.\n\n\"Boosie is currently in custody and will appear before a judge for assault charges next week.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
