The captions also claimed that her daughter is a JNU student as well.\n\nBOOM ascertained that the person in the photo is 23-year old Shambhavi Siddhi, a Master\u2019s student of the French department of JNU.\n\nA photo of former JNUSU Vice-President Shehla Rashid wearing a green sari with crescent moon and star (resembling the Pakistani flag) went viral on Facebook.\n\nWe found out that the original image was shot in Manhattan and did not contain the crescent moon and star, thus suggesting that the photo was doctored.\n\nAn image of a policeman striking a woman protester during 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape case in Delhi has been revived in the wake of the current JNU protests.\n\nThe picture has been used to paint various narratives - either supporting or condemning the protests and the instances of police brutality.\n\nHowever, it is an image from December 2012, taken by a Reuters journalist, and has no link to the current JNU protests.\n\n7. Photo Of Woman In Muharram Procession Falsely Linked To JNU\n\nAn image of a woman bleeding from her head went viral as a photo of a JNU student injured during the police crackdown of a protest march for the demand of roll back of proposed fees hike.\n\nHowever, the image originates from 2005 and shows the mourning procession during the tenth day of Muharram (called the day of the Ashura).\n\nA screen grab of a Zee News bulletin on JNU protests went viral recently with the claim that one of the protesters is 47-year old Moinuddin from Kerala, who has allegedly been a student there for 30 years.\n\nBOOM ascertained that the person in the photo is actually 30-year-old JNU MPhil student Pankaj Kumar Mishra, who enrolled in the varsity earlier this year.", "lang": "en"}
