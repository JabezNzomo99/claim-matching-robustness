The company\u2019s name is written as two words, not \u201cRipcurl\u201d as appears throughout the Instagram post.\n\nRip Curl\u2019s Australian Instagram account also shows the name as two words.\n\nThe \u201cripcurl_models\u201d Instagram account made its first post on December 21, 2019, with the image of the official Rip Curl logo and no caption. The post for the supposed model call out was posted on December, 29, 2019.\n\nRip Curl Media and Communications Manager, Mimi LaMontagne, told AAP FactCheck that the \u201c@ripcurl_models\u201d Instagram account and its call for models are not genuine.\n\nMs LaMontagne said the company does not conduct model searches on Instagram or any other social media platform and the Rip Curl Group \u201cis in no way associated with the Instagram account\u201c.\n\nA series of other Instagram accounts impersonating major brands and following a similar recruitment drive strategy have popped up on the social media platform in the past. Men\u2019s fashion website HYPEBEAST reported a similar fake Nike account using the same recruitment tactic. While the Daily Mail documented evidence of people falling for a similar fake campaign by an account purporting to be from Lululemon the same year.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck found the Facebook post to be false. The \u201c@ripcurl_models\u201d account is not associated with surfwear brand Rip Curl and the surfwear company has confirmed it does not conduct model searches on Instagram. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
