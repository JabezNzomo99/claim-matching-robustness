A Facebook post claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hired a makeup artist who is paid 15 lakh rupees a month has gone viral on the social media. In our investigation we found that the claim is false. The photo is from 2016 when a team from Madame Tussauds wax museum visited Prime Minister Modi\u2019s house to collect measurements for a wax replica they were building in their museum.\n\nThe post was shared by a Facebook page called \u2018Beware of FROUD MEDIA\u2019. In the photo, a woman could be seen standing alongside Modi. The post claims that the woman in the photo is PM\u2019s personal Make-Up artist who has been hired at a salary of Rs 15 lakh a month.\n\nTo know the truth behind the viral post, we took a screenshot of the image and searched it on Google Reverse Image Search tool. This landed us on a news story of ndtv.com. The same image was used in the story. The story was about Narendra Modi\u2019s wax statue being installed at Madame Tussauds Museum. The video consisted of a video where this same screen grab could be seen. The news was uploaded on the website on March 17, 2016.\n\nWe searched for the official website of Madame Tussaud Museum and there presence on social media. We found this video uploaded on Youtube from the official channel of Madame Tussaud Museum. It was uploaded on March 16, 2016. In this 58-second video, Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be seen with Madame Tussaud\u2019s Artist. The video comes with a caption: \u201cIndian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been involved in the creation of his figure and gave Madame Tussauds renowned artists a sitting at his residence in New Delhi earlier this year.\u201d\n\nLooking at the video, one can see that the woman standing next to Modi was not applying make-up on PM Modi\u2019s face, as alleged in the caption, but is holding up an eyeball while a study of Modi\u2019s facial features was being done for the wax statue.\n\nThis video has more than 76 million views so far. Not only this, more than 600 people have commented on this video.\n\nWe also found a picture on Madame Tussaud\u2019s Facebook page where Narendra Modi can be seen watching his statue. This photo was posted on April 20, 2016.\n\nOn Youtube, we also found a video that showed the making of Modi\u2019s wax Statue. This video was uploaded on Madame Tussaud\u2019s Youtube Channel of Singapore on May 19, 2016.\n\nWe decided to scan the account of the person who shared this image on facebook. With the help of StalkScan, we found that most of the posts on \u2018Beware of FROUD MEDIA\u2019 Facebook page are against the government and Narendra Modi. This page is followed by five million people.\n\nThe admin of this page is Facebook user Harish Humanist. Harish is the native of Agra and resides in New Delhi. According to his profile, he is working as a supervisor in Delhi Metro.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation we found that the post claiming that PM Modi has hired a make-up artist at a salary of Rs 15 lakh per month is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
