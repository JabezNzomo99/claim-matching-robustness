The claim about the test\u2019s efficacy goes against published advice from the US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the UK\u2019s NHS. The purported quote used in the video is in fact not from the inventor of the PCR test.\n\nThe video also repeats previously debunked claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates visited New Zealand recently and that COVID-19 is no different to the common cold.\n\nDr Rashid A Buttar is described on his website as the medical director of The Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research in Cornelius, North Carolina. The site claims the centre\u2019s treatments \u2013 specialising in detoxification and enhancing the immune system \u2013 \u201care so effective that even the North Carolina Medical Board is trying to suppress the truth\u201d.\n\nNear the five minute mark of the video, Dr Buttar claims there is an \u201cexponentially increasing rate of diagnostics showing positive for COVID-19 despite the real-time PCR testing \u2026 not being an appropriate testing methodology that would actually indicate anything that was viable\u201d. He cites PCR inventor Dr Kary Mullis and says the Nobel Prize winner \u201cactually said you cannot use the RT- PCR testing for diagnosing a viral or a bacterial infection or any other type of infectious type of pathology\u201d.\n\nThe quote on the PCR test used by Dr Buttar comes from a 1996 magazine article about HIV/AIDS and is not from Dr Mullis. The quote, which has previously been fact checked, wasn\u2019t made by Dr Mullis and is in fact an extract from the article, which was written by New York writer John Lauritsen. In the article Lauritsen uses a quote from Dr Mullis \u2013 \u201cQuantitative PCR is an oxymoron\u201d \u2013 but then continues with his own writing to say: \u201cPCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers\u201d.\n\nThe false attribution of the quote to Mullis has previously been addressed here, here and here.\n\nA CDC fact sheet on PCR states the test is designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19. In the UK, the NHS says its preferred screening/testing is molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 using real-time PCR.\n\nDr Buttar also claims that Mr Gates, who he says is close friends with NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, was in NZ \u201cas of a few weeks ago\u201d. He adds: \u201cApparently so is Larry Page from Google.\u201d AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims that Mr Gates visited NZ in 2020 with a statement from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ms Ardern gave an address at the Gates Foundation\u2019s Goal Keepers Summit in New York in September 2019. There is no evidence that Mr Page visited NZ recently.\n\nNear the end of the video, Dr Buttar says COVID-19 is no different to the common cold. WHO lists common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, and tiredness but can also \u201crange from no symptoms\u2026 to severe pneumonia or death\u201d. The CDC lists symptoms of the common cold to include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches. The CDC also states on its website that the \u201cvirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\u201d AAP FactCheck has previously debunked this claim.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Dr Rashid Buttar\u2019s claims about the value of PCR testing are not supported by advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US or the NHS in the UK. The quote on the PCR test used by Dr Buttar is not from Dr Kary Mullis and is taken out of context.\n\nThere is no evidence that Bill Gates or Larry Page visited New Zealand in recent months.\n\nThe CDC states the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the same as coronaviruses that cause the common cold.\n\nFalse \u2013 The primary claims of the video\u2019s content are factually inaccurate.\n\n* AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
