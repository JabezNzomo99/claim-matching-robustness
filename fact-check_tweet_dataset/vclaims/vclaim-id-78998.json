So did we.\n\nThe flurry originated with blogger Joshua Cook on Aug. 13. He picked up the phrase \"forced home inspections\" from a state lawmaker in South Carolina.\n\nBack in March, as a group of state legislators discussed a bill to fight the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Rick Quinn of something in the law that worried him: \"The forced home inspections that I\u2019ve heard about.\"\n\nCook was there. And the comment nagged him. He noticed people weren\u2019t really writing about the issue.\n\n\"It's just been bothering me,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nSo he wrote about it last week, talking with an attorney who spoke at the committee hearing and posting of Quinn\u2019s comment.\n\n\"The point is South Carolina legislators believe it, and are convinced this is going to happen,\" Cook told us.\n\nQuinn, indeed, had added to the South Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act to prevent state workers from conducting any \"involuntary \u2026 in-home visitation.\" It passed the House, but the Senate didn\u2019t have a chance to vote. Cook says lawmakers hope to revive the legislation in the next session.\n\nBut that Obamacare program that worries Quinn? It already is \u2014 by statute \u2014 voluntary.\n\nThere\u2019s literally nothing to suggest raids or weapons.\n\nConcerned bloggers pointed to an Obamacare-funded for \"maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting.\" In 2011, the government announced in funding.\n\nMost of those grants are going to \u2014 none, so far, in South Carolina.\n\n: fund visits from nurses and social workers to high-risk families to help them develop skills to keep kids healthy, get them ready for school, and prevent child abuse and neglect.\n\nBut to Kent Masterson Brown, invited by South Carolina lawmakers to help them avoid implementing Obamacare, the programs suggest overzealous nonprofits telling parents how to raise their children without their consent.\n\nBrown raises the specter of a home-schooling family subject to \"intervention\" for school readiness, their children forced into schools and onto medications and vaccines.\n\n\"The federal government will now set the standards for raising children and will enforce them by home visits,\" he wrote about the law.\n\nBut consent is built into the program.\n\nA home visitor could no more compel a family to vaccinate kids than a pediatrician could, said Kay Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School who\u2019s one of the nation\u2019s experts on state home visiting policy.\n\nHere\u2019s what the says: Home-visiting programs must assure they\u2019ll have procedures that ensure \"the participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how that might work, according to Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supports such programs.\n\nA low-income mom gets her prenatal care at a community health center. Her doctor asks if she would like visits from a nurse after the baby comes to offer tips and answer questions.\n\nMom could say yes \u2014 or no.\n\nIt\u2019s like the old days of health care, Rosenbaum said, when nurses would visit families to show how to breastfeed, sterilize bottles, care for babies and cope when you\u2019re exhausted.\n\n\"It's real health education in the home, is the purpose of it,\" she said.\n\nSuch programs have a long history backed by peer-reviewed research, she said. They work.\n\n\"They make sure that you don't go home to nothing. It's done to help families, not to police them.\"\n\nA in Elmira, N.Y., showed nurse visits to families of newborns reduced child abuse and neglect, even years later. They also reduced government spending for low-income unmarried women.\n\nBrown, the lawyer, says he\u2019s concerned families have no protection from social workers. He\u2019s concerned workers won\u2019t be well-trained and will overstep families\u2019 rights.\n\nNobody should knock on your door without a badge, he said.\n\n\"What I see in this is a monster, frankly. And you can quote me on that,\" he said.\n\nThe law, however, specifies that programs be voluntary, their staffs trained and supervised, and the they follow based on strong research.\n\nAny \"forced home inspection\" wouldn\u2019t be under the law \u2014 it would be in direct opposition to it.\n\nAnd if a family welcomed help but later decided it made them uncomfortable?\n\nSamantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency administering the program, said families could stop accepting services \"without consequence at any time and for any reason.\"\n\nBloggers passed around a claim last week that a provision of the new health care law will allow \"forced\" home inspections by government agents.\n\nBut the program they pointed to provides grants for voluntary help to at-risk families from trained staff like nurses and social workers.\n\nWhat bloggers describe would be an egregious abuse of the law \u2014 not what\u2019s allowed by it.
