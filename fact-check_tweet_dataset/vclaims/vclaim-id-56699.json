The bizarre claim is false and has been debunked by experts.\n\nSaying the current pandemic is an \u201corganized one world agenda,\u201d the incorrect Facebook post published by several netizens claimed, among other things:\n\u2022 that humans are getting sick because the \u201cbioengineered\u201d coronavirus in one\u2019s body is reacting to 5G,\n\u2022 that 5G is being installed in the country via \u201cMislatel towers,\u201d and\n\u2022 that a coronavirus vaccine \u201cwith an RFID chip\u201d will be introduced as the cure for the disease, which the post refers to as \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A web page about 5G and health, the World Health Organization (WHO) said \u201cno adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.\u201d\n\nIt noted that tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction observed between radiofrequency fields and the human body, but radio frequencies emitted by current technology only result in a \u201cnegligible rise\u201d in body temperature.\n\n5G technology also does not spread COVID-19 because viruses \u201ccannot travel on radio waves,\u201d said WHO.\n\nWHO has repeatedly stated that the virus is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, or when a person touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes after coming in contact with a contaminated surface.\n\nThe claim that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is bioengineered, is likewise unsupported.\n\nA study published March 17 in the journal Nature Medicine said evidence shows the virus is \u201cnot a purposefully manipulated virus\u201d and that the researchers \u201cdo not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\u201d Evidence collected by the WHO point to SARS-CoV-2\u2019s \u201cecological origin in bat populations.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases globally contradicts the claim that 5G makes people sick by causing a reaction with the coronavirus in the human body. Not all 188 countries and regions where COVID-19 has been recorded have 5G connection.\n\nA February report by American network testing company Viavi Solutions says only 34 countries around the world have access to commercial 5G networks as of January 2020.\n\nMislatel does not have 5G yet\n\nThe conspiracy theory also mentioned \u201ctowers\u201d of Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. (Mislatel) as the source of the 5G frequency causing people\u2019s acquisition of the virus in the country.\n\nThe Mislatel consortium, renamed Dito Telecommunity, which was awarded July last year the license to operate as the country\u2019s third telco provider, has yet to offer 5G network services. Reports say that the company will start with 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology before it rolls out 5G services.\n\nGlobe Telecom Inc. is the only service provider that offers a 5G network for commercial use in the country, introduced June last year -- way before the first COVID-19 case in the country was confirmed on January 30 this year.\n\nThe FB post also claimed that a \u201cvaccine with RFID chip\u201d will be given to people as a \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19. This is false on two accounts.\n\nFirstly, a vaccine does not cure a disease but prevents it. The United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Prevention and Control broke down what a vaccine does:\n\n\u201c(It) stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.\u201d\n\nSecondly, the claim of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed with an RFID chip has been called \u201cpreposterous\u201d by a health expert, according to a fact check article of Poynter Institute\u2019s Politifact that debunked a similar claim.\n\nDr. Wilbur Chen of the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health said even the smallest version of RFID chips are still \u201crather large such that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle.\u201d\n\nRFID is an information-storing technology composed of a tag -- like in the form of a chip -- and a reader. Using radio waves, a reader will be able to identify tags in its vicinity and access the data stored in them.\n\nSeveral iterations of the circulating FB post carried a screengrab of an article by website disclose.tv, published more than a year before the new coronavirus was identified. It made no mention of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, disclose.tv\u2019s thumbnail, visible in the circulating FB posts, is misleading. It spliced together a 2002 Agence France-Presse photo of the first implantable RFID microchip approved for human use, and a 2007 stock photo of a hand that was photoshopped to make it look like an RFID chip was inserted in its flesh.\n\nThe viral post on this particular conspiracy theory started circulating on March 30 and continued to be shared through the Holy Week likely because of its religious undertones. It posits that the pandemic was \u201corganized\u201d to give everyone the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d -- an allusion to a symbol of the devil from the Bible\u2019s Book of Revelation.\n\nThe theory claims that worship houses and churches are being shut down \u201cto weaken praise and worship activity,\u201d so that \"the Spirit of Anti-Christ can come.\" It tells others to share the information \u201cif you love the Lord Jesus.\u201d\n\nThe government has prohibited mass gatherings, including religious ceremonies, as part of the implementation of community quarantine to control the spread of the virus.\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows there are 141 identical posts by FB pages and public groups carrying the false conspiracy theory. Posts from April were reshared again starting May 10, a day after the Philippines marked its 100th day since recording its first confirmed COVID-19 case.\n\nFour of the most shared versions of the post -- three of which were published by private netizens while one was published in public group LIFE SAVING STATION -- already accumulated over 9,600 shares, 2,200 reactions, and 1,700 comments.", "lang": "en"}
