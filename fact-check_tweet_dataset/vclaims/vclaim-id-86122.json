Kavanaugh for comments he made regarding \u201cabortion-inducing drugs\u201d when discussing a case brought by an antiabortion religious group challenging Obamacare rules on providing employees health coverage for contraception. She is not the only Senate Democrat to claim that Kavanaugh might undermine access to birth control if he wins a seat on the court -- here\u2019s Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley and Dianne Feinstein -- but we will focus on Harris because she tweeted out a video that snipped out a key part of his statement.\n\nIn 2013, Priests for Life and other Catholic hospitals, universities and the like sued the Department of Health and Human Services over the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide contraception as part of health insurance coverage for employees. The law included an opt-out provision, but the plaintiffs, citing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, said their exercise of religion was unfairly burdened because the ACA required that they fill out a form or be subjected to monetary penalties. The Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, a 1993 law signed by President Bill Clinton, was introduced in the House by then-Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and in the Senate by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).\n\n\u201cThat was a group that was being forced to provide a certain kind of health coverage over their religious objection to their employees, and under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the question was first, was this a substantial burden on the religious exercise? And it seemed to me quite clearly it was,\u201d Kavanaugh replied. \u201cIt was a technical matter of filling out a form, in that case with -- that -- they said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -- as a religious matter, objected to.\u201d\n\nBut, as we noted, Harris is not backing down. \u201cIt had been originally just edited for length like almost all videos are, but we wanted to make sure that if there was any confusion, we posted the full video so people can see,\u201d said spokeswoman Lily Adams. \u201cOur point in the original tweet is unchanged, which is that he uses this term that is extremely political and medically inaccurate with no critique or effort to note any type of disagreement.\u201d\n\nAdams pointed to a number of media reports, including in The Washington Post, that highlighted Kavanaugh\u2019s use of the phrase \"abortion-inducing drugs.\" As readers know, just because it\u2019s in the mainstream media doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s correct. (The brief mention in The Post, which said he \u201cappeared to refer to birth control as \u2018abortion-inducing drugs,\u2019\" was mostly about anti-Kavanaugh tweets about his comment.)\n\nFor instance, in referring to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, he writes, \u201cThey complain that submitting the required form contravenes their religious beliefs because doing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe operate as abortifacients.\u201d (At issue in particular is the morning-after pill, or Plan B, which some believe could thin the lining of a uterus and thus in theory could destroy a fertilized egg, though evidence of that is slim.)\n\nWhen it comes to contraception -- which Harris and her colleagues suggest Kavanaugh opposes -- he wrote that the government appeared to have \u201ca compelling interest in facilitating women\u2019s access to contraception.\u201d To alleviate the cost to society of unintended pregnancies, \u201cthe Federal Government has long sought to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, including through the Affordable Care Act by making contraceptives more cheaply and widely available.\u201d He added that a previous Supreme Court ruling \u201cstrongly suggests that the Government has a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception for the employees of these religious organizations.\u201d\n\nWhen we pointed out the section of the dissent concerning contraception, Adams countered that Kavanagh appeared to struggle to say whether previous Supreme Court rulings were correctly decided when the court said the government could not prohibit either married or unmarried people from using contraceptives. He instead referred to previous statements made by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.: \"That\u2019s what they said.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Kavanaugh was asked specifically about his dissent and cited the plaintiffs' position. The fact that critics removed the phrase \u2018they said\u2019 from his answer shows that they knew he was citing the party\u2019s opinion and were deliberately trying to mislead the public,\u201d said White House spokesman Raj Shah. \u201cAs Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion stated, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, it\u2019s the court or a judge\u2019s job to determine \u2018only the sincerity of a plaintiff\u2019s religious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that religious belief.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
