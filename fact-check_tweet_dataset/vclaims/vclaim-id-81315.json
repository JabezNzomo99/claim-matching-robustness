While the use of a private e-mail account is not prohibited by federal law, questions remain over the circumstances. Among them: Did Clinton\u2019s staff appropriately comb through all records that would qualify as matters of public business? Why did Clinton not turn over records of her own accord, prior to the State Department\u2019s request? What are the legal ramifications, if any, of her use of private e-mails?\n\nClinton has served in a much more e-mail-savvy time than her predecessors and has immediate access to her records. (The \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d meme has gone viral among her supporters using the popular photo of her on her BlackBerry, wearing shades.) The State Department is now working with previous secretaries about whether they have any records that can be made for archiving.\n\nWhen Colin L. Powell served as secretary of state from 2001 to 2005, he did use his personal e-mail address for official business, as Schumer noted. He is known as the first secretary to modernize the agency\u2019s computer system and use of technology. But Powell said during a March 8 interview on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d that he \u201cretained none of those e-mails.\u201d His e-mail account from 10-plus years ago has been closed for years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any to turn over. I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off. I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files,\u201d Powell said on the show. \u201cIn fact, a lot of the e-mails that came out of my personal account went into the State Department system. They were addressed to State Department employees and the state.gov domain. But I don\u2019t know if the servers at the State Department captured those or not. And most \u2014 they were all unclassified and most of them, I think, are pretty benign, so I\u2019m not terribly concerned even if they were able to recover them.\u201d\n\nNARA confirmed to The Fact Checker that it opened an inquiry into locating Powell\u2019s e-mail records. Given that he is unable to immediately provide the records, it is not an accurate comparison to Clinton\u2019s situation. Her e-mails were accessible enough to turn over to the State Department soon after the agency requested them. (Indeed, according to the Times, Clinton\u2019s staff had been negotiating about the return of the e-mails since August, two months before the letter was sent.)\n\nSchumer\u2019s spokesman, Matt House, noted that the National Archives has always required the secretaries to preserve their records regardless of the format, and the same requirements applied to Powell and Clinton. Powell is \u201ca perfect comparison to Clinton. Neither were prohibited from using personal e-mail. Both were supposed to preserve their records. Both likely have the vast majority of their records preserved anyway because they sent them to and got them from state.gov accounts where someone else preserved them. However, in one instance (Clinton), she kept her records and has been able to turn them over to State. And in Powell\u2019s case, whatever unique records he had were ultimately destroyed.\u201d (Our friends at PolitiFact rated Schumer\u2019s statement Mostly False.)\n\nSchiff\u2019s spokesman, Patrick Boland, pointed out that Schiff acknowledged each secretary must be judged on the circumstances. Indeed, Schiff said later in the CNN interview: \u201cAs a matter of law, we have moved as of last year to a requirement that official e-mails be used for official business. But we have to evaluate and consider the secretary under the standard of what was the law at the time. And the law at the time was she could use her personal e-mail as long as she preserved it.\u201d\n\nThis talking point applies a direct comparison between Clinton and her predecessors. We focused on her two immediate predecessors who were in office the past 14 years, when e-mail usage became more widespread. Albright did not use personal or professional e-mails. Rice rarely used e-mails while secretary. Powell did use his personal account on the job, and by his own admission no longer has access to the account he used then. The State Department, NARA and Powell\u2019s staff are now working to figure out what e-mails need to be, or could be, retrieved.\n\nBy the time Clinton took office, federal expectations for archiving electronic records were clearer than they were under Powell\u2019s tenure. That does not absolve Powell for not being able to locate his records a decade later, or for not turning them over to National Archives back then. But it does mean that Clinton was held to a more definitive standard. Moreover, this common defense among her supporters is used to deflect the central issue: that Clinton exclusively used a personal account, and did not provide records until she was requested to, after she left office. That is the most relevant point, so the Democrats earn Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
