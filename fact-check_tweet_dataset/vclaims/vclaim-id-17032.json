Republican 2012 nominee Mitt Romney has called for Trump to release them, saying that it\u2019s \u201cdisqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse\u201d to do so.\n\nEvery major party nominee since the late 1970s has released tax returns before Election Day.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about releasing the returns at a February presidential debate, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t learn anything from a tax return,\u201d a claim he repeated this week in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nHe similarly said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8 that \u201cyou don\u2019t learn much from tax returns.\u201d\n\nBut voters learn several pieces of information from candidates\u2019 tax returns.\n\nRoberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us that there are three things we could learn from Trump\u2019s tax returns: details about where he gets his income and how much it is; \u201chow he\u2019s structuring his income for tax purposes\u201d; and what kind of deductions he takes, including charitable giving. If Trump had overseas income or foreign bank accounts, for instance, that information would be on his tax return.\n\nJeremy Scott, editor in chief of the commentary and analysis products for the nonprofit Tax Analysts, told us in a phone interview that it was \u201cstrange for Trump to say you don\u2019t learn anything,\u201d when just four years ago, Romney\u2019s effective tax rate, revealed through his tax returns, was a significant issue. (In fact, Romney\u2019s 14 percent effective tax rate in 2010, due to most of his income coming from dividends and capital gains, became fodder for Obama campaign attack ads.)\n\nScott told us that ever since President Richard Nixon released his returns in 1973, the candidate\u2019s returns have been \u201ca form of checking on how a candidate conducts his financial affairs.\u201d Conflicts of interest can be exposed, as well as how a candidates\u2019 individual tax policy squares with his proposals.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, said Scott, pushed the idea of paying your fair share, but his returns \u2014 released by his presidential library after he was in office \u2014 show he was \u201cactually very aggressive at trying to minimize his own taxes.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Analysts\u2019 Tax History Project is compiling an online archive of candidates\u2019 returns. Project Director Joseph J. Thorndike wrote in a May 12 blog post on taxnotes.com that beyond an effective tax rate, \u201c[r]eturns can shed light on the way a candidate lives his life. It can tell us about charitable giving as well as personal borrowing and investment activity. Returns can also illuminate the complicated business arrangements that often provide the bulk of a candidate\u2019s income, especially for a real estate mogul like Trump.\u201d\n\nAnd the returns also \u201ctell us a lot about how candidates conduct themselves in the gray areas of the tax law,\u201d Thorndike wrote. \u201cSome items on a tax return are black and white, like the income reported on a W-2. But other items, especially for someone with lots of non-salary business income, are open to debate and interpretation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments also prompted Time magazine to outline \u201c5 Interesting Things We Learned From Presidential Tax Returns,\u201d including: Obama gave sizable charitable contributions to his controversial pastor; Romney had an unusually high IRA balance; and President George H.W. Bush gave nearly 62 percent of his 1991 income to charity.\n\nJustin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan, wrote in a May 11 piece in the New York Times that without the returns, voters are left to make their own inferences as to why Trump won\u2019t release them. By releasing them, voters may learn that Trump isn\u2019t hiding something that\u2019s worse than what\u2019s actually there.\n\nIn other words, if \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to learn,\u201d voters would, in fact, learn that.\n\n\u201cThis explains why candidates like Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton were willing to release their returns, despite revealing useful ammunition for their opponents,\u201d Wolfers wrote. \u201cIn each case, it was a savvy choice, because not revealing would have led voters to infer they were hiding something worse.\u201d\n\nIf Trump does not release his tax returns prior to the November election, he would be the first major party nominee not to do so in decades.\n\nIn 1976, Gerald Ford released a summary of his tax returns, rather than the complete tax returns.\n\n\u201cEvery other major party nominee since then has released complete tax returns: not just summaries, not just a Form 1040, but the whole thing,\u201d Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told us in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s been standard practice and that\u2019s what voters have come to expect.\u201d\n\nOf the remaining Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton has released the last eight years of full returns, posted on her website, and Bernie Sanders has released one year.\n\nOn May 11, Romney posted a message to Facebook calling Trump\u2019s refusal to release tax returns \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d\n\nRomney then went on to suggest that the only \u201clogical explanation\u201d for Trump\u2019s refusal is that his returns contain \u201ca bombshell of unusual size.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps ironic that Romney is suggesting \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 there may be a \u201cbombshell\u201d in Trump\u2019s tax returns. In 2012, then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the unfounded claim that an anonymous source told him Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. He called on Romney to release tax returns prior to 2010 to prove him wrong.\n\nRomney released his 2010 tax returns in January 2012, and he released his 2011 tax returns in September 2012 (when he said they were finally completed). Romney said he would not release any more than those two years, arguing that he was only following the \u201cprecedent\u201d set by Sen. John McCain in releasing just two years of tax returns. As we wrote in July 2012, Romney was correct about the number of returns released by McCain, but we noted that McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, bucked the trend of other recent presidential candidates.\n\nAs we noted then, in more than three decades, no other nominees for either party have released fewer than five years\u2019 worth of returns.", "lang": "en"}
