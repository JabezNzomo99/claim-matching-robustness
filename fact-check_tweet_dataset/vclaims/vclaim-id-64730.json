It does not specify that an abortion opponent be appointed. Even after Mitt Romney changed his position on abortion to pro-life, a new attack ad says he \"governed pro-abortion.\" The ad , put out by the Newt Gingrich campaign, is airing in South Carolina before the state\u2019s presidential primary. It raises several examples from Romney\u2019s abortion record, including this one: that he \"put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board.\"We decided to look further.The ad cites the text of the far-reaching Massachusetts health care law Romney signed in 2006 when he was governor, as well as the website ProLifeProfiles.com Among other things, the law establishes the MassHealth Payment Policy Advisory Board and says it shall have \"one member appointed by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.\" It also includes two heads of state agencies plus members from the mental health field, a hospital association, aging services and other areas. It does not specify that an abortion opponent be appointed.\n\nThe governor of Massachusetts gets to appoint two of the 14 board members. When Romney was governor, he appointed Deborah Enos, president of Neighborhood Health Plan, a Medicaid managed care organization, and Bob Moran, an expert in payment methodologies at the University of Massachusetts. (Both are named in this implementation report from 2006.) It\u2019s true that neither of them represents an anti-abortion group.\n\n \n\n The problem with the Gingrich ad's claim, however, is that the board\u2019s job is to review state Medicaid reimbursement rates -- it does not address abortion policy at all.\n\n \n\n \"It has nothing to do with saying what they\u2019ll cover, what they won\u2019t cover\" in abortion services, said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, an organization opposed to abortion.\n\nWe also reached out to NARAL Pro-Choice America, which advocates for legal abortion, for its take on the matter.\n\n \n\n Spokesman Ted Miller responded that the group\u2019s position \"is that the Massachusetts healthcare plan enacted during former Gov. Romney\u2019s tenure replaced a program that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n\n\n Gingrich\u2019s ad argues that Romney, after changing his position on abortion to \"pro-life,\" made governing decisions contrary to that stance. One example, according to the ad: He appointed Planned Parenthood to a state medical board but didn\u2019t also appoint a pro-life group.\n\n \n\n But the board the ad refers to was created as part of Massachusetts\u2019 health care overhaul, which the Legislature passed and which Romney signed, and its function is to review Medicaid reimbursement rates. The law also specifies where 12 of the board's 14 members must come from, including one member appointed by Planned Parenthood. It's true that Romney didn\u2019t appoint any abortion foes to the board -- but the board doesn\u2019t deal with abortion or have any say in what abortion services are covered by state-subsidized insurance policies. So that claim is correct but leaves out an important detail. Our ruling: Half True.", "lang": "en"}
