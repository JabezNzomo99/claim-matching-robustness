The claim is false; the local government and police said the Tamil-language street name sign was in fact vandalised.\n\nThis Facebook post published a photo collage of street name signs in the Sri Lankan city of Panadura and a tweet screenshot on November 24, 2019, claiming that one shows the \u201coriginal\u201d picture and the other an \u201cedited\u201d picture.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 340 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cMangala\u2019s disgusting work.\u201d\n\n\u201cMangala\u201d refers to Mangala Samaraweera, former Sri Lankan finance minister. He resigned from his ministerial position in mid-November 2019 after his United National Party\u2019s presidential candidate lost in the presidential election.\n\nThe photo on the left shows a screenshot of Samaraweera\u2019s tweet on November 22, 2019. The English-language tweet reads: \u201cBarely one week since the election, the ugly face of majoritarianism is raising its ugly head again. Tamil street names have been removed. The country awaits your response, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe tweet also includes photos of street sign names that are blank.\n\nOn the Facebook collage, a red arrow points at the tweet, with a Sinhala-language text which translates to English as: \u201cFailing miserably at mud-slinging even after losing, Mangala mud-slinger\u2019s bankrupt photoshop jobs.\u201d\n\nThe image on the right side shows street name signs in Sinhala, Tamil and English. An arrow pointing at the image reads: \u201cThe original one\u201d.\n\nThe Sinhala text at the bottom of the image reads: \u201cSir, gone are the days when you could Photoshop and fool people\u201d.\n\nThe street name signs in the pictures show the sign of a street named Susantha Mawatha, in the city of Panadura.\n\nThe official languages policy of Sri Lanka stipulates: \u201cThe Sinhala and Tamil languages are both the official and national languages in Sri Lanka while English is the Link Language,\u201d referring to the language used to communicate between the two ethnic groups. Street names have to be written in the three languages.\n\nThe same images were shared on Facebook here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThis claim is false; the Panadura urban council chairman and the Panadura South Police told AFP the Tamil-language street name sign was actually vandalised.\n\nNandana Gunathilaka, chairman of the Panadura Urban Council, told AFP by phone on November 29 that the street name sign was vandalised.\n\n\u201cWe noticed the vandalisation on November 21; the street name signs are stickers, and the Tamil-language sign had been ripped off. I immediately lodged a police complaint and the police arrived at the site to inspect the area,\u201d Gunathilaka said. He also said further inspections revealed there had been other attempts to vandalise Tamil-language street name signs in a similar manner.\n\nGunathilaka posted photos and a video of the vandalised street name sign on his Facebook page on November 21, 2019.\n\nAt the two-second mark of this 59-second clip, a police vehicle can be seen passing the vandalised sign.\n\nGunathilaka also uploaded a photo of the receipt issued after he lodged a police complaint about the vandalised sign on November 21, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the receipt:\n\nGunathilaka told AFP that a few days later, an unidentified group restored the Tamil-language sticker.\n\n\u201cIt is not a restoration that was carried out by the local government body. We suspect it\u2019s the same group that tried to stir trouble in the first place. If you look closely, the colour and the font used in the new sticker is different to the original sticker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the image of the mysteriously renovated name board that is now being circulated with the false claim that the vandalisation never took place.\u201d\n\nThis Google Street View image, dated October 2015, shows the location of the street name sign.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the original name board as seen on Google Street View (L) and the street sign name pictured in the misleading posts (R). The shades of blue and the fonts used in the two photos are different.\n\nPanadura South Police told AFP on November 29, 2019 it had launched an investigation to find the person or people who vandalised the sign.\n\nIndian news outlet News18 reported on November 26, 2019, here that Sri Lankan Prime Minister ordered an investigation into Tamil-language street signs vandalisation cases.", "lang": "en"}
