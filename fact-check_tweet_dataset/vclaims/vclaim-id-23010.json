His tweet has hypothesized that Rajamma Vavathil, the nurse who was present during Congress President Rahul Gandhi\u2019s birth, was only 13 years old at the time. According to his claim, the present age of Rajamma\u2019s is 62 while Rahul is 49. The user took a jibe at Gandhi by tweeting, \u201cYaha bhi Saala Scam (There is a scam here as well -translated)\u201d. The handle quote-tweeted a tweet by ANI which reported Rahul Gandhi\u2019s meeting with Rajamma Vavathil during a 3-day visit to his new constituency Wayanad.\n\nMuralikrishna is followed on Twitter by the office of Piyush Goyal. At the time of writing this article, this tweet has been liked more than 12,100 times and retweeted close to 6,700 times.\n\nA screenshot of the same tweet was also shared by many other individual users on Facebook.\n\nAlt News found that the claim about Rajamma\u2019s age is untrue, according to several media reports. As per a report published by India Today, Rajamma is a \u201c72-year-old\u201d retired nurse. The Hindu, The Quint, Republic TV and The Asian Age similarly reported her age as 72.\n\nFurthermore, a detailed report published by The Outlookstated that Rajamma Vavathil, who was then a nurse serving at the Holy Family Hospital, was 23 years old at the time of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s birth in 1970.\n\nAlt News contacted Rajamma Vavathil to confirm her age during the time when Rahul Gandhi was born. She said, \u201cI was 23 when Rahul Gandhi was born. I am a 72-year-old lady now. It has been 48 years since he was born. The relationship between me and Rahul Gandhi is that he was born in front of me and I call him beta [son]. My date of birth is June 1, 1947. He was born on June 19, 1970. You calculate. I don\u2019t want to be insulted like this. I am not into politics.\u201d Thus, the claim that Rajamma was only 13 years old when Rahul Gandhi was born is factually incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
