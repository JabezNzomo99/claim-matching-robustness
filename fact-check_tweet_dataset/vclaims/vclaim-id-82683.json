Advani at Viramgam, Gujarat, in \"1987-1988\", which he then sent to Delhi using e-mailing service.\n\n\"The picture was printed in full colour in the newspaper the very next day, much to the surprise of Mr. Advani,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister received sharp criticism for his comments, as many pointed out that neither digital cameras, nor internet were available to the Indian public prior to the 90s.\n\nSome others also claimed that the technology for taking photos digitally, and for electronic mailing, were both available long before the 1980's.\n\nWith the heated debate around the prime minister making untrue claims, BOOM decided to look into their possibilities\n\nThere are two major questions that arise from his statement:\n\u2022 Could Modi have been in the possession of a fully functional digital camera between 1988 to 1989?\n\u2022 Would it have been possible for him to send the image from Viramgam to Delhi using e-mailing service?\n\nThe Very First Digital Cameras\n\nAccording to a New York Times blog, the first digital camera was made in 1975 by a 25-year old Steven Sasson, under the employment of Eastman Kodak.\n\nHowever, the camera was never made commercially available to the public, due to its poor quality as compared to 110 colour negative film that were in use at that time.\n\nIn 1981, Sony beat Kodak in making the first film-less camera - the Pro Mavica, which was then made commercially available in 1987. However, as opposed to Kodak's previously made digital camera, Mavica was an analog camera, which stored images in a two-inch floppy disk.\n\nAfter a thorough research, BOOM found two contenders for the position of the first digital camera commercially available to the public: the Fuji DS-X and the Kodak DCS 100.\n\nFuji had been running its own digital camera R&D since the 1970s and had come up with their first prototype of the digital camera in 1988 with the model DS-1P. This model was, however, not made available to the public.\n\nA year later, it came up with the more advanced DS-X - a fully digital camera - which saw its first sale in December 1989, for a price of $20,000 or Rs. 14 lakh- which would roughly translate to Rs. 28 lakh today, adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe same year, Kodak came up with their prototype of a newer and more advanced digital camera with a photo resolution of more than one million pixels.\n\nKodak made its new model - the DCS 100 - available commercially in 1991, according to a Mashable article.\n\n\n\nThis makes December 1989 the earliest possible instance for Modi to come in possession of a digital camera, provided the humongous price of Rs. 14 lakh (or inflation adjusted price of Rs. 28 lakh, in present day) was paid for the purchase.\n\nHowever, as far as the year 1988 is concerned, the prime minister's claim of using the digital camera to take a photo of Mr. Advani is highly unlikely.\n\nAnd Then Came The Internet\n\nWhile speaking to News Nation, Modi said, \"Very few people had e-mails back then (1987-1988)... I clicked a picture of him (Advani) with the digital camera.. I took the photo and transmitted it to Delhi.\"\n\nBOOM reached out to BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya for clarification on this rather ambiguous aspect of Modi's claim, but did not get a response. The article will be updated if and when he responds.\n\nMeanwhile, BOOM worked on the assumption that the prime minister's mention of e-mail suggested that he had used an electronic mailing service to send the photo in question.\n\nIncidentally, e-mailing has been around since as early as the 1960s, but operated across closed computer networks as opposed to the internet today.\n\nIndia's early brush with the internet came with the formation of the Education and Research Network (ERNET) in 1986.\n\nThis saw the setting up of the first dial-up network in the country between eight premier institutions - National Centre for Software Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, five Indian Institutes of Technology at Delhi, Bombay, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras, and the Department of Electronics (GOI), New Delhi, with the help of the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nOn August 14, 2015, News18 published an excerpt from a book called NetCh@kra by Dr. Srinivasan Ramani, one of the founders of ERNET, where he jots down the details regarding the advent of internet and electronic mailing in India.\n\nBOOM reached out to Ramani for a comment, and the article will be updated upon his response.\n\nWhile e-mailing services were available in 1988, Ramani's book makes it clear that until the introduction of public internet access by VSNL in 1995, the service was limited to the academic network. It was only after 1995 that individuals with access to the newly launched internet in India could send e-mails to each other.\n\nTherefore, Modi could not have possibly sent an e-mail in 1988, as he claimed.\n\nModi's interview to News Nation right in the middle of the general elections has been marred with other controversies as well, with his quotes drawing sharp criticism and ridicule from social media users and the opposition.\n\nSeveral bytes from the interview have gone viral since, where the prime minister was found making unrealistic claims.\n\nPreviously, he had claimed that his decision to conduct airstrikes over Balakot was influenced by the fact that it was cloudy that day, which would \"help in avoiding radar detection\".\n\nThis, along with his claims of using digital cameras and e-mails, have led to the hashtags #CloudyModi and #GadgetGobhi trending on Twitter on May 12 and 13, 2019.\n\nPhase 7 of the general elections will be held on May 19, 2019, when the country will go to the polls one last time, while the results will be announced on May 23.", "lang": "en"}
