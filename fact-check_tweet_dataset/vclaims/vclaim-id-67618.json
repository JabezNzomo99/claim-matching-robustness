That bill instituted a \"health insurance premium assessment.\" For those of you who like government speak in plain talk (we sure do) that\u2019s the 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums levied against insurance companies but ultimately passed onto consumers.\n\n \n\n As Johnson sees it, that means less money in Oregonians\u2019 pockets, and therefore less for paying medical bills. \"I don't think there's any way to deny that employees ... will have fewer dollars to take home,\" he said.\n\n \n\n But this 1 percent tax -- and its impact on families -- is begging for some context.\n\n \n\n In terms of insurance premium increases, a 1 percent bump may not exactly be welcome, but, according to the state, it\u2019s a small part of what typically are higher annual rate increases.\n\n \n\n Not all of the increases for 2010 have been submitted, but so far they range from 8 to 17 percent, according to the Insurance Division of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. In 2008, some Oregonians saw increases of nearly 30 percent.\n\n \n\n Again, a 1 percent increase isn\u2019t negligible, but given these numbers, it doesn\u2019t account for most of the increases Oregon families see.\n\n \n\n \"Not every consumer can afford to pay the increase,\" Wand says. \"How many additional children have become uninsured as a result of the increases in premiums?\"\n\n \n\n But there\u2019s one last thing to consider in this debate: the cost of the uninsured.\n\n \n\n That 1 percent tax went toward eventually insuring 80,000 children. Now, it might not seem as though insuring those kids has any sort of effect on anybody other than those kids, but there are some indications that say otherwise.\n\n \n\n Yet another health care report, this one by John McConnell of Oregon Health & Science University and Neal Wallace of Portland State University, says the cost of caring for the uninsured -- which often takes place in hospital emergency rooms -- accounts for 6 to 9 percent of the average health insurance premium.\n\n \n\n Numbers about how much children contribute to that total are hard to come by, but a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation study from 2004 looked at numbers from 1998 through 2000 and estimated that, overall, there was about $40.7 billion in uncompensated health care spending during those years. Of that, $5.4 billion came from uncompensated care for children. Those figures are in 2004 dollars.\n\n \n\n Because of this indirect cost, Democrats could -- and do -- argue that insuring these 80,000 children will, over time, lead to a slowdown of premium increases. Of course, as Wand points out, that\u2019s no help to families today.\n\n \n\n Now, for the ruling. While it\u2019s true that the new 1 percent tax is being passed onto consumers, it\u2019s also true that this tax is helping insure 80,000 children. What\u2019s more, the 1 percent is small compared with average premium increases, and there\u2019s an argument to be made that insuring these children will eventually lower the cost for everybody.\n\n \n\n There\u2019s a grain of truth in the Republicans\u2019 claim that their opponents are \"making it harder for many families\" to cover basic health care expenses, but it\u2019s missing so much context that we rate this claim Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
