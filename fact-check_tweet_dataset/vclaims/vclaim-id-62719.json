Please o, abeg! if you don\u2019t have anything to do in the bank, please stay in your house.\n\n\u201cOkay, this is what happened, you know the Access Bank branch in Onne. If you are coming into Onne, you will see Fidelity Bank, First Bank, Sterling Bank, Union bank, Polaris bank, then you will see Access Bank and Zenith Bank.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, NCDC has sealed Access Bank. The bank manager tests positive and he is dead. Everyone working there has been taking to the isolation centre,\u201d a feminine voice narrated.\n\nThere are three claims from the voice note, namely:\n\u2022 The Onne branch of Access Bank was shut down due to coronavirus.\n\u2022 A staff from the branch died due to the coronavirus.\n\u2022 The person who died is the branch manager of the bank.\n\nThe ICIR contacted Abdul Imoyo, the Head of Media Relations of the Access Bank PLC.

The branch has been shut down for immediate disinfection and will only be reopened once we certify that it is safe enough for services to resume\u201d, the statement reads in part.\n\nFurther checks by The ICIR revealed that the River State governor, Nyesom Wike, had on June 20, ordered the lockdown of Onne community of Eleme and Bonny LGAs of the state to check the spread of COVID-19 in the areas.\n\nFrom all evidence obtained, The ICIR was able to confirm that:\n\u2022 The Bank\u2019s branch in Onne was shutdown due to coronavirus\n\u2022 A staff of the bank died due to coronavirus\n\u2022 However, The ICIR could not confirm if the dead person was the bank\u2019s branch manager in Onne.\n\nTherefore, two out of the three claims are TRUE.", "lang": "en"}
