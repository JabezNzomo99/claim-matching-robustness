Tony Evers\u2019 \"Safer at Home\" order limiting all non-essential movement, a Republican lawmaker lamented the last item on that list.\n\n\"Laura, my eight children and I are enjoying our last legal dinner together this evening from our spring break staycation,\" state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, said in a March 24, 2020, tweet.\n\nEvers\u2019 16-page order \u2014 which took effect March 25, 2020 \u2014 has sweeping consequences throughout the state, but does it really ban family dinners?\n\nAt first glance, Stroebel\u2019s claim to legal limitations within his home might sound off base. The order explicitly makes an allowance for family units.\n\nIt says Wisconsinites \"do not need to maintain social distancing between family members in a single living unit or household members.\" A later section adds, \"Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a single household or living unit.\"\n\nBut it turns out Stroebel wasn\u2019t referencing a single household.\n\nJohn Soper, Stroebel\u2019s chief of staff, said in an email the senator\u2019s eight children range in age from 14 to 29. Only three of those children live at home, while five have their own residences.\n\n\"Governor Evers mentioned specifically \u2018dinner parties\u2019 as an activity that must stop under the new Order,\" Soper said. \"Senator Stroebel put out this tweet to highlight that there is no exemption for meeting immediate family (adult children, grandparents etc.), but there is for places like liquor stores and dry cleaners.\"\n\nThat changes the analysis dramatically.\n\nIndeed, there is no blanket exception to social distancing requirements for extended or even immediate family members if they live separately.\n\nHere\u2019s the key line from Evers\u2019 order: \"All public and private gatherings of any number of people that are not part of a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes expressly permitted in this Order.\"\n\nThose \"limited purposes\" include things like providing care or transport for the health and safety of someone in another household.\n\n\"Large family dinners that include people who do not live together are prohibited,\" said Melissa Baldauff, Evers\u2019 spokeswoman.\n\nShe said it\u2019s a requirement that affects everyone, including Evers.\n\n\"That\u2019s really hard on extended families, we get it,\" she said in an email. \"The governor\u2019s grown kids and their families aren\u2019t coming to visit him and the first lady at the executive residence right now.\n\n\"But that\u2019s the sacrifice we are asking of everyone in this state. Stay home and limit the number of people you have contact with. This kind of distancing is one of the most effective ways of stopping the spread of the disease.\"\n\nStroebel said in a tweet before the stay-at-home order that he was having his \"last legal dinner\" with his wife and eight children.\n\nThough this is technically true for Stroebel\u2019s family, people reading this tweet could well take away that their own one-household family can\u2019t get together to eat. To that extent, the tweet is misleading.\n\nThere\u2019s a key difference between families that still live together under the same roof and those like Stroebel\u2019s with adult children \u2013 to the point that Evers\u2019 order allows one and bans the other.\n\nSo Stroebel is accurate, but only if you take into account key details that weren\u2019t included in his tweet.", "lang": "en"}
