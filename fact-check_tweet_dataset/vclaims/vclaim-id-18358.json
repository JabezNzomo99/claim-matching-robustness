Russell experts say the quote is misattributed.\n\nThe Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, houses around 130,000 records related to Russell, a philosopher known for his contributions to mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. A search of its digital archive turned up no similar or matching expressions.\n\nRussell published a sizable body of work during his lifetime, including more than 70 books, thousands of essays and numerous letters. The quote, however, does not appear in collections of those either.\n\nAndrew Irvine, a Russell scholar at the University of British Columbia, said in an email to TheDCNF: \u201cIt is not from Russell.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not by Russell, though it is often attributed to him because of a book of quotations edited by Laurence Peter, author of \u2018The Peter Principle,'\u201d Nicholas Griffin, editor of the \u201cThe Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell,\u201d told TheDCNF via email.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, a lot of people took the passage in parenthesis to be by Russell as well. In fact, it is by Peter,\u201d explained Griffin in the email. \u201cWhat he thought it had to do with Russell actually said, I have no idea. But by now it\u2019s an established misquotation.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator offered a similar account \u2014 the proximity of Peter\u2019s parenthetical to a quote attributed to Russell likely caused readers to falsely attribute the parenthetical to Russell as well.\n\nOxford Essential Quotations also attributes the quote to Peter, noting the expression is commentary on a Russell quote yet frequently attributed to him.\n\nAn earlier instance of the quote appears in a 1912 book by Marthe Troly-Curtin, according to Quote Investigator, and Troly-Curtin is who the website \u201cprovisionally\u201d credits with the saying.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
