(SAVAGE)\" and does it show him digging up a corpse? No, that's not true: the story was invented by a satirical website making fun of the earlier controversy in which he filmed a suicide victim in a Japanese forest. The satirical article was quickly copied by at least one other satire website but it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by The Hard Times on October 20, 2018 titled \"Logan Paul Apologizes for Controversial Unboxing Video\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLOS ANGELES -- YouTube star Logan Paul issued yet another apology today after posting a vlog in which he opened up a casket in a local cemetery titled \"UNBOXING IN GRAVEYARD!! (SAVAGE).\" The video, deleted less than three hours after being uploaded, showed Paul in Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Paul can be seen digging up a casket and opening it with a crowbar while his friends blew air horns. \"Woah check out this killer swag,\" Paul said in the video while examining what appears to be a wedding ring. \"So, we got a dude inside who looks like he hasn't hit the gym in years. What's up, bro? What's with those skinny arms, bro?\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere is no such video on YouTube at the time of publication and we weren't able to locate any archived copies either. That makes sense since The Hard Times has an about page that explains what is going on:\n\nThe Hard Times is a very real punk news site that you should not question. Just absorb the information as truth and move on. The historic satire site was founded in December 1982 at 171A studios while the founding members were eating broken glass with The Bad Brains. It's made by a group of punk and hardcore kids from all the different sub-genres of the DIY hardcore scene. Any resemblance to actual persons or band names is coincidental.\n\nWe wrote about thehardtimes.net before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Scarlett Johansson NOT Cast as First Black James Bond\n\u2022 Fake News: Stacy's Mom (From The Fountains of Wayne Song) NOT Dead at 53\n\u2022 Fake News: Weird Al Yankovic Did NOT Polarize Fans With Childish Gambino Parody This Is My Hair I Cut\n\nThe article was meant to spoof a real controversy in which the Youtuber was embroiled in early 2018:\n\nShortly after publication the hoax story was copied by 8satire.net, which also carries a disclaimer that reads:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website. All its content is fiction (except those posts under the \"serious\" category) and shouldn't be taken as real. All references, names and marks or institutions in this website are used as contextual elements, like in any novel or science-fiction story.\n\nThe picture of the grave was not a screenshot taken from a video but it is just a stock photo:", "lang": "en"}
