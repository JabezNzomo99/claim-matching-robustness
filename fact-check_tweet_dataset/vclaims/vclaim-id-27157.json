An audio of a song has gone viral on social media which claims it to be Shakira\u2019s rendition of Paul Robeson\u2019s Ol\u2019 Man River\u2019 and Hazarika\u2019s 'Ganga Behti Ho Kyun'.\n\nIndia Today TV Fact Check found that the claim is totally false. The voice in the audio is not of Colombian singer Shakira but of Purabi Mukhopadhyay, an acclaimed Bengali singer.\n\nThe nearly 10-minute video has been shared on all the three platforms -- YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp. A Facebook user Bangkim Munu Rabha along with several other people shared it on their Facebook pages. Hardly even realising this as a misleading post many went ahead to praise Shakira\u2019s Hindi pronunciation.\n\nThe video with the still images of Shakira and Hazarika and the song played in the background has been viewed by more than 2.5 lakh people on YouTube.\n\nOne Facebook user, Rahul Raha, has posted his apology on the same video for the wrong claim and wrote that both the songs -- 'Ol\u2019 Man River' and 'Ganga Behti Ho Kyun' -- in the video have been sung not by the Colombian star but by Bengali singer Purabi Mukhopadhyay.\n\nWe found from several newspaper reports that Purabi Mukhopadhyay, an acclaimed Rabindra Sangeet singer from West Bengal, died in 2017.\n\nBefore her death the same year, she gave an interview to The Times of India, where she expressed her concern over this false claim that went viral regarding her rendition of Hazarika\u2019s song 'Ganga Behti Ho Kyun'. In the interview, she claimed that she recorded this song in 1999 and sang this number several times with Hazarika.\n\nBharat Ratna awardee Hazarika was inspired by American artiste Paul Robeson\u2019s song 'Ol\u2019 Man River' and composed his megahit 'Bistirno Parore' first in Assamese and later in Hindi (Ganga Behti Ho Kyun) and Bengali.\n\nThe lyrics of this immensely popular song 'Ganga Behti Ho Kyun' was written in Hindi by another stalwart poet and literary figure Pandit Narendra Sharma whose death anniversary is on February 12. The poet's death anniversary could be the reason why this old viral claim has been circulated again on social media, especially on WhatsApp.", "lang": "en"}
