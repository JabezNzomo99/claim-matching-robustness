Uhuru Kenyatta is his son.\n\nIn 1978 the national statistics office recorded that Kenya had\n\nof paved road. The first Kenyatta presidency increased the paved road network by 2,541 kilometres in 15 years, an average of about 170 kilometres a year.\n\n, Kenya\u2019s second president, was in office from 1978 to December 2002. In 2002, the country had\n\nof paved road. Another 4,607 kilometres had been built during Moi\u2019s 24-year rule, an average of 192 kilometres a year.\n\nwas the third president, in office from 2003 to April 2013. During his term the country\u2019s paved road network increased from 8,937 kilometres to\n\n.

That\u2019s an average of 390 kilometres a year, not 1,000 kilometres.\n\nBut even that figure is difficult to ascertain. In February 2017, infrastructure minister James Macharia\n\n: \u201cIn 4yrs, President @Ukenyatta has ensured we have achieved 9000Km of 10000Km of road network promised to Kenyans.\u201d A month later, he\n\non national television that it was, vaguely, \u201cmore than 2,500 kilometres\u201d.\n\nrecorded that only 366 kilometres of paved road had been built in 2013/14, the first financial year of Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s presidency. A year later, the treasury\n\nthis to 260 kilometres built that year.\n\nIn January 2018, the treasury said\n\nof paved road had been built in 2014/15 and 2016/17, the next two financial years of Kenyatta\u2019s presidency. A month later, Macharia\n\nthat the government had \u201cembarked on completion of the 10,000Km road projects across the country\u201d.\n\nthat 3,939 kilometres of new road has been built since 2016/17 \u2013 725 kilometres in 2016/17, 1,200 kilometres in 2017/18 and 2,014 kilometres in 2018/19.\n\nInterestingly, as the length of paved road increased in those three years, the\n\non building it dropped from KSh58.2 billion in 2016/17 to KSh52 billion in 2017/18, before rising to KSh54.2 billion in 2018/19.\n\nThis indicates that 2,014 kilometres of road was built in 2018/19 at a lower cost than building 725 kilometres in 2016/17, three years earlier and despite inflation. We have asked the minister for comment.\n\nIn a further twist, the statistics office\u2019s\n\nshows that from 2015 to 2019, the paved road network increased from 13,033 kilometres to 21,295 kilometres \u2013 a jump of 8,261 kilometres in just three years.\n\nThe source of the survey\u2019s data is given as the Kenya Roads Board. We have asked the agency to explain the difference, and will update this report when they respond.\n\nSo far, we have found no coherent data to back up the president\u2019s claim that he has built 1,000 kilometres of road a year. By his administration\u2019s admission in 2017, the data shows an average of 390 kilometres each year of his first term.\n\nIn previous research, we found out that data on roads built during Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s presidency\n\nUntil we can get logical data to verify the claim, we rate it as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
