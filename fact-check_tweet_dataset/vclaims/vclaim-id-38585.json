No, that is a hoax. Pence did not send such a tweet, as evidenced by the fact that no record of this tweet exists. It is a fake, despite getting some attention through shares and likes on social media.\n\nThe claim originated from a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook by user Comrade Gritty on March 1, 2020. It read:\n\nUsers on Facebook saw this:\n\nThe picture below the post is the 7th Police District of the Chicago Police Department, which covers parts of the city's South Side.\n\nThere are several indications the tweet is fake, including there being no record of it on Pence's account, live or deleted.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated on the Facebook page of \"Comrade Gritty,\" a self-proclaimed \"public figure\" with almost 30,000 followers. The Facebook page is loaded with leftist memes and satire. It features a photo of deceased \"Gonzo Journalist\" Hunter Thompson with the Philadelphia Flyers mascot named Gritty, which has been adopted as a symbol by radical leftists.\n\nRather than \"Find the Police,\" the writer is likely using the hashtag \"FTP\" to wink at the better known reference, \"Fuck tha Police.\" That 1988 well-known protest song by the hip hop group N.W.A. calls attention to police brutality and racial profiling.\n\nThe fake tweet posted on Facebook has been shared almost 200 times and liked nearly 450 times.\n\nOther fact checks by Lead Stories concerning coronavirus misinformation include:\n\u2022 Fact Check: San Diego Lab Says It Has Created Coronavirus Vaccine In Three Hours\n\u2022 Fact Check: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Robbery Using Cough As A Weapon\n\u2022 Fact Check: Lysol Products Can Kill Older Strains Of Coronavirus, But Tests Have NOT Scientifically Proven They Kill Novel Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Hair Weaves And Lace Front Wigs Made In China NOT Likely To Contain Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Scientists Did NOT Discover That Cocaine Kills Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NO Evidence Coronavirus Is Bioweapon Leaked From Wuhan Lab\n\u2022 Fake News: Six Coronavirus Cases NOT Confirmed In Wichita, Kansas (Or Several Other U.S. Cities)\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Million Chinese Did NOT Convert To Islam, And It Was NOT Proven That Coronavirus Epidemic Did Not Afflict Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence To Support Claim From Bioweapons Expert Who Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon\n\u2022 Fake News: Popping Bubble Wrap Does NOT Expose People To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Data From Windy.com Does NOT Show Massive Release Of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Near Wuhan\n\u2022 Fake News: Latest Research Published By Chinese Scientists Did NOT Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Proof That High-Rise Buildings Have Become Human Incinerators To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Residential Building NOT In Wuhan, NOT Set Ablaze To Control Coronavirus Spread", "lang": "en"}
