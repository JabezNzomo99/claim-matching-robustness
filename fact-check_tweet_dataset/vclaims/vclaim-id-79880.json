She paid $2 in cash. The remaining 63 cents in change had been donated, so the cashier didn\u2019t owe her any change.\n\nIn the accompanying post, Jacob claimed that the cashier asked her for $2 (rather than the $1.37 total price of the items), and that she only realized afterwards that her 63 cents in change had been donated without her consent. According to Jacob, the cashier said the store\u2019s policy was to not give out change in the form of cash. She wrote:\n\nSo folks here we go. Watch your receipt at Walmart. I bought a bag of chips and a candy bar. I paid with cash $2.00 and they just donated my 63 cents without even telling me. I thought both items were a dollar a piece and didn\u2019t think twice about giving her the 2 bucks.. then I looked at the receipt. I questioned the cashier and she said they don\u2019t give change. It\u2019s not about the amount of money. It\u2019s the principle. They could have Told me. At the very least offer me a Walmart card with .63 cents on it. I feel like I\u2019ve been ripped off. Who\u2019s to say where my 63 cents is going to go. It just says donation. Is this just the beginning? Who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t find different ways to take more of my/our money in the future. It\u2019s not right.\n\nIn an interview with WCVB, a local news station in Boston, Massachusetts, Jacob said the cashier did not offer her the opportunity of paying with exact change, or paying by credit, or debit card:\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, the United States was hit by a nationwide coin shortage in 2020 because lower in-person shopping volumes meant fewer coins were in circulation \u2014 but also because the virus slowed coin production at the U.S. Mint. As a result, several major retailers introduced policies to encourage or request customers to pay with exact change, use a credit or debit card, or have the amount of their change loaded onto a loyalty card.\n\nThose policies occasionally caused confusion among both shoppers and supermarket staff, as we have examined elsewhere, and this appears to have been what happened at the Framingham Walmart on July 20.\n\nA spokesperson for Walmart told Snopes the company had investigated the transaction in question, which Jacob described accurately, and found it was an isolated incident. They added that the company\u2019s policy is still to give customers the choice of whether to get change, or donate the difference.\n\nSince the company corroborated Jacob\u2019s account, we are issuing a rating of \u201cTrue.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth noting that, by donating the change for Jacob, rather than offering her that option, the cashier in question misunderstood Walmart\u2019s policy, which is to provide coin change if a customers wants it.", "lang": "en"}
