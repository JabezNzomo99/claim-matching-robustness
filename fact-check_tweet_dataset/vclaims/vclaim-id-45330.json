Duterte recognized anew by TIME magazine as) \"STRONGMAN\" in the WORLD!|.\u201d This is false.\n\nIt also misleadingly presents the title \u201cstrongman\u201d as a praise for Pres. Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe cover story that Showbiz Fanaticz featured in its inaccurate upload was from TIME\u2019s May 3, 2018 issue, which placed Duterte alongside other \u201ctough-talking populists\" such as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nContrary to Showbiz Fanaticz\u2019s claim that Duterte was hailed as a strongman for his \u201cbrave and firm leadership,\u201d dictionary definitions of the term do not show such leaders in a good light.\n\nMerriam-Webster refers to a strongman as someone \u201cwho leads or controls by force of will and character or by military methods.\" University of Oxford\u2019s Lexico puts it simply as \u201ca leader who rules by the exercise of threats, force, or violence.\u201d\n\nThis negative connotation of the term was also affirmed by the piece\u2019s author Ian Bremmer in a follow-up article published May 11, 2018, after Duterte reacted to his story and said he was not a strongman. Bremmer described the world leaders in his first article as those \u201cwho\u2019ve won elections in their countries while restricting basic freedoms to tighten their hold on power.\u201d\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz also said TIME described Duterte as someone who has shown \u201cunstoppable humanity\u201d and \u201ctransparency.\u201d This claim is fabricated.\n\nAdding to the list of falsehoods propagated by the story, the YouTube channel quoted a Philstar.com article on TIME\u2019s strongman issue and falsely claimed it was recently published. It also wrongly described the news publication as a \u201cmen\u2019s magazine.\u201d\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz\u2019s erroneous video made the rounds online as opposition to the controversial Anti-Terrorism bill, certified by Duterte as urgent, mounted. The bill has been passed and sent to the presidential palace for his signature.\n\nThe inaccurate video has received over 165,000 views on Youtube, and could have reached over 1.6 million people. Traffic to the upload largely came from public FB pages Francis Leo Marcos Supporters group, Duterte Kami, and Ang Pagbabalik Namin Mga DDS @ SARAH DUTERTE & BBM PARA SA 2022.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has also flagged FB page Pinoy Online Trendz and at least four websites that have republished the video -- pinasdailynews.xyz, kidstva.com, pinasbalitangayon.blogspot.com, and philip.nhatkimanh.vn.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz, which has a history of publishing disinformation, joined Youtube in November 2017.", "lang": "en"}
