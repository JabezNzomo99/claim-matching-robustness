But it is possible to document how long it took to get from arrest or indictment to conviction in major cases.\n\nWith the help of the staff of Human Rights First, an advocacy group that supports keeping terrorism-related cases in U.S. courts, we have compiled a list of 23 major terrorism-related cases, largely drawn from a list of more than 600 terrorism-related convictions since 2001 obtained by the group from the Justice Department via a Freedom of Information Act request. (The data in the DOJ list goes through December 2015.)\n\nIn some cases, militants might have been indicted earlier but only arrived in the United States months or years later, after they were captured and extradited. In those instances, we date from when the legal process began in the United States.\n\nYou will see that in most cases, the process took less than two years \u2014 or even a year. The longest case took 35 months. One case \u2014 the failed Times Square bomber \u2014 was completed in just seven weeks. The average duration between indictment and conviction of the 23 cases is 16.2 months.\n\nMany militants ended up pleading guilty, which attests to the strength of the government\u2019s case. Except in a handful of indictments, it\u2019s difficult to see much evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that terrorists \u201cgo through court for years.\u201d (Only seven of the 23 cases took 24 months or more between extradition or indictment and conviction.) That is also apparent from reviewing the 600 cases in the DOJ document, though we did not obtain an average for all of those cases.\n\nAs we said, whether the numbers here suggest a need for \u201cmuch quicker and much stronger\u201d justice is a matter of opinion. Readers can judge for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
