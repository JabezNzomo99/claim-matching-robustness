The memo alleges that the FBI did not fully disclose to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that some of the information stemmed from intelligence reports provided by Christopher Steele, a former British spy under contract for a research firm working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI, in a rare unsigned statement, said it has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the accuracy of the memo.\n\n\u201cWell, I hadn\u2019t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names \u2026 Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counterterrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he\u2019s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that\u2019s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that\u2019s a representative group.\u201d\n\nSept. 23, 2016: The Trump campaign denies Page was ever part of the campaign. \u201cMr. Page is not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign,\u201d campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s never been part of our campaign. Period.\u201d The statement comes as Yahoo News reports that a U.S. intelligence probe was trying to determine if Page had \u201copened up private communications with senior Russian officials \u2014 including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president.\u201d\n\nOct. 21, 2016: Nearly a month after the Trump campaign says Page was never part of the campaign, the FBI seeks and receives a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. The order is renewed at least three more times over the next year, meaning that the FBI is able to convince the judges that surveillance continues to provide assistance to investigators. The Wall Street Journal reported that all of the judges who approved the orders were appointed by Republicans.\n\nFeb. 16, 2017: Trump denies he ever met Page. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met him,\u201d he told reporters at a news conference. \u201cAnd he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don\u2019t think I ever met him. Now, it\u2019s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don\u2019t think I ever met him. I didn\u2019t talk to him, ever.\u201d\n\nThe memo also discloses that the FBI opened a counterintelligence operation in July because of allegations concerning other Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos. But Papadopoulos was never mentioned in the Steele dossier. He came to attention of the FBI because he had told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had obtained thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special counsel.\n\n\u201cThe Nunes Memo makes it clear that federal officials were interested in Carter Page because he was connected to the Trump campaign. Why else would the FISA application contain the findings of the anti-Trump dossier? Why else would the application include the fact that the FBI was already investigating Trump advisor George Papadopoulos? Whether or not Carter Page was on the payroll of the Trump campaign on the date of the FISA order is irrelevant. By virtue of the fact that he had once worked on the campaign, he was connected to the campaign. \u201cFor a year, the Washington Post and other media outlets have specifically mentioned Carter Page as one of the leading figures in the Trump-Russia collusion story. Now that the media narrative is falling apart, all of a sudden you want to argue that Carter Page has nothing to do with Trump. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Duncan said: \u201cHad the noncredible DNC funded dossier never been leaked to the media to fuel mass speculation of Russian involvement, and had it not been used as \u2018evidence\u2019 to elevate the investigation to the level of requesting FISA warrants, it\u2019s very likely that there would have never been a perceived need for special counsel to be created in the first place.\u201d\n\nDuncan\u2019s spokesman appears to be referring to the Yahoo News article. That article included a claim that later surfaced in the Steele dossier \u2014 and which has been vehemently denied by Page: that Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft. Steele has admitted in court documents that he met with Yahoo News at the behest of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired him.\n\nThe GOP memo provides no evidence that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign. Instead, it shows that the court order for surveillance of Page was obtained weeks after Page and the Trump campaign had said Page was no longer part of the campaign. Trump has asserted that he never even met or spoke to Page.", "lang": "en"}
