No, that's not true: The tweet-within-a-tweet was made up, and the author has admitted it was a joke. The fake tweet has been debunked previously, but it seems to resurface whenever the stock market drops more than 1,000 points in a single day.\n\nThe claim reappeared in the form of a Facebook post (archived here) published by Andrew Yang Bagposting on March 9, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe fake tweet included a timestamp and date of February 25, 2015, which would have been almost two years before President Trump was sworn into office on January 20, 2017. Reuters, Snopes, and Newslit.org have previously debunked the tweet.\n\nShaun Usher, a British blogger and author, acknowledged he had created and shared the tweet as a joke. According to Snopes, Usher didn't think anyone would believe it was true when he published the fake tweet on February 5, 2018.\n\nThe hoax was Usher's attempt to capitalize on the popular Twitter activity, \"There's Always A Tweet.\" Routinely, Internet users will highlight old tweets from the archive of @realDonaldTrump to point out perceived hypocrisies or comments that Trump made when he was a private citizen.\n\nTrump's tweets have previously contained spelling errors, so some people fell for the joke. However, Usher's hoax does not appear in the Trump Twitter Archive, a repository for all of the president's tweets ever since he joined the microblogging site in March 2009.\n\nFaking tweets is relatively easy to do. Hoaxers can superimpose made-up tweets on top of a real account using photo editing software or online tweet generators and then retweet the image. Unsuspecting followers might also retweet the fake tweet, allowing it to go viral.\n\nFour years before making up the tweet, The New Yorker profiled Usher on June 6, 2004. In the article, he detailed his love of reading old letters, and in 2013, he published his first book, \"Letters of Note: Correspondence Deserving of a Wider Audience.\"\n\nOn March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped a staggering 2,013 points, or almost 8%, as falling oil prices and fears over the novel coronavirus spooked investors. It was the biggest point drop ever for the Dow, according to CNBC.", "lang": "en"}
