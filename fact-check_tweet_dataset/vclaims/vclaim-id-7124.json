No, that's not true: that news was made up by a website that normally invents stories about bizarre sex acts or weird crimes for entertainment purposes but which now seems to have strayed into the political field.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 19, 2018 by World News Daily Report which was titled \"Donald Trump bestowed honorific title by association of people with small hands\" (archived here) and which opened:\n\nWashington, D.C. | The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) has bestowed President Donald Trump this week with the honorific title of Honorary Ambassador for people suffering from Acrodysostosis. Acrodysostosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormally small hands and feet with short, stubby fingers and toes that may affect all or some of the fingers and toes. Donald Trump was officially diagnosed with Acrodysostosis in 1954 at the age of eight years old after his mother noticed \"his hands and feet weren't growing normally\" according to his latest biography. Acrodysostosis has also been closely linked to Penile agenesis, a birth defect in humans in which a male child is born with unusually small genitalia or without a penis in certain cases.\n\nSomewhat unusual for World News Daily Report: the National Organisation for Rare Disorders actually exists and the picture is kind of real, but it does not show someone at NORD giving an ambassadorship but depicts Desiree Lyon Howe receiving an award from NORD in 2016.\n\nThe NORD website does not mention giving out any ambassadorships and they have only posted one news item mentioning President Trump this year, an article praising his efforts to lower drug prices:\n\nAcrodysostosis does exist but Trump is not known to suffer from it.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 500-lbs Woman Did NOT Kill World's Oldest Tortoise By Sitting On It\n\u2022 Fake News: Alabama Man Did NOT Cheat On His Wife With A Goat\n\u2022 Fake News: Lottery Winner NOT Arrested For Dumping $200,000 of Manure On Ex-boss' Lawn\n\u2022 Fake News: Zambian Man NOT Arrested After Boasting He Lost 280 Pounds On 'Cannibal Diet'\n\u2022 Fake News: Doctor Did NOT Get Arm Stuck For 8 Hours During Prostate Exam", "lang": "en"}
