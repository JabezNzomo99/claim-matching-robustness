The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a special report about the ramifications of continued warming, for example, and the U.S. government highlighted current and future risks in its National Climate Assessment.\n\nBut a post liked by thousands on Instagram and shared repeatedly throughout social media claims climate change isn\u2019t real, calling it a \u201cmade-up catastrophe used by globalists & socialists to instill fear and guilt to tax, regulate, and remove our freedoms while pretending to be saving the planet.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in that statement, but we\u2019ll focus on the core falsehood: that climate change is a \u201cmade-up catastrophe.\u201d\n\nClimate change is actually understood through a large body of scientific evidence that has been gathered over many years. The theory of the greenhouse effect \u2014 that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide trap the sun\u2019s heat in the atmosphere \u2014 has been repeatedly proven since it was first proposed in 1824.\n\nToday, NASA notes, studies show that \u201c97 percent or more\u201d of active climate scientists believe human-caused warming is occurring. The agency calls the fact that \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is warming\u201d a matter of \u201cscientific consensus.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment \u2014 prepared by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which involves 13 federal departments and agencies \u2014 states that \u201cglobal average temperature has increased by about 1.8\u00b0F from 1901 to 2016, and observational evidence does not support any credible natural explanations for this amount of warming; instead, the evidence consistently points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse or heat-trapping gases, as the dominant cause.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cSixteen of the last 17 years have been the warmest ever recorded by human observations.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as we\u2019ve written before, found that it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d \u2014 defined as being between a 95 and 100 percent probability \u2014 that the majority of the increase in global average surface temperature between 1951 and 2010 was due to human activities.\n\nClimate change effects are already being felt, the federal National Climate Assessment report said \u2014 citing the impact of higher temperatures on droughts, extreme weather events, coral reef ecosystems and more.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s 2018 special report warns of exacerbated risks \u2014 including sea-level rise, loss of biodiversity, species extinction, crop loss, and limits on water supplies and economic growth \u2014 if trends continue.\n\nBut to say climate change is a \u201cmade-up catastrophe\u201d is to ignore the scientific conclusions established by actively publishing climate scientists from around the world.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
