But there is no record of the event where Jonathan is alleged to have made the claim, which the ex-president has denied making.\n\nThe text in the post claims that Jonathan stated that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u201cmade a wrong choice in the person of Mr Peter Obi\u201d, allegedly speaking during a keynote address at the inauguration of his foundation for the underprivileged in his home state of Bayelsa.\n\nAFP could not find any record online and in the media of the event where Jonathan allegedly spoke. The most recent event hosted by the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation was a \u201cone-day peace conference on Peaceful Elections and National Development\u201d in the capital, Abuja, which was widely reported in local media.\n\nJonathan delivered a welcome address at that event but the alleged statement on Obi does not appear in a video recording of that speech.\n\nJonathan, who lost and conceded the 2015 presidential election to Buhari, also denied making the statement via a thread on his official Twitter account.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to a fake article circulating online, to the effect that former President Jonathan has expressed misgivings over the emergence of Mr. Peter Obi as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),\u201d read a Twitter thread from media aide Ike Eze, reweeted on Jonathan\u2019s account.\n\nObi is running mate to Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of Jonathan\u2019s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday\u2019s election in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nAtiku -- as he is known -- is the main rival to the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nMore than 84 million Nigerians are registered to vote presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, followed two weeks later by votes for governors and state assemblies.", "lang": "en"}
