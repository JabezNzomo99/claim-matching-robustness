(their home) on a smaller scale. There is a very identifiable Somali community. I might add if you come to the train station with me you\u2019ll notice I have great relationships with them because there\u2019s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real. I\u2019m not being solicitous. I\u2019m being serious.\"\n\nIn short order, interviewed some Wilmington cab drivers who said they know of drivers from some African countries such as Ghana and Liberia, but none from Somalia.\n\n\"I don't think I've seen any (Somalis) in Delaware,\" Anthony Eber, a taxi company owner who emigrated from Sierra Leone, told CNN.\n\nDid Biden know something no one else seems to know? Apparently not.\n\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s latest did find some Delaware residents with Somali ancestry -- it estimated that there were a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware. That\u2019s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nIf that\u2019s \"very identifiable,\" it would help to have a microscope.\n\nCompare that with Minnesota, which has the United States\u2019 Somali population, at more than 35,000. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s home-away-from-home, the Washington, D.C., metro area, ranks in the .\n\nRefugees from the started coming to the United States en masse in the 1990s, after a civil war broke out. Today, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate Islamic terrorist group, is a major source of instability in Somalia and a why refugees continue to flee to the United States.\n\nAll told, roughly 90,000 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States since 2000, according to the . However, Delaware has not received any of them, according data from the same office.\n\nJewish Family Services of Delaware is the state\u2019s largest refugee resettlement organization. On their website, there\u2019s a list of nearly from which refugees have been resettled. About half of those are African countries, but Somalia is not one of them.\n\nWilmington is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, which has one of the higher rates of foreign-born residents from Africa, according to the . But even in this expanded geographical area, the vast majority are from African countries other than Somalia.\n\nOf Delaware\u2019s foreign-born population, only 9.5 percent are from the African continent -- about 8,000 people in all -- and most of those are from West Africa, according to the survey report. And of those 8,000, just 4 percent work in \"transportation and warehousing, and utilities,\" the category that includes taxi drivers.\n\nBiden\u2019s office did not respond to a query. His office also didn\u2019t reply by publication time to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which gave Biden their worst rating -- -- for this claim.\n\nBiden said \"there is a very identifiable Somali community\" back home in Delaware. If so, it's minuscule: The Census Bureau estimates that there\u2019s only 15 Somali people living in Delaware. Biden\u2019s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
