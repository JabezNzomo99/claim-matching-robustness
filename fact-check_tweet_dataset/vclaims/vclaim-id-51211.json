No, that's not true: The claim that House Speaker Pelosi ordered the president's doctor to send the medical file to Congress is a work of satire, published by a liberal who is trolling conservatives. It did not happen. Still, many people read, believe, and share the article without awareness that it is a joke. Also, other websites steal the story for their own pages, but without the satire disclaimers.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by dailyworldupdate.us on November 26, 2019 titled \"Pelosi Demands Doctor Hand Over Trump's Medical Records\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe impeachment inquiry under way in November 2019 has not questioned President Trump's health. In fact, poor health is not impeachable. The constitution's 25th amendment does include provisions for removing a president from office for health reasons, but that is initiated in the executive branch and not in Congress.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes dailyworldupdate.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
