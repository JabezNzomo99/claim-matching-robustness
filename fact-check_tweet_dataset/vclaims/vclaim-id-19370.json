At the end of the conference, they also issued a \u201cJoint declaration in this regard terming the killing, burning, and elimination of unarmed vulnerable civilians in the name of religion or patriotism...\u201d\n\nThe Quint also reached out to the organisation\u2019s media officer, who confirmed that the video in circulation was indeed that of the people gathered outside the Jamiat Aman Ekta conference held at Talkatora Stadium on 5 August.\n\nHe told The Quint that the conference was not related to Article 370 or the state of affairs in Jammu & Kashmir in any manner, that it was purely about mob lynching incidents.\n\nHe also added that many people could be seen on the road because around 50,000 people had come to attend the conference while the Talkatora Stadium can only accommodate around 3,000-4,000 people.\n\nSo when the seats got filled, the gates were closed and people filtered out onto the road. Since there were people from not only Delhi but other places as well, they had nowhere to go and were hence gathered on the roads in that area.", "lang": "en"}
