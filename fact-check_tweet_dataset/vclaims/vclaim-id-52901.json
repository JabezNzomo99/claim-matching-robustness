The photograph also features Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders, who can be seen standing at the background.\n\nThe photograph has been edited to include text which identifies the former prime minister and Sonia Gandhi and states their respective ages. At the bottom of the image, text in Hindi ridicules Dr Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi for their gestures. It further takes a dig at Rahul Gandhi for 'smirking' at the turn of events.\n\nPosts ridicule Singh for seeking 'blessings' from Sonia Gandhi, who is younger to him, by touching her feet (a common Indian tradition).\n\nThe photo was shared \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u094b \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u0939\u0941-100 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b \u0915\u094b \u091c\u094b\u095c\u094b with the caption, ''\u0907\u0938\u0947 \u0924\u092e\u0940\u091c \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0913\u0930 \u091a\u092e\u091a\u0947 \u0907\u0938\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u092c\u0941\u0932\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948''.
