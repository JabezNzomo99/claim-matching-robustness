While criticizing the conclusion reached by the state's commission of experts appointed by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office for Zamana\u2019s case, Zhivotov claimed the commission had determined that the Ukrainian military\u2019s actions in eastern Ukraine are illegal.\n\n\u201cThe experts found that, according to Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot be involved in any conflict within the country. They are intended only to repel external aggression,\u201d Zhivotov said.\n\nDmytro Koval, Associate Professor and Program and Legal officer at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said it was \u201cimpossible to verify\u201d Zhivotov's reading of the conclusion reached by the state commission of experts appointed by the prosecutor in Zamana's case, without seeing the commission\u2019s report.\n\nHowever, he told Polygraph.info that any interpretation of Article 17 of Ukraine\u2019s constitution claiming the military can only be used to \u201crepel external aggression\u201d is incorrect.\n\n\u201c[Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukrainian] simply doesn't say a word about expelling external aggression,\u201d Koval said. \u201cMoreover, article 1-1 of this law explicitly allows the use of the armed forces in the situation of peace.\u201d\n\nBased on the text of the Ukrainian constitution translated for the World Intellectual Property Organization, Koval is correct.\n\nTo protect the sovereignty and territorial indivisibility of Ukraine, and to ensure its economic and informational security are the most important functions of the State and a matter of concern for all the Ukrainian people.\n\u2022 The defense of Ukraine and the protection of its sovereignty, territorial indivisibility and inviolability, are entrusted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\u2022 Ensuring state security and protecting the state border of Ukraine are entrusted to the respective military formations and law enforcement bodies of the State, whose organization and operational procedure are determined by law.\n\u2022 The Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations shall not be used by anyone to restrict the rights and freedoms of citizens or with the intent to overthrow the constitutional order, subvert the bodies of power or obstruct their activity.\n\u2022 The State ensures the social protection of citizens of Ukraine who serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and in other military formations as well as of members of their families.\n\u2022 The creation and operation of any armed formations not envisaged by law are prohibited on the territory of Ukraine.\n\u2022 The location of foreign military bases shall not be permitted on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nBogdan Bondarenko, an expert on constitutional law, legislature and elections at the Center of Policy and Legal Reform, a Ukrainian non-governmental think tank, said in the case of war, the armed forces can be used on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nBondarenko said Article 17 is intended to keep the military from being used against the citizens or for overthrowing the government.\n\n\u201cCases of use of armed forces in peacetime are regulated by special legislation. In the context of the war on the territory of Ukraine, there are many legislative problems, but this is a bit of a different problem,\u201d Bondarenko said.\n\nHe added that problem was \u201cpartly solved\u201d on January 18, 2018, when the Ukrainian parliament adopted a law describing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as \u201ctemporarily occupied\u201d by Russia, which is designated as an \u201caggressor country.\u201d\n\nThe bill is intended to help Ukraine reestablish control over those regions, while Moscow said it amounted to \u201cpreparation for war.\u201d\n\nVolodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta research center, an independent Kyiv-based think-tank, told the Associated Press that bill was primarily intended to defend Ukraine\u2019s interests in international courts.\n\nAs posited in that legislation, Ukrainian military forces in eastern Ukraine are being used to repel external aggression, as the Russian military has been deployed there, despite the Kremlin\u2019s claims to the contrary.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously noted, in spite of numerous denials, the evidence of Moscow\u2019s involvement in the Donbas war is overwhelming and has been confirmed by numerous open-source investigations, journalistic investigations by international and Russian media outlets, and even, at times, by Russian officials.\n\u2022 The presence of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine neither produced by nor purchased by the Ukrainian armed forces, such as the T-90A main battle tank;\n\u2022 The \"continued access the \u201cseparatists\u201d have to large quantities of advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them;\n\u2022 A Vice News report that proved the presence of Russian servicemen from the 37th Motorized Infantry Brigade (Kyakhta) operating in eastern Ukraine. Later, Russia adopted an \u201canti-selfie soldier law\" which might have prevented such public evidence;\n\u2022 A wealth of open source intelligence (OSINT) produced by groups such as Bellingcat and Inform Napalm demonstrating Russian military movements in Ukraine.\n\u2022 On May 24, 2018, the Dutch Joint Investigative Team (JIT) presented its findings on the system that shot down the Malaysian passenger airliner MH17, which was flying over eastern Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The JIT determined the missile system had been provided from Russia and identified the military unit it belonged to \u2013 the Russian armed forces\u2019 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds the claim that Article 17 of the Ukrainian constitution bans the use of the armed forces within the country is false.", "lang": "en"}
