No, that's not true: the part about the muskets was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site for entertainment purposes. The ICE part is true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on February 3, 2019 titled \"Authorities Find Illegal Musket Rifles In 21 Savage's Home After Being Arrested by ICE\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nATLANTA - After rapper 21 savage was arrested sunday morning by ICE for allegedly being a UK resident and illegally living in the U.S., 21 savage is also facing gun charges as authorities discovered multiple illegal firearms in 21's home. Authorities discovered multiple 16th century firearms including rifles muskets and flintlock pistols. Many of them decorated with real gold.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\n21 Savage was indeed arrested by ICE for violating immigration law:\n\nBut the musket rifles part is obviously a joke. And historically inaccurate.

The grooves would add spin to the projectiles being fired so they would have a more stable trajectory, increasing accuracy.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes huzlers.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
