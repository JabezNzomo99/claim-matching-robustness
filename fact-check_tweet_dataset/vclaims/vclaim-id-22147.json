Most recently, there was speculation about Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump\u2019s short-lived national security adviser who left the administration after it was revealed that he had communicated with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office.\n\nFlynn was not charged under the act, although he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with the Russian ambassador.\n\nNow, a dozen identical websites \u2014 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \u2014 that operate under the name \u201cPoliticsFocus\u201d have posted a story claiming that former Secretary of State John Kerry is facing felony charges under the act, and other dubious websites have copied the story.\n\nThe websites refer to coverage of a recent controversy in which the Israeli press reported that Kerry spoke to Hussein Agha, a friend of Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas, and through that discussion, urged the leader to \u201cstay strong in his spirit and play for time\u201d in dealing with the Trump administration.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that newspapers have published reports of Kerry\u2019s meeting with Agha, a spokesman for Kerry has denied that he made any anti-Trump remarks.\n\nThe spokesman told Fox News: \u201cThe original story wasn\u2019t accurate, and I\u2019ve read that Mr. Agha himself has made that clear. These are neither Secretary Kerry\u2019s views nor anything he would say.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, the headline on the PoliticsFocus story says: \u201cBREAKING: Major Announcement Out Of The White House \u2014 John Kerry Facing Felony Charges.\u201d That\u2019s false. There was no announcement from the White House, and no charges have been filed against Kerry.\n\nThe websites that posted the story have hundreds of similarly false or misleading headlines. That\u2019s typical for dubious websites that claim to be news outlets. What\u2019s unusual is that when they first started publishing, in July 2017, the stories and headlines were aimed at appealing to liberals \u2014 such as \u201cEgomaniac Trump Wants To Have Military Parade In His Honor On Independence Day\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s Treatment Of Melania Is So Disgusting The Entire Nation Is In Shock [VIDEO].\u201d\n\nBut, starting in October, they flipped and started running stories with headlines such as, \u201cTrump Just Got a HUGE Supreme Court Victory \u2014 Media Silent\u201d and \u201cFormer US Atty: Obama Committed Crime of \u2018UNBELIEVABLE Dimensions\u2019 Against Trump.\u201d\n\nThere is no information about the owners, publishers or authors of these websites \u2014 which is a red flag that often signifies an unreliable source of news.\n\nEach of the sites is registered through a company that hides the identity and location of the owner.\n\nThey also run several Facebook pages \u2014 with names like \u201cAmerican News Source,\u201d \u201cAmerican Journalist\u201d and \u201cAmerica The Great\u201d \u2014 which have a combined following of 2.6 million.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nPhillips, Amber. \u201cDid Michael Flynn just admit to violating the Logan Act?
