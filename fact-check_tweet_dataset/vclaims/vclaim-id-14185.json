No, that's not true: he did order the deployment of army troops alongside regular security forces of the Gendarmerie but no tanks were deployed. The rumor seems to have originated with a single journalist that seemed to have some difficulty with the difference between a tank and an armored personnel carrier and between the French Army and the French Gendarmerie.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 23, 2019 by Express titled \"Yellow Vest CHAOS: Desperate Emmanuel Macron deploys army tanks in terrifying scenes\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere has indeed been some controversy in France about the deployment of Army troops to maintain security during the Yellow Vest protests:\n\nBut a tank is a military combat vehicle that is heavily armed (usually with a big main gun and several smaller machine guns), covered with thick armor and moving on tracks.\n\nThe basis for the report about tanks appears to be a single tweet:\n\nThis appears to be the tweet in question (archived here):\n\nThe image clearly does not show tanks but armored personnel carriers on wheels (not tracks). It looks like they are of the type VXB-170 VBRG:\n\nThese vehicles mainly serve as troop transports and are used both by the army (in limited numbers) and by the Gendarmerie Nationale:\n\nThe blue color of the vehicles indicates they are operated by the Gendarmerie, here is a picture of a training excercise that shows them from a different angle:\n\nAnd even if they were operated by the army: they are not tanks.\n\nWe wrote about express.co.uk before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: President Macron Did NOT Knowingly Grant ISIS Chief Political Asylum In France\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Get Arm Bitten Off By Pet Shark He Raised In His Bathtub\n\u2022 Hoax Alert: British Newspaper's Report ISIS Guns Down Children In Video Is False", "lang": "en"}
