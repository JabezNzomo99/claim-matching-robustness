Tsukayama reported that \u201cApple has not said how much of the money it spends on projects, such as facilities, goes to the United States; globally, Apple has spent between $12 billion and $15 billion on such projects over the past several years.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the caveat: Woods said the investment was only partly due to the tax changes (again, there\u2019s no breakdown of how much was going to be invested without the tax package and how much because of it). Moreover, a company spokesman later clarified that the new investment over five years totaled $35 billion \u2014 not $50 billion \u2014 because $15 billion in projects already had been announced.\n\nApple, ExxonMobil and Fiat Chrysler to varying degrees say Trump\u2019s tax package helped facilitate new U.S. investments worth a combined $385 billion. But they all agree the tax package was but one of several factors. Moreover, it\u2019s not known how much of this money would have been invested anyway, regardless of the tax changes. These claims from Trump are all worth between One and Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
