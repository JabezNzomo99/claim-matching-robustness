No, that's not true: The claim that Speaker Pelosi was involved in a massive operation to smuggle heroin into the United States from southeast Asia has no basis in fact. A published report making the claim offered no documentation and included a conspiracy theory dating back to World War 2 and anti-Semitic accusations in an attempt to connect Pelosi to the drug operation.\n\nThe claim has been shared on social platforms in 2019, using stories published in 2008 and 2010, including a post (archived here) shared on October 22, 2019 under the title \"Nancy Pelosi was involved in one of the biggest heroin busts??\". This post linked to a 2010 story (archived here) published by AmericanFreePress.net titled \"PELOSI'S TRAIL OF CORRUPTION.\" The opening paragraphs read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe \"Eric Massa scandal\" is a reference to a New York congressman who retired from the house after being accused of sexual harassment by staffers. There is no known involvement by Pelosi in Rep. Massa's alleged ethics violations other than he was in her party and she was speaker of the house at the time.\n\nThe story then references \"a much darker string of controversies\" that allegedly began with Pelosi's father Thomas D'Alesandro when he was purportedly serving in U.S. military intelligence during World War 2 and that blossomed when he became Baltimore's mayor in 1947:\n\nThe first problem with that conspiracy theory is that D'Alesandro was a U.S. congressman during the war, spending much of his time trying to convince President Roosevelt to be more aggressive in rescuing Jews from Hitler's holocaust. He was in his 40s during the war, and not in uniform or in Italy.\n\nAnother problem about the claim that Pelosi's father was in Italy, where he allegedly hooked up with his future drug-smuggling partner Lucky Luciano, is the source is Wayne Madsen, who is described as a \"paranoid conspiracy theorist\" by TheDailyBeast.com. To prove something that runs counter to everything we can find about Pelosi's father, Madsen is not a good source.\n\nThe story then connects Pelosi's father to post-war heroin smuggling:\n\nLuciano had been smuggling heroin into the United States since the 1930s, according to the McCoy book cited in the story. That book also makes just one reference to Baltimore and that is about pushers in the 1970s. There is no sourcing for the claim that Pelosi's father \"oversaw\" heroin smuggling into Baltimore during his time as mayor, which was 1947 to 1959. Even if it were true, it still does not connect Nancy Pelosi, who was seven years old in 1947, to heroin smuggling.\n\nThe author then exposes an anti-Semitic motivation as he attempts to connect Nancy Pelosi to decades of heroin smuggling:\n\nHuh? Yes, weird and confusing. We will skip much of the nonsense to get to the point. The 2010 article takes readers back to 1991 and San Francisco, where Pelosi moved 22 years earlier:\n\nWe found the \"local newspaper\" story it referenced. Published in 2008, the article titled \"NANCY PELOSI'S CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDO TRUST: THE UNPUBLICIZED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW OCCUPANTS IN THE U.S. ARMY'S OFFICERS' HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO\" focused not on a drug smuggling conspiracy, but on Pelosi's support of how the former U.S. Army base Presidio was being used to house a world peace foundation headed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. At the end, it referenced a report of a 1991 drug bust at a warehouse purportedly owned by investors including Pelosi:\n\nThe sourcing for this claim appeared to be another 2008 article titled \"THE BILLION DOLLAR HEROIN BUST\"\n\nTime flies they say and with it we forget and knowing some I know who should know at the age they are - the senior moment kicks in every few minutes. So, folks what is it really to know about the Pacific Height Mafia? \n\nFolks do you all remember the billion dollar heroin bust made by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 1991 at a Hayward California Warehouse? Try forgetting your Senior Moments and think of a name - Robert DeMonte. The year 1991 and Robert DeMonte, Administrator of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - Region IX if I am not mistaken.\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi and many other prominent names were linked with this bust - all investors in the Hayward California Warehouse- billion dollar heroin bust. Time flies and people forget and now we have a Speaker of the House - and surely no one is supposed to remember this incident. At least not the heroin!\n\nThis story provides no sourcing for the claim that Pelosi is \"link with this bust.\" There is no reporting from 1991 about her connection, or about the claim that a high-ranking HUD official was implicated. It is not believable that the FBI would let DeMonte off the hook for involvement in a major heroin smuggling operation in exchange for him quitting his job.\n\nWe did find reporting from Associated Press in 1991 that tells what really happened and there is no mention of Pelosi:\n\nAuthorities Seize 1,200 Pounds of Heroin in Biggest Bust in U.S. History Precede HAYWARD, Calif.\n\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Law enforcement \u2033ripped the heart out\u2033 of a significant Asian smuggling group by seizing 1,200 pounds of high-grade heroin and arresting four people in the biggest heroin bust in U.S. history, an official said today.\n\n\n\n\u2033We took off the upper echelon of this organization,\u2033 said Bob Bender, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's San Francisco office.\n\n\n\n\u2033If we had allowed this to be distributed ... we could have arrested 300 to 400 people ultimately, but we've cut the head of the dragon off,\u2033 Bender said. \u2033Law enforcement has ripped the heart out of a very significant organization.\u2033\n\n\n\nThe \u2033China White\u2033 heroin was found in a shipment headed for a warehouse in Hayward, a suburb just east of San Francisco Bay. It came from somewhere in the Golden Triangle of Burma, Laos and Thailand and was shipped from Taiwan to Oakland, Bender said.\n\n\n\nU.S. Customs Service spokesman Mike Fleming called it the largest-ever heroin seizure in the nation, and Bender estimated its street value at $3 billion.\n\n\n\nThe complaint identified the four arrested Thursday as Jim Juichang Chen; his wife, Lucy Chen; Kelly Paokui Chen, who is married to Jim Chen's brother; and Lu Chin Sheng. Bender, who gave the names somewhat differently, said the suspects were all in their 20s and 30s.\n\n\n\nA fifth suspect, Mike Juiming Chen, Kelly Chen's husband, was still at large, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThey each face one federal count of possession of heroin with intent to distribute one of conspiracy to distribute heroin. They could face up to life in prison and a $4 million fine on each count.\n\n\n\nThe four entered no plea at their arraignment this morning. They appeared in court in handcuffs, appearing solemn, and communicated with the judge through an interpreter.\n\n\n\nBender described Lu Chin Sheng as \u2033the heavyweight, very significant\u2033 in the organization, and said he entered the United States using a fraudulent passport.\n\n\n\nSheng is from Bangkok, while the rest are Taiwanese who are resident aliens in the United States, Bender said.\n\n\n\nThe heroin was discovered by Customs inspectors at the port in Oakland about the middle of May during a routine check of imports, Bender said. The inspectors had no advance knowledge that the package addressed to the Join Sun Corp. in Hayward contained contraband, he said.\n\n\n\n\u2033The DEA and Customs joined together and we removed about 1,180 pounds of heroin and we left about 10 pounds of heroin in the shipment, and we made a controlled delivery to the Join Sun Corp.,\u2033 Bender said.\n\n\n\nThen the two agencies, each devoting about 35 agents to the task, plus officers from the Hayward and San Leandro police departments launched a round- the-clock surveillance of the warehouse. As people stopped by, surveillance expanded to include their homes and another business, the Tracy Hotel in Tracy, he said.\n\n\n\nBender would not disclose whether the surveillance included wiretaps.\n\n\n\nBy Thursday, Bender said, prosecutors decided they had enough information for arrests.\n\n\n\nDuring Thursday's actions, authorities searched the Tracy Hotel, a home adjacent to the hotel and two homes in Blackhawk, taking mainly records and finding no drugs, he said.\n\n\n\nThe warehouse also contained legitimate imports of Chinese porcelain figures, Bender said.\n\n\n\nBender said officials planned to seize the bank accounts of those allegedly involved in the heroin scheme, and that DEA offices in Southeast Asia were working with local officials to track down other people and bank accounts that may be connected to those arrested.\n\n\n\nThe previous record heroin bust was made in New York City in 1989 when authorities seized 800 pounds of the drug worth about $1 billion.\n\n\n\nAuthorities in Los Angeles seized 20 tons of cocaine at a warehouse in 1989 in the world's largest bust involving that drug.", "lang": "en"}
