What animal was it?\n\nThe options provided were 'Horse', 'Yak', 'Elephant' and 'Donkey'. The poll attracted over 19,000 votes.\n\nAlmost two-thirds respondents to the poll picked donkey as the right answer.\n\nThe correct answer is 'Yak'. In 1958 Jawaharlal Nehru rode to Bhutan on the back of a yak looking to forge a friendship between the two countries. His visit was in the backdrop of China looking to claim some parts of Bhutanese territory.\n\nWhile some replied earnestly others mocked the party for providing 'donkey' as an option.\n\nThe BJP and its supporters were quick to attack the party over the tweet on Sunday. Subsequently forcing INC to delete the poll.\n\nAnd while India's grand old party retreated on Sunday it put up a somewhat bizarre fight on Monday. Sample this tweet from Uttarakhand Congress. The thread soon became a free-for all troll fest.\n\nThe photograph from March 2014 is when then Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi rode a pony during his visit to Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra.\n\nNearly every political party in India is playing catch-up with the BJP when it comes to leveraging social media.\n\nOn the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement, the Congress posted a cheeky quiz taking aim at VD Savarkar, whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP hold in high esteem.\n\nWhile that quiz was a direct hit, the current one seems to have backfired.", "lang": "en"}
