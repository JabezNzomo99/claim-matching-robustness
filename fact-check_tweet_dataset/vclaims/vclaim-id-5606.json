A small part is because immigrants tend to be paid less than native workers, bringing the average down further.\n\nThe Bank of England also found that an increase in the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers seemed to have an effect on the average UK wage nationally. This effect was much smaller than the effect found when the report focused on particular groups of occupation.\n\nWhether the immigrant workers had come from inside or outside the EU made very little difference.\n\nThis is a relatively small effect\n\nBetween 2004-2006 and 2012-2014 the ratio of foreign-born to UK-born workers rose by about 8% in low-skilled and semi-skilled service occupations across the UK as a whole. This was the largest change in any of the four occupational groups classified by the report.\n\nSo for a low-skilled or semi-skilled occupation paid \u00a38 per hour, this would work out to a drop of between 1 and 2 pence per hour, each year.\n\nMany issues have an affect on the wages of the lowest paid. Academics commonly list global changes in technology and trade, or national differences in education, attitudes to gender, and union activity as having a much more significant effect than having a higher proportion of immigrants in the workforce.", "lang": "en"}
