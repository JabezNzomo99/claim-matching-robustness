See you next Season mga Kapamilya.\u201d\n\nThe word charot is Filipino slang for \u201cjust kidding.\u201d Despite this, Duterte Social Media Supporter\u2019s post gained over a thousand shares, more than 400 comments and above 2,300 reactions. Some comments on the tweet professed admiration for Santos-Concio's \u201chumility.\u201d Only a few noticed the Twitter account name.\n\nThe @CharotSntos account has been suspended.\n\nDuterteSocial Media Supporter\u2019s post was uploaded three days after the National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease and desist order against ABS-CBN after its 25-year franchise expired on May 4. The media network\u2019s application for renewal remains pending in Congress.\n\nThe FB page was created in 2015 and now has more than 250,000 followers. Several other FB accounts have reuploaded the fabricated post.", "lang": "en"}
