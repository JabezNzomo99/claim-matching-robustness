The independent human rights project OVD-Info put the number of arrests at 1,373.\n\nIn a piece for the website of the Russian state television network RT, Alexey Martynov, director of the International Institute of Newly-Established States, a Moscow-based think tank, accused the protesters of attempting to \u201corganize mass unrest in Moscow,\u201d claiming that what he called a \u201cprovocation\u201d failed to incite a harsh reaction from law-enforcement officials.\n\nThis claim mirrors the much-repeated Kremlin narrative that outside forces direct public protests in Russia.\n\nHowever, Matrynov\u2019s claim the protesters tried (and failed) to provoke a police clampdown is false.\n\nThe Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, a consultative body to the President of the Russian Federation, noted the peaceful character of those who began gathering outside of Moscow City Hall on Tverskaya Street.\n\n\u201cThe arrests were not isolated, and mostly young people, both men and girls, were dragged [away]. I didn't see aggression from protesters\u2026 After the arrests started, the protesters began to express themselves with chants. At the same time, I did not hear any revolutionary overtones or calls for violent actions,\u201d said council member Nikolai Svanidze.\n\nWhile isolated instances of demonstrators skirmishing with police were reported after the crackdown began, many journalists and rights organizations said the immediate use of force by police was unprovoked and disproportionate.\n\nAlec Luhn, a correspondent for Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper, reported police began arresting people before the protest began.\n\nPatrick Reevell of ABC news reported 140 people were arrested less than half an hour into the protest.\n\nAuthorities began arresting opposition figures days before the rally, including opposition leader Alexei Navalny and opposition candidate Yulia Galyamina.\n\nAll eight opposition candidates running in Moscow\u2019s local elections were placed under arrest or sentenced to jail since the protest, in what the Moscow Times called \u201cthe harshest crackdowns on Russia's opposition in several years.\u201d\n\n\"In numerous incidents, police used excessive force, throwing people to the ground, dragging them on the asphalt, twisting their arms behind the back, and using batons,\u201d the New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported. \u200b\n\nHRW said several dozen people, including at least six journalists, sustained injuries, such as \u201cbruising, abrasions, a fractured leg, and a concussion.\u201d\n\nNumerous instances of police swinging batons at protesters who were not putting up any resistance were captured on film.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem D\u00e9sir, released a statement \u201cdeploring\u201d the harsh treatment and obstruction faced by reporters covering the demonstration.\n\n\u201cAccording to various reports, on 27 July at least 15 media workers working or contributing to various media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta, RBK, the Associated Press, Meduza, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Deutsche Welle, Mediazona, The Village and Wikinews were assaulted, detained or had their equipment damaged by police while covering a public demonstration in Moscow,\u201d the OSCE said.\n\nPolice reportedly broke into the independent station TV Rain (Dozhd), which was live streaming the protest.\n\nUPDATE: Following publication, RT\u2019s press office contacted Polygraph.info disputing the following paragraph:\n\nRT editor in chief Margarita Simonyan claimed \u201cour guys\u201d had footage of a TV Rain journalist \u201ctacitly consenting\u201d to protesters breaking down a police cordon. She declined to release that footage.\n\n\u201cShe is clearly commenting on a fragment of TV Rain coverage that was broadcast live and was publicly available on their platforms \u2014 but which she chose not to repost on her own social media accounts,\u201d the RT press office letter said.\n\nOn July 28, a TV Rain journalist was arrested while reporting outside of the hospital where Navalny had been transferred after suffering a health scare in prison.\n\nMartynov said the journalists had informed the police in advance about their desire \u201cto cover the scandalous event,\u201d claiming that those in the media were essentially saying \u201cdo not touch us, we are at work.\u201d\n\nHowever, he omitted the fact that it was the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, that, on July 25, had asked media managers to inform it in advance of those journalists who would be covering the event on safety grounds.\n\nThe ministry justified the request as a safety measure.\u200b\n\nPolygraph.info finds that Martynov\u2019s claims regarding the July 27 protests in Moscow are false.", "lang": "en"}
