Woman Slices Off Rapists Genitals, Forces Him To Eat It At Gunpoint\n\nOn 5 April 2016 the web site News4KTLA published an article reporting that a female rape victim had cut off a rapist\u2019s genitals and then forced him to eat them:\n\nA gruesome scene unfolded in a Fayetteville, North Carolina neighborhood after a convicted child molester kidnapped a 19-year-old woman and took her back to his home and assaulted her. Kimberly Walt was walking home from her friends house on Sunday afternoon when she says she was approached by Robert Williams, a three-time convicted felon. Williams asked her if she wanted a ride to where ever she was going, Walt replied \u201cNo thank you.\u201d That\u2019s when she said Williams drove off, but when she turned the corner he jumped out of the bushes, grabbed her and threw her in his car. Williams took Walt to his home where he proceeded to assault her for several hours. According to police reports, Williams fell asleep after drinking massive amounts of alcohol and Walt was able to untie herself. She then approached Williams, tied him up, and in a bit of rage, grabbed a knife and \u201ccastrated him.\u201d Walt stated that he woke up screaming and yelling, as she walked over with his \u201cparts\u201d and toss them in the microwave. \u201cI threw that bastards junk in the microwave, grab the plate, fork and a steak knife and cut it up like hot dogs,\u201d said Walt and a recorded statement. \u201cI grabbed a gun that he had left on the kitchen counter, walked over to him, and forced him to eat it. I have no remorse and I am not sorry. That bastard deserved it and he\u2019s going to hell.\u201d\n\nThe claim spread on social media for a number of reasons. One was that the fabricated story falls neatly into the always-popular category of \u201cjustice porn,\u201d presenting a narrative involving a crime and a victim who manages to turn the tables on her attacker. The second was the appropriation of Los Angeles-area outlet KTLA\u2018s call letters in the name of the site (the two sites are not related).\n\nThe photograph of the purported rapist was in actuality an old mugshot taken on or before 4 October 2014, unrelated to any rape cases in April 2015.\n\nWhile News4KTLA carries no disclaimer warning readers its content is fabricated (its \u201cAbout\u201d page simply describes it as \u201clocal news for southern Louisiana and the surrounding area\u201d), the site appears to be one of many fly-by-night fake news purveyors using visual and call-letter elements to trick social media users into spreading misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
