The quote attributed to her reads:\n\n\"Yes, he\u2019s an idiot with zero common sense, and no social skills, but he IS my son. I just hope he never goes into politics. He\u2019d be a disaster.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis does not appear to be a legitimate quote from President Trump\u2019s mother.\n\nThe post gives no details or citations as to when or where the statement was made, and a search of news archives turns up no trace of it. The quote cannot be found in any interviews or books and only appears to exist in the form of memes and social media posts. Other fact-checking websites have also been unable to locate the statement outside of social media.\n\nMary Anne Trump passed away in 2000, and if she had said such an inflammatory statement about her son, it would have likely come up in the news cycle during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere is no credible evidence to suggest this quote is real.
