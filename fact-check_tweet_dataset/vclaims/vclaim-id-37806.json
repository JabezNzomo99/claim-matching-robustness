Ultimately, the marriage was upheld and Hadiya was given the liberty to live with her husband Shafin Jahan,\u201d Sibal said.\n\nHe said the cheques, when received in his office, were deposited and encashed by his staff.\n\n\u201cI was paid for professional services rendered and for nothing else... The first invoice was raised on 4 August 2017 and the last of the seven invoices was on 8 March 2018,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cThe CAA was cleared by Parliament only in December 2019.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
