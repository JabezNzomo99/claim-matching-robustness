Facebook page that goes by the name 'Jabab Chahiye' posted Khan's photo with a caption in Hindi that loosely translates to, \"Breaking: Shah Rukh Khan, who arrived at London's Heathrow Airport to take part in the (anti) CAA protests happening there, was arrested. Main opposition parties in India said this is a matter of shame to India and said the whole thing is an outcome of a conspiracy between the RSS and the new government of Britain.\" The caption ends with a question, \"Will you still watch his movies, Hindus?\"A Twitter user who goes by the handle '@ShooterVartika' also tweeted the same photo with almost the same caption.An archived version of the tweet is here. The same photo and caption are being shared widely on WhatsApp as well.No, Shah Rukh Khan was not arrested in London over any anti-CAA protest. The photo shared along with the false claim is one clicked in 2012.A simple reverse-image search on Yandex search engine led us to a website called Zimbio that carried the exact same photo and a few other photos from the time Khan visited BBC Radio 2 office in London.The caption given to the album on Zimbio says, \"Bollywood legend Shahrukh Khan is seen arriving at BBC Radio 2 to a crowd of dedicated fans and press,\" and is dated June 21, 2012.Meanwhile, Khan celebrated the new year's eve with his family and friends at his Alibaug bungalow. Khan's wife Gauri Khan shared a few pictures from the new year celebration on her verified Instagram account.We could not find even one credible media report that said Khan was arrested in London. Such an arrest would have made headlines both nationally and internationally.We also could not find any media report on Khan's comments on the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, neither supporting it or opposing it.Khan, on January 1, 2020, had wished all his fans a happy new year through a tweet and an Instagram post. In it, he said, \"Not one for telling anyone how they should be...or do what should be done...or what this year & future made to be. I have so many frailties myself...that I wish may the future be kind to all of us...& we be who we are. May Allah be kind to us inspite of ourselves. Happy New Year.\"Times Fact Check has found the claim that Shah Rukh Khan was arrested at a London airport over anti-CAA protest to be false.", "lang": "en"}
