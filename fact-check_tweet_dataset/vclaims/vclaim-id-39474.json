It was included in a popular meme, posted Oct. 20 on Facebook, that bears the logo of the conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nThe quote has circulated online for years, although there is no evidence Biden ever said that.\n\nA YouTube video, for example, was posted in October 2015 and titled, \u201cBiden: no ordinary American cares about his constitutional rights.\u201d It\u2019s been viewed over 30,000 times.\n\nThe video doesn\u2019t show Biden saying that. Instead, it\u2019s a clip of him talking about \u201croadblocks\u201d set up by the \u201corganized opposition\u201d to gun control.\n\nBiden spoke at Western Connecticut State University in February 2013 at a conference on gun violence. It was convened two months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults dead. The shooter had also killed his mother and later took his own life.\n\n\u201cThey say all you\u2019re going to do \u2026 [is] deny law-abiding citizens their rights under the Second Amendment,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot true.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add, \u201cLet me say at the outset to all the press: No law-abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero.\u201d\n\nThe day Biden made his remarks, a headline on the conservative website Breitbart paraphrased the then-vice president this way: \u201cBiden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants.\u201d\n\nThat appears to be how those words became attributed to Biden.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBiden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants.\u201d Breitbart.com. 21 Feb 2013.\n\n\u201cFederal Response to Gun Violence Conference with Vice President Joe Biden at Western Connecticut State University.\u201d Video. Connecticut Network. 21 Feb 2013.\n\nKegu, Jessica. \u201cJoe Biden reveals how he\u2019ll decide whether to run for president in 2020.\u201d CBS News. 18 Oct 2018.", "lang": "en"}
