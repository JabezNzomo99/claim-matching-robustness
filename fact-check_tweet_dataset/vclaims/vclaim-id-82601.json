You can access the archived version of the tweet here.\n\nA few Twitter users pointed out, one of the buildings in the above photo shared by Chaturvedi had Telugu writings on it, which is highly unusual for Lucknow.\n\nMany Congress supporters shared this photo along with ones from Monday's roadshow that were shared by Chaturvedi.\n\nThe photo turned out to be from an older event from a Congress campaign rally at Telangana and was tweeted by Mohammed Azharuddin last December, which explains the Telugu text on one of the buildings in the photo.\n\n\n\nAs it became clear that Chaturvedi tried to pass of an older photo as recent one, Twitter users rebuked her.\n\nWhen word got out, both Chaturvedi and Yadav deleted their tweets. Chaturvedi went ahead and accepted her mistake and corrected herself by tweeting a newer set of photos from Monday's roadshow.", "lang": "en"}
