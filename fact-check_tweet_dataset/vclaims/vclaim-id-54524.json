The claim originated on a satirical news website.\n\nMaxwell, the longtime confidant and ex-girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, was arrested in early July on charges that she allegedly helped him recruit minors to sexually abuse, according to NPR. She is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she awaits trial after being denied bail, per The Associated Press.\n\nAn image alleges in a post that prison guards turned off security cameras to give Maxwell \u201cprivacy during this trying time.\u201d It appears to be a screen grab of a news article published July 10.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for this reason that Maxwell has also been taken off 24-hour guard watch,\u201d the article reads. \u201cInstead, guards will check up on her once every six hours.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show BBC News Article About Ghislaine Maxwell Being Moved To The ICU For COVID-19 Symptoms)\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to substantiate the claims in the story. The Justice Department has added extra security precautions and placed non-Bureau of Prisons officials in charge of protecting Maxwell from other inmates and herself, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\n\nIn reality, the screen grab shows an article published by the self-described satirical news website the Daily Squat. The article, titled \u201cPrison guards switch off security cameras to give Ghislaine Maxwell privacy during \u2018difficult time,'\u201d appears to play on the conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances of Epstein\u2019s death, which a New York medical examiner ruled a suicide.\n\nHeadlines from the Daily Squat include \u201cJohnny Depp killed me and now I\u2019m a ghost, claims Amber Heard\u201d and \u201cThousands of dogs protest, claiming \u2018all cats are bastards.'\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
