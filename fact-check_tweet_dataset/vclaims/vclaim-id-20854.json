One of those pages goes by the name \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Lady, Melania Trump,\u201d which lists itself as a \u201cpublic figure.\u201d\n\nThe story claims that there is a \u201cclip being circulated on the Dark web\u201d of Sessions talking to his therapist. The links included in the story, however, go to a picture of a clown standing next to a booth that says, \u201cPsychiatric Help \u2014 0\u00a2\u201d and a stick figure drawing of a man pointing and saying, \u201cNUH-UH!\u201d\n\nThe story also gives a link that it claims will take readers to a site where they can hear the clip, but the link actually leads to the website of a sound production company in New York City.\n\nSessions is still very much the head of the Justice Department. On June 11, he announced a new rule that restricts the circumstances under which U.S. immigration judges can approve applications for asylum. And his schedule for the rest of the week includes stops in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on June 14, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, on June 15, to talk about immigration issues.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nMatter of A-B-, Respondent.
