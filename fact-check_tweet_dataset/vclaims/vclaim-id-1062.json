This claim is false, as the deaths happened in January, 2020.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here and here .\n\nThe image shows the photographs of six different police officers with overlaid text that reads: \u201c6 officers have died in the last 10 days. The media has barely said a word.\u201d\n\nThis headline, however, is nearly six months old and is unrelated to the George Floyd protests.\n\nThe image stems from an article by Law Enforcement Today published on January 30, 2020. The officers listed died from a range of different causes, according to the outlet ( here ). None of the deaths were related to Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nDeputy Sheldon Gordon Whiteman was killed in a car crash during a high-speed vehicle pursuit ( here ). Officer Cesar Ramirez passed away from brain cancer. Ramirez died on January 21 ( here ). Officer Katherine Thyne died in the line of duty ( here ). Correctional Major Angelanette Moore died after performing a \u201cprison shakedown\u201d on January 23rd. She had suffered a heart attack ( here ).\n\nInvestigator John Cole Haynie died from complications related to the flu virus. He passed after a \u201cmonth long medical battle\u201d according to the Rockdale County Sheriff\u2019s Office ( here ). Officer Munir \u201cMo\u201d Edais died \u201cunexpectedly\u201d, according to Law Enforcement Today. A Facebook post by the Los Gatos Police Officers\u2019 Association confirmed this ( here )\n\nPartly false. Six police officers in this photograph did die, but months prior to George Floyd protests.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
