German law enforcement officials arrested an alleged triggerman who is suspected of being a Russian agent.\n\nA video of Putin\u2019s comment in Russian was posted on Facebook by MBK Media South (@mbkmediasouth), a Russian media outlet.\n\n\u201cYou talked about the murder of a Georgian,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThat is not entirely true. I know that a man died in Berlin, he is not simply a Georgian. This is a man who took active part in combat actions on the side of separatists in the Caucasus. He is not ethnically a Georgian. This man was wanted by us, he is a militant. Moreover, he is a cruel and blood-thirsty person. In just one of the attacks in which he took part, 98 people were killed by him. He was one of the organizers of explosions in the Moscow metro. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. It\u2019s a criminal milieu and anything can happen there.\u201d\n\nPutin did not offer any evidence of his claims regarding the slain man\u2019s alleged involvement in a Moscow metro bombing or the killing of 98 people in an attack. In addition, news reports have hypothesized that the shadowy Russian suspect in the Berlin killing has ties to Russian defense or security services.\n\nParts of Putin\u2019s claim are false; others are misleading.\n\nZelimkhan Khangoshvili, 40, an ethnic Chechen from Georgia, was killed in Berlin on Aug. 24 in a broad daylight. Witnesses told police the killer rode up on a bicycle, shot Khangoshvili twice and pedaled away. The suspect was captured after being seen dumping a wig, handgun and his bicycle in the Spree River.\n\nThe Berlin general prosecutor said the murder was a professional operation. According to Western media reports, German prosecutors suspect it was a state-sponsored contract killing. Russian officials have strongly denied any connection.\n\nA prominent figure in Chechen diaspora circles, Khangoshvili served as a field commander in the second Chechen war with Russia (August 1999-April 2009) and as an intermediary between Georgian security services and the Chechens. More recently, he helped organize resistance in the Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine. Following several assassination attempts, Khangoshvili sought asylum in Germany with his family.\n\nGermany\u2019s Der Spiegel newspaper reported on Dec. 6 that the country\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the BND, had obtained \u201cvalid information from a trustworthy source\u201d that a Russian state agency was planning to kill Khangoshvili\u2019s suspected assassin in a German prison. As a result, German authorities transferred the suspect to an undisclosed detention facility.\n\nThe German prosecutor\u2019s office said the suspect carried the passport of a Russian citizen under the name Vadim S. The man refused to speak with investigators and demanded a meeting with Russian embassy officials. German media said he had traveled to Berlin from Moscow via Paris and had return ticket to Moscow.\n\nDer Spiegel reported the name in the suspect\u2019s Russian passport as Vadim Sokolov. An investigation by Der Spiegel, Bellingcat and the Russian Dossier Center identified him as Vadim Krasikov, a Russian national. Krasikov, their report contends, had potential ties to Vympel, an elite unit inside the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB. The link was based on Krasikov\u2019s alleged association with two other Russians, purportedly Vympel veterans, who had been charged in the 2007 killing of a businessman in a small Russian town.\n\nThe Bellingcat report also argued that Sokolov/Krasikov may have been the target of an arrest warrant related to the killing in 2013 of another businessman, Albert Nazranov, in Moscow. Also a bicycle-shooting attack, the episode was caught on security cameras and widely broadcast by news media.\n\nPutin\u2019s assertion that Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was \u201cwanted\u201d in Russia could not be verified. As Polygraph.info previously reported, neither the name Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, nor his adopted name Tornike Kavtarashvili, are on the official list of terrorist suspects wanted in Russia. If Russia is seeking his extradition for terrorism, details have not been disclosed.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 16, 2019: The allegations made by Putin against Khangoshvili \u201chave never been communicated to the federal government in the past,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in an interview with ZDF on Dec. 13. They were made only after Germany launched an investigation into his murder, he said. \u201cThere is nothing, neither with us, nor with the Interior Ministry, nor with the authorities responsible for requests for legal assistance,\u201d Hass said.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Accent, a Georgian media outlet, Khangoshvili spoke about fighting alongside Chechen separatists during the second war.\n\n\u201cAs for the Russian military, I repeat, I fought in the Chechen war,\u201d Khangoshvili said in that interview. \u201cI had no enemies in Georgia.\u201d He claimed that the Russian special services were behind a failed attempt to assassinate him in Tbilisi in 2015.\n\nIn his Dec. 9 comments, Putin said 98 people were killed by Khangoshvili in an attack. The figure of 98 killed appears only once in reports of battles between Russian and rebel forces in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region.\n\nThat was in the official Russian death toll from a June 2004 attack by a force that Russian authorities said consisted of 250 Chechen and Ingush rebels launched simultaneously on security, military and police in Ingushetia and Dagestan, republics that neighbor Chechnya in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region.\n\nThe rebels claimed more than a thousand fighters participated in that raid. The attack reportedly killed 98 Russian troops and security officials and wounded 104.\n\nZelimkhan Khangoshvili\u2019s brother, Zurab, told Polygraph.info that in the summer of 2000, his brother crossed the Caucasus Mountains to join separatist forces in Chechnya and returned to Georgia in December 2004.\n\nZurab confirmed that his brother participated in the 2004 attack in Ingushetia: \u201cYes, he participated in that operation, but there were about a thousand of them. He was wounded in the leg and that is why he returned home.\u201d\n\nAssuming this is the attack Putin intended, he was correct that Khangoshvili took part. But it is misleading to attribute all 98 fatalities in the raids to a single fighter.\n\nThere have been seven explosions in the Moscow metro that the Russian authorities determined were terror attacks:\n\nPutin did not specify which metro attack he meant, but Khangoshvili\u2019s name isn\u2019t mentioned in any of the investigations of those attacks, nor has he been accused of involvement in or indicted for any of the Moscow metro bombings.\n\nIn his Accent interview, Khangoshvili denied any involvement in terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are blaming me for many things, including terrorist attacks,\u201d he told the Georgian media outlet. \u201cThis is a lie. No one can provide any evidence that a single civilian was injured or killed in any of my actions!\u201d\n\nZurab Khangoshvili called Putin\u2019s assertion about the Moscow metro bombings \u201cfalse, and an attempt to distract the Germans from investigating Russian intelligence involvement\u201d in his brother\u2019s murder.\n\nLikewise, he said Chechen rebels did not consider the 2004 raid in Ingushetia a terror attack, but rather a \u201cmilitary operation carried out under the command of legitimately elected president of Ichkeria [Chechnya], Aslan Maskhadov, during the war with Russia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
