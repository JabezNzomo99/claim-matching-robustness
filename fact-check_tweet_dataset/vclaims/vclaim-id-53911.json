Ted Yoho said that black Americans should only get three-fifths of a vote.\n\nThere is no evidence Yoho made the comment. The claim actually comes from a satirical article published in 2014.\n\nThe viral post credits Yoho with saying black Americans should only get three-fifths of a vote. The alleged comment appears to reference the 1787 Three-Fifths Compromise that counted slaves as three-fifths of a person when apportioning taxes and state representation in Congress.\n\n\u201cHe is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that\u2026 OUT LOUD!\u201d says the post. \u201cYou stay classy Florida.\u201d (RELATED: Was Obama \u2018Furious\u2019 After Being Photographed Carrying \u2018The Post-American World\u2019?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence the Florida congressman actually made this statement. The Daily Caller conducted an internet search and did not find any credible results for the remark, except for instances where it was being debunked by other fact-checking websites.\n\nThe fake quote has been circulating online since at least 2014, when the website Newslo published an article quoting Yoho as saying, \u201cAnd a black man\u2019s vote counts as 3/5 of a white man\u2019s.\u201d The \u201cShow Facts\u201d button that allows readers to see which parts are true in the article indicates that the statement has indeed been fabricated.\n\nThat satirical story appears to have drawn inspiration for its fake quote from a video showing Yoho saying at a 2012 campaign stop, \u201cI\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.\u201d But Yoho didn\u2019t mention black voters during the event, according to PolitiFact.", "lang": "en"}
