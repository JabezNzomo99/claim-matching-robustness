Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican, is one of them.\n\nMurphy is a physician who won the seat in a special election last year after longtime congressman Walter Jones passed away. Murphy has been posting videos on Twitter, wherein he explains the effects of the virus and the federal government\u2019s response.\n\nIn a video posted March 16, Murphy stands next to a white board wearing his scrubs.\n\nMost of his tips are on-point. He says cold weather won\u2019t kill the novel coronavirus (true). He says gargling hot water doesn\u2019t kill coronavirus (also true).\n\nBut Murphy also says this.\n\n\"Sunlight actually can kill the virus. But we have to be cautious about that. It\u2019s good to be out in the sun, but away at a distance from each other,\" Murphy says.\n\nWe reached out to Murphy but didn\u2019t receive a response. So we did our own research.\n\nAs it turns out, PolitiFact has already reported on a variation of this claim. Sunlight has not been proven to kill the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.\n\nThis is one of many unverified claims about the novel coronavirus.\n\nAt first, the reasoning might make sense. There is, in fact, some evidence that viruses don\u2019t like heat.\n\n\"The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,\" Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, recently told Time Magazine.\n\nBut, at this point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control isn\u2019t sure the sun or heat will affect COVID-19 the same way. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier said on Feb. 12 that \"it\u2019s premature to assume\" the heat and sunlight will temper the virus. \"We haven\u2019t been through even a single year with this pathogen,\" she told NPR.\n\nSun exposure can also raise a person\u2019s vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection, Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch wrote in his recent paper: \"Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?\"\n\nBut, Lipsitch wrote, \"On the other hand, we found that this effect was unlikely to be a large factor in the variation in influenza incidence between summer and winter.\"\n\nNeither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control list sunlight exposure as a method for preventing the coronavirus. In fact, on its \"mythbusters\" webpage, the WHO says COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, \"including areas with hot and humid weather.\"\n\nOne reason people might believe sunlight can kill the virus is because sunlight contains ultraviolet light. In Rep. Murphy\u2019s video, he stands next to a white board that mentions UV light from the sun.\n\nHigh-intensity UV light can indeed kill viruses. But natural sunlight doesn\u2019t provide the UV light intensity needed to kill the virus, according to Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\n\"Exposing surfaces to plain sunlight should not be considered sanitation,\" she said, adding: \"I would never ever, ever rely on sunlight to kill coronavirus.\"\n\nGraham\u2019s claim about UV light is supported by Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nTo kill a virus, temperatures must rise to about 140 degrees fahrenheit, Bloomfield told the BBC.\n\nMurphy said \"sunlight actually can kill the virus.\" This claim has not been proven true.\n\nHis whiteboard mentioned UV light in sunlight. But experts claim the UV rays in sunlight aren\u2019t intense enough to COVID-19.\n\nWe found no conclusive evidence that someone could prevent the virus by exposing themselves to the sun for long periods of time. And we found no evidence that sunlight exposure could help an infected person defeat the virus. We rate this claim False.", "lang": "en"}
