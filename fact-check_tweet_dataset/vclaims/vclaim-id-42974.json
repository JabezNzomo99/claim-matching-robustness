The original photo was taken by photographer Kai Pfaffenbach.\n\nReuters' caption read: \"People lay down in a pedestrian zone as part of an art project in remembrance of the 528 victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp, in Frankfurt, March 24, 2014. The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt's central cemetery.\"\n\nThe false photo brings to mind a real instance in January when a dead man was found on an empty street in Wuhan.\n\nTo date, the coronavirus cases in China passed 70,000, with the death toll in mainland China rising to 1,765. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
