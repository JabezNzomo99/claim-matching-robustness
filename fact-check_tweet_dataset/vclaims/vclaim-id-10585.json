Salmon caught off the coast of Alaska are riddled with cancer. Fish in the Great Barrier Reef are radioactive and full of external and internal tumors. Polar bears in Canada are losing patches of fur. Of 12 bluefin tuna caught in California waters, all 12 were highly radioactive. Does anyone care? Fukushima has been seeping radioactivity into our oceans daily since 2011, and the oceans are extremely sick because of it. Why isn't this a global crisis and why aren't we all coming together to stop it?\n\nIn February 2016, a series of photos purportedly showing the ill effects that the Fukushima nuclear disaster had on marine life was widely shared on social media. A popular Facebook post, which appeared to be a rewrite of an article published by web site Superstation95 in October 2015, reported that North Americans were eating seafood filled with \u201ccancerous tumors\u201d:\n\nWhile the Daiichi meltdowns and subsequent radiation releases did have a major effect on aquatic life, these photos do not illustrate those effects. For instance, the lead photo of the article, purportedly showing the \u201cbloody\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d tumors caused by nuclear radiation, was actually taken in 2004, years before the Fukushima disaster started leaking radiation into the sea:\n\nSuperstation 95 touted these images as undeniable proof of Fukushima\u2019s effect on seafood:\n\nThe article then shows a picture of \u201ccancerous tumors in salmon\u201d purportedly linked to a rise in nuclear radiation in oceans:\n\nAgain, however, the above-displayed image was taken prior to the Fukushima disaster. The image also does not show cancerous tumors, or any type of tumor at all. Instead, it was lifted from Wikipedia, and shows a salmon infected with with Henneguya salminicola, a myxosporean parasite.\n\nAnother misleading photo featured University of Alberta scientist David Schindler holding a fish with a growth. The article reported that this image depicted a fish \u201cshowing classic signs of radiation-caused cancerous tumors,\u201d but Schindler said that the fish was taken from the Athabasca River watershed, which is downstream from an oil sands industrial development \u2014 not a nuclear plant:\n\nIn addition to spreading misinformation about the effects that the Fukushima disaster had on marine life, Superstation95 attempted to revive a long-debunked rumor that sharks don\u2019t get cancer:\n\nThe above-displayed image was taken in 2013, and while it was an unusual sight -\u2014 the first time a tumor was spotted on a great white shark \u2014 there is no evidence that the tumor was caused by radiation from Fukushima or anywhere else. Rachel Robbins, shark biologist at the Fox Shark Research Foundation who studied the animal, said that while the cause of the tumor was unknown, industrial pollutants may have been a contributing factor:\n\nScientists have known for more than 150 years that sharks get cancer. And yet the belief persists that the animals don\u2019t suffer from the disease. That misconception is promoted in part by those who sell shark cartilage, who claim that the substance will help cure cancer, said David Shiffman, a shark researcher and doctoral student at the University of Miami. But no studies have shown that shark cartilage is an effective treatment, and the demand for the material has helped decimate shark populations, researchers say. In total, scientists have now documented tumors in at least 23 species of sharks, including the two in the new study, Robbins said. \u201cThe main take-home message from the study is that it adds to the growing evidence of tumor formation in sharks, contrary to popular belief that sharks do not suffer from such anomalies,\u201d Robbins told LiveScience. It\u2019s unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronzer shark. However, reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals, especially mammals, have steadily increased over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may trigger the cancers, according to the study. Beluga whales have been recorded to suffer from cancer, and in areas near aluminum smelting plants, cancer is the second leading killer of the whales, the study noted.\n\nAnother misleading photo used to illustrate the effects of nuclear radiation featured a coral trout with skin cancer:\n\nThe web site reports that \u201cthe only explanation for a fish getting human-like skin cancer is exposure to radiation.\u201d While that may be technically true, the researchers who discovered the above-displayed fish told Live Science that the fish probably got skin cancer due to UV radiation, not nuclear radiation:\n\nThe first case of skin cancer in a wild marine fish population looks eerily similar to the melanoma that plagues humans, researchers report today. Coral trout living on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef are directly beneath the Antarctic ozone hole, the world\u2019s largest, which is the result of the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere that normally protects humans from harmful UV rays. \u201cFurther work needs to be carried out to establish the exact cause of the cancer, but having eliminated other likely factors such as microbial pathogens and marine pollution, UV radiation appears to be the likely cause,\u201d study researcher Michael Sweet, of Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.\n\nThe following images were presented with little to no explanation, although they were, presumably, included in the article in order to imply to readers that these animals had all been victims of the Fukushima disaster:\n\nThe above photograph of shrimp was taken in 2012 in the Gulf of Mexico, and was lifted from an Al Jazeera story about the effects of the BP oil spill.\n\nThis photo of a starfish was taken in 2006 \u2014 long before the Fukushima disaster \u2014 and appears on a Wikipedia page.\n\nThis photo of a \u201cjuvenile male Northern Fur Seal\u201d was taken in 2009 \u2014 again, before the Fukushima disaster \u2014 and has nothing to do with radiation. According to Getty, the image shows combat wounds.\n\nThis photo of a polar bear with alopecia was taken in Alaska in 2012. While researchers said that this disease has been found in both wild and captive animals, they do not know the cause. The United States Geological Survey speculated that the lesions may have been caused by numerous factors, including \u201cman-made and natural biotoxins, radiation, contaminants, auto-immune diseases, nutritional, hormonal and environmental factors.\u201d\n\nHowever, SuperStation95 did use one photo that was directly tied to the radiation leaked from the Fukushima power plant. In August 2011, researchers detected cesium-137 and cesium-134 in 15 tuna caught off the coast of California:\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the above-displayed bluefin tuna did show signs of radiation from Fukushima, the study\u2019s author, Daniel Madigan, said that the levels did not come close to exceeding safety limits:\n\nThe article published by Superstation95 on 15 October 2015 (and subsequent posts on social media) used half-truths, misleading statistics, and unrelated photos in order to convince its readers that they had been ingesting radioactive seafood. While the Fukushima disaster certainly had effects on the environment and marine life, they are not adequately demonstrated by the photographs circulating in social media, nor by Superstation95.", "lang": "en"}
