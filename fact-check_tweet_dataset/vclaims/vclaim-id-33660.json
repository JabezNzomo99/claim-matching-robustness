According to her most recent financial disclosure, Yovanovitch has an estimated net worth of between $1.3 million and $3.3 million.\n\nSocial media posts have recently bestowed upon Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a personal net worth of anywhere from $6.4 million to $23 million.\n\nHowever, according to her 2019 financial disclosure, which we requested from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Yovanovitch has assets worth between $1.3 million and $3.3 million.\n\nThat includes houses in Boca Raton, Florida, and Alexandria, Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C. The Florida house is valued at between $250,001 and $500,000, and the Virginia house is valued at between $500,001 and $1 million. The rest of her assets are in either bank accounts or investment funds, the estimated value of which can vary widely.\n\nWhile this kind of financial disclosure report doesn\u2019t give a full account of net worth \u2014 it excludes some financial information, such as government retirement benefits and some bank accounts worth less than $5,000 \u2014 it does provide an outline of her wealth.\n\nThe posts on social media, on the other hand, either don\u2019t include any evidence to support the figures they cite, or they link to websites that, similarly, don\u2019t include any supporting documentation. One of those websites, for example, lists Yovanovitch\u2019s net worth as $17 million, but it doesn\u2019t explain where that number came from. The website was registered in September and is based in Pakistan, according to domain registry details. The site\u2019s owner did not respond to our email.\n\nThe claims about Yovanovitch\u2019s net worth are part of the flood of attention the former ambassador has attracted since she testified during the impeachment inquiry focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOne unsourced tweet from a user who includes the pro-Trump MAGA hashtag in his bio, claimed that he had \u201ctracked down\u201d Yovanovitch\u2019s net worth to be between $17 million and $23 million, but \u201cthe ENTIRE WEB had been scrubbed\u201d of the evidence. That claim was retweeted more than 4,300 times and then it migrated to Facebook.\n\nOne of the most popular memes about Yovanovitch\u2019s finances on Facebook gives a lower estimate. It says: \u201cSomeone needs to ask Maria Yovanovitch how she amassed a networth over $6.4 Million with a $124 K salary? Always Follow the $$$\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what that appraisal is based on, but, according to her financial disclosure, it appears that most of Yovanovitch\u2019s wealth is in either real estate or investment funds.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
