That leaves one in 10 who are \u2018only a little\u2019 (7%) or \u2018not at all\u2019 proud (3%).\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201cThe Russian media\u2019s willful misinterpretation of the Gallup poll reveals a common and consistent tactic used in disinformation: the use of factually accurate but manipulated or incomplete information to support a position,\u201d Bret Schafer, social media analyst at the German Marshall Fund, told Polygraph.info.\n\nSchafer said the tactic is an example of \u201cclassic information manipulation,\u201d which employs a partly true narrative rather than a wholesale fabrication or \u201cfake news,\u201d making it far more difficult to debunk.\n\n\u200bThe tsargar.tv reference to \u201cpolitical turmoil\u201d as the reason for the drop in patriotism among Americans seems to be an accurate reflection of the conclusions drawn in the Gallup report.\n\nSummarizing the implications of the recent poll, Gallup stated: \u201cFewer than half of U.S. adults are extremely proud to be Americans, something that had not been seen in the prior 17 years Gallup has asked the public about its national pride. Politics appears to be a factor, with sharp declines evident among Democrats and political liberals and no decrease among Republicans and conservatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schafer, the exploitation of the existing societal divisions is another traditional part of Russia\u2019s disinformation strategy.\n\n\u201cGoing back to the Cold War, Russian information operations have long preyed upon real and existing societal divisions in America, from racial strife to political polarization. It is important to stress that Russia did not create these divisions, but they have effectively exploited them. The strategy, in essence, is to turn the cracks in our system into chasms,\u201d Schafer said.\n\nTsargrad.tv is owned by Konstantin Malofeev, an oligarch targeted by U.S. Treasury sanctions for his role in the Ukraine conflict and annexation of Crimea, as well as accusations of involvement in a failed coup in Montenegro, and Russia\u2019s active measures in the Balkans.\n\nThe TV channel is popular among Russian nationalists worldwide.", "lang": "en"}
