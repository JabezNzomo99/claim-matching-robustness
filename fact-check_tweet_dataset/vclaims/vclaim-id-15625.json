The quote is fabricated.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Apr 24, 2019 9:59 AM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-15625", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/false-nancy-binay-says-ofws-are-domestic-helpers-not-foreign-workers", "vclaim": "The media team of the senator told Rappler via Facebook messenger that the senator did not issue such statement nor was she interviewed by the Adobo Chronicles. They said that she would not say anything against the OFW as she advocated for their betterment during her tenure in the Senate.\n\nThe headline of the blog post is also misleading. The context of the statement stemmed from the senator's call to ban Chinese workers in the country, not foreign workers.\n\n\"Ang panawagan ay total ban sa pagpasok ng mga Chinese laborer at construction workers. (We are appealing for a total ban of entry among Chinese laborer and construction workers). Our duty is to protect our own workers and provide job security for them \u2013 but sadly, we're opening our labor market to non-Filipinos.\"", "lang": "en"}
