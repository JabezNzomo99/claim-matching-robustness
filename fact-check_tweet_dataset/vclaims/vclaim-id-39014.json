The claim is misleading; Israel\u2019s MIGAL Research Institute said in a press release in February 2020 that it was still working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19; the image of a vial labelled \"coronavirus vaccine\" in the misleading Facebook posts was taken from a stock photo website.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on March 2, 2020. It has been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nIt features a photo of a vial labelled \u201cCoronavirus Vaccine\u201d and Sinhala-language text, which translates to English as: \u201cIsrael discovers a vaccine against coronavirus. / Doctors of Israel - the home of medical research, has said they have received excellent results by giving the corona vaccine.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; Israel\u2019s state-funded MIGAL Research Institute announced that it has developed a vaccine against Infectious Bronchitis Virus, a strain of coronavirus affecting poultry.

Our goal is to produce the vaccine during the next 8-10 weeks, and to achieve safety approval in 90 days.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s website also says \u201cthere is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019\u201d in this Q&A section of its website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant section on the WHO website:\n\nA Google reverse image search for the photo in the misleading posts found it was previously published on the stock photography website Shutterstock here.\n\nThe caption reads: \"Coronavirus vaccine vial with injection syringe at the background.\"\n\n\"Coronavirus\" is a general term for a group of viruses.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the photo misleading post (L) and the Shutterstock photo (R):", "lang": "en"}
