Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least.\n\n\u201cWHY?\u201d the post continues. \u201cEven if the virus gets into your mouth\u2026 drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in the tummy\u2026your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don\u2019t drink enough water more regularly\u2026 the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck found more than 15 identical posts with the same claim and one had been viewed more than 26,000 times and received more than 430 shares.\n\nCOVID-19 has spread to more than 151 countries around the world since first reported in December 2019 and infected more than 179,000 people as of March 17, 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a pandemic on March 11.\n\nThe Facebook post firstly claims the advice on sipping water comes from Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. However, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare lists no advisory about regular water intake on its website nor in its document, \u201cPrevention Measures against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization Philippines directly addressed whether drinking water protects against COVID-19 in a tweet. \u201cWhile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection,\u201d WHO tweeted on February 8.\n\nExperts from the federal Department of Health and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) told AAP FactCheck that while hydration is important the claims mentioned in the post don\u2019t stack up.\n\nFor the claim that drinking water will wash the virus down the oesophagus and into the stomach, UNSW Professor in virology and molecular biology William Rawlinson told AAP FactCheck that COVID-19 particles are \u201ctoo small to wash away\u201d and infection can occur through the eyes, nose and throat.\n\n\u201cIt (COVID-19) binds to cells in the upper part of your nose and throat. Drinking water won\u2019t necessarily wash it away because it gets stuck in the material up there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has advised COVID-19 can be transmitted by touching eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that COVID-19 causes infection when the virus enters cells in the middle part of the throat, the oropharynx.\n\n\u201cAs the cells burst open and release the virus, viral particles can move down the respiratory tract and infect lower respiratory tract epithelial cells,\u201d the Department of Health spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThis will occur whether or not water is sipped.\u201d\n\nFor the claim \u201conce there in the tummy\u2026 your stomach ACID will kill all the virus\u201d, Prof Rawlinson said COVID-19 would most likely be killed by gastric acids if it somehow ended up in the stomach via food, however it could also potentially survive.\n\n\u201cGastric acid does kill viruses, not all of them but many,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck. \u201cBut the virus can specifically stick to cells in the stomach.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that \u201cgastric acid will not kill all viral particles\u201d.\n\n\u201cHydration is important with any infection, however, sipping water will not prevent infection nor will it prevent infection spreading,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post to be false. According the World Health Organization Philippines, drinking water will not prevent infection with COVID-19. The federal Department of Health and a professor in virology and molecular biology both say COVID-19 particles are too small to wash away by drinking water and that infection can also occur via the eyes and nose. There is no guarantee that all of the COVID-19 particles would be killed by gastric acids if it was washed into the stomach, according to the experts.
