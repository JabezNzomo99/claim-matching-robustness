But Forbes told AFP Fact Check it has not published such a list. The claim is a misinterpretation of an old ranking published on a now-defunct website.\n\n\u201cAccording to Forbes, of the ten (10) richest pastors in the world, five are Nigerians,\u201d reads the caption on a post by HistoryVille, a Facebook account that highlights historical events, particularly in Nigeria.\n\nThe post has been liked more than a thousand times since being published on August 23, 2020. It emerged a few weeks after a page named George Udom published the same claim. The account was a key subject in this previous debunk by AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe claim has also circulated in Ghana and Nigeria since 2018. Online news sites GhanaWeb and Yabaleft published the same list purportedly released by Forbes.\n\nBut the claim is false; Forbes did not release any list on the 10 richest pastors in the world.\n\nAFP Fact Check traced the claim to a ranking of the world\u2019s richest pastors published by online lifestyle magazine Richest Lifestyle. Although the website is no longer accessible, a version is still available on the online archiving platform Wayback Machine.\n\nIn 2014, Richest Lifestyle published a list of the \u201ctop 10 richest pastors in the world\u201d, saying its ranking was based on information provided by the Celebrity Net Worth website and Forbes.\n\nThat article linked to this 2011 Forbes story about five of Nigeria\u2019s richest pastors. The Forbes journalist said the list was based on \u201cconservative estimates of their fortunes\u201d following an investigation of the \u201cassets of some of Nigeria\u2019s most prominent pastors\u201d.\n\nImportantly, Forbes does not list the world\u2019s richest pastors or compare the Nigerian preachers with their colleagues globally.\n\nForbes spokeswoman Laura Brusca told AFP Fact Check that the only ranking on its website to do with Nigerian pastors was the one from 2011. \u201cWe looked into this further. The only list on Forbes.com with this information is from 2011,\u201d said Brusca.\n\nForbes Africa managing editor Renuka Methil confirmed the website had not updated the list since then.\n\nNigeria is a religious country with several megachurches, where tens of thousands of worshippers gather. The actual net worth of pastors who lead the churches is a big topic in Africa\u2019s most populous country where half of the residents are living in extreme poverty, according to the world poverty clock.", "lang": "en"}
