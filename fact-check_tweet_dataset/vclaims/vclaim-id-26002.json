Shrapnel from the bomb \u2013 iron balls -- are presented by the investigator, Aleksandr Konoplya.\n\nThe segment\u2019s reporter, Alexander Rogatkin, said that the placement of the bomb would have necessitated the anteroom ceiling being taken down, requiring a ladder. That, coupled with the explosive device\u2019s connection to the electrical wiring, would, in his words, have had to been prepared \u201ccarefully\u201d and for \u201ca long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Konoplya, a man of Zakharchenko\u2019s height would have passed through the vestibule in \u201ctwo to three steps.\u201d That would have provided a very small window to carry out the strike. Konoplya therefore concluded Zakharchenko would have been under close surveillance, possibly from someone at the scene of the attack, with microphones or even video surveillance, leading to speculation that he was being monitored by the caf\u00e9\u2019s CCTV system.\n\nThe report notes that special services in the DNR have not provided footage of the bomb\u2019s installation itself.\n\nA man with a bag over his head is then presented for the cameras. The \u201csuspect,\u201d whom the report names as Oleksandr Pogorelov, is identified as the man who \u201cplanted the bomb\u201d that killed Sparta Batallion leader Arsen \u201cMotorola\u201d Pavlov in October 2016.\n\nPogorelov, in handcuffs, then goes on to show Rogatkin how he planted both the bomb and the camera in the elevator of Pavlov\u2019s apartment, as well as a device under the bathroom sink at Caf\u00e9 Pushkin during a \"foiled attempt\" on Zakharchenko\u2019s life in 2017. This alleged attempt on Zakharchenko\u2019s life has not been verified.\n\nPogorelov then describes how his \u201cKyivian curator Sergei\u201d had planned the operation at the Separatist Caf\u00e9 with another group.\n\n\u201c[The bomb] worked through an antenna, through a link that worked two kilometers away despite the interference of homes and other obstructions. Ideally, it worked perfectly without interference.\u201d\n\nHe added that, according to Sergei, the device was \u201can American production that was given by American intelligence.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Zakharchenko\u2019s convoy was equipped with a special radio-jamming system with a functional range of several dozen square meters. That further leads an anonymous DNR operational officer to conclude that \u201cthe devices were transferred from foreign intelligence.\u201d\n\nSeveral points of the report remain unclear.\n\nPogorelov was first arrested in 2017. The report never elucidates how an alleged agent, who claims to have been recruited by Ukrainian intelligence in 2014, would have operational knowledge of another group which carried out the assassination in late August of the following year. That his handler would divulge information on the equipment provided by a foreign intelligence service to another group carrying out another high-level attack many months down the line strains credulity.\n\nThere are also questions regarding the alleged remote control system used to detonate the device and claims of Zakharchenko having a special radio-jamming system. An unidentified female in Zakharchenko\u2019s entourage places a call on her cellphone the moment she steps out of the vehicle after the convoy pulls up to the caf\u00e9. She trails Zakharchenko by several feet, never putting the phone down, right up until the moment the bomb goes off.\n\nThe report makes no mention of how a person would be speaking via cellphone in the immediate vicinity of an engaged radio-jamming system.\n\n \n\n But even then, remotely detonated devices are by no means indicative of specially acquired Western equipment. Radio and mobile-phone detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are a staple of insurgent combatants the world over, and the Irish Republican Army managed infrared-light triggered IED\u2019s nearly three decades ago, which were later employed by insurgents in Iraq to circumvent radio jamming systems.\n\nBut if a member of Zakharchenko\u2019s entourage was able to use a cellphone when the attack took place, it follows that less sophisticated means of detonation would have been available.\n\nRegarding the explosive device itself, its 1.5 kilogram TNT equivalent and fragmentation presented in the video could just as well indicate a far less technologically advanced device like the Soviet manufactured MON-50 Claymore-shaped anti-personal mine. No evidence has been presented showing a highly-sophisticated bomb was used.\n\nIt also remains uncertain why no CCTV footage was available showing the \u201clong, careful\u201d installation of the bomb in the ceiling.\n\nBut blame for Ukrainian security services was almost a fait accompli.\n\nSergey Beseda, a high-ranking officer of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, pinned culpability on the SBU days after the bombing took place, before any such evidence would have been available.\n\nAs reported by RT, acting DNR head Denis Pushilin similarly claimed that DPR investigators had analyzed the remains of the explosive device that killed Zakharchenko, identifying technology that hadn\u2019t previously been used by the SBU.\n\nInterestingly, a number of Western ordnance specialists declined to comment for this article \u2013 no indication of fault since none of them appeared to be involved in Ukraine, though perhaps a signal of the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nOur conclusion: Russian media reports are inconclusive and only serve to raise more questions about the assassination of Zakharchenko", "lang": "en"}
