It is being called Ophiuchus and is believed to be associated with those being born between November 29 and December 15.\n\nMore such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Don\u2019t believe the FAKE news of Amitabh Bachchan being fully recovered\u2026\n\nWe fact-checked the claims and found them to be false.\n\nSince NASA has an active Twitter account, we first checked the claims on their official Twitter. We came across a tweet in which NASA refutes these claims.\n\nThe Tweet reads: We see your comments about a zodiac story that re-emerges every few years. No, we did not change the zodiac.\n\nWhen the Babylonians invented the constellations 3,000 years ago, they chose to leave out the 13th sign. So, we did the math.\n\nSince the NASA Tweet mentioned that this news resurfaces every few years, we Googled the keywords \u2018Ophiuchus\u2019 and came across the origin of this claim. It is listed in an article on Nasa.gov.\n\nIt explains the creation of the 12 zodiacs based on 12 constellations by the Babylonians and their decision to leave out the 13th zodiac because the 12 zodiacs fit their 12-month calendar. Hence, while there is a constellation named Ophiuchus, NASA has not linked it with the zodiac signs.\n\nHence, the claims of NASA creating the 13th zodiac are false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
