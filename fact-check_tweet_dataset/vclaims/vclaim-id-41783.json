This is a classic definition of fake news.\n\nOn April 21, under the banner headlines, \u201cBoko Haram leader Shekau says he\u2019s ready to surrender-Military,\u201d The Daily Times reported of Abubakar Shekau, leader of the notorious Islamic sect \u2013 Boko Hara\u2019s \u2013 alleged willingness to surrender. The report credits Major General John Enenche of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), as the source of its story.\n\nBoko Haram is responsible for many attacks in Nigeria, especially in the north. Recently, on the 21st of April, the Defence Headquarters informed the public of an airstrike on the terrorist group at their base in Borno state. Lafiya Dole, the frontline operational theatre in the campaign against the insurgents, reportedly destroyed the compound housing the terrorists in Sambisa Forest, Borno.\n\nBefore the operation, there has been news of surrender from some members of the sect. According to the military, \u2018Abubakar has been making frantic efforts to seek a soft landing as he prepares to surrender.\u2019 Nigerians have also been speaking loudly, advising the military on how to manage the presumed surrender. Fani Kayode, an opposition politician and one-time Minister of Aviation, is one of those who have so advised the federal government on what to do if he surrenders.\n\nSince the Daily Times published the report on the same day of the ambush; it lends basis to believe that it was the event that inspired the publication. The critical question, however, is whether Shekau made those comments about his readiness to surrender. Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe first striking thing about the story is the organisational structure and the apparent disconnect. While the headline of the publication suggests a statement made by Shekau- \u2018he is ready to surrender\u2019, the body of the text made inferences riddled with speculations- \u2018Shekau May soon surrender\u2019. Therefore, Dubawa recognises a case of a misleading headline, one of the strategies employed by fake-news purveyors.\n\nThe disconnect between headlines and body text is an essential strategy of purveyors of misinformation who struggle to cover their trails by omitting dates, regardless of the importance of periods to ascertain a story\u2019s authenticity. Case in point, this author mentioned a press briefing at Abuja, without giving the date of the conference.\n\nFurther research revealed a similar report in the Daily Post which rests its claims also on speculation. In this instance, however, it elucidates the phrase, \u201cmay surrender soon\u201d. The news platform claimed that the General made the statement upon reading the terrorist\u2019s \u2018body language\u2019 and from any verbal statement he made. In other words, the report resorted to an assumption as a basis for authenticating a report.\n\nAlso, the total absence of resonance from any credible news platform adds further scepticism to this claim; especially when you consider that this was to be a major story. If it were factual, it would capture the imagination of Nigerians, the sub-region and the international community. The fight against Boko Haram which entered its second decade this year is considered one of the most important security challenges in Africa today.", "lang": "en"}
