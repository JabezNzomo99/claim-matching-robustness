Bruecker analyzed 194,495 applications for teaching vacancies in public school districts between January and October of 2014. The data came from a job-application website, the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network, and included those newly entering the profession as well as existing teachers.\n\nEvers comment that \"less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin\" doesn\u2019t square with the study\u2019s findings.\n\nHere are some key findings from the study:\n\n-- 54 percent of prospective teachers did not apply for any vacancies in a rural school.\n\n-- 40 percent applied to multiple types of districts, including rural ones.\n\n-- Less than 5 percent applied only to rural vacancies.\n\nThat last conclusion reflects the claim made by Evers.\n\nBut if that fact is what he was thinking of, his claim didn\u2019t accurately reflect the report.\n\nLess than 5 percent of applicants applied exclusively to rural districts, but a total of 45 percent showed interest in rural vacancies.\n\nGoff said there is clearly an aversion to rural districts for many applicants. Another piece of evidence for that: The average applicant submits only 15 percent of their applications to rural vacancies.\n\nBut, \"applicant pools in rural districts don\u2019t look any different than applicant pools in urban areas or towns,\" Goff told us. They have the same number of applicants, on average, with similar levels of experience, certification, advanced degrees and competitiveness of undergraduate institution.\n\nEvers claimed a study of where teachers apply to work found that \"less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe study found that schools in cities, suburbs or towns all draw more interest than rural districts, but Evers badly overstated the case.", "lang": "en"}
