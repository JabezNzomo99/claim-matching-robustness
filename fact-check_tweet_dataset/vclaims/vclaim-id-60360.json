There are no recent news reports about such an incident.\n\nThe video's URL led to a YouTube video entitled \"Mumbai Girl molesting CCTV footage\" uploaded by the Youtube channel The Bakchod. It depicted a short film that made a commentary on molestation incidents \"inspired by some real life events.\"\n\nIt did not mention that the girl was a doctor nor that she was raped and killed by an unknown suspect. The channel uploads pranks and reaction videos, among others.\n\nGMA News did not publish any recent report on the rape-slay of a frontliner, nor did any other news outlet.\n\nEarlier, Rappler debunked a claim that an overseas Filipino worker who tested positive for coronavirus was raped by her employer's pet camel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sites that posted this claim made use of the same method of asking viewers to share the link before viewing the whole clip. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
