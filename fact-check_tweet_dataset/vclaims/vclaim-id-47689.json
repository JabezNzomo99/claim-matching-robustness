This is being shared in the backdrop of reports stating that India would be sending the drug to other countries to help tackle the Coronavirus outbreak. BOOM found that the original image is from a 2016 India Today article that shows protestors in Kashmir displaying Pakistan flag and banners demanding 'freedom'. The banner in the original picture reads, \"We Want Azadi\". BOOM had previously fact-checked the same image in June 2019, when it was earlier edited to falsely claiming that Pakistani cricket fans want Virat Kohli instead of Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
