At least 3 different pages and accounts were flagged. As of writing, these posts got over 5,500 combined shares, 2,600 comments, and 4,100 reactions.\n\nThe facts: Vice President Leni Robredo did not say the words attributed to her in the viral photos. She only questioned the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the available data on the number of drug users in the country because it is \u201cnot clear.\u201d\n\nRappler also reached out to the administrators of the page that shared the earliest post available to ask for the source of the quote but received no reply.\n\nDuring Robredo's first meeting with the members of ICAD on November 8, Robredo said in her opening statement: \u201cGusto ko pong malaman \u2018yung datos (I want to know the data). Kasi (Because) before today, I did not have access to the kind of data that you had access to.\u201d (READ: Robredo opens ICAD meet: The enemy is drugs, not people)\n\nWhen the Duterte government\u2019s campaign against illegal drugs started, Robredo said she was told there were 1.8 million drug users according to official data from the Dangerous Drugs Board. This increased to 4 million in 2017, according to Duterte himself. In February 2019, Duterte again claimed the number surged to 7 to 8 million.\n\nOn November 14, Robredo gave her first order to law enforcement agencies to complete the government\u2019s baseline data on the extent of illegal drugs in the country. Among the data she wants to see are exact figures on the number of arrested drug users and pushers since 2016, including those surrendered, along with the status of their cases.

An earlier claim spread that she banned police under ICAD from carrying firearms, to ensure that no suspect dies during anti-drug operations. This claim is also false. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
