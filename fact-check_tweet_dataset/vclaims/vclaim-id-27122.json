Insha Allah. May Allah keep everyone healthy and happy,\u201d and then moves on to recite what constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam \u2013 \u201cLa illaha illallah, Mohammed ur Rasul Allah.\u201d The video has been posted on several Facebook pages.\n\nBOOM analysed the video and found out that it is a part of a longer speech that Banerjee had delivered at the Maati Utsav in East Burdwan during the first week of January last year.\n\nBanerjee concluded her 25 minute-long speech by offering prayers to the major religions of Bengal.\n\nAt the 21.35 minute mark, Banerjee can be heard reciting the Ma Chandi mantra and the Durga Stotra \u2013 Sarba Mangala Mangalyay. She then moves on to Islam while praying for everyone\u2019s good health and prosperity to Allah. The part of the video which has been culled out and is being spread online is from 22.5 minutes mark. Banerjee then prays to god and asks him to \u2018bless all\u2019 and then chants the Khalsa prayer, Wahe Guru Ji Da Khalsa, Wahe Guru Di Fateh. At the end of the video, Banerjee says, \u201cSaare jahan se accha, Hindustan humara.\u201d\n\nThe Maati Utsav festival was started by the West Bengal government in 2013. Peasants and farmers are primarily awarded in this festival, which is held across several districts of the state.\n\nThis is not the first time that Banerjee\u2019s speech has been culled out of context to give it a communal narrative. During the United India Brigade Rally in January, a part of Banerjee\u2019s speech was highlighted from a TV grab, where she was seen praising Islam, and made viral. She spoke about other religions in that speech as well. Read about it here.", "lang": "en"}
