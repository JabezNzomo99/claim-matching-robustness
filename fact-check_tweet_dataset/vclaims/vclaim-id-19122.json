This video is being shared in the light of Indian Parliament\u2019s decision to revoke Article 370 that provided special provisions to the Jammu and Kashmir state. Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the video and also, the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nSince the revoke of Article 370, social media is flooded with many old, irrelevant videos and photographs attributing them to the present prevailing conditions in Kashmir. The above is also one such video.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes of it are obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe directs to a video link on YouTube. This video is same as the one posted on the Facebook and it had the title \u201cKashmir- Hundreds attend funeral of cop killed by militants\u201d. When looked for the timestamp, it was found to be uploaded on February 25, 2018. The video carried a description with it- \u201cHundreds of people mourned and joined the funeral procession of a policeman Farooq Ahmed of Keegam, Shopian who was shot dead by Militants at the residence of Hurriyat leader Fazal Haq Qureshi yesterday\u201d.\n\nA tweet in this regard by SP Vaid who was Chief of Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP) when that incident had occurred was found.\n\nSeveral newspaper reports corroborating with the description, seen below the Youtube video were also found, which can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old funeral procession video of a Kashmiri policeman is being shared with a false narrative.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
