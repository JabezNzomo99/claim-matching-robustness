Were tax dollars used to pay a manufacturer in China for the new fermentation tanks at Genesee Brewery?\n\nIn September 2016, New York state officials announced a $9.5 million investment to support the expansion at Genesee Brewery.\n\nThe state promised help from two programs: $4.5 million in tax credits from the Excelsior Jobs Program and up to $5 million from the governor\u2019s Upstate Revitalization Initiative.\n\nBut Genesee Brewery has not yet received any of that money from the state. The company must first meet criteria from the Empire State Development.\n\nThe brewery must create 128 full-time positions by 2020 to qualify for the $4.5 million in tax credits. Half of those jobs have to go to local residents in poverty based on criteria from the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative. The tax credits are spread out over ten years.\n\nThe $5 million from the Upstate Revitalization Initiative has strings attached, too. The brewery must invest $34 million in private money and create 13 full-time positions to receive the first $2 million of the grant. The other $3 million would be paid in four installments if the brewery maintains its hiring goals and consistently pays its property taxes.\n\nThe tanks are part of a three-phase upgrade at Genesee Brewery. The state incentives could reach $9.5 million. Genesee Brewery\u2019s corporate parent, North American Breweries, is spending $40 million.\n\nThe approximate cost of the tanks accounts for about 5 percent of the company's $40 million investment, the company said.\n\nThe brewery says its parent company paid for the tanks. The state also confirmed no state money was used.\n\n\"The bottom line is that while Feldmeier bid on a larger equipment package, the company declined (twice) to bid on the tanks in question and not one penny of State funds were spent on the equipment purchased by NAB, from China or elsewhere,\" Jason Conwall, an Empire State Development spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nA request for bids on the tanks went out in December 2015, the same month the Finger Lakes region was awarded $500 million in economic development money from the governor\u2019s Upstate Revitalization Initiative competition. The brewery\u2019s expansion was included in the region\u2019s pitch for the award but no dollar amount was announced until September 2016.\n\nGenesee Brewery signed a contract with Chinese manufacturer Lehui in June 2016 to begin the first phase of the project, a modernization of the brewery\u2019s equipment.\n\nGenesee Brewery has worked with Feldmeier Equipment since at least 2006 to manufacture equipment for the plant, including seven tanks in the last three years. When the bid for new fermentation tanks went out, Feldmeier put in a bid for a large part of the project instead of the whole project.\n\n\"Based on the timing for the project at the time, we placed a bid on the majority of it but not the entire project, just because of the timing,\" said Dave Pollock, vice president of sales for Feldmeier Equipment.\n\nNorth American Breweries said in its funding application to Empire State Development that no state money would be used to fund the first phase. The plan called for public funding in the second and third phases of the project, which include the construction of a business incubator, event space, solar panels and a learning center for tourists and brewers.\n\nThe brewery is still in the first phase of the project.\n\nBrindisi said \"state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China.\"\n\nThat may eventually be true. But it's not true now. The company has not received any state money yet.\n\nBrindisi also said New York state should support \"our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers' money right out the door to China.\"\n\nNo state money was used or will be used to buy twelve fermentation tanks from a Chinese manufacturer for Genesee Brewery. The brewery stands to eventually receive state money for other phases of the upgrade, but it must first meet investment and job creation targets.", "lang": "en"}
