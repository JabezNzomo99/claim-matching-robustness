This claim is false.\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here , here and here .\n\nAccording to a SpongeBob fandom page ( here ), iterations of SpongeBob\u2019s driver\u2019s license has appeared in eight episodes throughout the series: \"Sleepy Time\u201d (2000), \u201cNo Free Rides\u201d (2001), \u201cNautical Novice\u201d (2008), \u201cGone\u201d (2008), \u201cBumper to Bumper\u201d (2012), \u201cPatrick! The Game\u201d (2015), \u201cSpongeBob LongPants\u201d (2016), \u201cBurst Your Bubble\u201d (2017), and \u201cGirls\u2019 Night Out\u201d (2018). The address for his \u201cpineapple under the sea\u201d has consistently been \u201c124 Conch St., Bikini Bottom\u201d in each of these episodes.\n\nThe posts on social claim that \u201c124 Conch Street\u201d is the address of a theme park called \u201cLedges of Little St. James\u201d that is located on Little St. James. Dubbed \u201cPedophile Island\u201d and \u201cOrgy Island\u201d by locals and the media alike, the island, according to Epstein\u2019s accusers, was once a place where Epstein and his associates trafficked and sexually abused young women and girls.\n\nSocial media posts juxtapose SpongeBob\u2019s driver\u2019s license with a screenshot of a Google Maps entry for \u201cLedges of Little St. James,\u201d an alleged theme park located on the northern tip of Epstein\u2019s island, with the address \u201c124 conch street Bikini bottom, St Thomas 00802.\u201d One Facebook user sharing this post said, \u201call of these cartoons are tainted by pedophiles. our kids are not safe\u201d ( here ). Some iterations of the image, like this one here , include text that reads, \u201cWhy is Jeffrey Epstein sex traffic island address doing on SPONGEBOB. DO your research This is crazy\u2026 #savethekids #hollywoodisfullofpedophiles.\u201d\n\nIn January 2020, the U.S. Virgin Islands sued Epstein\u2019s estate, claiming that the late accused sex offender raped and trafficked dozens of young women and girls on a private Caribbean island he owned ( here ). The complaint filed by Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George significantly broadens the scope of the financier\u2019s alleged misconduct, saying it spanned from 2001 to 2018 and targeted girls who appeared to be as young as 11 or 12.\n\nThough a Google Maps search for \u201clittle st james theme park address,\u201d as seen in the posts, does not currently yield a result for SpongeBob\u2019s fictional address on Epstein\u2019s island, it may well have in the past. As explained here on the Help Center page for Google Maps, anyone can \u201cpublicly add places, like a business or landmark, to the map\u201d by searching for an address and clicking on the \u201cAdd a missing place\u201d option. It is likely that someone did this for \u201c124 Conch Street.\u201d\n\nSatellite and aerial images provided bit.ly/2By7kzS by Google Earth do not indicate the presence of a theme park on Little St. James, or at least not one located outdoors. Images published here by Reuters as well as 360-degree drone footage of Little St. James and neighboring Great St. James, provided here by the Miami Herald, suggest the same.\n\nFalse. The address seen on SpongeBob SquarePants\u2019s driver\u2019s license is not the address of a theme park located on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
