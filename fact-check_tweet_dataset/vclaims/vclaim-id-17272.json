Although the appeal was a somewhat fact-based one, the child has long since been found and safely returned to his home.\n\nHarrisburg television station WHP reported on 30 December 2016 that the boy seen in the photograph is actually 7-year-old Ariel Revello, noting that \u201cHe is NOT from Harrisburg and, most importantly, he is NOT missing.\u201d\n\nAriel Revello is actually from Connecticut and was the subject of an Amber Alert issued on 12 March 2016, when his father Rodolfo Revello allegedly took him (along with thousands of dollars in cash) after attacking Ariel\u2019s mother.\n\nThe boy was found later the same day at a relative\u2019s home after his father contacted police. Rodolfo Revello was arrested twelve days later in New York City and charged with assault and kidnapping.", "lang": "en"}
