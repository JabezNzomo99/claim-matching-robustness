Yet, the number this fourth grader came up with in 2011, as part of a personal environmental conservation campaign, has proved surprisingly durable, working its way to the heart of the debate over plastic straws.\n\n\u201cIt is honestly a little surprising,\u201d said Mr. Cress, who turned 17 on Thursday. \u201cI came up with this statistic because I couldn\u2019t find anything else about it. If there are other statistics on how many straws we use that are based on more rigorous research than the research that I did, I\u2019m happy to embrace those.\u201d\n\nFact check: The claim that 500 million straws are used by Americans is an estimate above the ranges of more rigorous studies. Market research firms put the figure between 170 million and 390 million per day, or 63 billion to 142 billion straws per year.\n\nOne market research firm, Freedonia Group, determined that the nation used about 390 million straws a day last year. Another, Technomic, puts the number closer to 170 million, though that count excludes some types of straws.\n\nBut Mr. Cress, who then lived in Burlington, Vt., had access to neither of those figures when he developed his estimate in 2011, when he started \u201cBe Straw Free,\u201d a campaign to persuade restaurants to offer straws optionally rather than automatically.\n\nAfter failing to find reliable statistics online about straw usage, he decided to call a handful of manufacturers himself.\n\n\u201cThe average of those was 500 million,\u201d he said, adding that, being 9, he had not thought to document the process closely. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the number has changed since then, and I would hope that the number has gone down.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
