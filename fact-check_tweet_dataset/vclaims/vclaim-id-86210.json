But he repeatedly twisted it to say it was the \u201chighest murder rate\u201d in 45 years.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as month over month or year over year,\u201d we noted at the time. \u201cAn annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, the nation\u2019s violent crime rate peaked at 758 violent crimes for every 100,000 people. Since that point, violent crime across the country has declined. In fact, in 2015, the violent crime rate was lower than it has been in almost 45 years, and lower than it has been for most of the 2000s save for 2013 and 2014. The violent crime rate increased in 2016, but it was still lower than any year between 1970 and 2013. And while Trump brags about the rate in 2017, the rate was not significantly different than 2016 \u2014 a decline of less than one percent.\n\nIn other words, this is exactly the statistical noise that researchers warned about in 2016. There may have been a one- or two-year increase, but so far the long-term trend appears to be continuing.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, in a June 2018 report, noted the increase in crime rates in 2015 and 2016 and said: \u201cViolent crime rates, even after accounting for the recent increases, remain near historical lows \u2026 While there were increases in violent crime (particularly homicides) in some cities, these increases are not indicative of a sweeping national crime wave.\u201d\n\nThe report said that the recent spike reflected a pattern seen before: \u201cEven though violent crime and homicide rates have generally declined since the early 1990s, there were years when either one or both increased, before resuming the long-term decline in subsequent years. For example, the national violent crime rate increased from 2004 to 2005 and again from 2005 to 2006 before declining nearly every year thereafter.\u201d\n\nThe murder rate was Trump\u2019s particular focus during the president campaign. Note that, when speaking to the conference, he touted a six percent decline in the rate \u201cin America\u2019s largest cities.\u201d That parsing was necessary because the overall murder rate has barely changed under Trump, going from 5.4 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 5.3 in 2017, or a decline of 1.4 percent. Like the 2016 rate, the 2017 murder rate was the highest since 2008 \u2014 but it\u2019s still better than any year between 1965 and 2009.\n\nLeft unsaid by Trump is that one of the cities with the biggest decline in murders in 2017 was Chicago, with an 18 percent decline in the murder rate, according to calculations by the Brennan Center of New York University. All throughout that year, Trump attacked Chicago for the number of murders.\n\nThere\u2019s another survey \u2014 an annual survey of more than 90,000 households conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics \u2014 which asks Americans whether they have been victims of crime. But that survey simply reaffirms the FBI data. \u201cUsing the FBI numbers, the violent crime rate fell 49 percent between 1993 and 2017,\u201d said a Pew Research Study note. \u201cUsing the BJS data, the rate fell 74 percent during that span.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the long-term trends appear to be holding, and, contrary to Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, the United States was not in the middle of a crime wave before he took office. Since 1991, the murder rate has generally gone down, accounting for yearly fluctuations.\n\nTrump tends to act as if everything started anew when he became president. The crime rate is something largely beyond a president\u2019s control, at least in the short term, reflecting societal, economic and demographic factors. There\u2019s been a small decline \u2014 as we suggested was probable in 2016 \u2014 but it\u2019s simply false to claim it\u2019s \u201cthe first time in a long while.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
