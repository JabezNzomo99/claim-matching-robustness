They were actually displayed in June 2015, marking the Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming same-sex marriage:\n\n\u201cI had a chance to do the Rose Garden celebration of the court decision around same-sex marriage,\u201d the president told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cI did not have a chance to comment on how good the White House looked in rainbow colors. That made it a really good week. To see people gathered in an evening outside on a beautiful summer night, and to feel whole, and to feel accepted, and to feel that they had a right to love, that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe image showing the American flag displayed on the White House is a hoax that first appeared in June 2015, shortly after the White House was lit up in the aforementioned rainbow display. The web site Zwinglius Redivivus was one of the pages that shared the doctored image in an article calling on President Obama to light up the White House with patriotic colors, not rainbows:\n\nThis American flag display is a digitally altered image based on a 2007 photograph bathed in a plain white light. For comparison, here is the altered image (left) and the original image (right):\n\n\n\n Although this American flag display is fake, the White House was truly dressed up in red, white, and blue over the July Fourth weekend in 2017:\n\nThe White House is lit with various colors to mark different occasions throughout the year. President Donald Trump lit the White House blue to commemorate Peace Officers Memorial Day in May 2017. Similarly, President Obama lit the White House pink for breast cancer awareness month.\n\nThis meme gives the impression that the White House was never lit red, white and blue during President Obama\u2019s administration, which is demonstrably not true; in November 2014, the White House was illuminated red, white and blue for an event called \u201cSalute to the Troops: In Performance at the White House\u201d.\n\nFurther, the Obama administration typically held large July Fourth celebrations with fireworks and musical performances, and did light up the White House in patriotic colors. However, we could not find a photograph of the White House lit up red, white, and blue on that exact date during Obama\u2019s administration.", "lang": "en"}
