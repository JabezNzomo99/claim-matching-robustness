The video was posted on what appears to be a fake news website that has no apparent affiliation with WGN America.\n\nChapman, known as the star of reality television show \u201cDog the Bounty Hunter,\u201d learned in September on an episode of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d that he was suffering from a pulmonary embolism, according to the Denver Post.

He Didn\u2019t Survive His Second Attack. He Was 66.\u201d It also includes doctored footage of CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d anchor John Berman reporting on \u201cterribly sad news.\u201d\n\nHowever, the video appears nowhere on the WGN America website nor on the network\u2019s social media accounts.

He took to Instagram Nov. 20 to dispel rumors of his death, posting a picture of himself holding an \u201cI\u2019m Alive\u201d sign and a copy of the Denver Post.\n\nChapman\u2019s wife, Beth, died of throat cancer in June, according to CNN.", "lang": "en"}
