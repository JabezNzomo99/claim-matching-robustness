Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi \u2014 over funding for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\nMeanwhile, on social media, a quote about the wall falsely attributed to Pelosi made the rounds yet again.\n\n\u201cBuilding a Wall will violate the rights of millions of illegals,\u201d reads the purported quote, featured in a meme shared in numerous Facebook posts. The meme doubles down by adding: \u201cYes, she actually said that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. We could find no record of Pelosi ever making that statement, which has circulated for months \u2014 despite previous fact-checking efforts by Snopes, PolitiFact and the Weekly Standard.\n\nPelosi has indeed bristled at Trump\u2019s demand for a border wall, including in the Oval Office meeting Tuesday. It\u2019s a posture she\u2019s long maintained.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats do not support the wall,\u201d Pelosi said in a 2017 NBC interview. She called the wall \u201cimmoral, expensive, unwise\u201d \u2014 a sentiment she echoed at a recent news conference.\n\n\u201cWe, most of us, speaking for myself, consider the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive,\u201d she said at her Dec. 6 press conference.\n\nBut there is no evidence Pelosi \u2014 who appears likely to return to the role of House speaker when Democrats assume control of the chamber in January \u2014 said it would \u201cviolate the rights of millions of illegals.\u201d\n\nTrump has insisted that the government\u2019s next funding package should include $5 billion for the wall.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nDaly, Matthew. \u201cPelosi takes hard line on paying for Trump\u2019s border wall.\u201d Associated Press. 6 Dec 2018.", "lang": "en"}
