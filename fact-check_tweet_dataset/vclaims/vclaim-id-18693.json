Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Image of the house of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Kashmir. Fact: The image shared as the house of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Kashmir is actually that of \u2018Hotel Taj Vivanta Dal\u2019 in Srinagar. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo in the tweet is subjected to Google Reverse Image Search technique, search results obtained said it to be \u2018Hotel Taj Vivanta Dal\u2019 in Srinagar.\n\nInformation from the Taj Vivanta hotels website confirmed its presence in Kashmir with the name \u2018Hotel Taj Vivanta Dal\u2019. On the hotel\u2019s website, many photos of that hotel can be seen but the particular photo used in the tweet wasn\u2019t found.\n\nOn the further search, that photo of the hotel was found in an article of \u2018Greater Kashmir\u2019. From the article, it was found that the photo is of \u2018Hotel Taj Vivanta Dal\u2019 in Srinagar. The photo gallery of \u2018Hotel Taj Vivanta Dal\u2019 on Google maps has that photo and this can be seen here.\n\nTo conclude, the building in the image is not the house of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Kashmir. It is the Taj Vivanta hotel in Srinagar.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
