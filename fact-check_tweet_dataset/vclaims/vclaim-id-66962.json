Doug Collins claimed in a tweet that Sen. Kelly Loeffler has a \"long history of donating to abortion-on-demand Democrats.\"\n\nCollins has a point. Over a period of years, Loeffler has made campaign contributions to Democrats who support abortion rights.\n\nBut the vast majority of her campaign cash has been given to Republicans, and she has been endorsed by major anti-abortion groups.\n\nTheir race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.\n\nThe special election \u2014 open to candidates from all parties, including the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the leading Democratic candidate \u2014 is being held to fill the seat held by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in December with health problems. Loeffler was appointed to the seat on an interim basis.\n\nGeorgia is unique in this cycle in that both of its Senate seats are being contested on Nov. 3. If none of the 21 candidates in the special election gets at least 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held Jan. 5.\n\nTo some, the term \"abortion on demand\" might suggest abortion at any time under any circumstances; but the common definition is much different.\n\nCollins\u2019 campaign cited three dictionary definitions of abortion on demand. Each says:\n\u2022 \"The right of a woman to have an abortion during the first six months of a pregnancy.\n\u2022 \"An abortion performed on a woman solely at her own request.\"\n\nTo back Collins\u2019 claim, his campaign cited campaign contributions Loeffler made herself as well as contributions from the political action committee of the company Intercontinental Exchange, where her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is CEO. ICE is the publicly traded parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nCollins\u2019 campaign cited Federal Election Commission records showing a total of $13,100 in donations made by Loeffler nine or more years ago \u2014 from 2006 to 2011 \u2014 to congressional campaigns for six Democrats, all of whom support abortion rights.\n\nWe found that each of the Democrats had received high ratings from NARAL (formerly the National Abortion Rights Action League) Pro-Choice America.\n\u2022 Says the Atlanta mayor is \u201cshutting the city down for\u201d the NBA All-Star Game weekend.\n\nCollins also cited $69,000 in donations made from 2011 to 2019, but not by Loeffler herself. They were made by the political action committee for her husband\u2019s company, Intercontinental Exchange, to five Democrats who support abortion rights.\n\nThere is no indication, however, that these donations were made because of the individual lawmakers\u2019 stances on abortion.\n\nLoeffler gives more to Republicans\n\nLoeffler\u2019s campaign responded by claiming that nearly 99% of nearly $2 million in political contributions made by Loeffler have gone to anti-abortion candidates.\n\nThe data does indicate the vast majority of Loeffler\u2019s contributions have been to Republicans:\n\u2022 Since 2006, of the more than $2 million in political contributions made by Loeffler, $16,600 has gone to Democrats or liberal causes, according to data the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics provided PolitiFact.\n\u2022 Of the $3.2 million Loeffler and her husband have given to political committees, less than 3% went to Democratic candidates and causes, the center reported in December.\n\nMoreover, Loeffler can point to anti-abortion credentials.\n\nRepublican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December chose Loeffler over Collins, who had been recommended by President Donald Trump, to replace Isakson. Kemp said Loeffler would \"defend life against the radical left's abortion-on-demand agenda.\"\n\nLoeffler also has been endorsed in the special election by the National Right to Life Committee and other anti-abortion groups.\n\nCollins claimed his fellow Republican Loeffler has a \"long history of donating to abortion-on-demand Democrats.\"\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, Loeffler personally gave a total of $13,100 in campaign donations to six Democrats who support abortion rights. The political action committee of her husband\u2019s company has also donated to a handful of Democrats more recently, but these contributions did not come from Loeffler.\n\nOverall, only a tiny fraction of the campaign contributions made by Loeffler have gone to Democrats, and she has won endorsements from major anti-abortion groups.", "lang": "en"}
