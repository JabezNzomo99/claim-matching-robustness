The camera then pans to a man graffitiing \u2018BLM\u2019 on the side of a building.\n\n\u201cThe cenotaph, London. Defaced as they police simply watch,\u201d the caption of one such post reads.\n\nThe building the man is filmed graffitiing is the UK government\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, not the Cenotaph memorial (tinyurl.com/ya4lo5u2) .\n\nCity of Westminster Police said on Twitter: \u201cWe are aware of incorrect social media rumours of damage being caused to the Cenotaph during protests in #Whitehall. We are not aware of any damage.\u201d (here)\n\nThis corresponds with a YouTube video that is described as showing the Cenotaph after the protests. In the video, the \u2018BLM\u2019 graffiti is seen on the Foreign Office building, but the Cenotaph appears unmarked. The video was uploaded on June 4 and has a caption stating it was filmed the morning after the protests (here) .\n\nA separate video posted to social media by a radio journalist on the afternoon of June 3 shows protesters gathered around the base of the Cenotaph, with one protester standing between the flags on the memorial itself (here) .\n\nFurther protests happened in London over the weekend of June 6 and 7. On June 6, a radio reporter posted an image showing the Cenotaph had been daubed with graffiti (here) and Forces News ran a report on June 8 about the subsequent cleaning of the memorial (here).\n\nFalse. The Cenotaph was not defaced during an anti-racism protest in London on June 3.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
