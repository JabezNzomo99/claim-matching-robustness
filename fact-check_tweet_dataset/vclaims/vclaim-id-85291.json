However, the oldest instance we found dates back to 2016.\n\nIt was uploaded by a user on November 24, 2016, with the caption, \u201cAs the heinous CrimesAgainstWomen r increasing everyday, what @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @CPDelhi is doing?! @DaminiAndolan.\u201d\n\nWhile Alt News could not establish the origin of the photograph, its existence since at least 2016 is proof that it cannot be representative of an incident that took place amidst recent anti-CAA protests in West Bengal.\n\nThe image and the accompanying false claim was shared by Anima Sonkar who identifies herself on Twitter as Delhi state joint secretary of ABVP.\n\nThe post is viral across social media platforms \u2013 Facebook, Twitter.\n\nIt has also found its way on Instagram.", "lang": "en"}
