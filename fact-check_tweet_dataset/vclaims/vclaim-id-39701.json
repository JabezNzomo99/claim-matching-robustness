The Facebook post, which distinguishes Republicans from Democrats in a series of statements, seems to resemble the format of these popular jokes. (RELATED: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?)\n\nYet, while Foxworthy has supported at least one Republican political candidate in the past, there is no evidence that the comedian made this series of statements. A search of his verified social media accounts didn\u2019t turn up any matches, except for a 2013 Facebook post debunking the attribution.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a post going around with my name on it,\u201d wrote Foxworthy on Facebook. \u201cI would just like to clear the air and say it was not created by me. It is nothing close to my beliefs and someone just slapped my name on it.\u201d\n\nThe series of statements, debunked by Snopes in 2013, has been circulating online since at least 2010, when someone posted it without attribution in the comments section of an article on an educational website.", "lang": "en"}
