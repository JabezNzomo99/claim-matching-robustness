The latest post claims the worker is a South African Airways (SAA) employee, when in fact she is a member of ground crew in Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines apologised for the worker\u2019s conduct.\n\nA tweet identifying the woman as a South African Airways employee shared the video on November 28, 2019 in an overtly racial context. We\u2019ve archived the post, which was shared more than 200 times, here. The caption reads: \u201cBLACK South African woman at South African Airlines destroying luggage of flight passengers! Boikot SAA!!!! SAA is a racist BBBEE Enterprise and their workers are disrespectful!\u201d\n\nBBBEE stands for Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment and is a policy position of the South African government to ensure economic opportunities are afforded to black-owned businesses as redress for apartheid.\n\nBut the term has been incorrectly used in this tweet. South Africa Airlines is a state-owned enterprise, as it was during apartheid. While affirmative action policies are applicable to all employers when it comes to hiring, including the airline, a \u201cBBBEE enterprise\u201d would refer to a black-owned business receiving preferential access to contracts or tenders.\n\nTo locate the origin of the video, AFP used online search tool InVid, which creates screenshots and then scours Google for similar images. The result was matched to a 2018 article on Britain\u2019s Daily Mail website detailing how reporter Vanessa Marsh tweeted to Hawaiian Air on May 10, 2018 about her flight from Honolulu to Phoenix, with the same video attached.\n\nThe airline quickly replied to Marsh\u2019s tweet, saying the employee's behaviour was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and that they would be \"addressing the situation\".\n\nNumerous reports, including here and here, covered the incident at the time.\n\nThe same video can be found posted here and here on Facebook, shared hundreds of thousands of times. Neither post links the handler to a specific airline.\n\nOher social media users shared the footage, either blaming South Africa Airlines or questioning whether the employee in the video really worked for the company.\n\nSouth African Airlines spokesman Tlali Tlali said the company's employees do not handle passengers\u2019 luggage beyond the check-in counters, where they are weighed, tagged and released through the automated conveyor belt for screening and loading onto the aircraft.\n\nAccredited companies are responsible for screening and loading bags onto the plane, as well as offloading them from the plane onto carousels upon landing, he told AFP via email.\n\n\"We are satisfied that this has nothing to do with SAA or any of its service providers responsible for ground handling,\" he said.\n\nTlali said staff for the three service providers contracted to SAA in South Africa do not wear the same uniform as the woman in the video, and that the chute alongside the plane is unlike the automated conveyor belts used in South Africa.", "lang": "en"}
