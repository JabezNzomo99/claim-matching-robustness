The controversial visit by several Members of European Parliament (MEPs) to Kashmir and their meeting with PM Modi is linked to a network of 265 fake local media sites run by an Indian influence group, uncovered a European NGO that researches disinformation campaigns. The report by EU Disinfo Lab states, \u201cOver 265 fake local news sites in more than 65 countries are managed by an Indian influence network.\u201d The report states that the fake media outlets have ties to a large network of think tanks, NGOs and companies from the Srivastava Group, the same group that had come under scrutiny over the Modi-MEPs meet. Who Is \u2018Business Broker\u2019 Madi Sharma, Organiser of Modi-MEPs Meet?\n\nThe IP address of the Srivastava Group is also home to the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies (IINS), the organisation that reportedly sponsored the visits of the MEPs to India to meet Modi. That the IINS was going to sponsor the MEPs trip was mentioned by meet organiser Madi Sharma in her invitation emails to the MEPs. The same IP address is also home to the obscure online media house, \u2018New Delhi Times\u2019. A screenshot of the invitation sent out to the Members of European Parliament by Madi Sharma mentions that IINS would sponsor the MEPs\u2019 visit.\n\nWHAT DID THE NETWORK OF FAKE MEDIA OUTLETS PUBLISH? The report by EU Disinfo Lab states that through the content on the sites, it is evident that this network was \u201cdesigned to influence the EU and the UN by repeatedly criticising Pakistan.\u201d According to the Lab, the network of fake media outlets serve lobbying interests directed at the European Union and the United Nations \u2013 all achieved while providing extensive visibility to certain former MEPs and MPs. HOW DID EU DISINFO LAB ASCERTAIN THAT THE MEDIA OUTLETS ARE FAKE? Speaking to The Quint, Alexandre Alaphilippe of EU Disinfo Lab explains how they ascertained that the media outlets are fake.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have no editors, no original content and are not quoted outside this network. They also present themselves as legitimate newspapers (which they are not). And they are coordinately pushing all the same content at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe sites run by the Indian influence group posed as local news sites in places across the world, with site names such as newyorkmorningtelegraph.com, thedublingazette.com and timesofportugal.com. However, the main focus of these sites was to post content critical of Pakistan, with a concentration of content on Pakistan\u2019s role in the Kashmir conflict, their treatment of minorities within the country, as well as other India-related matters. \u201cOver 265 fake local news sites in more than 65 countries are managed by an Indian influence network,\u201d says the EU Disinfo Lab report.\n\nThe EU Disinfo Lab is an NGO \u201cfocused on researching and tackling sophisticated disinformation campaigns targeting the EU, its member states, core institutions and core values.\u201d The Lab used Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to trace the links between the various news outlets on the network. It started with digging into a site by the name of eptoday.com. \u201cIn early October, the European External Action Service\u2019s East StratCom (the EU Disinformation Task Force) revealed that \u2013 eptoday.com \u2013 the website of a self-proclaimed magazine for the European Parliament in Brussels \u2013 had been re-publishing a large amount of news directly from Russia Today and Voice of America. Among this syndicated content, we unexpectedly found a large number of articles and op-eds related to minorities in Pakistan as well as other India-related matters.\u201d EU DisinfoLab discovered that EP Today is managed by Indian stakeholders, with ties to a large network of think tanks, NGOs and companies from the Srivastava Group.\n\nThat, in turn, led them to come across timesofgeneva.com \u2013 an online \u201cnewspaper\u201d that is \u201capproaching 35 years in business\u201d. This \u2018publication\u2019 also \u201cpublishes the same type of content as EP Today and produces videos covering events and demonstrations criticising Pakistan\u2019s role in the Kashmir conflict.\u201d Next, the Lab \u201cfound hard evidence that both EP Today and Times of Geneva have extremely strong ties with a network of NGOs and think tanks.\u201d There were links between website registration addresses, email addresses and domain names. Digging further into the links led the team at EU Disinfo Lab to 4newsagency.com, another site which brands itself as a \u201csynergy between 4 news agencies from Switzerland, Belgium, Thailand, and Abu Dhabi (UAE)\u201d, with \u201cteams located in 100 countries\u201d. And then came the final, massive step. The report recounts, \u201cTipped off by 4newsagency.com itself, and by the presence of Canadian and American (now offline) NGOs and think tanks on the same servers as EP Today and Srivastava Group, we discovered an additional network of over 265 resurrected media in more than 65 countries, following a similar modus operandi.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
