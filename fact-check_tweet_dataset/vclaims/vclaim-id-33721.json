AFP Factcheck found that some of Anez's tweets do appear to have been deleted.\n\nMultiple tweets and Facebook posts highlighting anti-indigenous statements from Anez have surfaced online since the deputy Senate speaker proclaimed herself interim president of Bolivia on November 12, 2019.\n\nSome of the purported statements were translated into English and shared on social media in North America.\n\nThis Facebook post is captioned: \"Here's new Christian fundamentalist Bolivia President Jeanine Anez calling the Aymara people (42% of the population) and their practices 'satanic'\".\n\nThe Facebook post shares a screenshot of a purported tweet by Anez denigrating the indigenous Aymara nation\u2019s New Year celebration, calling it \u201csatanic\u201d and adding that \u201cnobody can replace God.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Aymara people make up 41 percent of Bolivia\u2019s population, including former president Evo Morales. They celebrate the new year on June 21 of each year, marking the beginning of a new agricultural cycle.\n\nAnez did post a tweet on June 20, 2013, on the eve of the Aymara celebration, which was later deleted. The tweet is still available on the online archiving platform Wayback Machine.\n\nAnez referred to the Aymara New Year in another tweet on December 31, 2016, stating: \u201cThose who celebrate the Aymara New Year in whatever month, I don\u2019t want to see them drunk tomorrow saying \u2018Happy New Year\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnother purported tweet from Anez was shared widely on English-language social media, with some Western media relaying it.\n\nFor example, this tweet posted on November 13, 2019 says: \"She previously tweeted (since deleted): 'I dream of a Bolivia free of indigenous satanic rites, the city is not a place for Indians, they must go to the highlands or lowlands!' This racist sentiment towards Evo Morales & Bolivia's majority indigenous is a huge part of the #coup.\"\n\nThe tweet shared a purported screenshot of an April 14, 2013, tweet by Anez saying: \u201cI dream of a Bolivia free of satanic indigenous rites, the city is not a place for indians, they must go to the highlands or the plains.\u201d\n\nAn identical screenshot is used in all Facebook and Twitter publications that include this tweet, always with the same amount of likes and retweets. The profile photo for the tweet is also the same across social media publications, which is the one the politician had before proclaiming herself interim president.\n\nAFP Fact Check accessed the Bolivian president\u2019s tweet capture history, on Wayback Machine and found no record of this publication. An advanced search on Google does not show any signs of it either. We cannot be sure this tweet was ever published.\n\nIn a now deleted October 5, 2019 tweet, Anez called the then president of Bolivia Evo Morales a \u201cpoor indian\u201d \u201cclinging to power,\u201d alongside a cartoon of the politician hanging on to a throne, with the message \u201clast days in power\u201d added in yellow letters.\n\nAn AFP journalist made a capture of the tweet on Anez\u2019s account minutes before it was deleted. It is also available on Wayback Machine.\n\nAlthough AFP Fact Check did not find any English version of this tweet either, a screenshot of it was viral on Spanish-language social media.\n\nIn it, Anez doubted whether the people who appear in the photo above with shoes on were indeed native people. Though the tweet, originally published on November 6, was later deleted, it remains available on Wayback Machine and Google advanced search.\n\nFollowing questionning regarding her Twitter activity, Anez denied on November 15 that she had written \"ill-intentioned\" tweets and accused Morales' ex-government of resorting to \"digital warriors\" in order to falsify social media accounts.\n\n\"I've seen a couple of tweets that I never wrote and that we already stated were false,\" Anez said during a press conference, without specifying which tweets she was referring to.\n\nAnez proclaimed herself acting president on Tuesday, November 12, the day after former president Evo Morales fled the country for Mexico, fearing for his safety amid deadly protests.", "lang": "en"}
