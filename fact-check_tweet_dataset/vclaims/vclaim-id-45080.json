Antifa isn\u2019t one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\n\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowell\u2019s School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. \u201cSo, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law \u2018proving beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 an individual was a member of ANTIFA.\u201d\n\nAs far as we know, antifa doesn\u2019t have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there haven\u2019t been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 a designation the U.S. government does make \u2014 is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\n\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\n\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa \u201cand the Radical Left,\u201d as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or \u201coutsiders\u201d generally. \u201cThe violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups,\u201d the president said on May 30.\n\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about \u201cdesignating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no legal process or meaning\u201d for what the president said, Patel told us. \u201cHe\u2019s reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n\n\u201c[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding \u2018Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries\u2019, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism,\u201d Forest told us. \u201cAs an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019 because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.\u201d\n\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would \u201cundoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the \u201cfederal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. \u201cSuch a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups,\u201d the CRS report said.\n\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Center\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s national security project director, made similar statements to the press. \u201cNo current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns,\u201d McCord said.\n\nWe asked the White House about the president\u2019s tweet but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nOn the same day as Trump\u2019s statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: \u201cThe violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s language isn\u2019t an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI \u201chas long history of targeting protest groups\u201d and said she would be \u201cvery worried\u201d that by targeting antifa, an \u201camorphous term,\u201d the Justice Department \u201cwould actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.\u201d\n\nThe CRS report said that while there\u2019s no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI \u201chave publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threats\u2014such as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremism\u2014without illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.\u201d\n\nForest said the \u201ccourt cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al \u2013 but not \u2018domestic terrorism\u2019.\u201d The language about such \u201cthreats\u201d can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. \u201cTechnically, the FBI can\u2019t really gain any law enforcement tools it didn\u2019t already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat,\u201d Forest said.\n\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a \u201cthreat\u201d was \u201cmostly language\u201d but \u201ccould also reflect what resources\u201d they\u2019re going to devote to an issue. \u201cWhen we call something terrorism,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re suggesting it\u2019s something very serious.\u201d\n\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\n\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\n\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies\u2019 Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that \u201cdesignation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies.\u201d But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism \u2014 just as it\u2019s a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization \u2014 \u201cdoes not raise the same concerns.\u201d\n\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was \u201cboth unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence,\u201d Patel said.\n\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we haven\u2019t received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didn\u2019t know who was behind it.\n\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was \u201cnow confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\u201d\n\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there aren\u2019t enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n\n\u201c[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity,\u201d Bray said.\n\n\u201cBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe it\u2019s true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. I\u2019m also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barr\u2019s statement that \u201cit appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics,\u201d said \u201cthe truth is nobody really knows.\u201d He said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 31 that there had been \u201cvery suspicious behavior,\u201d including \u201ccars with no license plates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,\u201d Ellison said.\n\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. \u201cWe\u2019re working to get to the bottom of that right now,\u201d Carter said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked,\u201d Bottoms said on the same show. \u201cAnd it was \u2014 it was just\u2013 it was a different group. So we don\u2019t know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
