On average, a woman is murdered every three hours in the country.\n\nBut is the president correct about the percentage of South African women who experience violence at the hands of a partner? We investigated.\n\nThe World Health Organization, or WHO, defines \u201c\n\n\u201d as \u201cbehaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm\u201d. It includes physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviour.\n\nis a senior research fellow of the Justice and Violence Prevention Programme at the\n\nin Pretoria, South Africa. She told Africa Check risk factors like food insecurity, lower levels of education, substance abuse and childhood abuse can be linked to intimate partner violence.\n\n\u201cIf you witness domestic violence as a child in your home you are much more likely to go on to either be the victim of domestic violence in your own relationships later in life or to be a perpetrator of domestic violence,\u201d Gould said.\n\nWe contacted the president\u2019s office to ask for the sources of the claim. They provided four studies, the most recent of which was published nine years ago, in 2011. They were also all localised and did not provide data for the whole of South Africa.\n\u2022 None showed that between 19.1% and 28.4% of women in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces reported ever being abused.\n\u2022 None of girls and women attending antenatal clinics in Soweto, a region of Johannesburg, found that 55.5% of participants reported having been physically and/or sexually assaulted by a male partner in their lives.\n\u2022 None of sexually active girls and women aged 15 to 26 in the Eastern Cape found that 26.6% of respondents reported experiencing more than one episode of physical or sexual intimate partner violence. \n\n\n\n\n\nsent to Africa Check that most closely matches the President\u2019s claim is from 2011. It was conducted by women\u2019s rights organisation\n\nIt found that 51.3% of women in Gauteng province reported experiencing either emotional, physical, sexual and/or economic violence in their lifetime.\n\nis a specialist researcher at the council\u2019s gender and health research unit and worked on the study. She told Africa Check that the study\u2019s findings could not be applied outside of Gauteng.\n\n\u201cThe danger with generalising to the rest of South Africa is that the rest of South Africa is not like Gauteng,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might find there is a variation between what you might see in the Western Cape, for example.\u201d\n\nThe most recent data on the topic comes from the 2016\n\n. It\u2019s a nationally representative household survey, which provides data on a wide range of topics, such as population, health and nutrition.\n\nThe survey looked at physical, sexual and emotional violence. It found that\n\nwho had ever had a partner had experienced one or more of these forms of violence. Physical violence was the most common form of violence experienced by women, at 21%. This was followed by emotional violence (17%) and sexual violence (6%).\n\nrespondents reported experiencing one or more form of violence. In the Eastern Cape,\n\nWomen were asked if their partners ever did the following:\n\n\n\nPhysical violence : push you, shake you, or throw something at you; kick you, drag you, or beat you up; try to choke you or burn you on purpose; or threaten or attack you with a knife, gun, or any other weapon. \n\n\n\nSexual violence : physically force you to have sexual intercourse with him even when you did not want to, physically force you to perform any other sexual acts you did not want to, or force you with threats or in any other way to perform sexual acts you did not want to. \n\n\n\nEmotional violence : say or do something to humiliate you in front of others, threaten to hurt or harm you or someone close to you, or insult you or make you feel bad about yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\nExperts said it was not easy to conduct research on intimate partner violence, as it could be a difficult issue to discuss with women.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very careful when you\u2019re doing research on a subject like this because you don\u2019t want to put the person who you\u2019re interviewing at risk,\u201d said Gould. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of research you can do every day or even every year.\u201d\n\nThere was also limited research on interpersonal violence that included economic abuse. Shai explained that this is when \u201cmen deprive women of access to income and use finances to control women\u201d.\n\nConclusion: About 26% of women report experiencing violence from partners\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa claimed that \u201cas much as 51% of South African women have experienced violence at the hands of someone with whom they are in a relationship\u201d.\n\nThe presidency provided Africa Check with a number of studies to support his claim, all of which were not nationally representative.\n\nThe most recent, nationally representative data is from 2016. It shows that 26% of women reported physical, sexual or emotional abuse by their partners in their lifetime. We, therefore, rate the president\u2019s claim incorrect.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that intimate partner violence statistics can be difficult to compile. There is also limited data available on economic abuse. Accurate information on this topic is vital in order to understand this serious issue and devise solutions.", "lang": "en"}
