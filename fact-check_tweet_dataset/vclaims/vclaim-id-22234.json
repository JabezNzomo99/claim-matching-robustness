Facebook users recently flagged a version as being potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story claims that \u201cMarquesha Johnson\u201d is a \u201cprominent\u201d member of Black Lives Matter, but there is nobody by that name listed on the group\u2019s website as a founder or staff member.\n\nThe photo of a woman that ran with the story isn\u2019t \u201cMarquesha Johnson,\u201d either. It is actually Temitope Adebamiro, a Delaware woman who pleaded guilty in 2016 to killing her abusive husband.\n\nThe made-up story also says: \u201cAccording to a class action lawsuit filed Wednesday, Johnson \u2018solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself.'\u201d\n\nAlthough the link included in the story does go to the federal court system\u2019s website, a search of the site shows that no such lawsuit has been filed.\n\nAccording to the story, documents filed in that fictional court case say that she bought a $1.2 million house, and a picture with the story shows a luxurious, palm-tree-shaded poolside lounge. But that photo is actually from a Mexican resort where a room can cost $5,000 per night.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nGambino, Lauren and Laughland, Oliver. \u201cThree years after Trayvon Martin, a new civil rights movement grows in strength.\u201d The Guardian. 27 Feb 2015.\n\nFrench, David. \u201cThe Numbers Are In: Black Lives Matter Is Wrong about Police.\u201d National Review. 29 Dec 2015.\n\nMasulli Reyes, Jessica. \u201cWife gets 4 years after murdered husband\u2019s past unfolds.\u201d The News Journal. 15 Dec 2016.", "lang": "en"}
