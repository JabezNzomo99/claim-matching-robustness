The post further claimed that two people died by drinking a cold drink after eating mangoes. Vishvas News team investigated and found that the viral claim is false.\n\nA message is circulating on social media with a claim stating that: \u201cmangoes and cold drinks, if consumed together, create a deadly combination in the stomach. There is citric acid found in mango which mixes with carbonic acid and forms an acid which is poisonous for human beings. Also, two people died as soon as they consumed cold drink after eating mangoes.\u201d The post has been shared by a Facebook user Sandeep Thakur.\n\nVishvas News team started the investigation by contacting a Nutritionist, Ms. Avni Kaul on whether drinking cold drink immediately after eating mangoes can create a deadly reaction in the stomach.\n\n\u201cCitric acid, or citrate, is an organic acid that exists in all fruits. The highest concentration of citric acid occurs in lemon juice with 1.44 grams per ounce of juice. Lime juice comes in second with 1.38 grams per ounce. In comparison, citric acid is found in very minimal quantity in Mangos, less than 0.1 grams in every 100 grams of mango.\n\nOn the other hand, soft drinks contain Carbon-di-oxide gas dissolved in water under high pressure. This carbon-di-oxide combines with water to form Carbonic acid. When soft drinks bottles are opened the carbonic acid starts to decompose. This decomposition of carbonic acid produces the characteristic soda fizz. Despite its acidic properties, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that carbonic acid in beverages does any harm to humans.\n\nAlso carbonic acid and citric acid are both weak acid there is no proven record of both the acids mixed together, doing any damage to human body at chemical levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a practical sense, if citric acid mixed with carbonic acid could turn poisonous and kill humans then MILLIONS Indian would have died after drinking the famous Sikanjis (Indian Lemonade), since lemon contains 10 times more citric acid, compared to mangos.\u201d\n\nShe also explained about the rare cases when the combination of mango and soft drinks can be harmful:\n\n\u201cIn a theoretical scenario, mango and soft drinks combination may be harmful if the person is diabetic and have a very high sugar level in body prior eating. In such a scenario, a further spike in sugar level may cause harm to organs if insulin is not given on time.\u201d\n\nVishvas News searched for any scientific study confirming that mixing the mango and cold drinks can cause any severe chemical reaction. But, there was no study available.\n\nWe then searched news reports stating that two men died after consuming mangoes and cold drinks. No, news reports were available.\n\nPost claiming having cold drinking after eating mangoes can create a deadly combination is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
