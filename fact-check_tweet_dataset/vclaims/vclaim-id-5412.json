You are not protesting, you are being used to send a vote to the LNP.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, shadow finance minister Jim Chalmers described One Nation as \u201cthe wholly-owned subsidiary of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s Liberal Party\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month, deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek said that in 2018, Pauline Hanson had \u201cvoted effectively 100% of the time with the Turnbull Government\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the records.\n\nIn response to The Conversation\u2019s request for sources and comment, Tanya Plibersek said:\n\nPlibersek\u2019s comment related to votes on second and third reading votes (including amendments) on legislation.\n\nPlibersek\u2019s office highlighted 20 such votes in 2018 in which Labor and the Coalition disagreed. Of those, Hanson abstained from one vote, and voted 18 times with the government. (The equivalent of 95% of the time, with the abstention excluded.)\n\nA spokesperson told The Conversation Plibersek used the qualifier \u201ceffectively\u201d in her original comment to indicate that Hanson voted with the Coalition almost all of the time.\n\nDeputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek said Pauline Hanson has \u201cvoted effectively 100% of the time with the Turnbull Government\u201d in 2018.\n\nParliamentary records show the figure to be between 83-86%, depending on the measure used.\n\nPauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party has cast 169 formal votes in the Senate to date in 2018. Of those, it was in agreement with the government 83% of the time.\n\nIf we look at the 99 occasions where the government and opposition were in disagreement, and One Nation cast an influential vote, we see that the minor party voted with the government 86% of the time.\n\nVotes in the Senate can be determined \u201con the voices\u201d or \u201cby division\u201d.\n\nFor a vote to pass on the voices, a majority of senators must call \u201caye\u201d in response to the question posed by the chair.\n\nIf two or more senators challenge the chair\u2019s conclusion about whether the \u201cayes\u201d or \u201cnoes\u201d are in the majority, a division is called.\n\nBells are then rung for four minutes to call senators to the chamber. The question is posed again, and senators vote by taking their place on the right or left hand side of the chair, before the votes are counted by tellers.\n\nVoting records are only published for votes passed by division.\n\nHow has One Nation voted in 2018?\n\nWe can look to parliamentary records to test Plibersek\u2019s claim.\n\nPauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation Party is represented in the parliament by party leader and Queensland senator Pauline Hanson, and West Australian senator Peter Georgiou. New South Wales senator Brian Burston was a One Nation senator until June 2018.\n\nPlibersek\u2019s comment referred to votes on the second and third readings of legislation in the full Senate, excluding procedural votes, motions and votes in Senate committees.\n\nBut votes that take place in Senate committees, after the second reading, but before the third, are also important. Much of the legislative process is done \u201cin committee\u201d, where various parties propose amendments to legislation, and these are voted on.\n\nSo counting only the full Senate votes on legislation as being significant, as Plibersek did, does not give the full picture.\n\nIn this FactCheck, I will consider all the divisions, from a number of different angles.\n\nThere have been 187 divisions in the Senate so far this year. Of those, One Nation:\n\u2022 voted with the Coalition on 141 occasions (or 75% of the time)\n\u2022 voted against the Coalition on 28 occasions (or 15% of the time), and\n\u2022 abstained from voting on 18 occasions (or 10% of the time).\n\nOf the 169 divisions where One Nation voted, it was in agreement with the government 83% of the time.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to consider the balance of power.\n\nWhen the Coalition and Labor vote the same way, minor party votes do not affect the outcome. When the Coalition and Labor are in disagreement, minor party votes are all important.\n\nThere have been 110 such divisions between the Coalition and Labor in the Senate in 2018 to date.\n\nIn these 110 divisions, One Nation:\n\u2022 voted with the Coalition on 85 occasions (or 77% of the time)\n\u2022 voted against the Coalition on 14 occasions (or 13% of the time), and\n\u2022 abstained from voting on 11 occasions (10% of the time).\n\nIf we look at the 99 divisions where the Coalition and Labor were in disagreement, and One Nation cast an influential vote, we see that the party voted with the Coalition 86% of the time.\n\nBy comparison, in the 110 divisions where Labor opposed the government, the Australian Greens supported the Coalition 5% of the time, and the Centre Alliance (formerly Nick Xenophon Team) did so 56% of the time.\n\nThe calculations for the Greens and Centre Alliance above do not include abstentions and cases where the party vote was split. \u2013 Adrian Beaumont\n\nThe author\u2019s points and statistics appear to be all in order.\n\nAs the FactCheck shows, while One Nation has not voted with the government 100% of the time, it has supported the Coalition in a large majority of cases. \u2013 Zareh Ghazarian\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit was the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
