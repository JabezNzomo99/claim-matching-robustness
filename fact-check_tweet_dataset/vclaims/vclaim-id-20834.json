Now what what do you have to say? Will you all still claim that this a lie? \u2013 translated). A post is being circulated on social media, with purported images of former Congress President Sonia Gandhi in beachwear.\n\nThe images shared by right-wing Facebook page \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 (Phir ek bar Modi sarkar) have more than 10,000 shares in less than 24 hours.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the post has been picked up by several other right-wing Facebook groups and pages, including WE SUPPORT PM MODI, Vote 4 BJP and We support Yogi Adityanath, among others. It has also been shared by individual users.\n\nWhere are the images really from?\n\nTo establish the origin of the photographs, Alt News reverse image searched the post via Google.\n\nThe photographs are actually of Swiss actress Ursula Andress on the sets of the first Bond movie Dr. No. The man pictured with Andress is Scottish actor Sean Connery, the first actor to portray the fictional character of British spy James Bond.\n\nMany people in the comments section of the page \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 also called out the bluff and posted the original photographs.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated incident, but several attempts have been made in the past as well to malign Sonia Gandhi\u2019s reputation by posting fake or morphed photos with sexist captions.\n\n\u092b\u093f\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 had photoshopped an image of a meeting between Sonia Gandhi and former President of Maldives Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to show that Gandhi is sitting on his lap. It had a massive share count of more than 36,000.\n\nHollywood actress Reese Witherspoon\u2019s photograph was used to claim it is the image of a young Sonia Gandhi as a \u201cbar waitress\u201d.\n\nA photograph of Marilyn Monroe was morphed with Sonia Gandhi\u2019s face, calling her a \u201cbar dancer\u201d.\n\nAs part of a patriarchal society, women constantly find themselves in the cross-hairs of misogynist propaganda meant to shame them and malign them. Sonia Gandhi has especially been a target of such propaganda to portray that she doesn\u2019t confirm to \u2018Indian culture\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
