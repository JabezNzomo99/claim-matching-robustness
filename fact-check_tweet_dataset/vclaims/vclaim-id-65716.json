Ngayon sa GCQ, pwede na yung outdoor exercises pero non-contact yung sports\u2026 so pwede na yung golf. Yung basketball hindi pa pwede kasi contact sports iyon (During the ECQ, outdoor exercises were totally prohibited. Under the GCQ now, outdoor exercises are allowed as long as the sport is non-contact\u2026 so golf is now allowed. Basketball is not yet allowed because that is a contact sport),\u201d said Robredo.\n\nThe fake quote card twisted her comments on basketball during her radio show and followed the publication on her official FB page of a video giving safety tips on the reopening of offices under the GCQ. Among the the tips is to practice social distancing of about one meter or three feet.\n\nThis is not the first time disinformation publishers attributed an incredulous health advice to the vice president. Editing the same March 15 GMA News and Public Affairs graphic, netizens claimed Robredo told the public to \u201csuck in their cough\u201d to avoid infecting others with COVID-19 in March.\n\nTwo more fake quote cards on Robredo using News5 templates also surfaced in March.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check flagged at least two netizens and two FB pages -- SOLID Duterte and Duterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel -- that published the fabricated 'basketball advice' graphic. It collectively has over 1,200 shares, and could have reached more than 116,000 people.\n\nA day after Duterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel published its post, it edited its caption to include a disclaimer saying it did not claim Robredo made the statement. However, the graphic clearly shows Robredo\u2019s name under the statement, alongside her photo.\n\nDuterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel was created in November 2016, SOLID Duterte last April 16.", "lang": "en"}
