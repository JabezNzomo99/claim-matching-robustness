Samira Saba, communications director for the company, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the firm\u2019s only U.S. client is Los Angeles County.\n\nThe viral image alludes to a years-old conspiracy theory that Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic megadonor, influences American elections through his involvement in Smartmatic, a firm that specializes in building and implementing electronic voting systems. Smartmatic has operated in 25 countries, including the U.S., where the firm has provided election equipment and technical support in some areas since 2005, according to its website.\n\nHowever, Soros does not and has never had any ownership stake in the voting technology firm, according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. The only connection between Soros and Smartmatic is its chairman, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown. He has worked with Soros in the past and sits on the global board of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, an organization that funds \u201cbuilding inclusive and vibrant democracies.\u201d\n\nSmartmatic emphasizes on its website that it is \u201c100% privately owned\u201d and has \u201cno ties to political parties or groups in any country.\u201d (RELATED: Was Kavanaugh Accuser Deborah Ramirez A Soros Fellow?)\n\nDuring the 2005 and 2006 election cycles, the firm sold around 60,000 U.S.-certified electronic voting devices that were used in 15 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Its voting machines were also used in D.C. during that time period.\n\nSmartmatic operates one voting system in Los Angeles County that was recently used in the state\u2019s March 3 presidential primary. Saba confirmed to the DCNF that Los Angeles County is their only U.S. client.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the billionaire philanthropist has been the subject of an online conspiracy theory. One such theory claims he was a Nazi officer during World War II, while another claims that he organized and funded the 2018 migrant caravan that attempted to enter the U.S. Both have been thoroughly disproven.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
