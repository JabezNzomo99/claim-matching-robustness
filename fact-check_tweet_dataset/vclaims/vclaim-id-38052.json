The photos are real but the claim that all the photos are from this year\u2019s Chhath Puja is false. Two of the photos, showing the woman in a red sari and the woman in a grey and black sari are dated to November 2016 and were taken on the occasion of that year\u2019s Chhath Puja.\n\nOn doing a reverse image search, The Quint found the two pictures mentioned above to be from three years ago. They were published by the The Indian Express on 8 November 2016, with the caption \u201c Yamuna river: Sea of froth welcomes devotees on Chhath Puja\u201d. They were credited to Abhinav Saha. The 2016 article by The Indian Express carried the same pictures of the two women standing in the frothy river as in the Facebook post and the News18 article. The picture on the left is from The Indian Express article published on 8 November 2016, while the picture on the right is claimed to be from the celebration in November 2019. The picture on the left is from The Indian Express article published on 8 November 2016, while the picture on the right is falsely claimed as being from this year\u2019s celebration. The two pictures from November 2016 shows the froth at the level of the waist, while this year, the froth has lessened to knee level. We can see the differences in the two photos below. Left: Old picture from November 2016, Right: November 2019 This year the froth in the Yamuna river, while still alarming, was slightly less. Below are some other pictures from this year\u2019s Chhath Puja in Delhi's Kalindi Kunj. Did \u2018Sanghs\u2019 Attack Lucknow Imam? No, It Was a Robbery Gone Wrong Therefore, some of the viral photos claiming to be from Chhath Puja this year are actually old and are from 2016.", "lang": "en"}
