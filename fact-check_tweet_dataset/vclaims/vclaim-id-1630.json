It claims that \u201chuman breast milk naturally contains the same cannabinoids found in the Cannabis plant, which are vital for proper human development\u201d. The article reports that \u201cthe findings of several major scientific studies\u201d support its claim, but it only names one study by Dreher et al, published in 1994[1].\n\nScientists who reviewed the claim explained that human breast milk does indeed contain cannabinoids, but these are endocannabinoids which are important for human development[2,3] and are different from the type of cannabinoids found in cannabis (also known as marijuana). Therefore, the article\u2019s claim is inaccurate.\n\nIt is true that Dreher et al. reported that \u201cneonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation\u201d. However, the authors concluded that \u201cthe better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development.\u201d In short, the higher behavioral scores in cannabis-exposed babies were attributed to the relatively higher socioeconomic status of mothers who used cannabis during pregnancy and lactation (compared to mothers who did not use cannabis), not to cannabis exposure itself.\n\n\n\n Andrew F. Scheyer, Postdoctoral Researcher, Mediterranean Institute of Neurobiology:\n\n This claim in the article \u201cAccording to the findings of several major scientific studies, human breast milk naturally contains [\u2026] the same cannabinoids found in the Cannabis plant, which are vital for proper human development\u201d is patently false. It is true that endocannabinoids such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are found in breast milk[4,5] and do play an important role in development[2,3]. But endocannabinoids are not the \u201csame cannabinoids found in the Cannabis plant.\u201d That would be the functional equivalent of saying that because norepinephrine exhibits many of the same receptor binding profiles as psychomotor stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, that we all have cocaine in our blood all the time.\n\nAlso note that the article they referenced found that the slight differences between cannabis-exposed and non-exposed children were due to sociodemographic positioning, rather than the cannabis itself[1]. As the study\u2019s authors reported in their conclusions: \u201cThe absence of any differences between the exposed [and] nonexposed groups in the early neonatal period suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development.\u201d\n\nOur recent review from Trends in Neurosciences briefly discusses the negative consequences of cannabis consumption by lactating mothers[6].\n\nElizabeth Appiah-Kusi, Trainee Clinical Psychologist, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust:\n\n The article\u2019s main pitfall is in saying that \u201chuman breast milk naturally contains [\u2026] the same cannabinoids found in the Cannabis plant\u201d. This is not correct. Some studies state that human breast milk does indeed contain cannabinoids, but they are endocannabinoids \u2013 \u2018endo\u2019 means within, meaning made by the body. Cannabinoids in cannabis are what we call phytocannabinoids \u2013 \u2018phyto\u2019 meaning plant. Endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids have a similar chemical structure, but they are not the same. Phytocannabinoids are not \u201cvital for proper human development\u201d. However, the endocannabinoid system in the human body is indeed involved in regulating brain development[2], motor control[3], cognition and emotional responses[7].\n\nFurthermore, the study that the article refers to actually attributes the better performance on certain measures to the \u201ccultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers\u201d who use cannabis, rather than the cannabis exposure itself[1].\n\nThe statement \u201cCannabinoids are not, however, present in baby formula, which makes it far more inferior to breast milk\u201d could be problematic as it seems to pressure women into successful breastfeeding. Some women find it really difficult and do not get the correct support and while the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until a child is 2 years old, a fed baby (via breastfeeding or bottle feeding) is best.\n\nRose Chesworth, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Western Sydney University School of Medicine:\n\n The 1994 study by Dreher et al. does not measure cannabinoid levels in breast milk[1]. From this study, one cannot make any claims about the presence or quantities of cannabinoids in breast milk.\n\nHowever, there is more recent evidence suggesting metabolites of the endogenous cannabinoid system are present in breast milk[5]. It appears these endogenous cannabinoids facilitate the suckling response and enhance feeding behaviour in infants.\n\nUndark published an article in August 2019 discussing the study by Dreher et al. and how the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure are still unclear.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Dreher et al.
