Other examples have also been shared multiple times, including here and here.\n\nThe claims in the post about the medical qualifications of members of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) ignore the key point that the NCCC was not set up to advise on medical matters. That work is done by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).\n\nThe NCCC, made up of business, labour and policy experts was established to advise on recovery from the huge economic and social impacts of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on Australia.\n\nAustralia began its COVID-19 response on February 13, 2020, by restricting the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled in mainland China. A month later COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation and on March 19 Australia closed its borders.\n\nFollowing months of lockdowns and business closures, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed on June 2 that Australia\u2019s economy was in recession for the first time in 29 years.\n\nThe NCCC was established by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on March 25, 2020 to advise the new National Cabinet on actions to \u201canticipate and mitigate the economic and social effects of the global coronavirus pandemic\u201d.\n\nNCCC Chair Neville Power, who was once the CEO of iron ore giant Fortescue Metals, said the role of the commission was to \u201cminimise and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on our businesses, our communities and our people.\u201d\n\nThe NCCC\u2019s Terms of Reference page states the committee will advise the Prime Minister on \u201call non-health aspects of the pandemic response\u201d while \u201cworking in tandem with the Chief Medical Officer\u201d.\n\nThe Terms of Reference also state: \u201cThe CMO (Chief Medical Officer) and the medical expert panel he leads \u2013 the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) \u2013 will continue their role of advising the National Cabinet on Australia\u2019s health management and response to the virus.\u201d\n\nThe AHPPC comprises the CMO and all state and territory Chief Health Officers.\n\nA spokesperson for the NCCC told AAP FactCheck in an email that the commission was set up to coordinate economic and social advice to the Australian Government.\n\n\u201cIt was never set up to provide medical or health advice. There is a dedicated expert medical group providing comprehensive health advice to National Cabinet,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post to be misleading. While none of the commissioners on the NCCC have medical credentials, the commission was not established to provide medical or health advice but rather to advise the government on actions to minimise the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. Partly false \u2013 The primary claim is misleading or incomplete. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
