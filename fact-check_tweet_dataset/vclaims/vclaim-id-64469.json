Trump, the niece of U.S. President Donald Trump. Although Trump\u2019s younger brother Robert sought to block publication of the work, it was released ahead of scheduled by publisher Simon & Schuster on July 14, 2020.\n\nWhile various news outlets obtained copies of the book and reported on its contents in advance of its publication, but \u201cToo Much and Never Enough\u201d proved to contain little new information that was truly shocking or surprising. Perhaps its most salacious revelation was Mary Trump\u2019s claim that her uncle had secretly paid someone to take the the SAT college-admissions exam in his place in order to ensure he recorded a high score.\n\nPrior to the book\u2019s official release, social media users circulated a purported excerpt from it, a passage in which Mary Trump allegedly described inadvertently walking in on her uncle in bed with his daughter Ivanka:\n\nThis \u201cleaked\u201d excerpt was nothing more than a prurient fabrication, however. Although Donald Trump has made a number of comments about his daughter that some observers have found unsettling, nothing remotely like what is described above appeared in Mary Trump\u2019s book. Certainly an occurrence so shocking would have been mentioned by news outlets that obtained pre-release copies of the book, but none of them did, and we also searched the ebook version of \u201cToo Much and Never Enough\u201d subsequent to its official release and found no description that came close to matching the one displayed above.\n\nThe only passage in the book we found that bore the slightest resemblance to the faux \u201cexcerpt\u201d seen above \u2014 and it was a very slight resemblance \u2014 was the following paragraph:\n\n\u201cShortly after, Donald came in with his kids and [his brother] Rob\u2019s stepson. With the exception of Eric, they were all teenagers, the boys tall and chubby and wearing suits. Donald went to sit on the chair by the TV, and Ivanka climbed on his lap. The boys started wrestling. Donald watched the action from his chair, kissing Ivanka or pinching her cheek. Every once in a while, he\u2019d stick his foot out and kick whichever boy was being pinned to the floor.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
