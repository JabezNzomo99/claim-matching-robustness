No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 13, 2019 titled \"Ocasio-Cortez Wants to Take Guns Away From Cops\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now on a nationwide campaign to take \"all means of lethal force\" from ordinary beat and patrol cops. \"They do it in England,\" said the young, naive Congresswoman, \"why can't we do it here?\" Her proposal would require that police carrying live, deadly force weapons be specially trained, in tactical and recognizable uniforms, and only be dispatched \"in extreme circumstances.\" In other words, if a patrolling cop comes up on a fight and someone shoots at him, he can fire back with pepper spray and bean bag rounds to his heart's content, but he has to call SWAT if he needs real backup. According to her spokesman, Art Tubolls, the idea is very popular in Democrat strongholds like New York and Chicago.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under the category \"AOC Fan Fiction for the Discerning Tater\" and the name \"Art Tubolls\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the owner of the site.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine and his partner in crime John Prager along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nThat happened with this story too: a site named Harley and The Davidsons copied it and got almost four times the Facebook engagement out of it by posting it to several pro-Trump and conservative Facebook groups and pretending it was real.\n\nEngagement data for the copied story courtesy of CrowdTangle:\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pelosi's Office Did NOT Spend More on Alcohol Last Year Than Food\n\u2022 Fake News: Robert DeNiro Did NOT Lose $40 Million Reunion Contract, Did NOT Blame Trump\n\u2022 Fake News: Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar DID NOT Praise the Destruction of Notre Dame\n\u2022 Fake News: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT Have 150-Year-Old Sign Removed From House Chamber Entrance\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Body In Ohio River Confirmed As Major Clinton Aide", "lang": "en"}
