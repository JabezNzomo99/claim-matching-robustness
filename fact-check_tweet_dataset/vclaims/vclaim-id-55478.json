No, that's not true: in September 2019 someone made a Facebook post with photos from a 2016 accident lifted from a Twitter account and got almost 6,000 shares, close to 3,000 reactions and over a hundred comments on it. But the baby is fine and has been home since October 2016.\n\nThe photos and prayer request went viral via a post (archived here) published on September 9, 2019 with following caption:\n\nThis baby was involved in a horrible car accident and is fighting for his life Can you please like and say a prayer please don't ignore\n\nThis is the Facebook post in question:\n\nThe photos seem to have been taken from this tweet (archived here):\n\nThe baby appears to be the cousin of the woman running the Twitter account (tweet archived here):\n\nIn subsequent tweets she kept her followers up to date on the status of little Emree:\n\nFortunately it all ended well (tweet archived here):\n\nIt is unclear why someone from Chicago, Illinois (according to her Facebook profile) would post old pictures taken by someone in Texas in 2016 and request likes and prayers on it.", "lang": "en"}
