The list includes such household names as Walt Disney, Sydney Airport, Qantas, Origin Energy and News Australia. These companies can collectively be considered to be amongst the biggest operating in Australia \u2013 both in terms of income, and the prominent position they enjoy in the public eye. Some of them are not Australian owned, and they may pay tax in other jurisdictions. However, they all operate in Australia, generate revenue from the spending of Australians and utilise existing infrastructure \u2013 like roads and ports \u2013 that were paid for by Australians. So there\u2019s something deeply unfair about a system which allows them to not pay any tax in Australia.\n\nThe ACTU also provided The Conversation with a spreadsheet listing the corporations it said had paid no tax.\n\nIs that figure right?\n\nThe best source for information on how much tax Australia\u2019s biggest corporations pay every financial year is the ATO. The ATO\u2019s Report of Entity Tax Information \u2013 the same report the ACTU referred to in their response \u2013 is produced annually and shares information taken from the tax returns of:\n\u2022 Australian public and foreign-owned corporate entities with total income of A$100 million or more\n\u2022 Australian-owned resident private companies with total income of A$200 million or more\n\u2022 entities with tax payable under the petroleum resource rent tax, and\n\u2022 entities with tax payable under the minerals resource rent tax.\n\nThe report includes each company\u2019s name, total income, taxable income, and tax payable.\n\nFor the purpose of this FactCheck, the relevant information is the tax payable by each of these companies. By looking at this data, we can see which companies didn\u2019t pay tax in 2014-15, the most recent financial year for which this information is available.\n\nThere are 1,904 companies included in the ATO\u2019s 2014-15 report. Of those, 678 \u2013 or 36% of the companies listed \u2013 had no tax payable.\n\nMy count \u2013 678 \u2013 is slightly different to McManus\u2019s count of 679, and to the figure the ATO quoted on its pie chart here (the ATO has since corrected its report to reduce the number of nil tax payable taxpayers by one to 678).\n\nThe ACTU provided The Conversation with a spreadsheet listing the 679 companies that, in their view, paid no taxes. When I compared my count with the ACTU\u2019s, I noted the ACTU included a company that I did not, a company named Tal Dai-Ichi Life Australia.\n\nIn the report I downloaded from the ATO website, Tal Dai-Ichi Life Australia is recorded as having total tax payable of A$56,171,148 for the 2014-15 financial year, so it shouldn\u2019t be included in the count of companies that paid no tax.\n\nNevertheless, the difference is obviously minor. McManus was essentially correct.\n\nWhy do some companies pay no tax?\n\nIn general, there are two reasons why corporate companies pay no tax in Australia.\n\nThe first is that some companies are not making any profit. The concept of \u201ctotal income\u201d, which is used to identify the companies included in the ATO report, relates to revenue \u2013 not profit.\n\nSo, a company can have income (or revenue) of more than A$200 million, but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean it has made a profit. Its losses or outgoings may outweigh its income. Only companies making a profit have to pay taxes.\n\nMany of the companies that didn\u2019t pay tax in 2014-15 were those in the energy/natural resources and manufacturing sectors \u2013 two sectors that were experiencing a downturn in that year and where profit margins were shrinking.\n\nThe second reason could be tax avoidance or profit shifting. These situations arise when companies take advantage of the international tax system to reduce the amount of tax to be paid. For instance, companies may set up complex ownership arrangements that allow them to redirect profit to countries with lower tax rates.\n\nWhile not necessarily illegal, these situations are closely monitored by the ATO to ensure that Australia receives its correct share of tax under international tax rules.\n\nSally McManus\u2019 claim that \u201c679 of our biggest corporations pay not one cent of tax\u201d was essentially correct. According to ATO records, 678 of Australia\u2019s biggest corporations didn\u2019t pay tax in Australia in 2014-15.\n\nMcManus\u2019s figure of 679 included one company that did have tax payable in that financial year. But in percentage terms, the difference between 678 and 679 is negligible.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that when a company doesn\u2019t pay tax, it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply tax avoidance or profit shifting. A company might not be paying tax because it isn\u2019t making a profit, even if its total income (that is, revenue) amounts to more than A$100 million or A$200 million. \u2013 Fabrizio Carmignani\n\nThe ATO\u2019s annual corporate tax transparency reports can provide useful insights to inform public debate regarding how effectively our tax system is working.\n\nAs the author rightly points out, the information must be used with caution. There are legitimate reasons why a company with substantial income does not have to pay income tax. For instance, it may make a loss in that particular year, or has substantial carried forward losses from previous years.\n\nOr, as the author has also rightly noted, tax avoidance may be the reason why a large company is not paying any income tax. \u2013 Antony Ting\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit is the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
