A missile did crash in a North Korean city during a 2017 flight test but, per U.S. officials, it was non-nuclear.\n\nThe image, posted by UberFacts on Feb. 17, likely references an April 2017 missile test conducted by North Korea, though the post appears to get details of that failed flight test wrong.

It flew approximately 24 miles before crashing into a complex of industrial and agricultural buildings in Tokchon, a city north of the capital city of Pyongyang, according to the magazine.\n\nIf the country had \u201caccidentally nuked\u201d one of its own cities, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets reported the missile had a nuclear payload. U.S. officials actually told NBC News that the ballistic missile was non-nuclear, according to CNBC.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies reports that North Korea has launched six Hwasong-12 IRBMs since April 2017. Three tests involved missiles capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1,102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles), per the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies database.", "lang": "en"}
