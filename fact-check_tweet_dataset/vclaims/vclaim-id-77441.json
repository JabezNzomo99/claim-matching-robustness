At one point, the narrator says, that \"Obama\u2019s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.\"\n\n \n\n We previously examined a similar -- but opposite claim -- when Obama said that \"over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of\" President George W. Bush\u2019s policies and the recession.\n\n \n\n We ruled Obama\u2019s claim False, and a recalculation of the same numbers can shed some light on the American Crossroads claim as well. We contacted American Crossroads for this fact-check, but a spokesman did not respond to our inquiry.\n\n \n\n First, the bottom-line number on the debt: Yes, it has grown by $5 trillion during Obama\u2019s tenure. Total debt has increased by $5.5 trillion since January 20, 2009, while the share of that debt held by the public has increased by $5 trillion.\n\n \n\n But it\u2019s not entirely correct to hang that increase on \"Obama\u2019s spending\" alone.\n\n \n\n In our previous item, we looked at calculations by the Treasury Department based on data from the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress.\n\n \n\n To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it with the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead. CBO specifically broke out how much several laws contributed to the deficit, some of which started under Bush and some under Obama.\n\n \n\n Because American Crossroads was only referring to the debt added during Obama\u2019s tenure, we only looked at fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. And because the American Crossroads ad does not reference how much the deficits fell below the surpluses that had been forecast by CBO, we\u2019re going to exclude from our calculations a category CBO called its own \"failures to predict economic conditions accurately.\"\n\n \n\n We added up the lost revenue and additional spending each year and then calculated their percentage of the deficits over those three years.\n\n \n\n Spending\n\n \n\n Spending initiated by Bush policies: 4 percent of total deficits in 2009, 2010 and 2011\n\n Spending initiated by Obama policies: 11 percent\n\n Other increases in discretionary spending: 32 percent\n\n Other increases in mandatory spending: 6 percent\n\n \n\n Revenue reductions\n\n \n\n Revenue reductions initiated by Bush policies: 11 percent\n\n Revenue reductions initiated by Obama policies: 13 percent\n\n Other unclassified revenue reductions: 5 percent\n\n \n\n Interest\n\n \n\n Net interest: 19 percent\n\n \n\n The spending increases traceable to programs clearly attributable to Obama, combined with the increase in discretionary spending on his watch, account for about 43 percent of the three years worth of deficits.\n\n \n\n So if you\u2019re talking about what \"drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt,\" then a clear majority stemmed from sources other than \"Obama\u2019s spending.\"\n\n \n\n If you expand the definition from \"Obama\u2019s spending\" to \"Obama\u2019s spending and tax cuts,\" you get to a total of 56 percent. Throw in 13 percentage points for the added interest costs of Obama\u2019s policies and you\u2019re at 69 percent.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The American Crossroads ad claims that \"Obama\u2019s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.\"\n\nBut not all of the $5 trillion can be attributed to Obama's spending. Much of it can be attributed to his tax cuts and the policies of President Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
