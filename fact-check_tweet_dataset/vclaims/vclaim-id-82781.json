To some extent, it\u2019s a misplaced analogy because the two countries at the moment are not dueling around the globe, battling over a particular economic philosophy. But certainly Russia and the United States\u2014after the Obama administration\u2019s much-heralded \u201creset\u201d five years ago\u2014are entering a chilly period.\n\nSo now let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and look back at a celebrated exchange between President Obama and his GOP rival, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, during the third presidential debate. With the passage of time, it makes for interesting viewing. The \u201cTruth Teller\u201d video above depicts the exchanges.\n\n\u201cOn all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it\u2019s important for him to give me space,\u201d Obama told Medvedev, referring to incoming Russian president Vladi\u00admir Putin. \u201cThis is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI understand,\u201d Medvedev replied. \u201cI will transmit this information to Vladimir.\u201d\n\nRomney went on CNN and said: \u201cThis is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world\u2019s worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world\u2019s worst actors, of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough, but when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them, when [Syrian President] Assad, for instance, is murdering his own people, we go to the United Nations and who is it that always stands up for the world\u2019s worst actors? It is always Russia, typically with China alongside, and so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that\u2019s on the Security Council, that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course a massive security power \u2014 Russia is the geopolitical foe.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria\u2019s vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America\u2019s national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama\u2019s policy toward Russia has been: \u2018We give, Russia gets.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of the debate, such subtleties apparently did not matter. Obama offered a jab that spawned approving headlines: \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years\u2026.When it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s, and the economic policies of the 1920s.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s comment on the \u201c1980s\u201d was clearly a planned zinger. In the wake of the Crimea standoff, odds are the anonymous author of that line is not eager to be identified. But it probably seemed like a clever idea at the time.", "lang": "en"}
