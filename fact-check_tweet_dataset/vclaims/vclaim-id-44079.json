But what they're saying about admission of guilt, that's difficult, because I was of minor age, I was not a government official, and what I remember is that I would be sent to look at the price of rice, to go to Tatalon and other places like that. But I was not a government official. I just know that my dad was very troubled by the price of rice and every day I would check if one ganta was P8\u2026 and that was my only job, because if it went past P8, it would be a big problem for families. That's also what I do as a governor, maintain the low price of rice, because that's really the hardship of every family, and that's what the poor are hoping for.", "lang": "en"}
