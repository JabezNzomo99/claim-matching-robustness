We have it down to two years, and it\u2019s going to be one year very shortly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, at a campaign rally on Thursday night in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\n\nMr. Trump has doubled a previously exaggerated claim about the permitting process for roads and infrastructure taking a decade. Average wait times for a permit ranged from three to six years from the fiscal years 1999 to 2016, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nIn the 2017 fiscal year, the average wait time was three years and 10 months, almost double Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of a two-year period. (Data for the 2018 fiscal year, which ends in September, is not yet available.)\n\nwhat was said\n\n\u201cOur first lottery winner \u2014 let\u2019s see, he has seven convictions for theft. He\u2019s killed nine people. And we\u2019re getting him the hell out of our country and giving them to the stupid politicians that have been running the United States for many years.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has previously said that other countries were not \u201cgiving us their best\u201d through the diversity visa lottery program. He has now escalated that unsubstantiated \u2014 and vague \u2014 claim into a false one by suggesting that foreign governments are sending murderers through the program.", "lang": "en"}
