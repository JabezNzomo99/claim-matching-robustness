In order to promote consistent and equitable filing practices the follow[ing] analysis is to be applied when giving consideration to filing of PC 463 (Looting): 1. Was this theft offense substantially motivated by the state of emergency, or simply a theft offense which occurred contemporaneous to the declared state of emergency? a. Factors to consider in making this determination: i. Was the target business open or closed to the public during the state of emergency?\n\n ii. What was the manner and means by which the suspect gained entry to the business?\n\n iii. What was the nature/quantity/value of the goods targeted?\n\n iv. Was the theft committed for financial gain or personal need?\n\n v. Is there an articulable reason why another statute wouldn\u2019t adequately address the particular incident?\u201d Oh. Well. If you need those shoes and purses, then it\u2019s totally different\u2026\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2020, conservative talk show host Ben Ferguson posted a Facebook meme composed of a screenshot of Red State\u2019s headline (\u201cSoros DA Diana Becton Requires Officers Consider Whether a Looter \u2018Needed\u2019 Stolen Goods Before Charging\u201d), along with his own summary of Becton\u2019s position: \u201cSo now it\u2019s okay to loot as long as you \u2018need\u2019 it?! \u2026 This is sick!\u201d\n\nFerguson\u2019s remarks, and the descriptions included in the Organic Prepper\u2019s article, did not constitute an accurate summary or representation of Becton\u2019s prosecutorial guidelines around looting offenses.\n\nOn Aug. 27, the right-leaning Red State website posted an article with the headline \u201cSoros DA Diana Becton Requires Officers Consider Whether a Looter \u2018Needed\u2019 Stolen Goods Before Charging.\u201d That article claimed to include a leaked document consisting of the internal \u201clooting guidelines\u201d quoted above by the Organic Prepper.\n\nThose guidelines were real, and the document was authentic. A spokesperson for the Contra Costa DA\u2019s office confirmed for Snopes that Becton, who is the county\u2019s first Black and first female district attorney ever, issued the guidelines in June 2020.\n\nSection 463 of the California Penal Code sets out the state\u2019s prohibition against looting. In brief, it upgrades the existing crimes of burglary, grand theft, and petty theft, where a state of emergency or evacuation order has been declared in a given location. In the cases of burglary and grand theft, the law states that when upgraded to crimes of looting, those offenses are \u201cpunishable by imprisonment in a county jail for one year or pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170\u201d \u2014 that is, up to three years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nBecton\u2019s guidelines encouraged prosecutors to make a distinction between theft and burglary offenses that merely happen to take place in a state of emergency, and those that are \u201csubstantially motivated by\u201d the existence of the state of emergency.\n\nIn order to help them make that distinction, and decide whether it would be advisable or warranted to charge an individual with looting as opposed to theft or burglary, the document sets out five factors to consider: whether the business targeted was closed or open to the public; the means by which the offender entered the business; the quantity and value of the items stolen; whether the offense was committed \u201cfor financial gain or personal need\u201d; whether a different statute (other than Section 463) would adequately address the offense committed.\n\nCrucially, the guidelines do not state or indicate that an individual who, during a state of emergency, committed theft or burglary for \u201cpersonal need\u201d would not be charged with looting. That absolutely remains a real possibility under Becton\u2019s guidelines, and one that her spokesperson reaffirmed in response to questions submitted by Snopes. Therefore, the claim that Becton had indicated looting was \u201cokay\u201d if the offender \u201cneeded\u201d the items stolen was false, not least because it implied that Becton, or her office, had engaged in a degree of moral absolution as well as legal predetermination, neither of which they had done.\n\nProsecutors routinely exercise broad discretion in deciding whether to charge individuals suspected of having committed crimes, and how to charge individuals who may have committed several criminal offenses in one action. The factors that influence those decisions are complex and manifold, but prosecutors often weigh the strength of the evidence available, the resources available to them to take upgraded offenses to trial, as well as less tangible considerations, such as political or public pressure, or the broader \u201cinterest of justice.\u201d\n\nDue to the existence of that discretion in the decision of whether to upgrade theft or burglary charges to looting, it makes sense for a prosecuting agency to attempt to mitigate against any inconsistencies or biases in the decision-making process. Hence the guidelines issued in June.\n\n\u201cWe evaluate all possible factors in reviewing whether or not to file criminal charges. We always have an ethical responsibility to ensure when filing a case we can meet the high burden of proving the case to a jury and prove the facts underlining the alleged criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The factors outlined in the policy are similar for our review of [other] criminal offenses \u2014 examining the intent and reasons why a crime was committed along with all the other available evidence.\u201d\n\nThe function of Becton\u2019s document was to provide her prosecutors with black-and-white guidelines in order to help them decide whether to charge an arrested person with looting, or charge them with the underlying burglary or theft offenses. It was simply not the case that the document required or even advised prosecutors not to go ahead with a looting charge if the suspect was found to have been motivated by \u201cpersonal need.\u201d\n\nIt was also not the case that suspects would go free entirely if a prosecutor decided not to charge an individual with looting, after considering the five factors set out in the guidelines. In that scenario, the individual would still be charged with the underlying offense of burglary or theft, just not the upgraded charge of looting.\n\nThus the Daily Wire erred in claiming that Becton\u2019s guidelines required law enforcement \u201cto consider if looters needed their loot before the police charged them with a crime.\u201d Similarly, the blog USSA News falsely claimed that Becton had \u201copenly admitted that she\u2019s going to look the other way at looting in her jurisdiction as long as the people involved can prove they needed the Louis Vuitton purse and weren\u2019t stealing it for personal gain.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
