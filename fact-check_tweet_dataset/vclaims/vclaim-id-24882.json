This is false. The 6,613 figure comes from an article about one government jobs creation program and Statistics Canada data shows employment rose by more than one million between 2015 and 2019.\n\nOne tweet jumped social media platforms when Facebook users began to share it as a screenshot on Facebook in July. It claims: \u201cThe million jobs that Trudeau says he created, ended up only being 6,613. Over the past 4 years Trudeau brought in 500,000 immigrants, resulting in a net job loss of 983,387, not including the 100,000 jobs lost in the oil sector.\u201d\n\nThe original tweet links to an article by online media The Post Millennial, which tells a different story. The Post Millennial article is based on another article by online media Blacklock\u2019s Reporter. Basing the article on an Access to Information request, Blacklock reported on July 15 that The Canadian Strategic Innovation Fund, a jobs creation program launched in 2017 by the Canadian Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, only produced 6,613 jobs since it launch in 2017. This contradicts Liberal Minister and program sponsor Navdeep Bains\u2019 announcement that it created 56,000 jobs.\n\nAFP Fact-Check was not able to access the full Access to Information data from Blacklock\u2019s Reporter, but a list of projects funded by the Canadian Strategic Innovation Fund has been published online since the publication of the article.\n\nThe online numbers show a distinction between \u201cjobs created\u201d and \u201cjobs maintained.\u201d However, the June 4 press release from the minister did not make that distinction and simply mentioned the creation of 56,000 jobs. This number actually reflected the number of jobs created as well as those maintained.\n\nDani Keenan, press secretary for the minister, told AFP that \u201cthe department made a mistake and forgot that word, (maintained)\u201d and that other statements did say, \u201cjobs created and maintained.\u201d\n\nOn July 23, the total for all jobs created and maintained for the program was nearly 61,000, but the net number of new jobs created was just over 10,000. Dani Keenan said that jobs maintained is a category that includes jobs that could have been cut without funds from the program.\n\nIt is clear that the claims presented in the meme are unrelated to the article alongside which they were posted. The figures for immigrants and net job losses are also not accurate.\n\nThe claim that 500,000 immigrants settled in Canada over the past four years is false.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada\u2019s annual demographic estimate, 239,800 immigrants arrived in Canada in 2014-2015, 320,932 in 2015-2016, 272,666 in 2016-2017, 303,257 in 2017-2018, for a total of just over 1.1 million. These numbers include non-permanent residents such as temporary workers.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of new permanent residents in Canada, which includes long-term immigrants sometimes arrived several years prior, totalled 1.17 million, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n\nStatistics Canada\u2019s seasonally adjusted data shows that the number of employed Canadians went from 15,752,066 in April 2015 to 16,906,247 in April 2019, which represents a net increase of 1,154,181 people employed over this four year period.\n\nThe National Employment Report drafted by ADP Canada, a private company, shows that total nonfarm payroll employment in Canada went from 15,490,869 in April 2015 to 16,535,481 in April 2019, or 1,044,612 new jobs over that time period.\n\nThe differences in numbers reflect the different methodologies used by Statistics Canada and ADP.\n\nJobs in the oil and gas sector did decrease over the past four years, though not by 100,000. Between April 2015 and April 2019, 6,797 jobs were lost in that sector, as well as 17,734 jobs in support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction, according to Statistic Canada\u2019s Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours.\n\nThe unemployment rate has fallen across the board from 2014 to 2019.\n\nStatistics Canada\u2019s Labour Force Survey shows that the unemployment rate for individuals 15 and over born in Canada fell from 6.8 percent in 2015 to 5.7 percent in 2018. For immigrants landed five or less years earlier, the unemployment rate also decreased from 12.9 to 9.4 percent over the same time period.", "lang": "en"}
