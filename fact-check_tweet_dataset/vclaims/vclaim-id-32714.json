(RELATED: Did Burger King Admit To Using Horse Meat?)\n\nHowever, photos found on Getty Images reveal that the image has been photoshopped to show a reference to the devil. The California-based chain actually prints the words \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d on its soda cups. That bible verse, per the King James Version, reads, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d\n\nThe fast food chain prints various Bible verses on its cups, burger wrappers and fry boats, among other packaging. For instance, the wrappers on the chain\u2019s popular \u201cDouble-Double\u201d sandwiches feature Nahum 1:7, according to Snopes.\n\nIn-N-Out Burger isn\u2019t the only fast food chain that\u2019s been the target of misinformation on social media. Burger King appeared recently in a misleading article on Facebook that falsely claimed the restaurant chain used horse meat.", "lang": "en"}
