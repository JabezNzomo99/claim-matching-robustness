That\u2019s a 12% increase.\n\nUsing figures for April 2017 (which are the ones used by the Conservative party to make the claim) and comparing back to May 2010 there were 11,800 more doctors. These figures look at full time equivalent staff \u2013 that\u2019s the number of staff there would be if you added their hours together to create only full time positions.\n\nThese don\u2019t include the number of GPs working in England though. Information on GP numbers isn\u2019t comparable as far back as 2010 because of changes in the way the figures were collected.\n\nOf course this doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about the impact this increased number of doctors has on patients and the NHS. We\u2019ve looked at other areas including the level of satisfaction with the NHS, the number of people attending Accident and Emergency and the state of the NHS elsewhere.", "lang": "en"}
