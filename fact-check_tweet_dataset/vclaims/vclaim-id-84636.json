When Aurangzeb succeeded Shahjahan, was any election held then? This was always known that the heir to the emperor will inherit power, although it is another matter if the successors fight among themselves. But, in a democracy, elections are held. I invite Shehzad Poonawala to come and file an application for contesting the election\u201d. What Mani Shankar Aiyar said was unambiguous and clear. Prime Minister Modi and his party colleagues used only the first half of his statement to make their point. It is not uncommon for political parties and leaders to resort to such tactics, but what explains the skewed reportage by sections of the Indian media? Far from calling out the Prime Minister when he wrongly quoted Aiyar, many from the fourth pillar of Indian democracy actively joined him in disseminating the fake news.\n\nTo be very clear about what Aiyar said, let us listen to him once again:\n\nAn hour after Aiyar made this statement; PM Modi used the first part of it in his election rally.\n\nLet us look at a cross section of the media to see how they reported this incident.\n\nMani Shankar Aiyar had spoken to ABP News. The full video of the conversation was available on ABP page. If anyone knew the reality of what was said versus how it was being represented, it was ABP News. If anyone could have called the bluff, it was ABP News. But ABP did none of it. It played along.\n\n\u201cABP News Interview: Aiyar compares Congress to Mughal era to support Rahul, gets targeted by Modi\u201d was the headline of the ABP story even though the channel knew fully well from its own interview that Aiyar was not comparing Congress to the Mughal era but drawing upon the difference that exists between the Mughal era and a democracy. The channel quoted Amit Malviya\u2019s tweet without once mentioning that the video shared was cropped.\n\nLater in the day while reporting the political storm after PM Modi cited ABP News\u2019 interview with Mani Shankar Aiyar, ABP News itself tweeted the cropped video clip.\n\nRepublic TV\u2019s response was entirely predictable. The channel went overboard in misreporting the story. Aiyar\u2019s comment was conveniently edited and Republic TV went berserk with the news. Editor-in-chief of Republic TV Arnab Goswami on his 9 pm show carried Aiyar\u2019s statement as the lead story. Goswami opened the show with the following statement\n\n\u201cGood evening and welcome. The Congress party has officially declared that Rahul Gandhi, in their view, and this is an official statement, they say that in their view Rahul Gandhi is like a Mughal emperor. No don\u2019t pinch yourself, this is the reality, they have actually said it, and they have further gone on to say that the Gandhi family in their view is like the Mughal dynasty because the Mughal dynasty was born to rule and the Gandhi family is also born to rule. And the Congress party\u2019s specific words of the senior member of the media committee of the Congress Party Mani Shankar Aiyar said this in an official statement, repeated many times, he said this viewers, you have hear this, he says when Shahjahan succeeded Jahangir, was there any election and they have gone on to ask, and I\u2019m quoting them, so that the Congress party does not say I\u2019m misquoting them, The Congress Party\u2019s official statement is when Aurangzeb succeeded Shahjahan was there any election. Now I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. But I will read what Mani Shankar Aiyar, senior top Congress spokesperson said about the lack of democracy in the Congress. He said and I quote, believe me viewers this is the thinking in the Congress party. It is pre-decided, the Congress party says that the son of a king will be a king, the son of a king will be a king, official Congress party statement on record. Dear viewers, this is the most unfortunate admission, of dynasty which we hate, of entitlement which we hate, and arrogance which we cannot tolerate but I\u2019m happy tonight\u201d\n\nIn the debate that followed, Goswami in his usual style shouted down those who pointed out that the clip shown by the channel was incomplete and that the full statement of Aiyar has been ignored or conveniently left out. That is not all. Republic TV carried the hashtag #RahulMughalEmperor at 1:10 pm.\n\nWithin no time, BJP\u2019s twitter account @BJP4India and @BJP4UP helped turn it into a twitter trend.\n\nTimes Now reported about PM Modi welcoming \u201cAurangzeb raj\u201d. Mani Shankar Aiyar\u2019s controversial statement was not mentioned but his position was stated clearly by quoting him as saying \u201cAnybody can walk in and contest\u201d\n\nZee News reported Mani Shankar Aiyar\u2019s statement in full mentioning that PM Modi latched on to it. \u201cCongress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Monday stoked a controversy when he invoked the rulers of the Mughal dynasty in the election of Rahul Gandhi as party President, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi latched on to quickly to call it \u201cAurangzeb Raj\u201d.\n\nThe India Todaystory summarized in their sub-heading that \u201cMani Shankar Aiyar, while commenting on Rahul Gandhi\u2019s elevation as the president of the Indian National Congress, said there were no elections during Mughal rule to decide the next emperor.\u201d While the sub-heading is misleading, India Today covered the statement in full in the text of the article.\n\nIn its Hindi story, CNN News 18 spoke of PM Modi using Mani Shankar Aiyar\u2019s \u201chalf statement\u201d while attacking Congress thus indirectly indicating that PM had misquoted Aiyar. The English report carried Aiyar\u2019s full quote but the essence was one of Aiyar playing into PM Modi\u2019s hand and not about Modi misquoting Aiyar. In its prime time show at 9:55pm, the channel used the hashtag #MughalRaga.\n\nNDTVreported PM Modi\u2019s \u201cAurangzeb Raj\u201d dig but also carried the clarification by Mani Shankar Aiyar where he says that his statement was about contrasting the dynastic succession under the Mughals with the democratic process of electing the Congress chief.\n\nHow did prominent newspapers report the story?\n\nThe Times of India in its front page on December 5 carried a small column on the story. However, TOI in its report quoted the incomplete quote by Aiyar and mentioned that Aiyar \u2018later clarified that in a democracy, elections are held\u2019. This is misleading because Aiyar had spoken about the \u2018democratic process\u2019 bit in his original statement. TOI did report the complete statement but on page 15 of the newspaper.\n\nThe Hindi daily Amar Ujala too carried the story on its front page. Amar Ujala put out the series of quotes from Aiyar and PM Modi. Aiyar\u2019s quote was again clipped just as it was by media outlets like Republic.\n\nAlt News had called the bluff on Aiyar\u2019s statement yesterday. However, sections of mainstream media not only remained oblivious but chose to play up the fake report. A controversy was sought to be generated and sustained by reinforcing a false narrative through constant coverage. This is not the first time that mainstream media has distorted information and misrepresented news and by all indications this comes across as part of a pattern to manufacture consent.", "lang": "en"}
