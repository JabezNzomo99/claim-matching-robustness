At least 13 unique links carrying this claim were also flagged by Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool.

It was uploaded on July 30, 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the real initiatives Globe has done amid the Luzon lockdown include giving free data access to reliable and verified news sources, and providing free and unlimited public wifi in selected hospitals, airports, and supermarkets.\n\nGlobe is also doing a donation drive through its app, where subscribers can donate reward points to extend help to medical workers in the country.\n\nOn March 24, Globe said they turned over P14.2 million to the Philippine General Hospital Medical Foundation, Inc. \u2013 P9.2 million-worth of points from users and P5 million donation from Globe. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
