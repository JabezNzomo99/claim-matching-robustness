Expand the practice of absentee voting.\n\nIn North Carolina, top Republicans have said they want to keep the state\u2019s current absentee voting laws. A pair of Democrats -- Jay Chaudhuri of Wake County and Natasha Marcus of Mecklenburg -- have described North Carolina\u2019s absentee rules as antiquated.\n\n\"North Carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public,\" they wrote in an April 10 op-ed on Medium.com.\n\nIs it true that NC is in a \"minority\" of states that requires two people to witness an absentee ballot? Yes.\n\nA breakdown of absentee rules is available via the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that tracks various laws in each state.\n\nIn most states -- 31 according to the NCSL -- elections boards simply compare the voter\u2019s signature on an absentee ballot with a signature they already have on file for the voter. If there\u2019s a discrepancy, election officials investigate.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of eight states that requires a witness to sign a voter\u2019s absentee ballot, and one of only three states that requires the ballot to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isn\u2019t available. The other states are Alabama and Rhode Island.\n\nThe information on the NCSL website was confirmed as accurate by conference spokeswoman Wendy Underhill.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that North Carolina is the hardest state to return an absentee ballot.\n\nAlabama, in addition to requiring signatures from two witnesses or a notary, requires voters to submit a copy of a voter ID with his ballot.\n\nIn Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma, you can\u2019t have just any witness. The ballots are required to be signed by a notary.\n\nRules for who qualifies for an absentee ballot vary by state, too.\n\nState Senators Marcus and Chaudhuri said \"North Carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public.\"\n\nAccording to a nonpartisan organization that tracks state laws, NC is one of only three states (6 percent of the US) that requires absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public.
