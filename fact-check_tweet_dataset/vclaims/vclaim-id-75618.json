The suspect identified by police as 64-year old Stephen Craig Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada then turned a weapon on himself.\n\nThe attack, which authorities have steered clear of calling a terror attack, has been called the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nWhile police and journalists scrambled to piece together details how the attack unfolded, fake news filled the void.\n\nJournalists were seen fire-fighting fake posts about the identity of the suspect and his make believe links to ISIS. As was seen after the Manchester bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in May, retweet hungry individuals made up fake posts about missing people.\n\nMore worryingly fake news stories ran rampant on Twitter, Google and Facebook, demonstrating that their algorithms had been gamed by the velocity with which these stories were being shared.\n\nGOOGLE's TOP STORIES SHOWED LINK FROM MESSAGE BOARD WHICH MISIDENTIFIED THE SUSPECT\n\nGoogle's top stories unit displayed a link to a toxic, anything-goes messaging board called 4chan where anonymous users had misidentified the shooter as 'Geary Danley' and called him a leftist and a democrat, as pointed out by BuzzFeed's Ryan Broderick on Twitter.\n\nThe thread was picked up and fleshed out into a story by far-right website Gateway Pundit in its now deleted story -\n\nIn a statement given to news agencies, the search engine giant pinned responsibility on its algorithm.\n\nFACEBOOK'S 'SAFETY CHECK' PAGE DISPLAYED A LINK FROM A FAR RIGHT WEBSITE\n\nIn the case of Facebook, its 'Safety Check' page for the shooting displayed a story from a blog called 'Alt-Right-News'.\n\nOne look at the story which spins wild conspiracy theories shows why promoting it on Facebook was so problematic.\n\nTWITTER USERS MADE UP FAKE POSTS ABOUT THE SUSPECT\n\nSome Twitter users shared a photo that falsely claimed that the shooter had been identified as 'Islam Convert Samir Al Hajeed'. However, the photograph belonged to American stand-up comedian Sam Hyde.\n\nMany from the politically right spectrum were convinced that the shooter had converted to Islam and had links to ISIS. This was compounded when the terrorist organisation claimed responsibility for the attack but did not provide any evidence to support its claim. The Federal Bureau of Investigation rubbished the claim. (FBI: Las Vegas Shooter Stephen Paddock Didn't Have Any Connection to ISIS)\n\nAnd as people worried about the safety of friends and family at Las Vegas during the attack retweet hungry trolls thought it was a good idea to create fake missing persons posts.", "lang": "en"}
