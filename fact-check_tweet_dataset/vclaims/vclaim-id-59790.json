The search led us to the original picture which is NOT of Delhi Chief Minister.\n\nOn digging further, we found the same picture in a news report by The Indian Express dated July 17, 2016.\n\nAccording to the report, the picture was taken on July 16, 2016, when a bus got stranded at a waterlogged underpass near Sarita Vihar in New Delhi. The man in the picture is the driver of the bus, Rajinder.\n\nIn the above FAKE vs REAL collage, it is clear that Chief Minister Kejriwal\u2019s face was superimposed on the man\u2019s (Rajinder) face using photo editing software.\n\nMoreover, there was NO report or any social media post of Arvind Kejriwal either getting stranded in the waterlogged underpass or making the above statement.\n\nHence, we can conclude that the post in question is FAKE as the picture of Delhi CM is morphed and the statement is being falsely attributed to him.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
