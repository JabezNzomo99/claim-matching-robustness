An animated meme being spread on social media seems to show Gonzales and three other students who survived the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida doing just that but the video is manipulated. Here's an example in the wild in a tweet from @getongab, an alt-right friendly social network:\n\nWe archived that tweet here in case it goes down.\n\nIn fact the video came from a shoot for Teen Vogue, as Philip Picardi, Chief Content Officer for that magazine, clarifies on Twitter:\n\nAs you can clearly see, Gonz\u00e1les is actually ripping up a paper target of the kind normally found at a shooting range.\n\nWhile you can argue the \"March for our Lives\" movement indeed seeks to rip up the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in a figurative sense, the literal events in the video did not take place. Even though it was probably meant to be \"just a meme\", some sort of crowdsourced editorial cartoon offering an observation on current events, it looks quite realistic and could potentially fool many people into believing things really happened that did not occur.", "lang": "en"}
