In 2014, a 9-year-old girl accidentally shot and killed her instructor at a gun range in Arizona.\n\nIn addition, a number of gun-related deaths and injuries have occurred at gun shows proper, according to numerous news reports. Among them, five people in three states were injured when weapons accidentally went off at gun shows in one day in January 2013, while a man seriously injured himself outside an Iowa gun show by accidentally shooting himself in 2018.\n\nA 2017 study by the University of California at Berkeley found \u201ca nearly 70 percent increase in deaths and injuries from firearms in California communities within convenient driving distance of Nevada gun shows.\u201d The state of Nevada \u201chas some of the least restrictive firearm laws in the country and no explicit regulations on gun shows\u201d whereas California \u201chas some of the strongest firearm laws in the country,\u201d per the study.\n\nIn other words, not only are the facts behind the meme incorrect, but the logic is flawed. The meme appears to be an effort to support the gun-advocate talking point, \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people.\u201d The problem, however, is that gun shows are not just full of guns but also people.\n\nSo if people kill people, then logically one must ask: What would explain the purported lack of gun deaths at gun shows that the meme asserts? Furthermore, the Berkeley study appears to show that the degree of violence associated with gun shows is dictated not by the presence of guns at those shows, but gun regulations in the states they are held in. We therefore rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
