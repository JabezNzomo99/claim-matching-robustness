Don't believe it.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "Jul 15, 2020, 5:50 PM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-48902", "url": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-bong-go-quote-abs-cbn-shutdown-fake", "vclaim": "Senator Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go is the subject of a fake quote card on ABS-CBN circulating on Twitter since May 9.\n\nThe image, an altered May 4 infographic by news organization One News, alleges that Go blames the media network itself for going off the air on May 5:\n\n\u201cWala dapat sisihin sa pagsasara ng ABS-CBN kung hindi mismo sila. Kung hindi sana nila sinaktan ang damdamin ng Presidente eh hindi na sana hahantong pa sa ganito (No one should be blamed for the shutdown of ABS-CBN but the station itself. If they didn\u2019t hurt the President\u2019s feelings, it wouldn\u2019t have reached this point).\u201d\n\nA cursory search on Google shows no record of the former special aide to the president uttering that statement on May 4 or any other day. But Go did mention the president\u2019s \u201churt feelings\u201d during the Feb. 24 Senate hearing on ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise:\n\n\"Hindi mababaw ang rason ng pangulo sa kanyang grievances against the network. Nasaktan ang presidente, nababoy ang presidente (The president\u2019s grievances against the network are not superficial. The president was hurt. The president was disrespected).\u201d\n\nOne News has also debunked Go\u2019s fake quote in a May 9 tweet. The original infographic was Go\u2019s statement on the new rate for members\u2019 health insurance contribution to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth), where he urged the agency to grant the needed payment extension amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGo released a statement on the May 5 Cease-and-Desist Order by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) against ABS-CBN. Referring to a bill seeking to renew the network's franchise, the senator is \u201curging the House of Representatives to act on this matter with due haste.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon reaching the Senate and once we have had a chance to conduct our own hearings on the matter, that is when I will decide and vote according to my conscience and the interest of the Filipino people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fake quote card was made days after ABS-CBN was barred from operating past the expiration of its franchise on May 4.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s tweet of the fabricated quote card reached 147 retweets, 763 likes and 150 comments.", "lang": "en"}
