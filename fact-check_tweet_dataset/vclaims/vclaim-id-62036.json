The protest was held by a far right political party Islami Andolon Bangladesh on September 13, 2017.\n\nThe video is doing the rounds on Whatsapp with the caption: \"This is Bengal.

State religion will be Islam.\"\n\nAccording to reports, the protest rally towards Myanmar embassy was organised on the morning of September 13 by the political party Islami Andolan Bangladesh.
