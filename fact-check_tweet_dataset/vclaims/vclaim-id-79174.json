For example, some states included private school students who received public funding. That's why a uniform system was adopted.\n\nThe last time the rates were close to being this high was for the class that graduated in 1970, when the Education Department pegged the rate at 78.7 percent.\n\nYet because the current method for calculating rates is only 5 years old, it's not clear that the 1970 rate, or even the subsequent ones, are comparable to current rates.\n\nSince the mid 1970s until around 2008, according to data from , the annual rates consistently stayed at 75 percent or below.\n\nWith the new system, begun with the 2010-11 school year, rates were calculated to be 79 percent once again and have since been rising, albeit slowly. It was 80 percent for 2011-12, 81.4 percent for 2012-13, and 82.3 percent for 2013-14, the most recent rate available.\n\nEven when we checked this statistic two years ago, there was a consensus in the education community that graduation rates were rising. But uncertainty persists about those old rates.\n\nIf Obama had restricted his time frame to the past four years, the numbers would be on firmer ground.\n\nBut he didn't. He gave the impression that these were the highest rates ever.\n\nBecause Obama's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
