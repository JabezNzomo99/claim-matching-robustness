Now, it has been claimed that Rashid has been booked under sections of the IPC for her controversial tweet on Nitin Gadkari and RSS plotting the murder of PM Narendra Modi, a tweet which she subsequently defended as \u2018sarcasm\u2019.\n\n\u201cBooked under sections 153A, 295 and 295A of IPC\u201d\n\nRight-wing accounts on social media have claimed that union minister Nitin Gadkari has filed a case against Shehla Rashid, and that she has been booked under sections of the IPC that pertain to inciting religious sentiments. Among the earliest to tweet this was TheGiniKhan (@giniormet), whose tweet has been retweeted over 3500 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 7300 times. @giniormet is a popular right-wing handle that masquerades as a Muslim woman who is supportive of the BJP.\n\nSection 153A deals with \u2018promoting enmity between different groups\u2019, whereas section 295 pertains to defiling places of worship, and 295A of the IPC addresses \u2018deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage feelings\u2019.\n\n\u201cShehla Rashid @Shehla_Rashid Has Been Booked Under Sections of 153A, 295 and 295A of IPC by Shri Nitin Gadkari @nitin_gadkari Thank You \n\nNitin Ji Much Appreciated Now JNU Needs to Take Action & Remove her & Stop Spending Tax Payers Money On Such Crooks @Swamy39 @ShefVaidya\u201d, tweeted Sanatan Dharma, which has more than 7500 followers. The tweet has been retweeted more than 370 times and has accumulated more than 580 likes. An account named after Swati Raina, anchor with Zee Business, has also tweeted this claim which has been retweeted widely. It may be noted that this is not the official account of the journalist.\n\nAlt News contacted Parliament Street PoliceStation where it is claimed that the FIR has been lodged, to verify the status of the complaint. The police confirmed that no FIR has been lodged against Rashid, although a complaint has been received and investigation is underway. Moreover, Business Standard reported, The BJP\u2019s youth wing today filed a complaint with the police against Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Shehla Rashid for making \u201cunpleasant remarks\u201d against Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the organisation said in a statement.\n\nOn June 9, as reports emerged of a possible assassination plot on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rashid had tweeted, \u201cLooks like RSS/Gadkari is planning to assassinate Modi, and then blame it upon Muslims/Communists and then lynch Muslims #RajivGandhiStyle\u201c.\n\nThe tweet invited a great deal of controversy, following which Rashid claimed that the tweet is \u2018sarcastic\u2019. Nitin Gadkari, however, was unimpressed and threatened legal action against \u2018anti-social elements\u2019, refraining from naming anyone in his tweet.\n\nWhile her unsubstantiated allegation on Nitin Gadkari and the RSS have understandably caused controversy, it is no justification for misinformation of this nature that has been circulated in her name.", "lang": "en"}
