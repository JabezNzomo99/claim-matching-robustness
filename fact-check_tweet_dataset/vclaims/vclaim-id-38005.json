The Centre for Social justice is the think tank that first proposed Universal Credit, and it is chaired by former Conservative work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nBut this recommendation has not been adopted by the Conservative party. In August we spoke to the Department for Work and Pensions, which told us that it wasn\u2019t government policy to do this. At the time of writing the Conservatives had not announced such a policy either.\n\nState pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.", "lang": "en"}
