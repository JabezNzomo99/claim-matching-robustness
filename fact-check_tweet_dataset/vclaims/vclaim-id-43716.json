No, that's not true: the entire story was made up by a liberal satire weblog that likes to invent fake stories that are just outrageous enough that conservatives and Trump supportes like and share them without reading the full article. Fans of the site then mock them for it online. The story is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on September 18, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: ABC Cancels Monday Night Football After Worst Ratings Ever\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMonday Night Football will stay alive -- on small local station in the home team's town. The rest of us will now see the reboot of Tim Allen's \"Last Man Standing\" headlining what ABC calls \"A night for conservative Americans.\" ABC Executive Director of Media Relations and Sushi Inspection (the two are unrelated but warrant mention), Art Tubolls, told Fox News: \"The NFL is just finished on Monday Nights. Real Americans have jobs and don't stay up that late. Rather than wait until 9 PM for a game to start, Allen's show will go on at 8. After that we're testing a new show with Mike Rowe and Larry the Cable Guy doing a tandem thing, kinda like Dual Survival but with more of a political leaning. The final hour will be the new Jeopardy, starring Drew Carey, followed by re-runs of Happy Days, to honor the recently deceased Henry Winkler. We believe the average conservative will be asleep and dreaming about what they'll be angry at tomorrow long before halftime.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, with a short description designed to get people angry:\n\nHowever \"Art Tubbols\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the hoax website. He likes sushi.\n\nThe reference to \"Happy Days\" and the \"deceased\" Henry Winkler is a callback to an earlier death hoax from the same site:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trumpbetrayed.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
