It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\n\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger on TNT in 1994:\n\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O\u2019Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film Kazaam:\n\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens\u2019 movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\n\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \u201cMandela Effect,\u201d an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa\u2019s first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993 \u2014 all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\n\nAs an April Fool\u2019s Day joke in 2017, the College Humor web site posted \u201clost footage\u201d from the non-existent Shazaam film starring Sinbad (complete with references to the Mandela Effect):", "lang": "en"}
