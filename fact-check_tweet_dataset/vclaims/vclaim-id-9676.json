With video of a man being punched, stood upon and being tased by employees in front of other customers?\n\nA recent tweet published on March 21, 2018 by @Aleeex_Rod appears to show just that (we archived it here in case it gets taken down).\n\nHowever the tweet shows video from a June 2017 Montrose, Texas incident in which a man first attacked the employees in question:\n\nLater reporting indicated that the man was likely homeless and had caused trouble at the restaurant before.\n\nA fight involving employees at a Montrose-area Burger King and an apparent homeless man is bringing to light a larger issue with the city's new homeless ordinance, according to a security expert.
