This is known as a \u201ctrade deficit\u201d, as we\u2019re buying more than we are selling.\n\nIn 2017, the UK was the third most populated country in the EU, after Germany and France. As of 2016, it was the EU\u2019s second largest single export market for goods.\n\nExcluding trade between EU countries, the UK came second only to the US in goods exports from the EU.\n\nThe rest of the EU countries altogether sold about \u00a367 billion more in goods and services to the UK than we sold to them in 2017, according to UK data. In 2016, this was closer to \u00a375 billion.\n\nOur exports to the EU were worth about \u00a3274 billion in 2017, while the UK imported \u00a3341 billion\u2019s worth.\n\nBetween the UK and individual countries within the EU, our biggest trade deficit is with Germany, which sold us \u00a326 billion more goods and services to us than we sold to it in 2016.\n\nWe did not have trade deficits with Malta, Denmark, Sweden or Ireland in 2016, as we sold more to them than they sold to us. We sold almost \u00a36 billion more goods and services to Ireland than we bought from it in 2016.\n\nYou can read more about trade with the EU in our explainer here.\n\nHow does this compare to the UK\u2019s other trading partners?\n\nIn 2016 the UK bought more than it sold to Asia by around \u00a320 billion (so another trade deficit there). In 2017, China sold more to us than we sold to them by about \u00a323 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite case for trade with the US. In 2017 we sold over \u00a340 billion more to the US than we bought from them.\n\nWe sold more to countries in Africa than we bought by \u00a33 billion in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
