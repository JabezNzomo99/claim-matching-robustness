While these measures appeared to work in helping to \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of cases, they also caused a dramatic economic downturn and caused millions of people to lose their jobs.\n\nIn mid-April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump and the White House started working on a plan to \u201cre-open America.\u201d Around the same time, cities such as Lansing, Michigan, started to see small, anti-quarantine protests that Trump gave verbal support to on his social media account, tweeting \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege.\u201d\n\nAs Trump worked toward easing social distancing measures and re-starting the economy \u2014 a decision that worried many health experts \u2014 an old tweet started to recirculate on social media that supposedly showed him criticizing governors for relaxing quarantine rules during the Ebola outbreak in 2014:\n\nThis is a genuine tweet from Trump. It is still available on his Twitter timeline here. An archived version of this tweet can be seen here.\n\nTrump\u2019s old tweets are frequently shared on social media along with the message \u201cThere\u2019s a tweet for everything,\u201d a phrase meant to encapsulate the idea that for every current Trump statement there is an equal and opposite statement of his from another time. While many of the \u201cthere\u2019s-a-tweet-for-everything\u201d messages point to genuine and seemingly contradictory tweets from the president\u2019s past, we\u2019ve also encountered quite a few fake tweets supposedly sent from Trump.\n\nIt should also be noted that the quarantines in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak were much different than the quarantines put in place during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. In 2014, no state-wide \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders existed. Rather, a handful of states required people who had come in contact with someone infected with Ebola to quarantine for 21 days.\n\nTrump, who was the host of the television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d during the Ebola outbreak, frequently criticized President Barack Obama during that epidemic. On Oct. 23, 2014, for instance, he said it was \u201cObama\u2019s fault\u201d after a case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.\n\nConversely, in March 2020, Trump said \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility\u201d when he was asked about a lack of testing to deal with the spread of COVID-19.\n\nGuinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone saw more than 11,000 die from Ebola between 2014 and 2016. In the United States, two people died from the disease.", "lang": "en"}
