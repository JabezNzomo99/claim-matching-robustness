The claim is misleading; the photos in this image have circulated in reports about China testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook on March 7, 2020.\n\nIt features one photo of an individual wearing a white gown administering an injection into the arm of another person dressed in military fatigues. It also features a second image of seven people dressed in military fatigues and masks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post on Facebook:\n\nThe English and Chinese text in the image reads: \u201cFirst shot of Covid-19 vaccine developed by China. The postgraduate research team leader took the first shot. The world\u2019s first new coronavirus vaccine was injected into the left arm of the lead researcher, Dr Chen Wei, today. Seven medical volunteers, all members of the Communist Party also received the new Coronavirus vaccine. State Council Vice Premier Sun Chunlan visited Chen Wei and the expertise team members.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It has since spread worldwide, killing at least 13,000 and infecting 300,000 others, according to this AFP report dated March 22, 2020.\n\nThe image was also shared here, here, here, here and here on Facebook, here, here, here and here on Twitter and here on Instagram, alongside a similar claim.\n\nChinese state media organisation The People\u2019s Daily published this tweet on March 5, 2020 which labels the claim \u201cFAKENEWS\u201d, alongside a link to this post on its Facebook page.\n\nThe Facebook post reads, in part: \u201cPLA medics are not testing #COVID19 vaccines on themselves, as some would have you believe.\n\n\u201cPhotos of a female PLA medic getting a shot have gone viral on the Internet and have made many people wonder if the Chinese PLA is testing a coronavirus vaccine on themselves... the human clinical trial assumption is simply fake news.\u201d\n\nThe post was published alongside a photo identical to that seen in the misleading image. The People\u2019s Daily states the photo shows Chen Wei, an academician at China\u2019s People's Liberation Army, receiving a shot for \u201cstrengthening immunity\u201d before her departure to Wuhan to join the aid effort.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nBelow is screenshot comparison of the photo from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the photo from the People\u2019s Daily Facebook post (R):\n\nThis Global Times report dated March 4, 2020 states Chen was sent to Wuhan, and \u201cachieved a major breakthrough in developing a vaccine to the novel coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThe report states, in part: \u201cThe military medical expert team has worked in Wuhan, the coronavirus epicenter, for more than a month, and the team led by Chen Wei, academician at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Medical Sciences, is seizing every minute and second and focusing all efforts on this emergency scientific research\u201d.\n\nChina announced on March 17, 2020 that it will start human trials for a COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Chen\u2019s team.\n\nThis Global Times report published on the same date reads in part: \u201cThe coronavirus vaccine developed by Chen's team passed the registration review of clinical research and was approved for clinical trial on Monday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter arriving at Wuhan, Chen Wei, a Chinese military major general, and her team launched pharmacy, pharmaceutical and toxicological research on COVID-19 vaccine in cooperation with local companies, based on their previous successful experiences in developing Ebola vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cChen, the military scientist, was quoted as saying in the report that the vaccine has been tested on safety, effectiveness and quality control and is prepared for massive production. And the biotechnology firm has started to recruit volunteers for the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is currently no medicine that can prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\nThe Q&A section of its website reads, in part: \u201cTo date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019\u2026 Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
