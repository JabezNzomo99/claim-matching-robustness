What's more shocking is that these complex words that were so difficult for people in China to understand is actually called tea in India, YES, our regular tea has all these chemicals already in it.'\n\nMaria Celia urged her family and friends to share the post widely. She also claims, \"The hospital staff in china has started serving tea to the patients three times a day.\"\n\nHere is the archived version of the post.\n\nWithin hours, the post has been shared by around 1,000 people.\n\nThe post is doing rounds on WhatsApp and Twitter as well.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading.\n\nWe checked out the CNN website, but could not find any such news. We searched their Twitter handle for breaking news, but no such thing was reported.\n\nWe found a report about China's whistleblower doctor on CNN but that article too does not talk about the medication he suggested nor does it talk about the utility of the chemical compounds of tea as claimed by social media users.\n\nOn Google search too, we found no reports that support the claim. Also, there are no reports that doctors in China are serving tea to Covid-19 patients.\n\nWe found a news report by China Daily related to this topic.\n\nAccording to this report, researchers from the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention found through experiments that because of its chemical components, drinking tea could help prevent novel coronavirus infections.\n\nBut later the article was removed by the Zhejiang CDC on February 26, China Daily reported.\n\nAs of now, scientists are still working on trying to create a vaccine for Covid-19.\n\nHere is an article published in The New York Times.\n\nA few tentative medications are suggested but they are yet to be proved useful.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also does not mention any specific medication.\n\nSo it can be concluded that there is no evidence that supports the claim of the social media users and hence the post is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
