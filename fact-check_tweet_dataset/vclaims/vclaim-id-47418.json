Along with the post, some have shared a link of an article by \u201cThe New York Times\u201d titled, \u201cNipah Virus, Rare and Dangerous, Spreads in India\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The last WHO alert of a Nipah virus outbreak in India was in August 2018.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nThe article by \u201cThe New York Times\u201d shared along with the message, was originally published on June 4, 2018. As per this news report, Nipah (NiV) had the potential to turn into an epidemic as it had already killed 17 out of 18 people infected by then in Kerala.\n\nThe latest warning from WHO on August 7, 2018, confirmed that till July 17 that year, 19 cases had been reported, of which 17 had died in Kerala. But it also mentioned, \u201cNo new cases or deaths have been reported since 1 June 2018 and, as of 30 July, human-to-human transmission of NiV has been contained in Kerala State.\u201d\n\nNipah is a zoonotic virus, i.e. transmitted from animals to humans, but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people. In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis.\n\nThe fatality rate is quite high for Nipah infection. According to WHO, the case fatality rate is estimated at 40-75 per cent.\n\nTherefore, the viral message saying WHO has now warned about a Nipah outbreak in India is misleading. This is a two-year-old warning and there has been no fresh alert from the global health body.", "lang": "en"}
