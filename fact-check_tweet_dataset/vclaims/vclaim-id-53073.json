A misleading caption was added to the graphic, insinuating Sackur was stating that Ressa is a \u201ctax evader.\u201d\n\nOn June 28, FB page Pinas Ang Ina Nyo wrote a three-paragraph caption that started with the baseless pronouncement that the \u201centire world knows\u201d Ressa was \u201creceiving money\u201d from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States. It ended with this sentence:\n\n\u201c...alam pa ni Stephen Sackur na isang huwad at tax evader ang Rappler CEO at convicted criminal na si Maria Ressa (Stephen Sackur knows Rappler CEO and convicted criminal Maria Ressa is fake and is a tax evader).\u201d\n\nThis is erroneous. Sakur, in his program HARDtalk, was only enumerating to Ressa the \u201callegations\u201d against the Filipino journalist. His complete statement was:\n\n\u201c...my show is called HARDtalk and I have to take seriously the charges against you because as you indicated, you\u2019ve indicated that the libel is the least of it. You still face allegations of -- my goodness, what a list -- fraud, tax evasion, receiving money from the CIA. I mean, you could be in court for years and years to come.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s episode featuring Ressa was published online on June 30. In the video\u2019s caption, Pres. Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s political leadership was referred to as a \u201cstrongman style\u201d characterized by the \u201cvisceral dislike of scrutiny from the independent media.\u201d\n\nRappler is one of several media organizations in the Philippines that have been attacked by the president since 2016. In 2017, he accused the outfit of being \u201cowned by an American\u201d then of being run by ABS-CBN Corp. In 2018, Duterte called Rappler a \u201cfake news outlet\u201d and barred its reporter from attending Malaca\u00f1ang's press briefings. This came after the online news outfit came out with a special report on the supposed link of then Special Assistant to the President Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go to the Armed Forces of the Philippines\u2019 multi billion-peso deal to acquire warships.\n\nOn June 15, Ressa, and former Rappler researcher and writer Reynaldo Santos Jr., were convicted of cyber-libel over a story accusing a local businessman of involvement in \u201chuman trafficking and drug smuggling.\u201d\n\nOn June 29, the two filed a motion for the Manila Regional Trial Court to reconsider its decision.\n\nSocial media tool CrowdTangle showed Pinas Ang Ina Nyo\u2019s post could have reached over 2.1 million social media users, garnering almost 10,000 interactions from netizens.\n\nThe post\u2019s top traffic generator is Pinas Ang Ina Nyo itself, alongside public groups REAL PHILIPPINE HISTORY and Rodrigo Duterte Supporters Cebu (RDS Cebu). Pinas Ang Ina Nyo was created in August 2015.", "lang": "en"}
