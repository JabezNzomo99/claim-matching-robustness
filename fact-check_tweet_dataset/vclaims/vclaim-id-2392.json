One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said.\n\nSchwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties.\n\nThe treasurer\u2019s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction.\n\nBut given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data.\n\nWe found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016.\n\n\"Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That\u2019s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that\u2019s obvious,\" said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley.\n\nA treasurer\u2019s office fact sheet promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are \"built or rehabilitated.\"\n\nNot just a coat of paint\n\nRepresentatives for the treasurer told us they\u2019ve always interpreted the term \"building, construction\" as including both new and rehabilitated units.\n\nMark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than \"just slapping paint\" on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction.\n\nSchwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California\u2019s limited affordable housing stock.\n\nHe added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state.\n\nCalifornia State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he\u2019s helped boost \"the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent\" since he took office in 2015.\n\nData from the treasurer\u2019s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016.\n\nBut Chiang\u2019s claim omits the fact that less than half were new units added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes. Experts told us such improvements help preserve affordable housing, but don\u2019t necessarily expand it.\n\nA fact sheet on the treasurer\u2019s website gets the details right.\n\nBut Chiang's statement in a campaign video and later in a Facebook post leave out this important context.\n\nFor this reason, we rate Chiang\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nPolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 California governor's race through our Tracking The Truth series.\n\nHear a claim you want fact-checked?
