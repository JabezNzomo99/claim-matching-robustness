It originated from an article published by a satire website.\n\nThe long statement, purportedly from Gibson, includes favorable comments about President Donald Trump and negative comments about liberals. He allegedly said liberals \u201chave no moral code\u201d and \u201chate God.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiberals absolutely hate this president,\u201d the statement reads, in part. \u201cIt makes no sense considering all the good he\u2019s done and all he has planned. Why would an American hate this man who is doing everything that\u2019s needed to finally fix America?\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Gibson ever making the remark. Check Your Fact didn\u2019t find any media outlets crediting him with making the statement, which almost certainly would have made headlines. A Facebook page using Gibson\u2019s name and likeness posted a similar quote on May 22, but that account is not verified and does not appear to be affiliated with the actor in any capacity.\n\nThe long statement attributed to Gibson originated in an article published on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that creates \u201cparody, satire and tomfoolery.\u201d While the Facebook post does not make the satirical nature of the quote clear, Bustatroll.org disclaims, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nGibson has spoken publicly about politics in the past. In a Univision interview in early November 2016, he said \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be a very good option for me\u201d in reference to then-presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.", "lang": "en"}
