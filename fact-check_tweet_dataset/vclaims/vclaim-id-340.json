The viral meme alleges Trump told People magazine in 1998 that Republicans are \u201cthe dumbest group of voters in the country\u201d. This is false.\n\nWhile the quote has been debunked several times since it apparently surfaced in 2015, users have recently been resharing it on social media. Examples can be seen here , here , here , here\n\nThe meme reads: \u201cIf I were to run, I\u2019d run as a Republican. They\u2019re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific. - Donald Trump, People Magazine, 1998\u201d\n\nSnopes first wrote about the false quote here in October 2015 . Since then, the quote has been debunked multiple times ( here , here , here ).\n\nPeople magazine has confirmed in the past that its archive has no register of this alleged exchange.\n\n\u201cPeople looked into this exhaustively when it first surfaced back in Oct. (2015). We combed through every Trump story in our archive. We couldn\u2019t find anything remotely like this quote\u2013and no interview at all in 1998.\u201d, a magazine spokesperson told Factcheck.org that year ( here ).\n\nPeople\u2019s magazine archive shows Trump did appear in the publication in the 1990s, but the coverage was mostly centered on his personal relationships ( here , here , here ). On September 2, 1987, shortly after releasing a full-page newspaper ad criticizing U.S. foreign policy, Trump identified himself as a Republican during an interview with CNN\u2019S Larry King ( youtu.be/A8wJc7vHcTs?t=24 ). Trump also explicitly told King that he had no interest in running for president ( youtu.be/A8wJc7vHcTs?t=297 ).\n\nIn December 1987, People published a profile on Donald Trump titled \u201cToo Darn Rich\u201d. The article quoted him saying he was too busy to run for president ( here ).\n\nMost iterations of the meme feature a photo of Trump during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1988, when he said he would probably not run for president but wouldn\u2019t rule it out ( youtu.be/SEPs17_AkTI?t=55 ).\n\nWhile other articles and interviews from the late 1980s and 1990s show Trump did publicly speak about his political affiliations and the possibility of running for office ( here ), there is no evidence of him ever saying the alleged quote or making any similar statement.\n\nFalse. Trump did not say Republicans were \u201cthe dumbest group of voters\u201d. This debunked meme has been circulating online since 2015.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
