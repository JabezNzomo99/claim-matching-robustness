Wallace does not appear to have a personal Twitter account.\n\nTrump tweeted criticism of the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host after Wallace interviewed Republican Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise Nov. 17. (RELATED: Did Four Republicans Vote To Impeach Trump?)\n\n\u201c[email protected] blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris\u2019s lowest rated (unless I\u2019m on) morning show,\u201d tweeted Trump. \u201cThis kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than a thousand times, alleges that Wallace fired back at Trump with a tweet of his own, making derogatory remarks about the president. It includes a supposed screen grab of their exchange.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump And you\u2019ll never be your father either, (Fred Trump), a self made Billionaire. You\u2019re a fraud. A Charlatan. A thug. A loser. A trust fund baby. A punk. A serial adulterer. A p***y grabber,\u201d Wallace purportedly tweeted. \u201cMy job is to be a journalist, not a flunky and a propaganda arm for your criminal behavior and corruption. If you want propaganda, go watch Hannity, Ingram, Pirro, and Tucker who do nothing but kiss your ass.\u201d\n\nCloser inspection of the screen grabbed tweet reveals that it is fake. It has the wrong name \u2013 \u201cChris Wallace\u201d rather than \u201cFoxNewsSunday\u201d \u2013 and the text is center justified. Additionally, Twitter only allows for 280 characters, whereas the alleged tweet has more than 400.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s no record of the verified \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d account ever tweeting the statement. Wallace does not appear to have a personal Twitter account.\n\nA Fox News representative confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the tweet is indeed fake. Wallace has not issued an official response to Trump\u2019s tweet, per a Fox News spokesperson who spoke to The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
