Alaska, meanwhile, was at the bottom with an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Department of Workforce Development reported the state added 11,400 total non-farm jobs and 19,300 private-sector jobs from February of 2018 to February of 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin's labor force participation rate -- a measuring stick that looks at the other side of the equation -- was 67.5 percent in February. That was more than four points better than the national rate.\n\nTrump said Wisconsin had the lowest unemployment rate ever at a recent rally in Green Bay.\n\nThe available data backs up his claim that Wisconsin hasn\u2019t had a lower unemployment rate to its 2.9 percent.", "lang": "en"}
