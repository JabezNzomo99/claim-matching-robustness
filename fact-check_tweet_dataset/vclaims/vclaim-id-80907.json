App Using Phone Camera for Measuring Oxygen Levels Not Reliable A viral WhatsApp message claims that an app called \u2018Pedometer 2018\u2019 can detect oxygen levels and heart rate just by placing the finger on the rear camera of the mobile phone. However, Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head, department of Pulmonology & Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh told The Quint that while the technology used in oximeter can be put in any device, if the phone does not have the required technology, an app alone cannot measure the oxygen levels. Further, the app in question has now been taken down from Google Play Store. A viral message falsely claimed that an app can help in measuring the oxygen levels.

However, it\u2019s actually the National President of Muslim Karsevak Manch, Kunwar Azam Khan who made the statement and not the SP leader. The claim was also shared by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra and Swarajya, a right-wing English magazine. However, both of them corrected themselves later. A statement made by the national president of Muslim Karsevak Manch was falsely attributed to SP leader Azam Khan.\n\nWe searched using keywords \u201cazam khan ayodhya jal samadhi\u201d and found a News18 article published on Saturday, 25 July, which mentioned that Muslim Karsevak Manch National President Azam khan had said that he will commit \u201cjalsamadhi\u201d if he is not invited to \u2018Bhoomi Pujan\u2019 (foundation stone laying) on 5 August.

Photos of Cremation in UP Falsely Shared as Organ Trafficking Racket A number of photos showing what seems like the cremation of a body in an electric crematorium are being shared with the claim that they show an organ trafficking racket that is taking place amid the coronavirus pandemic in Maharashtra. However, The Quint found that they actually show a Lucknow-based woman carrying out the cremation of an unclaimed body. We found that the pictures actually show a Lucknow-based NGO carrying out the last rites of an unclaimed body.\n\nOn running a reverse image search on the photos, we were led to a website called Delhi Crime Press, which had carried the photos along with the same claim as in the viral posts as a story. We found that the story was credited to an Om Shukla, who is Special Crimes Investigator, according to his Facebook bio. Then, on Facebook, we ran a keyword search with Shukla\u2019s name, along with \u2018'\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0935 \u0905\u0902\u0917\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0940\u2019 (human organ trafficking) and came across a post by a Lucknow-based woman by the name of Versha Verma. According to her post, dated 21 July, she was the woman seen in the viral photos. In her post, she calls out Shukla for misusing her photos to falsely claim that an organ racket was taking place in Maharashtra and clarified that she and her colleague Deepak Mahajan, through their NGO Ek Koshish Aisi Bhi, cremated unclaimed bodies.

A message is going viral on social media stating that the vaccine against COVID-19 produced by Bharat Biotech has received permission from the central government and will be available in the market from 15 August. The message is being shared with a letter from ICMR about fast-tracking the clinical trials of the vaccine. While the letter being shared from the Director General of ICMR about the Bharat Biotech vaccine is in no way fake or altered, the viral message along with it lacks the context that came after this letter was issued on 2 July. The message is viral without context.\n\nIn the letter, ICMR says that it has partnered with Bharat Biotech lnternational Limited to fast-track clinical trials of the vaccine produced by the company, which is India\u2019s first indigenous COVID-19 vaccine candidate, named Covaxin. Further, the letter, addressed to a site chosen for clinical trial, does indeed say that it \u201cis envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15th August 2020 after completion of all clinical trials.\u201d But it also adds that \u201cfinal outcome will depend on the cooperation of all clinical trial sites involved in this project.\u201d You can read the full story here. A 3D rendition of a large, grand temple is being falsely shared as a photo of the plan of what the upcoming Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will look like. However, we found that this is actually the plan for the ISKCON temple in West Bengal\u2019s Mayapur and not the Ram Mandir at all. The structure seen below is being shared as the proposed appearance of the Ram Mandir and is being shared on social media with the message, \u201cArchitectural view of proposed 'Ram Mandir' in Ayodhya....Jai Jai Shree Ram..\u201d A 3D rendition of the ISKCON Temple in Bengal\u2019s Mayapur is being shared as the proposed appearance of Ram Mandir.", "lang": "en"}
