PANGULONG DUTERTE NAKAKAKUHA NG 94.03% POSITIVE RATING SA PINAKA MAGALING NA PRESIDENTE (Wow! President Duterte got 94.03% positive rating as best president)!\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s content, a video uploaded May 1 by YouTube channel Showbiz Fanaticz, makes no such claim, however.\n\nThe video instead reported that actress Aiai de las Alas supposedly said in her Instagram account she was proud to be part of the \u201c94.03 percent of Filipinos\u201d who believe the chief executive can solve the current crisis, after answering a poll on a Facebook page.\n\nNo such post can be seen in the actress\u2019 Instagram feed. News Viral Online also did not disclose the name of the supposed FB page.\n\nA cursory search shows the 94.03 percent figure could have been drawn from the results of a poll conducted by consultancy firm EON Group and research firm Tangere, released April 17. Of 5,425 participants, 5,101 or 94.03% voted \u201cYes\u201d in a question asking whether or not they trust Duterte amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe videos emerged after several news organizations picked up the survey almost two weeks after results were released.\n\nNews Viral Online\u2019s misleading post could have reached over 4.4 million people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. It started publishing stories only last March.\n\nThis is not the blog\u2019s first time publishing misleading posts.
