Batchelder, up for re-election Nov. 6, 2012, recently sought the support of The Plain Dealer\u2019s editorial board. \n\n \n\n During an endorsement interview on Sept. 18, 2012, the subject turned to healthcare in Ohio and the Medina Republican, among other things, noted the state\u2019s impressive network of children\u2019s hospitals was worth bragging about. \n\n \n\n For example, Ohio is the only state with a \"flagship, world-class children\u2019s hospital within two hours of every child living in the state,\" according to the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association. \n\n \n\n During the interview, Batchelder noted that \"We (Ohio) have more hospitals that are children\u2019s hospitals than any other state in the union.\" \n\n \n\n That got Politifact Ohio\u2019s attention. \n\n \n\n The Buckeye State is large, but not as populous as, say, California, New York or Texas. So, could it really have more children\u2019s hospitals than any other state? \n\n \n\n PolitiFact Ohio asked Batchelder\u2019s office where the speaker got this information. The speaker\u2019s spokeswoman, Shannon Boston, directed us back to the website of the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospitals\u2019 Solutions for Patient Safety, a non-profit organization that works to align the vision of all of Ohio\u2019s children\u2019s hospitals. \n\n \n\n And how many hospitals does it list? Eight. \n\n \n\n Boston contends that Ohio is tied with Texas and California, which also each have eight children\u2019s hospitals according to organizations in those states similar to the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association \u2014 the California Children\u2019s Hospital Association and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association of Texas. \n\n \n\n But a closer look found that the hospitals listed on those websites to which we were directed for hospitals in California and Texas only represent a portion of all children\u2019s hospitals in those states. These state hospital associations are member-based organizations and not every hospital is necessarily a member and listed on the websites. \n\n \n\n In fact, Angela Krile, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association, when asked about Batchelder\u2019s claim, said: \"I have never heard that we have the most children\u2019s hospitals but we do have the highest rated system of children\u2019s hospitals in the country.\" \n\n \n\n The second part of her comment, about Ohio\u2019s hospitals being highest rated, would indeed be noteworthy. But it is the first part of her comment that PolitiFact Ohio is checking for this article. \n\n \n\n PolitiFact Ohio checked with the National Association of Children\u2019s Hospitals. Spokeswoman Gillian Ray directed us to a state-by-state list of children\u2019s hospitals on its website.\n\n \n\n By its count, Ohio hardly has the most children\u2019s hospitals in the country. \n\n \n\n Not even close. Here\u2019s what we found:\n\nThe site includes the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Cincinnati and the Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital for Rehabilitation, two hospitals that are not members of the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospitals\u2019 Solutions for Patient Safety or the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association, which lists just six member hospitals. \n\n \n\n Ray said that the national list is all-inclusive, meaning it lists all the children\u2019s hospitals according to their primary mission or duty: free-standing children\u2019s hospitals, like Akron Children\u2019s, specialty hospitals like Shriners in Cincinnati (which focuses on burn patients), or teaching hospitals, such as, Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s in Cleveland, which is affiliated with the medical school at Case Western Reserve University. \n\n \n\n For what it\u2019s worth, Batchelder did get that endorsement from The Plain Dealer\u2019s editorial board. \n\n \n\n But the organizations referenced by the speaker\u2019s staff in support of his claim were not umbrella organizations that represent all children\u2019s hospitals and their lists were far from complete. Even the two Ohio-based children\u2019s hospital associations do not list the same number of hospitals, and neither lists every children\u2019s hospital in the state. \n\n \n\n As an aside, there clearly appears to be a strong network of children\u2019s hospitals in Ohio which draws the state high rankings in several areas of care, accessibility and amount of research taking place at the various institutions. But all that does not add up to having the most available hospitals of their kind as compared to other states, as Batchelder claimed. \n\n \n\n On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.", "lang": "en"}
