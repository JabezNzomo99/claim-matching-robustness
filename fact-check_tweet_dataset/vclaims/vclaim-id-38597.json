Along with the post a screengrab has been shared showing the photo of a man and it has been presented in a news format. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named Steve Lock claims that Alcohol kills coronavirus. Along with the post a screengrab has been shared showing the photo of a man and it has been presented in a news format. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News earlier investigated in its previous posts that there is no medicine recommended to prevent coronavirus as per World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer for washing hands as a preventive action to help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nWorld Health Organization also suggests that one should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water to protect yourself from novel coronavirus.\n\nWorld Health Organization also debunked a myth related to alcohol and coronavirus. It stated that spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sajeev Kumar who is a General Physician. He refuted the claim that alcohol can kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe format of the viral post is similar to the post we debunked earlier. In the earlier posts we debunked (Weed kills coronavirus and Cocaine kills coronavirus) were created using the same news format.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
