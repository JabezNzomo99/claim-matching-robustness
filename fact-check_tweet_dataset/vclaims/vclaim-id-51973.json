Treasury data shows Kenya\u2019s ordinary revenue would have paid for debt due a number of times over.\n\u2022 None Revenue raised from taxes is also used to pay recurrent government expenses like salaries and pensions, and disbursed to Kenya\u2019s 47 counties. \n\n\n\n\n\nfor the 2020/21 financial year promises to be a tough balancing act for Kenya, with the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nfor \u201cthe suspension of interest payments\u201d on \u201cpublic and private debt\u201d for Africa.\n\nBut in February 2020, just before the enormity of the\n\nabout the country\u2019s public debt, and the pressure it was putting on spending plans.\n\nis a non-partisan team of technocrats that advises parliamentarians on the economy, tax and the budget.\n\nReporting on the budget office\u2019s presentation to lawmakers, Kenyan newspaper the\n\nsaid that \u201call\u201d of the country\u2019s taxation money is spent paying back debt.\n\n\u201cAll the ordinary revenue collected by Kenya Revenue Authority is used to repay the loans \u2013 local and foreign \u2013 currently worth more than KSh6 trillion [US$56.5 billion],\u201d the daily\n\nDoes Kenya spend all its \u201cordinary\u201d revenues paying back local and foreign debts? We ran the numbers.\n\nWhat was the evidence for the claim?\n\nAs the source of its claim, the Star cited a budget office report, \u201cThe Shuteye Economy: Unpacking the 2020/21 Budget Policy Statement\u201d.\n\n. This showed that from the 2014/15 financial year to 2019/20 interest payments\n\nBut the report did not state how much of the principal debt was repaid. To get a sense of this we turned to treasury data.\n\nHow much is Kenya\u2019s local and foreign debt?\n\nto publish a report on the financial and non-financial position of the national government every quarter. The most recent\n\nplaced the public debt at KSh6.05 trillion in December 2019. (\n\u2022 None Domestic debt of KSh2.94 trillion or 49% of the total.\n\u2022 None External debt of KSh3.1 trillion or 51% of the total. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor the current 2019/20 financial year,\n\nas total debt repayment - both principal and interest. In 2018/19\n\nwas used to repay debt.\n\nfrom KSh974 billion in 2013/14 to KSh1.5 trillion in 2018/19. But the forecasted KSh1.85 trillion for 2019/20 is likely to be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTaken together, all ordinary revenue would have met the country\u2019s debt obligations at least twice over.\n\nIn that period ordinary revenue has also been used to pay recurring expenditure such as wages and salaries, pensions, and allocations to county governments.\n\nThe Star left out these other payments when it said that all ordinary revenue raised was used to repay debt. In addition, all debt is not due at the same time.\n\nThe newspaper claim that all ordinary revenue was used to repay loans is incorrect, John Kinuthia,\n\n\u201cThat is just misleading,\u201d Kinuthia said.\n\nConclusion: Newspaper claim that all of Kenya\u2019s tax money goes to repay debt not accurate\n\nReporting on a presentation to Kenya\u2019s senate about the country\u2019s growing debt, a national newspaper claimed that all the tax revenue collected by the state tax agency is used to repay local and foreign debt.\n\nA review of the documents used by the parliamentary budget office shows that this \u201cordinary\u201d revenue has gone to more than just debt. It has also paid recurrent costs, like salaries, and been disbursed to Kenya\u2019s 47 counties.\n\nTreasury documents also show that the ordinary revenue raised in recent financial years would have met the country\u2019s debt obligations a number of times over. In 2018/19repayment of debt due was about 43% of ordinary revenue.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
