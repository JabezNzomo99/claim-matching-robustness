It has been shared in the Facebook group WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI with the message \u201cIf they had won everywhere then Pakistani flags would be seen in India, even after such humiliation you are mindless\u201d(translated), apart from the group I AM WITH PM MODI AND YOU?and the page Begusarai Zee News.\n\nThe group has over 29 lakh members and has been found to spread misinformation in the past. The picture has gone viral on Twitter where it has been shared widely in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlt News reverse searched the image on Google and found that it was taken in 2017. We found the same photograph in an article by The Hindupublished on April 17, 2017.\n\nAccording to the report, the people seen in the photograph are workers of the Indian Union Muslim League, a political outfit based in Kerala. The workers were celebrating a bypoll victory. By-election had taken place on the Malappuram Lok Sabha seat on April 12, 2017 in which IUML leader P N Kunhalikutty had emerged victorious.\n\nIUML flag different from flag of Pakistan\n\nThe IUML flag has often been passed off as the national flag of Pakistan. As recently as April 2019, IUML flags at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s pre-nomination roadshow were falsely claimed to be Pakistani flags.\n\nBoth flags- IUML and Pakistan, are green in colour. The similarity however ends there. The two banners have been juxtaposed and posted below for comparison.\n\nAn old photograph of a political rally, dating back to 2017 has been shared as a recent image, with the false claim that it represents celebration in Wayanad following Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Lok Sabha victory from there.", "lang": "en"}
