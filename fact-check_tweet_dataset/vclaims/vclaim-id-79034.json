Raul Torres announced his run for comptroller, he claimed a historic advantage:\n\n\"I\u2019m a certified public accountant and would be the very first CPA to serve in this office,\" he said in an Aug. 27, 2013, online campaign video.\n\nTorres, a Republican elected in 2010 who served one term representing Corpus Christi\u2019s District 33, has been a certified public accountant since 1993. Later in the video, he said, \"Can you believe that this office, which manages your tax dollars, has never had an accountant as its head officer?\"\n\nWell, can we believe it?\n\nTorres told us by phone that he and his campaign staff checked Wikipedia and other online sources for biographical information on Texas comptrollers back to 1896, when the was handed out in New York.\n\n\"I drew my own conclusion that there was no other person with the designation of CPA,\" Torres said.\n\nWe started our research with current officeholder Susan Combs, who left the comptroller\u2019s race wide open when she in May 2013 that she would retire. Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us by email that she holds a law degree and directed us to her official online, but said the office had no biographical information on previous comptrollers.\n\nA word on the word, which some pronounce \"controller\" or \"comtroller\": The \"p\" snuck in there during the 15th century, an Oxford English Dictionary editor the New York Times in 2010. It appears that Middle English \"counteroller,\" a person who checks two scrolls against each other, crashed into French \"compte,\" count.\n\nTexas\u2019 comptroller of public accounts collects state taxes and predicts how much the state will be able to spend, among other duties, and checks to make sure the budget adopted by the Legislature every two years is balanced.\n\nTorres said the knowledge of professional standards and skills required to become a CPA, which include performing audits and making reliable estimates, would be of use in the job. Becoming comptroller doesn't require special qualifications, though. DeSilva said the eligibility standards are the usual ones for a Texas candidate: U.S. citizen, 18 or older, not a felon, etc.\n\nFor information on comptrollers past, DeSilva suggested we consult the Texas State Library. There, reference and documents librarian Sue Troyan emailed us the Texas Almanac\u2019s list of comptrollers since 1835, when the provisional government of the Republic of Texas created the office.\n\nThe Republic\u2019s first comptroller is listed as John H. Money, but that surname might be too good to be true; we found him as John H. Morey in older editions.\n\nFor this fact-check we restricted ourselves, as Torres did, to comptrollers after 1896.\n\nAt the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, general counsel Jerry Hill told us by email that none of the folks on our list popped up in the database of certificates issued since , when the agency began administering CPA .\n\nThat helps considerably, but doesn\u2019t cover our whole timespan, and it\u2019s limited to CPAs who were certified in Texas. So we set to gathering descriptions from sources including the Austin American-Statesman archives, the Texas State Historical Association, the and materials sent to us by Troyan and reference librarian Kay Schlueter at the . Our full list of sources is at right.\n\nHere are the jobs we found Texas\u2019 chief financial officers held before they became comptrollers:\n\nJustice of the peace, businessman, cotton warehouse owner, financial agent for Texas penitentiaries. Teacher, Confederate soldier, farmer, sheriff, U.S. marshal. in the comptroller\u2019s office by an ex-employee whom he . Said to the Capitol. Farmer, merchandiser, stockman, county district clerk, chief deputy U.S. marshal to Love and then chief bookkeeper under Love in the comptroller\u2019s office. Businessman -- likely including a stint as manager of the carpet department at a -- a state representative. \u201cPipelines do not freeze. They are naturally insulated. They\u2019re buried beneath the ground.\u201d A state representative in 1919; possibly an anti-Prohibition activist before that, based on a Dec. 9, 1904, in the Itasca Item, and a speaker for a fraternal group offering life insurance, to the Feb. 19, 1917, Bartlett Tribune and News. Second lieutenant in the Army during World War I, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs . Alleged fiscal misdeeds as comptroller led to an , during which he resigned. Army Air Forces; for a railway and an electric company was a bank teller before becoming a statistician in comptroller\u2019s office and chief clerk in comptroller\u2019s office. The longest-serving comptroller was among the most controversial; in 1973, aged 81, he drew by using a racial slur to describe Eddie Bernice Johnson (then a state representative from Dallas, now a U.S. representative), who sought to have him impeached for racial discrimination. Air Force, lawyer, state representative, assistant attorney general, secretary of state. Credited with modernizing the office and, eventually, most of Texas\u2019 government as well.\n\nOnly a few of the jobs seem related to accountancy: Stephens\u2019 post as chief bookkeeper and Calvert\u2019s stints as a statistician and then chief clerk, all within the comptroller\u2019s office itself. But neither man, as far as we could tell, worked as a professional accountant outside the comptroller\u2019s office. We figured that it was unlikely they would have sought certification.\n\nTorres said he\u2019d be \"the very first CPA to serve\" as state comptroller.\n\nWe\u2019re not judging here whether the comptroller needs to be a CPA. But we found nobody with that certification in the checkered past of the comptroller\u2019s office, so we\u2019ll rate Torres\u2019 claim as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
