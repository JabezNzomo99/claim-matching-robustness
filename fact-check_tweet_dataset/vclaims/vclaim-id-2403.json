Of those who responded 47% said that EU nationals working for them were considering leaving as a direct result of the EU referendum. 31% said EU nationals had already left and 21% said that there had been no change since June last year.\n\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that someone considering leaving the UK doesn\u2019t tell us whether or not they eventually will. A survey like this is a cause for concern, but it\u2019s not proof of an impending exodus of workers.\n\nSecondly, this also doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the number of businesses or proportion of workers it affects. Some of the respondents to the survey were small businesses employing fewer than 50 people. Others were trade associations representing over 200 businesses and one million people. Each will count as just one response in the survey results.\n\nAnother question the survey asked was how confident the respondents would be in their ability to employ workers from the EU over the next two years (until the date the UK officially leaves the EU). Just over half aren\u2019t confident they will be able to fill all of the unskilled or low-skilled roles they need while about a quarter aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019ll be able to fill the highly skilled posts.\n\nIn response to another question, around half said that their businesses would seek to recruit locally if it didn\u2019t have access to any EU nationals. 36% said their business would become unviable.", "lang": "en"}
