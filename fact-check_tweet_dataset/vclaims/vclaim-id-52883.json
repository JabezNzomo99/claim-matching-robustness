But during his April 2019 presidential candidacy video, he did not specifically refer to antifa, an anti-fascist movement that sometimes resorts to violence.\n\nBiden\u2019s 2019 comments referred to the events of August 2017, when violence broke out in Charlottesville between counter-protesters and white supremacists who were marching against the planned removal of a Confederate statue. A paralegal was killed, and dozens injured after a car rammed into demonstrators.\n\nBiden in the video condemned U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s comments after the violence; Trump had said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Biden also rejected what he called Trump\u2019s moral equivalency between the white supremacists who \u201cspread hate\u201d and the protesters who stood against it, saying:\n\n[In Charlottesville] in August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and baring the fangs of racism. Chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued, and a brave young woman lost her life.\n\nIn other words, the graphic featuring Biden is a misquote. While antifa was part of the counter-protests in Charlottesville, Biden did not mention the group by name. Therefore, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
