Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cThere are homeless people out there who can\u2019t pay their mortgage.\u201d\n\nAlso featured in the image is a quote attributed to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThere is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever said the quote attributed to her in the post. It seems to have originated in a 2013 Saturday Night Live sketch. The Daily Caller previously debunked a variation of the quote attributed to Biden.\n\nThe March 27 post attributes to the two Democratic politicians seemingly contradictory statements: Ocasio-Cortez is quoted as saying, \u201cThere are homeless people out there who can\u2019t pay their mortgage,\u201d while Biden is credited with saying, \u201cPeople will die, who have never died before.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post, however. Searching her social media accounts and ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets didn\u2019t turn up any matches. Nor have any credible media outlets quoted her as saying it.\n\nThe quote appears to have originated in a 2013 Saturday Night Live sketch \u2013 \u201cWeekend Update: Girl You Wish You Hadn\u2019t Started a Conversation with on Christmas\u201d \u2013 that features comedians Cecily Strong and Seth Meyers.\n\n\u201cYou need to wake up and smell the music, Seth,\u201d Strong\u2019s character says at one point. \u201cThere are homeless people out there who can\u2019t even pay their mortgages.\u201d (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Say, \u2018Truck Drivers Are Destroying America\u2019?)\n\nThe Caller previously debunked a variation of the quote attributed to Biden. The variation appeared nowhere on his Twitter account, in transcripts of his most recent debates or in the transcripts and videos of his other recent public speaking events.", "lang": "en"}
