Almost all of the claims\u2014that Covid-19 is caused by a bacteria, that it is related to 5G, that autopsies were banned, and Italy broke rules to perform them\u2014are false.\n\nItaly was not the first country to perform a post-mortem on a Covid-19 patient. Forensic scientists in Wuhan, China performed post-mortems as early as 16 February, which was before the first detected Covid-19 death in Italy, on 21 February.\n\nItalian post-mortems did not discover that the virus causing Covid-19 doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nCovid-19 is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, not 5G. The symptoms of Covid-19 and radiation poisoning are completely different.\n\n5G is the next generation of wireless network technology. 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves\u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays). These radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don\u2019t damage the DNA inside cells.\n\nPublic Health England has said that there\u2019s no \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that exposure below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will only be in the tens of GHz.\n\nIt\u2019s not true that the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that post mortems could not take place. The WHO released guidance on 24 March on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Italian doctors also performed post-mortems on Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe idea that Covid-19 patients have been misdiagnosed, and actually have disseminated intravascular coagulation, is incorrect, as we have discussed before. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be present in Covid-19 pneumonia patients, but it\u2019s not the case that patients have that instead of Covid-19.\n\nAntibiotics are not used to directly treat viruses, though can be given to Covid-19 patients who are suffering from secondary bacterial infections. The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is being tested to see whether it can help Covid-19 patients, and the anticoagulant heparin has been used in some cases to treat Covid-19 illness. Aspirin can be used for pain relief in adults if they have a cough or cold but is not a specific cure or treatment for Covid-19.\n\nWe could find no record of Italian doctors or pathologists saying this. There was widespread coverage and studies of how many Covid-19 patients needed intensive care treatment in the country. Although there has been some debate about how ventilators are used, Covid-19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, which will often lead to needing a ventilator.\n\nCovid-19 illness is caused by a virus. Scientists have been studying the disease and its cause for several months now, and have sequenced the genetic material of the virus.\n\nIt\u2019s true that people with Covid-19 can get secondary infections caused by bacteria, but the bacteria themselves don\u2019t cause Covid-19. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence that 5G radiation has any effect on the immune system, or Covid-19 illness.\n\nHypoxia, which is a general term for low oxygen in the body, can be a symptom of Covid-19. It\u2019s not clear what exactly the post means by inflammation\u2014some serious effects of Covid-19 can be pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung tissue, and some other fatal effects can be generally referred to as types of inflammation, for example sepsis.\n\nAspirin has not been proved to be an effective treatment for Covid-19, however, there is at least one study looking into this.\n\n\u2018Apronax\u2019 seems to be a brand name for the drug naproxen, which reduces swelling in people with conditions like gout. This isn\u2019t yet recommended for treating Covid-19 either, but a trial on its efficacy is taking place in France.\n\nParacetamol is not a specific cure for Covid-19, but it can be used to ease mild symptoms of the disease.\n\nIt\u2019s true that severe Covid-19 illness can cause blood clotting problems. Pulmonary embolisms (when a blood vessel in the lungs gets blocked by a blood clot), strokes, and other issues caused by abnormal blood clotting have been seen in Covid-19 patients. This is not the only dangerous outcome of severe Covid-19 though.\n\nAs above, Italy did not break any international law, or WHO protocol by performing autopsies.\n\nThe \u201cthrombi\u201d the post refers to is the plural of thrombus, which is a blood clot. We couldn\u2019t find reporting from Italy making these claims, but it\u2019s true that some autopsies have found evidence of various types of blood clotting. However, we don\u2019t know if these blood clots were the cause of death for all these patients, as some seemingly suffered with other issues, such as pneumonia.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, the Italian Medicines Agency doesn\u2019t mention aspirin on its page about drugs being used outside of clinical trials to treat patients with Covid-19. It doesn\u2019t mention \u2018apronax\u2019 or naproxen either.\n\nWe can\u2019t find any record of a single day when 14,000 people were sent home from hospital in Italy. At the time of writing just under 170,000 people in Italy have recovered from Covid-19.\n\nIn the UK, you cannot be forcibly vaccinated.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation does provide funding for the WHO, has funded projects run by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). PTF may stand for Presidential Task Force in Nigeria, which has received funding from the foundation.\n\nNo one from the Italian Ministry of Health has concluded that Covid-19 is fake.", "lang": "en"}
