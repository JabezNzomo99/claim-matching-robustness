No, that's not true: the story was copied from a satire website by a fake news website from Kenya that changed some names and locations and then presented the story as their own work.\n\nThe story appeared in an article published on May 22, 2018 by a website named K24 titled \"Kiambu Man Crashes Into River After Attempting To Give Himself A Blowjob While Driving - K24\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nTHIKA-A Kiambu county resident was miraculously rescued by passers-by after he lost control of his vehicle and ended up in Chania river. Anthony Kamau, 47, reportedly told police officers he was attempting to perform oral sex on himself while driving his car when his head apparently got stuck under the steering wheel thus losing control of his vehicle. The man who is recently divorced and is allegedly suffering from depression was found heavily intoxicated and admitted being under the influence of alcohol, crystal meth and crack cocaine. \"He had his head stuck under the steering wheel with his genitals inside his mouth. I don't understand how he got into that position,\" Adam Njuguna, one of his rescuers, told reporters.\n\nOnly a few days ago we debunked the exact same hoax but set in South Carolina which was originally written by satirical website World News Daily Report in November 2017:\n\nFake News: Man Did NOT Crash Into River After Attempting To Give Himsef Oral Sex While Driving | Lead Stories Did Anthony Sanders, a 47-year-old man from Goose Creek, South Carolina crash his car into a river because he was trying to give himself oral sex while driving? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a site that regularily invents fictional stories about bizarre sex acts and weird crimes for entertainment purposes.\n\nWe can't help but think the writers at K24 are reading our website for inspiration (just like some other people we could name, hi Shawn!).\n\nWe wrote about k24-news.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Davao City Hotel NOT Shut Down For Selling Human Meat\n\u2022 Fake News: Nairobi Restaurant NOT Shut Down For Selling Human Meat", "lang": "en"}
