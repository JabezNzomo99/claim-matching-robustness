Gavin Newsom is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s nephew, and that Rep. Adam Schiff has a sister who is married to the son of George Soros. It also falsely states that a daughter of former Secretary of State John Kerry is married to a \u201cmullah\u2019s son in Iran.\u201d\n\nViral posts circulating on Facebook claim to show supposed marriages and family relationships among, and between, political and media figures \u2014 but they advance several falsehoods and also present some outdated information.\n\nThe images, repeatedly posted and shared thousands of times, first advance false claims about the families of three prominent Democrats \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Adam Schiff and former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\n\u201cYes, Gavin Newsom is Nancy Pelosi\u2019s nephew,\u201d the posts begin, falsely drawing that relation between Pelosi and Newsom, the California governor. It then falsely says \u201cAdam Schiff\u2019s sister is married to George Soros son\u201d \u2014 a claim we\u2019ve debunked before \u2014 and that Kerry\u2019s \u201cdaughter is married to a \u2018mullah\u2019s son in Iran.\u201d\n\nHere are the facts about those three claims.\n\nThere are ties between the Pelosi and Newsom families \u2014 both prominent California families \u2014 that go back several decades, as outlined in a recent commentary piece published by the nonprofit journalism venture CalMatters. But Nancy Pelosi is not Gavin Newsom\u2019s aunt. In reality, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law, Ron Pelosi, was married to the late Belinda Barbara Newsom, who was Gavin Newsom\u2019s aunt.\n\nIn other words, Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law was the uncle (through marriage) of Gavin Newsom. But Barbara Newsom and Ron Pelosi divorced decades ago, in 1977, and Barbara Newsom died in 2008.\n\nThe claim that Kerry\u2019s \u201cdaughter is married to a \u2018mullah\u2019s son in Iran\u201d is also bogus.\n\nKerry\u2019s daughter, Vanessa, is married to Brian Nahed, a neurosurgeon. Nahed is of Iranian descent, but he was born in the United States. According to the couple\u2019s wedding announcement in the New York Times in 2009, Nahed\u2019s father, M. Reza Nahed, is a pulmonologist in California, who operates a private practice managed by his wife \u2014 and Brian\u2019s mother \u2014 Nooshin P. Nahed. M. Reza Nahed graduated from Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services in 1974, and received his medical license in California in 1979, according to state medical board records.\n\nBoth Brian Nahed and Vanessa Kerry, in interviews with FactCheck.org, said the description of the elder Nahed as a \u201cmullah in Iran\u201d was a fabrication. The term in Iran typically describes a Muslim clergyman.\n\n\u201cThat is false,\u201d Kerry said, reiterating that her father-in-law is a \u201cdevoted doctor\u201d who lives in California and has been in the U.S. since the 1970s.\n\nMoreover, Brian Nahed said, \u201cmy parents aren\u2019t religious at all.\u201d Nahed added that his parents immigrated before the Iranian Revolution and haven\u2019t returned since; both Vanessa Kerry and Brian Nahed also said they have never been to Iran.\n\nIn 2015 \u2014 when then-Secretary of State John Kerry helped negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 online rumors wrongly claimed that the son of Iran\u2019s foreign minister had been the best man at the couple\u2019s wedding years earlier, which Vanessa Kerry publicly debunked. Nahed said similar falsehoods have continued to resurface. \u201cEvery once in awhile \u2014 maybe once a year \u2014 you\u2019ll see it flare up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly frustrating,\u201d Kerry said of the continued flow of misinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s really an invasion of the privacy of my in-laws. They never signed up for a political life.\u201d\n\nKerry is the co-founder and CEO of a Boston-based nonprofit aimed at improving the health profession around the world. Brian Nahed works at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThe claim that Schiff\u2019s \u201csister\u201d is married to the son of George Soros \u2014 a billionaire philanthropist known for funding liberal causes and who is often the subject of falsehoods \u2014 is also bogus. As we\u2019ve previously written, Schiff doesn\u2019t even have a sister. The falsehood is born out of the fact that Soros\u2019 son, Robert, was once married to a woman who also had the last name Schiff.\n\nThe posts then proceed to list a half-dozen family relationships it presents as proof that \u201cthe news system\u201d is \u201crigged.\u201d That same list \u2014 which accurately depicts relationships between members of the media industry and former members of the Obama administration \u2014 has circulated since 2016.\n\nAt this point, though, some of the information is outdated. For example, David Rhodes \u2014 the brother of former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes \u2014 is no longer the president of CBS News. And Ben Sherwood \u2014 whose sister, Elizabeth Sherwood, was a deputy secretary of energy under Obama \u2014 recently left his post as president of Disney/ABC Television Group.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
