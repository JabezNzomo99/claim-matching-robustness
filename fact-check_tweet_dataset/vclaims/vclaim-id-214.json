The vaccine in the image protects against a specific canine coronavirus, not SARS-CoV-2. ( bit.ly/35e2yBZ )\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illness in humans or animals. According to Peel, viruses grouped into such families have things in common, but that they are not the same.\n\nIn humans, coronaviruses which cause respiratory infections range from the common cold to more serious conditions like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) ( here ).\n\nEven if a vaccine was found for one coronavirus it would still not be effective at preventing COVID-19. \u201cCats also have a vaccine against coronavirus, and pigs have two - reiterating the fact that even for an individual species, one vaccine will not protect against all coronaviruses,\u201d Peel said.\n\n\u201cVaccines available for animals also haven\u2019t been tested for safety in humans so it could be harmful - at best it would be ineffective and at worst it would be dangerous,\u201d she added.\n\nFalse. The vaccine Nobivac Canine 1-Cv protects against canine coronavirus and not SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
