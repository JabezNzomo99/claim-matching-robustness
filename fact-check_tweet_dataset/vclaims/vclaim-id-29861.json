It\u2019s not. The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone\u201d originated with Robin Williams.\n\nAn image graphic featuring a photograph of Robin Williams and a quote ostensibly uttered by him is frequently shared on social media:\n\nThe quote reads: \u201cI used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It\u2019s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone.\u201d\n\nWhile Williams has a connection to this quote, he is not its original author. This quote comes from the 2009 film \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Dad\u201d that was written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait.\n\nWilliams, who plays the character \u201cLance,\u201d a high school teacher who is dealing with the death of his son, speaks a slightly modified version of the above-displayed phrase near the end of the movie.\n\nIn the movie, Lance says:\n\n\u201cI used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It\u2019s not. The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.\u201d\n\nThis quote can be heard around the 1:40-second mark of the following clip:\n\nIn other words, Williams made the statement but only while in character in a movie. And just as you wouldn\u2019t attribute quotes such as \u201cLuke I am your father\u201d to James Earl Jones, or \u201cLife is like a box of chocolates\u201d to Tom Hanks, this quote shouldn\u2019t be attributed directly to Williams himself.", "lang": "en"}
