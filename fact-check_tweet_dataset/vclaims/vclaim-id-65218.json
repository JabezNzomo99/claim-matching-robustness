The sign appeared to show how the words \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d contained 19 letters and that the disease at the center of the ongoing pandemic, COVID-19, also contained that number.\n\nThis is not a genuine photograph. Furthermore, when you add up the number of letters in \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d (6 + 7 + 5), you get 18, not 19.\n\nThis manipulated image was created from a genuine photograph of a protester at a demonstration in Huntington Beach, California, which took place in spite of the state\u2019s shelter-in-place orders. The original photograph was taken by Jeff Gritchen of the Orange Country Register on April 17, 2020, and showed a protester holding a sign bearing the words \u201cGive Me Liberty or Give Me Death.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the real photograph (left) and the doctored image (right):\n\nThe original photograph can be viewed here, where it is accompanied by the following caption:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve encountered a rumor concerning the name of the virus at the center of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. For instance, COVID-19 does NOT stand for \u201cChinese-Originated Viral Infectious Disease.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains how COVID-19 got its name in this passage, which appears on the CDC website:\n\nOn February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practice for naming of new human infectious diseases.", "lang": "en"}
