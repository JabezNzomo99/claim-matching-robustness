Some posts claim the words appeared in Hitler\u2019s book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, which outlined the ideology that formed the basis for Nazism and set out his hatred of Jews. This is inaccurate.\n\nAs of May 20, 2020, the quote has been shared over 20,940 times on Facebook. Examples are visible here, here, here, here, here.\n\nThe posts read: \u201cThe best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed. -Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf\u201d\n\nThe Leibniz Institute for Contemporary History, a research organization dedicated to the study of German history of the 20th and 21st century ( here ), confirmed to Reuters these words are misattributed to Hitler. \u201cWhoever invented this quote, it was not Hitler and it has never been written in Mein Kampf\u201d, a spokesperson for the Institute told Reuters on email. \u201cWe do not know in which context the author of this post is trying to manipulate a discussion by an invented \"Hitler\"-quotation,\u201d they added.\n\nProfessor Timothy Snyder, a historian at Yale University, also confirmed to Reuters that Hitler\u2019s idea of taking power was very different from what the quote alleges. \u201cThose words do not appear in Mein Kampf, nor do they represent Hitler\u2019s beliefs,\u201d he told Reuters via email. \u201cHis idea of taking power was to discredit traditional sources of factuality in favor of a myth of a supposedly innocent nation and its supposedly faultless leader, and to undermine the rule of law by willful violent actions carried out in the name of a race.\u201d\n\nSnyder further explained that Hitler came to power by \u201cexploiting a crisis\u201d and consolidated it by \u201cundermining constitutional institutions of altering them by mixing them with his own racial institution, the SS (Schutzstaffel or the \u2018political soldiers\u2019 of the Nazi Party bit.ly/2ZobO5B )\u201d. According to Snyder, Hitler\u2019s conviction was that Germans would fully support him by \u201ctaking them to war\u201d. \u201cHe believed that he was giving the German race its freedom by fighting for resources instead of pursuing technology, and by destroying an \u201cenemy\u201d (the Jews),\u201d he said. Snyder also added that those who supported Hitler before he came to power \u201cglorified weapons and opposed what they called the \u2018system\u2019, by which they meant parliamentary democracy\u201d.\n\nAccording to Snopes, the quotation in the claim and its misattribution to Hitler and Mein Kampf was \u201cvirtually non-existent until 2014\u201d, when it appeared in the book \u201cWillfully Ignorant\u201d ( bit.ly/2Zlgzg8 ) as a heading to one of the chapters of the fictional novel by American writer Pat Miller (here).\n\nAt the start of Mein Kampf\u2019s Chapter 15 \u2013 The Right to Self Defense, Hitler made a similar statement to that in the social media claims (beginning with \u201cA shrewd conqueror will always enforce his exactions on the conquered only by stages\u201d). This was in reference to his disagreement over Germany\u2019s new democratic republic following World War One\u2019s Armistice in 1918 and not reflecting his own policy preferences as a leader.\n\nSome iterations of the claim (visible here) include photo that is not of Adolf Hitler but a photoshopped image of former British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nUsers are resharing this false quote amidst weeks of lockdown and social isolation worldwide to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus ( here), which has been met with protests and defiance by some Americans ( here, here).\n\nFalse. This quote is incorrectly attributed to Adolf Hitler and historians say the ideas are not representative of his beliefs. A similar, not identical, passage can be found in Mein Kampf in reference to Germany\u2019s post-World War One policies, not Hitler\u2019s own preferences.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
