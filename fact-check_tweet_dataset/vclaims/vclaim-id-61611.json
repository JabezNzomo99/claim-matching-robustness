Here\u2019s a portion of the article:\n\n\"In a closed-door session with shareholders on Tuesday, Facebook executives wheeled out a set of new rules which, when implemented later this year, will ban their users from creating status updates and image posts related in any way to religion, while also vowing to disband groups and take down pages with religious goals or affiliations.\"\n\nThe story goes on to claim that Facebook will implement the new rules in three phases by removing pages with religious themes; prohibiting the posting or sharing of religious images and memes; and implementing filters to weed out status updates that include words like \"Jesus,\" \"prayer,\" \"church,\" or \"God.\"\n\nThis would be a pretty big deal if it were true, but there\u2019s a problem: The National Report is a fake news site.\n\nThe website, established in 2013, once included making that point clear.\n\nThe disclaimer has since been removed, but was archived by urban-legend investigation site .

Facebook pages for the Bible, Koran, and Torah have netted more than 40 million likes altogether. None have been deleted from Facebook.\n\nA recent article claims that Facebook plans to institute a ban on all user-generated posts related to religion.
