The EPA list includes only products that have demonstrated efficacy against:\n\u2022 a virus that is \u201charder to kill\u201d than SARS-CoV-2; or,\n\u2022 another type of human coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommends only disinfectants that are in the EPA list, said in an explainer that inhalation of gasoline may \u201ccause asphyxiation in enclosed, poorly ventilated, or low-lying areas,\u201d while repeated or prolonged skin contact may cause irritation, dermatitis (eczema), or even first- and second-degree burns.\n\nBreathing large quantities of diesel vapor or drinking diesel-based fluids may cause dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, incoordination, or euphoria, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) in guidelines provided by the Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom.\n\nAspiration into the lungs also causes \u201cpneumonitis with choking, coughing, wheeze, breathlessness, cyanosis, and fever,\u201d the guidelines added.\n\nWhen asked if gasoline and diesel can be used as disinfectants, a team of public health experts convened by international nonprofit Meedan told VERA Files:\n\nMeedan cited the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which has said gasoline exposure through the skin or eyes, drinking, or breathing \u201ccan cause many health problems.\u201d\n\nThis includes irritation or burns of the eyes, skin, or mucous membranes (such as tissues in the nose, eyes, mouth, or throat); headache, weakness, blurred vision, dizziness, slurred speech, confusion, and convulsions; and possible liver or kidney damage, among others.\n\nThus, the public health experts said gasoline exposure \u201cshould be avoided\u201d and, if accidental exposure does happen, \u201cwashing the exposed area is important\u201d:\n\nLike Roque, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the president\u2019s July 21 claim that gasoline and diesel can be used to disinfect masks may have been said in jest:\n\nVergeire, in a July 21 presser, said, \u201cshould people not have access to clean water and soap,\u201d the Department of Health and the Philippine Food and Drug Administration recommend the use of alcohol or alcohol-based hand sanitizers, with 70 and 60 percent ethyl or isopropyl alcohol content, respectively.\n\nThe health official said this is because the 60 to 70 percent range is \u201ceffective\u201d in fighting off germs, bacteria, and viruses.\n\nMoreover, not all masks are reusable. While some, like cloth or fabric masks, should be washed daily and hung under direct sunlight after use, medical masks, such as surgical and N95 masks, are for \u201csingle-use only,\u201d according to WHO.\n\nVergeire issued the same reminder to reporters, saying:\n\nERRATUM: The video incorrectly stated the date of one of President Duterte's speeches. It was July 20, 2020, not July 21, 2020.
