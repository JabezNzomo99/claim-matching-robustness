While the ministry did not make those notes public, on June 26 it posted a statement that included some details of Moscow\u2019s proposal.\n\nAccording to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the notes it sent to Ukraine and the tribunal \u201cdraw attention to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the 24 Ukrainian sailors are ongoing, as well as to the possibilities available under the criminal procedure legislation of the Russian Federation with regard to sailors and ships that may be at this stage involved by the Ukrainian side in order to release them.\u201d\n\nResponding to the Russian Foreign Ministry note, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry accused Moscow of failing to comply with the May 25 order by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It said the Russian Foreign Ministry note contained \u201ca cynical proposal to provide the Ukrainian side with written guarantees of Ukraine's participation in the continuation of the criminal prosecution of Ukrainian sailors in accordance with Russian law.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry added that it considered \u201cthis proposal by Russia unacceptable and aggravating the dispute between Ukraine and Russia regarding the immunity of warships.\u201d It also demanded, \u201cthat Russia, without any further conditions, comply with the Order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and immediately release the captured 24 Ukrainian sailors.\u201d\n\nRussia, however, is refusing to comply, insisting the international rules do not apply to this case.\n\nMoscow insists that it captured the Ukrainian ships last November while they were \u201cviolating Russian territorial waters.\u201d Polygraph.info has examined that claim and found it to be false.\n\nIn comments to Polygraph.info, U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said Russia\u2019s capture of the Ukrainian ships and sailors in international waters last November violated international law, and that their continued detention is illegal.\n\nHe also noted that a U.N. court (ITLOS) had ruled against Russia and demanded the immediate release of the sailors.\n\nVolker said Russia\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d to Ukraine to participate in the criminal investigation of the sailors was an affront to justice, since there was no basis to detain them in the first place, as well as an affront to the U.N. and Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nOn June 27, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin posted the scanned copies of the Russian and Ukrainian notes on his Facebook page.\n\nThe Kyiv Post translated Klimkin\u2019s post from Ukrainian to English, explaining that he had decided to share the diplomatic notes to clear up any questions and to reveal Russia\u2019s \u201chidden motives,\u201d calling Moscow's note a \u201ctrap.\u201d\n\nInstead of implementing ITLOS' decision, Klimkin said that Russia aims to:\n\u2022 \"require us to admit that our sailors could commit a crime\"\n\u2022 \"persuade us to recognize the lawfulness of the judicial process against them under Russian law\"\n\u2022 \"invite us to bend over to the criminal procedure code of the Russian Federation, and at the same time indirectly recognize the occupation of Crimea.\"", "lang": "en"}
