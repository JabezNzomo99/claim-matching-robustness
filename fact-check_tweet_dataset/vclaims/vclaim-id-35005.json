(RELATED: Did Harriet Tubman Say She Could Have Freed More Slaves \u2018If Only They Knew They Were Slaves\u2019?)\n\nThe viral Facebook post alleges in an image that the young woman pictured is Tubman. \u201cBet they never show you this picture of Harriet Tubman Young and Beautiful,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThey always show you the picture of her after she has been beaten and tortured yet still survived because she\u2019s black!\u201d\n\nHowever, a quick reverse image search revealed the photograph actually depicts Bonetta. The picture, housed at the National Portrait Gallery in London, was taken by French photographer Camille Silvy in 1862, according to the website.\n\nBonetta, the daughter of an Egbado chieftain of the Yoruba people, was enslaved during intertribal warfare and later brought to England by a British sea captain, according to the National Portrait Gallery. In 1850, Queen Victoria took up sponsorship of Bonetta\u2019s education and welfare.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have erroneously claimed viral images show Tubman. In 2016, Snopes debunked a miscaptioned picture that supposedly depicted Tubman but actually showed Mary Fields, the first black woman employed as a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service.", "lang": "en"}
