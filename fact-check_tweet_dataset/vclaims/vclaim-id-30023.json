Highly unlikely! But that's exactly being claimed through a post which has gone viral on both Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAccording to the message attributed to Smriti Irani, the minister apparently said, Delhi\u2019s government school should not be made a polling booth or else people will vote for Kejriwal after seeing government school.\n\nThis message, both in Hindi and English, had been tweeted from an account with a handle @aajTAK51 as breaking news. The handle also has a similar logo of Aajtak news channel.\n\nMany failed to notice that it's a fake Twitter account.\n\nSeveral Facebook users 'Praveen Kumar Prabhakar' and 'Franklin Mendonca' have posted this message.\n\nThe archived version of these posts can be seen here and here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this post to be fake. Neither Smriti has said this in public nor Aajtak has ever tweeted this message.\n\nThese tweets were posted from a dubious account masquerading Aajtak handle, which has now been suspended.\n\nWhen we looked for Twitter handle @aajTAK51, we found that Twitter has suspended this account for violating rules.\n\nBut we also found the archived version of this dubious Twitter handle.\n\n@aajTAK51 was operational since November 2019. It had more than a thousand followers and posted over 2,600 tweets until the time it was suspended. Most of the content of this Twitter handle was far from facts and misleading.\n\nThe fake handle copied Aajtak Twitter account in a manner which could leave people confused.\n\nThe bio of the fake account reads: AajTak covers breaking news, latest news in politics, sports, business & cinema. Follow us & stay ahead!\n\nThe Twitter handle of the Aajtak news channel is @aajtak.\n\nAnother Twitter handle called @AajTak422 masquerades Aajtak handle and keep pushing misleading content. The fake handle is still active.\n\nUpon searching the Internet and the social media profile, we have not found any credible evidence or news report which confirms that Smriti Irani ever said anything related to the Delhi government schools and polling booths.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Clip of video game passed off as US shooting down Iranian missiles\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: This European kid was not beaten up by a Muslim immigrant for having blue eyes", "lang": "en"}
