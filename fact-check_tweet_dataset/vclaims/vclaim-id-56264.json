This particular article was shared on Facebook at least 75 times, with 1,580 interactions, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nMeanwhile, one page pointed out that the Philippines was the first country in Southeast Asia to install 5G internet and also had the most cases of coronavirus among the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nAnother Facebook user posted that he removed his 5G antenna, saying, \"To all of you who are using PLDT Home Fibre, please if you wanna help the community to get rid of the so-called 'NCOV-19' remove it now and disable it through their homepage admin set up 192.168.1.1 also (sic) you may turn off its radio to stop it from sending and receiving harmful 5G waves.\"\n\nThe facts: The virus is spread through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed that viruses cannot travel on radio waves or mobile networks and that the virus is spreading in countries without 5G mobile networks.\n\nOn its \"Myth busters\" page, the WHO said 5G mobile networks do not spread the virus.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport has told people to stop damaging key infrastructure amid the national emergency.\n\n\"These are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated,\" a spokesperson said.", "lang": "en"}
