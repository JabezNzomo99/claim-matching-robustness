It came from a doctored video that combined audio and graphics from an MSNBC report with a clip from the \u201cWorld War Z\u201d trailer.\n\nCities across the U.S. have seen protests erupt following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. Derek Chauvin, the officer videotaped kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, per CNN.\n\nThe viral image juxtaposes two similar pictures: a screen grab of an alleged MSNBC broadcast and a screen grab of the \u201cWorld War Z\u201d movie trailer. Both screen grabs feature the same smoke-filled city skyline.\n\n\u201cMSNBC put this up which is from the movie World War Z,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cTrying to make the world believe our country is in total ruins.\u201d (RELATED: Image Claims To Show People Driving A Stolen Train During Minneapolis Protests)\n\nHowever, the screen grab of the supposed MSNBC broadcast is doctored. Four words above the MSNBC logo, though difficult to discern, read, \u201cBad Scooter. Not Real.\u201d\n\nTwitter user \u201cBad Scooter\u201d took credit for creating the doctored video clip that the screen grab came from on June 1. The doctored video was created by superimposing the audio and graphics from an authentic MSNBC report with footage from \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d according to one of the user\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cMSNBC never used the World War Z clip!! Period!\u201d the user tweeted. \u201cAudio taken from this real video last night (below), with graphics on top of a trailer ripped from YouTube. Again, MSNBC never never aired the WWZ footage!!\u201d\n\nMSNBC confirmed to Reuters that the edited video and screen grabs from it were fake.", "lang": "en"}
