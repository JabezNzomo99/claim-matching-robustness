Was Fox News essentially mum about the story until Kelly scored the at-home exclusive?\n\nStelter told PunditFact that he first started thinking about the coverage disparity when he saw a story by that compared light coverage by Fox with intensive coverage by MSNBC and CNN. He and CNNMoney media reporter Tom Kludt did their own research and reached a similar conclusion for a\n\n\"Along with the amount of time spent, we took into account the type of Fox's coverage,\" Stelter said. \"Early on, the mentions of the controversy were fleeting, not substantive at all.\"\n\nThe controversy went public when In Touch Weekly published the about Josh Duggar being the suspect in a 2005 underage sexual abuse investigation. In Touch and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published more stories based on a police report that said the father did not go to law enforcement until a year after the fondling incidents took place.\n\nAfter the stories appeared, Josh Duggar resigned his position as executive director of the Family Research Council and apologized in a statement, saying, \"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation.\"\n\nTLC pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting the next day, May 22.\n\nFox first told its viewers about the situation in a 30-second segment on May 22, followed by a 20-second segment on May 23. On May 26, the Duggars were mentioned on The Five in the context of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee defending the family. \"You don\u2019t go around defending the Duggar family when you\u2019ve got bigger issues going on,\" said pundit Greg Gutfeld. Fox analyst Howard Kurtz criticized the media\u2019s focus on the in a May 24 segment.\n\nThose are the only references we could find before May 30, when Kelly\u2019s interview was announced.\n\nNeedless to say, those mentions of the story were super-brief \u2014 especially when you compare how the other networks handled it. CNN and MSNBC anchors devoted considerably more time to the controversy from the start.\n\nWe used Critical Mention, which searches closed-captioning transcripts, to look for mentions of the Duggars on the three networks from May 19 to noon on May 30, roughly when the interview was announced. This method isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 misspellings aren\u2019t captured, for instance \u2014 but it does provide a rough snapshot of how often each network discussed the family.\n\nFox News personalities mentioned \"Duggar\" four times. Within the same timeframe, the family name came up 99 times on CNN and 72 times on MSNBC.\n\nOn Stelter\u2019s home network of CNN, the story was brought up on five different shows on May 22, with Erin Burnett OutFront and Anderson Cooper 360 devoting substantial chunks of air time to interviews with an In Touch staffer and child psychiatry professionals, as well as going into other TLC shows with stars that fell from grace. CNN Tonight host Don Lemon continued to explore the story in his May 26-28 shows.\n\nOn MSNBC, nearly every show on May 22 talked about the story, including hosts Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, Al Sharpton and Chris Hayes, often bringing in experts to dissect some of the story\u2019s finer points. The network continued to cover the story on May 26, 27 and 28.\n\nFox began to report the story in more depth on June 1, when Kelly criticized the media\u2019s handling of the story with Fox media analyst Howard Kurtz. She equated the rush to cover the story as feasting on a carcass, going after CNN specifically for bringing up how GOP presidential candidates had taken pictures with Josh Duggar before the scandal broke.\n\nKelly\u2019s coverage of the story has also focused on the release of police records, which she and the Duggars say should have never been made public.\n\nOther shows on the network, including The O\u2019Reilly Factor, Outnumbered, Your World and Fox and Friends, started talking about the Duggars in the context of Kelly\u2019s interview. From noon on May 30 to about 5 p.m. on June 5, there have been 134 mentions of \"Duggar\" on Fox, according to Critical Mention.\n\nFox News spokespersons did not offer comment for the story.\n\nStelter said, \"Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview.\"\n\nOur review of media mentions of the Duggar story among CNN, MSNBC and Fox supports his statement. Fox News\u2019 coverage was fleeting before Kelly\u2019s interview was announced.", "lang": "en"}
