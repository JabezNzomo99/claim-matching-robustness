At the same point in 2010 it was about 10,300\u2014so about the same size increase the Prime Minister is referring to.\n\nSimilarly you\u2019d find over 1,600 A&E consultants at the moment and 1,050 back in 2010, not far off the 600 increase being quoted.\n\nIn total about 6,350 doctors of all grades work in emergency medicine now compared to 5,050 at the same time back in 2010. That\u2019s about 1,300 more, so a little less than Mrs May claims.\n\nIt\u2019s still the case that A&E units across the country are facing severe pressures to meet rising demand, and experts from the King\u2019s Fund have warned in the past that departments still face difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.", "lang": "en"}
