One of the most reliable is the government\u2019s National Health Interview Survey. It reaches about 25,000 households and in 2017 it asked them how they tried to reduce the cost of their prescription drugs. About 11% said they did not take medications as prescribed. That could include not filling a prescription or stretching out one they had by not taking as much of the drug as they should.\n\nIf that\u2019s the measure of affordability, then about one out of 10, not one out of five, can\u2019t afford their medications.\n\nBut the survey revealed other strategies to cut costs that push the fraction higher. About 5% said they use alternative therapies, and nearly 20% said they ask their doctor for a cheaper drug.\n\nAnother well-regarded survey confirms the government results, and adds a few wrinkles that make it harder to draw simple conclusions.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable source of neutral health policy data, reported in February that 9% of respondents said it was very difficult to afford the cost of their prescription drugs.\n\nBut another 15% said it was difficult. This is based on prescription drug users. Out of all adults, 6% say it\u2019s very difficult and 9% say it\u2019s somewhat difficult to afford their medications.\n\nThese results highlight the ambiguities in Sanders\u2019s statement. There\u2019s no precise point where a drug becomes unaffordable.\n\n\"While having difficulty paying for medicine isn\u2019t the same as not being able to afford it at all, it can be closely related and can lead to cost-related nonadherence \u2014 not taking the drugs as prescribed,\" Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, told us. \"In some cases, this can be worse for people than not taking the drugs at all.\"\n\nDusetzina, and Sanders\u2019 policy team, pointed to another part of the Kaiser survey that asked if people had not filled a prescription because of the cost. Nearly 20% answered, yes. Another 12% said they had skipped a dose or cut their pills in half.\n\n\"It is very hard to define affordability, especially for drugs,\" said University of Pittsburgh pharmacy professor Inmaculada Hernandez. \"They are very important goods since they can save lives, so people may forgo use of other services or products to afford them.\"\n\nHernandez said that if people scrimp on basics such as food or clothing to pay for their drugs, that basically says that affordability is a significant problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the Kaiser survey data suggests that people might not see every prescription as vital to their health. Out of those who didn\u2019t take a prescription as recommended, two thirds said their condition did not get worse.\n\nThe third survey comes from Gallup, which produced a report on behalf of West Health, a group focused on lowering health care costs for seniors. Gallup found that about 20% of people said that at some point in the past year, they had been \"unable to pay for medicine or drugs\" because they \"didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for them.\"\n\nLooking at that and the Kaiser data, Stanford University health policy professor Michelle Mello said nearly 30% of people don\u2019t take a prescription drug as recommended due to cost.\n\nShe said, \"Sanders's estimate is on the low side.\"\n\nSanders said that one out of five people can\u2019t afford their prescription drugs. There is some evidence for this. About 20% of people in a Kaiser survey said they had not filled a prescription because of the cost, and another 12% said they took less than the prescription called for.\n\nBut affordability is hard to measure. Only about 10 percent said it was very difficult to pay for their medications. Another 15% said it was difficult. These are subjective terms, and neither says that people went entirely without their medications.\n\nThe experts we reached said affordability is a significant issue. The survey data don\u2019t precisely match up with Sanders\u2019s words, but they support the idea that many people are pressed to pay for their medications.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
