The woman in the video is not Sophie Trudeau, but a British waitress who has been infected with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is thinking of taking any chances, just take a look at me,\u201d warns a brown-haired woman speaking to a camera from a hospital bed, her arm linked to an intravenous line.\n\nThroughout the minute-and-a-half-long video, she describes her harrowing experience in the intensive care unit after contracting the novel coronavirus, and explains the toll that the virus has taken on her body.\n\nAccording to many Facebook and Twitter users who shared the video, the woman in the video is Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, the wife of Canada\u2019s leader.\n\nThe video was mainly circulated by accounts based in India, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines.\n\nBut the video does not show Trudeau.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who has ever seen Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau before, they know the person in that video is not her,\u201d Alex Wellstead, press secretary for the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cAs the Prime Minister had said on numerous occasions, Sophie is in self-isolation at home and is getting better,\u201d Wellstead added.\n\nThe woman in the video, who does not look like Sophie Trudeau, is Tara Jane Langston, a 39-year-old waitress from the United Kingdom who was taken into intensive care at London\u2019s Hillingdon Hospital after her health deteriorated due to the novel coronavirus, her sister Nicole Poppy Keatley confirmed to AFP via Facebook Messenger.\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not his (Trudeau\u2019s) wife. Tara is married to Richard Langston,\u201d Keatley said.\n\nKeatley told The Guardian newspaper that the video was originally shared by Langston to a WhatsApp group of her colleagues, before one of them shared it publicly. Langston\u2019s sister also shared the video on Facebook on March 18, 2020.\n\nKeatley said that Langston, who is now recovering, was the target of rumors -- including that she is an actress paid by the government to create a panic about the novel coronavirus.\n\nFacing online abuse, Langston published another video in which she confirmed her identity and assured viewers that her illness is real.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m recovering really well,\u201d Langston said in the video.\n\nSophie Trudeau was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, the Prime Minister\u2019s office announced on March 12, 2020, leading her and her husband to remain in isolation since then.\n\nAFP Fact Check has investigated more than 165 false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
