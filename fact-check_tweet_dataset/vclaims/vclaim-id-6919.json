This was before Trump came into office. 25%\u201424% to be precise\u2014responded the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThis widely-reported figure appears to come from a poll done by the WIN/Gallup International network of market research agencies.\n\nIt dates from 2013, when Barack Obama was President of the United States.\n\nAn archived press release tells us that \u201cThe US was the overwhelming choice (24% of respondents) for the country that represents the greatest threat to peace in the world today. This was followed by Pakistan (8%), China (6%), North Korea, Israel and Iran (5%). Respondents in Russia (54%), China (49%) and Bosnia (49%) were the most fearful of the US as a threat.\u201d We\u2019ve not been able to find more detailed results of the survey.\n\nAccording to the press release, the questions were asked in 65 countries, to around a thousand people in each country.\n\nGallup International (not to be confused with the separate US polling firm Gallup) does not appear to have repeated the question more recently.", "lang": "en"}
