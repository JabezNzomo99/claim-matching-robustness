We found that the same video was uploaded by many users and they identified it as Jog falls in Karnataka.\n\nThe same video was uploaded on YouTube in November 2019.\n\nTaking a cue from the above information, we looked for Jog falls and found some pictures from the location on Google. The pictures were very similar to the fall in the video.\n\nWe then checked Jog Falls on Google Earth and found two street views that were similar to the video. When we compared those street views to the screen grabs from the video, we found some similarities like the signboard, similar railings.\n\nWe also checked the pictures of Bhedaghat falls and found that it doesn\u2019t look anything like Jog falls.\n\nBased on the above information, it is clear that the video is of Jog Falls in Karnataka and not a fall from Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
