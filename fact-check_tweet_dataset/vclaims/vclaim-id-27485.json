Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nFact: The child help line (\u2018CHILDLINE\u2019) was started nearly two decades ago as a field action project at TISS. Currently, the CHILDLINE India Foundation (CIF) is the mother NGO for managing this helpline and gets funded under the Child Protection Services by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. So, an already existing helpline is being promoted as something PM Modi has recently announced. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched about the helpline on Google, the official website of \u2018CHILDLINE 1098\u2019 can be found in the search results. On the website, it can be found that \u201cCHILDLINE 1098 is a 24-hour a day, 365 days a year, free, emergency phone service for children in need of aid and assistance\u201d. In the \u2018Our Story\u2019 section, it can be read that the helpline was started nearly two decades ago as a field action project of the Department of Family and Child Welfare, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Formed in 1999, CHILDLINE India Foundation was granted the exclusive \u2018Nodal Mother NGO\u2019 status, in 2006-07, by the Ministry of Woman and Child Development to set up CHILDLINE services across the country. So, an already existing helpline is being promoted as something Modi has recently announced. \n\n\n\nSimilar posts about the helpline went viral previously with the claim that it is a helpline to pick up the food leftovers. The fact-check article written by FACTLY debunking that claim can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018CHILDLINE\u2019 (1098) helpline was started nearly two decades ago, not recently by PM Modi.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
