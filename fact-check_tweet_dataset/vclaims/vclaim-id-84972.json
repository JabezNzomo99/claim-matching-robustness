In a bit to paint the Congress President as nonchalant and indifferent in the face of defeat, the channel held a prime time \u2018debate\u2019 on Gandhi watching Star Wars on the evening of December 18 after the assembly election results had been announced.\n\nUnfortunately for Times Now, the absurdity of it did not go unnoticed. The channel\u2019s hashtag #AreYouSeriousRahul backfired and the channel and its anchors became the target for unending jokes and ridicule on social media. The hashtags #AreYouSeriousTimesNow and #AreYouSeriousaNavika were used by twitterati to mock Times Now for its ludicrousness.\n\nClearly on the backfoot following the ridicule, Navika Kumar, the Managing Editor of Times Now who hosted the prime time show came up with a weak explanation that did not cut ice.\n\nOn the face of it, Times Now was criticizing Congress President for not spending time with party workers after the election results but the agenda ran deeper. It was part of an organised campaign that the channel has been running since the announcement of Gujarat elections, echoing the words of BJP leaders and spokespersons. So what was this about Rahul Gandhi being serious? What were the origins of this line of thinking?\n\nIt was on Nov 1st after Rahul Gandhi\u2019s criticism of India\u2019s ranking on World Bank\u2019s \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 ranking, BJP minister RS Prasad stated \u201cRahul Gandhi, economics is a serious business please don\u2019t make it shallow and hollow\u201d From there started the campaign of projecting Rahul Gandhi as non-serious.\n\nA few weeks later when Rahul Gandhi tweeted on failure of PM Modi\u2019s \u201chugplomacy\u201d\n\nGVL Narasimha Rao, National Spokesperson, BJP wanted to know \u201cWhen will Rahul Gandhi get serious?\u201d\n\nA few days later another BJP spokesperson on a different channel spoke about Rahul Gandhi not being serious. This was on a program on Republic about chits being passed to Rahul Gandhi at a press conference.\n\nIt was unsurprising to see Times Now singing the tune of Government ministers and BJP spokespersons, questioning Rahul Gandhi on similar lines, drawing parallels with PM Modi.\n\nGujarat elections saw some of the most ridiculous hashtags from Times Now. Announcing #ModiSweepsGujarat on the day the elections were announced, Times Now\u2019s hashtags for the opposition left no doubt about its agenda. It was an endless tirade about #RahulNeechPolitics, #PappuBanaYuvraj, #RaGaSomnathSelfGoal, #CongTalibanTango, #CongPakSupport and so on as the channel continued its unabashed campaign for the ruling party. In the run-up to the result day, night after night in its primetime shows, the channel carried on its business of building public opinion against the opposition. Keeping an eye out for the smallest opportunity, Times Now dutifully attacked the opposition leaders with real and imaginary accusations.\n\nTimes Now has thrown neutrality to the wind in its political coverage. A systematic campaign of vilification and character assassination has been the primary pursuit of the channel over the last few months, the objective clearly being to build and sustain a negative perception of opposition leaders and parties. The political scenario is heating up with a string of assembly elections in 2018, and Times Now can be expected to sing the tune of the establishment through loud, relentless and blatantly biased coverage.", "lang": "en"}
