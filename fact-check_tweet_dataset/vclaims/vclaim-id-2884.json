He was born and raised in the Netherlands.\n\nThe embassy chastised the U.S. president for spreading false information.\n\n\u201cFacts do matter,\u201d it said in a statement on Twitter hours after the president\u2019s retweet.\n\nThe public prosecutor\u2019s office in the Netherlands that handled the case explained that the fight had happened in May and the boy was sentenced through a juvenile justice program.\n\nThe retweet was one of three anti-Muslim videos that Trump posted on the morning of Nov. 29 to his personal verified Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, which has more than 40 million followers. All three videos were posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a far-right group.\n\nThe president\u2019s retweets also drew condemnation from British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said through her spokeswoman: \u201cBritain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right which is the antithesis of the values this country represents, decency, tolerance and respect.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
