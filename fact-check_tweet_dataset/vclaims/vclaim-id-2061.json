This was a similar entity to those created in other mountainous regions of Georgia, to establish sub-ethnic Russian administrative units.\u201d\n\nIn April 1922, the leadership of the newly-created Soviet Union established the Autonomous District of South Ossetia, which was meant to create ethnic enclaves, Bakradze said. Over Georgia\u2019s objections, Tskhinvali, which was a Georgian and Jewish town, was named the capital of this administrative district.\n\nAbkhazia and South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia in the early 1990s, but ongoing ethnic tensions created \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in the two regions.\n\nFor more than two decades, however, the UN Security Council has adopted multiple peacekeeping resolutions that identify the two regions as part of Georgia.\n\n \n\n Russia is a signatory to those resolutions recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia as part of Georgia.\n\nFor instance, UN Security Council Resolution 858 (1993) established a monitoring mission in Abkhazia to ensure ceasefire compliance between \u201cthe Government of Georgia and the Abkhaz authorities in Georgia.\u201d Russia voted in favor of the resolution without objecting to Abkhazia being recognized as part of Georgia.\n\nSimilarly, on March 28, 2006, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1666 extending the UN monitoring mission to Georgia and reaffirming the Council\u2019s commitment to Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nRussia also voted for that resolution without objecting to Abkhazia and South Ossetia being identified as Georgian territory.\n\nFollowing the five-day war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008 war, Russian troops occupied South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A month after the war, Russia recognized the two regions as independent countries, and was joined in doing so only by Nicaragua, Venezuela and Nauru.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect an error in translation.", "lang": "en"}
