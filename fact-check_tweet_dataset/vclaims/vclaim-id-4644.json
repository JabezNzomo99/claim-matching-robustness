The reason? It has a lot to do with dogs, girls, the 1876 World\u2019s Fair, pharmaceutical companies, and its more complicated than you think. After his successful invention of the ice cream soda in 1874, Philadelphias Robert Green began to tackle a request from his customers. Green boldly stated, in an 1876 interview with the Pennsylvania Inquirer, \u201cThe people are tired of vanilla and chocolate. They want something more. When the children come up from the mines, they are not satisfied with the plain flavors anymore. I will give them grape. The world\u2019s fair is coming. The world will have grape ice cream. This I decree.\u201d What Green did not know, is that grapes contain a special molecule Anthocyanin that prevents freezing. Greens every attempt to create grape ice cream only produced one milk. He was destined to fail, but in all the excitement with the fair, no one noticed.\n\nThe EM Toast article was only initially shared a few hundreds times on social media, but an Imgur post based off the information contained in this fictional article went viral on 2015. While neither the Imgur post nor the EM Toast article included a disclaimer to indicate that the claim concerning an FDA ban on grape ice cream was false, several clues pointed to the article\u2019s fictional nature.\n\nFirst, the original article was published in the \u201cShort Fiction\u201d section of EM Toast. Second, although the EM Toast web site did not include a statement specifically declaring its humorous intent, its \u201cAbout\u201d page simply stated that \u201cWe write what we want, when we want.\u201d Finally, grape-flavored ice cream is available at several ice cream parlors around the United States. Handel\u2019s Homemade Ice Cream and Yogurt, for instance, currently sells grape ice cream.\n\nThe EM Toast spoof was based on the notion that the consumption of grapes and raisins has been linked to renal failure in dogs, although it is highly unlikely that phenomenon would ever lead to a ban on grape-flavored human treats by the FDA. Dogs are also problematic consumers of common ingredients such as chocolate, avocados, raisins, and macadamia nuts.", "lang": "en"}
