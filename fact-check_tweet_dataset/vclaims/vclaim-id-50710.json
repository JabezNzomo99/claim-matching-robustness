It is also being claimed that Modi has donated that total amount to ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post \n\n\n\nClaim: NASA has awarded Modi with the \u2018Best Scientist Leader\u2019 award. Fact: Modi has not been awarded by NASA with the \u2018Best Scientist Leader\u2019 award. There is no NASA Award with that name. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google with the keywords \u2018NASA award to Modi\u2019, it was found that no such award was announced by the NASA. If any such award was given by the NASA to Modi and Modi has donated that amount (Rs 2500 crore prize money) to ISRO, then all the prominent media organizations would have written articles about it. But, there were none in the search results. \n\n\n\nAlso, when searched for that award on Google, it was found that there is no NASA Award with the name \u2018Best Scientist Leader\u2019. The list of Honor Awards given by NASA can be read here and the list of NASA\u2019s 2019 Honor Awardees can be found here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, Modi has not been awarded by NASA with the non-existent \u2018Best Scientist Leader\u2019 award. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
