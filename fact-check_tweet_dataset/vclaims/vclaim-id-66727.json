Tuesday, stumping for Republican House candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Paul spoke about what he sees as out-of-control government spending.\n\nHe also talked about the government shutdown last fall. Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but he thought shutting down the government was a \"bad idea.\" And he carried the same position in Iowa this week.\n\n\"It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,\" Paul said. \"You know your government\u2019s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people.\"\n\nComing from someone like Paul, who has been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter Chris Moody, who was there, tweeted it out.)\n\nPaul\u2019s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16.\n\nDuring those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration -- were put on hold.\n\nSo how does not spending money come at a cost?\n\n\"Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'\" a spokesman told us. \"Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments.\"\n\nWe found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums.\n\nBut a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity.\n\nThe most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the , which reports directly to the president. (Paul\u2019s spokesman pointed us to this article about the White House report as evidence.)\n\u2022 $2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending);\n\u2022 120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October;\n\u2022 $500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ; HR 1 will allow members of Congress to draw a second salary \u201cworth an estimated $600,000 per year!\u201d\n\u2022 Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown;\n\u2022 Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode;\n\u2022 1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn\u2019t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities;\n\u2022 Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market.\n\nWe also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy\u2019s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service the reports in 2013.)\n\n, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown\u2019s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned.\n\nsaid the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it .)\n\n(in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, \"mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees.\"\n\nThe Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay.\n\nNews surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier.\n\nIn consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown.\n\nSome libertarians argue -- such as economist -- that just because the government didn\u2019t spend money for two weeks doesn\u2019t mean that the same amount of money didn\u2019t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening.\n\nDan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, , but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn\u2019t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic \"bumps\" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown.\n\nPaul said, \"It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open.\"\n\nNumerous independent economic research groups found that the shutdown resulted in overall costs, in terms of lost revenue, hindered GDP growth, stalled private-sector activity and actual expenditures associated with the logistics of closing the government for two weeks. The government had to pay all of what it normally would have spent during that two-week period and then some. There was very little evidence to the contrary.", "lang": "en"}
