RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.\n\n\n\nHis suggestion that Australia achieved \"better\" outcomes on a per capita basis than New Zealand can be approached from several angles, including total confirmed cases per capita, new daily cases per capita, the total number of deaths per capita, or the number of daily deaths per capita.\n\nAustralia has not achieved a better outcome than New Zealand in terms of total (cumulative) cases per capita.\n\nNor has Australia achieved a better result on the number of total confirmed deaths per capita.\n\nHowever, following both countries' respective lockdowns, Australia was recording lower numbers of new daily cases per capita, using a three-day rolling average to iron out volatility.\n\nAustralia was also recording fewer daily deaths per capita, again using a three-day rolling average.\n\nThese measures capture the picture after the lockdowns were imposed, and better reflect Mr Morrison's claim about \"the outcomes we are getting\".\n\nHowever, any differences between the two countries have been marginal.\n\nMoreover, the circumstances facing Australia and New Zealand were not identical.\n\nDuring the week in which both countries ramped up their respective lockdowns (March 23 to March 29), New Zealand experienced a very rapid acceleration in spread of the virus, with the number of cases per capita jumping 371 per cent, compared to a 122 per cent increase in Australia.\n\nNew Zealand was also testing at a higher rate, raising the possibility that more cases were being identified, and potentially giving the false impression that eradication efforts were more successful in Australia.\n\nAs experts noted, it is too early to make definitive judgements. \n\n\n\nIn making his April 16 claim, Mr Morrison linked the results to the lockdown measures imposed in both countries.\n\nAnd he spoke of \"the outcomes we are getting\", indicating a focus on results shortly before he made the claim.\n\nTo test Mr Morrison's claim, Fact Check used data from Monday, March 30, up to and including April 15, as a basis for comparison.\n\nThis represents the period immediately following the lockdowns imposed in both countries, up to the most recent full day of data available at the time Mr Morrison made his claim.\n\nAs noted, there are a number of ways to assess whether Australia has achieved \"better\" outcomes than New Zealand on a per capita basis, including total confirmed cases, total confirmed deaths, new daily cases and new daily deaths.\n\nBut using the total number of confirmed cases or deaths as a basis for comparison does not tell us much about a country's performance after lockdown measures have been introduced.\n\nFor example, a country might have experienced a high number of cases and deaths early on, inflating the total, but then have put measures in place to successfully suppress the virus.\n\nFact Check therefore places greater weight on the figures showing new daily cases or new daily deaths, rather than the cumulative figures.\n\nBecause the per capita numbers tend to be tiny and can be difficult to interpret, Fact Check has expressed figures as a rate per million people, in line with common practice.\n\nFact Check has relied on statistics compiled by Oxford University-based organisation Our World in Data, which in turn relies on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an agency set up by the European Union in 2004 to track and monitor infectious diseases.\n\nAs Fact Check has previously pointed out, comparing statistics on coronavirus can be problematic, particularly since different countries use different methodologies for recording and reporting.\n\nIt is difficult to be precise about the timing of the respective lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand, as a staged approach was applied.\n\nHowever, the week starting on Monday, March 23 was critical. During this week, both countries dramatically ramped up lockdown rules to control the virus.\n\nAt midday on the Monday, restrictions announced by Mr Morrison the previous day came into force affecting businesses such as hotels, clubs, restaurants, entertainment venues, cinemas and casinos.\n\nOn the Tuesday, Mr Morrison announced a ban on all Australians travelling overseas and expanded the list of prohibited venues to include nail salons, fitness centres, swimming pools, museums and places of worship, among others.\n\nOn the Friday, he announced that travellers arriving in Australia would be required to undertake mandatory 14-day self-isolation at designated facilities.\n\nMeanwhile on March 23, New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced a range of measures to be introduced in two stages over the week.\n\nThe first stage, called Alert Level 3, included the closure of non-essential businesses and a blanket ban on events and gatherings. The tougher Alert Level 4 involved closing all schools and public venues.\n\nDuring that critical week, the number of confirmed cases per million recorded in New Zealand increased from 21 on Monday, to 99 the following Sunday \u2014 a rise of 371 per cent.\n\nIn Australia the acceleration was not as dramatic, with the number of confirmed cases per million rising from 67 to 149, an increase of 122 per cent.\n\nBrian Cox, an epidemiologist from the University of Otago, said it was difficult to compare the two countries because the circumstances they faced at the time were not identical.\n\nAssociate Professor Cox likened the situation facing New Zealand to that of Italy, pointing to several clusters linked to returning travellers, a conference in Queenstown, two weddings with overseas guests, and a visiting cruise ship.\n\n\"These were similar to the cause of the rapid increase in the rate of infection in Italy,\" Associate Professor Cox told Fact Check.\n\n\"The available facilities simply would not have been able to cope with that and the control of this cluster-based epidemic would have been completely lost.\"\n\n\n\nMr Morrison noted in his media conference that the measures put in place by the two countries \"largely mirrored each other\".\n\nHowever, he also said New Zealand \"decided to go a lot further\" by imposing a state of \"even more extreme lockdown\".\n\nSince Mr Morrison's media conference, both Australia and New Zealand have begun winding back some restrictions.\n\nIn Australia, lockdown and social distancing rules have been less prescriptive, with more room for interpretation. The rules also vary, sometimes considerably, between jurisdictions.\n\nThe following table summarises major measures in place in Australia and New Zealand at the time Mr Morrison made his claim on April 16.\n\n\n\nAs the table shows, many of the measures put in place by the two countries were similar, although New Zealand was, as Mr Morrison noted, stricter in its approach.\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, all but the most essential retail businesses were forced to close, whereas in Australia many shops were permitted to remain open, albeit on a restricted basis.\n\nNew Zealanders were also only allowed to stay within their \"local area\" when leaving home \u2014 that is, they could only visit places nearby for essential services or local exercise.\n\nIn Australia, domestic travel was to be avoided but some states had exemptions on restrictions, like visiting another property you owned or compassionate grounds.\n\nIn Australia, restaurants and cafes were allowed to provide takeaway, whereas in New Zealand they were forced to close.\n\nWeddings and funerals were also completely banned in New Zealand (with some limited exceptions for close family), whereas in Australia they were allowed to take place with heavy restrictions limiting the number of people attending.\n\nWhile it is clear New Zealand went further than Australia with its lockdown, less obvious is the question of whether Australia has been more successful in suppressing the virus.\n\n\n\nThe total, cumulative number of cases detected has been higher in per capita terms in Australia than New Zealand.\n\nOn April 15, the day before Mr Morrison gave his media conference, Australia had notched up 252 cases per million people, compared to 224 in New Zealand.\n\nAustralia recorded an average of 37 cases per million more than New Zealand between March 30 and April 15.\n\n\n\nThe impact of suppression measures can also be assessed by examining the number of new cases recorded each day. This is more relevant to Mr Morrison's claim.\n\nTo iron out daily volatility, Fact Check smoothed the figures using a three-day rolling average.\n\nOver the three days to April 15, Australia recorded a daily average of 1.7 new confirmed cases per million people, compared to 2.0 cases per million in New Zealand.\n\nFrom March 30 to April 15, Australia recorded an average of 6.0 new daily cases per million, compared to 7.3 new daily cases per million across the Tasman.\n\n\n\nAnother way to assess the relative performance of Australia and New Zealand is to look at confirmed deaths per capita.\n\nAs the graph shows, on total deaths per capita Australia has not achieved a better outcome than New Zealand.\n\nBy April 15, Australia had recorded 2.4 deaths per million, compared to 1.9 deaths per million in New Zealand.\n\n\n\nWhat about the daily number of deaths?\n\nAs with the number of daily confirmed cases, this measure provides a more immediate snapshot, and reflects the results since the lockdown.\n\nThe following table shows the number of daily confirmed deaths per capita, again smoothed using a three-day rolling average.\n\nAs the graph shows, New Zealand's average daily death rate overtook Australia's during the second week of April.\n\nOver the three days to April 15, Australia recorded a daily average of 0.05 deaths per million people, compared to 0.35 in New Zealand.\n\nPeter Collignon, an infectious disease expert and microbiologist at the Australian National University Medical School, said it was still too early to use deaths as a basis for comparison, mainly because it typically takes some time for a person to die from the virus.\n\n\"The trouble with using deaths is that it is still too early to tell,\" Professor Collignon told Fact Check.\n\n\"The best measure is going to be in a few month's time when they look at deaths in winter and compare how that exceeds normal winters.\"\n\n\n\nIn proportional terms, New Zealand has generally been testing more than Australia.\n\nOn April 15, New Zealand was testing at about four times the rate of Australia, with 0.8 tests per 1000 people, compared to about 0.2 in Australia.\n\nThis raises the possibility that higher testing could result in higher numbers of confirmed cases, potentially giving the false impression that eradication efforts have been more successful in Australia.\n\nAnother way to illustrate this point is to examine the number of tests required to find one positive case of COVID-19.\n\nOn April 15, for example, New Zealand was conducting 65 tests for every confirmed positive case.\n\nIn Australia, the rate was lower, with 59 tests conducted for every positive case detected.\n\nIn other words, New Zealand has been testing more, but finding fewer positive cases.\n\nProfessor Collignon said it was difficult to be definitive about testing because it depended on the methodology used, including the criteria applied to determine eligibility for testing.\n\n\n\nMore from the experts\n\nProfessor Collignon said Australia and New Zealand had both achieved \"very similar\" results suppressing the virus.\n\n\"One being better than the other is dependent on how you look at it,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think that's important because it means Australia has likely achieved the same results controlling infection as New Zealand, just in Australia with less lockdown measures and so not as much economic and social impacts \u2014 but still very significant restrictions.\"\n\nProfessor Collignon said if you take the impact of cruise ships out, which accounted for about one-third of Australian cases, then Australia was clearly more successful at suppressing the virus than New Zealand.\n\nSiouxsie Wiles, an infectious disease expert from the University of Auckland, said the numbers in New Zealand and Australia had been so low that comparisons such as Mr Morrison's were not particularly meaningful.\n\n\"It's all in the noise,\" Associate Professor Wiles said.\n\n\"This is a long game and we need to wait and see how it plays out over the year rather than making bold claims about who has responded in the 'best' way right now.\"\n\nAssociate Professor Cox said he believed New Zealand was now in a good position to eliminate the virus following the lockdown measures it imposed.\n\n\"The lockdown has been vital to controlling this disease in New Zealand and we are even in a good position to eliminate it,\" Associate Professor Cox said.\n\u2022 Georgia Hitch, \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison flags easing of coronavirus restrictions in near future\", ABC News Online, April 29, 2020.\n\u2022 Lucia Stein, \"Jacinda Ardern announces New Zealand will relax coronavirus lockdown to level three next week\", ABC News Online, April 20, 2020\n\u2022 Peta Fuller, \"New Zealand's level four coronavirus lockdown has been strict.
