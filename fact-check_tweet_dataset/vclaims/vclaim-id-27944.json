The words do not appear on his Twitter timeline, and no such tweet was recorded by Politwoops, a service that archives deleted tweets by MPs.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s initial Twitter response to the London Bridge attack was actually the following tweet:\n\nShocking reports from London Bridge. My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident. Thank you to the police and emergency services who are responding. \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) November 29, 2019\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.
