And the CAC would also have to decide that Deliveroo drivers were legally \u2018workers\u2019 employed by Deliveroo.\n\nAt the moment, Deliveroo says that its drivers are self-employed.\n\nThe CAC told us that when this kind of thing is disputed, the panel can ask to hear arguments from both sides. What matters is the reality of the employment relationship and whether that fits the legal definition of a \u2018worker\u2019, not the terms of the contract.\n\nIf the CAC decide that Deliveroo drivers are actually \u2018workers\u2019, then that implies that they are entitled to a range of basic protections like the National Minimum Wage and sick pay. As the IWGB\u2019s general secretary put it, an application to form a trade union is, \u201canother way of achieving a change in employment status\u201d.\n\nFor the CAC to consider the application for trade union membership, the proposed \u2018bargaining unit\u2019 would have to include at least 10% of Camden drivers as members and be judged likely to have the approval of the majority of drivers in the area.\n\nCamden drivers would then have to show their support through a ballot, although the CAC may choose to bypass this stage if over 50% are union members.\n\nThe IWGB has said this would be the first collective bargaining agreement in the history of the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s no agreed definition for the gig economy, but it\u2019s generally used to refer to low-paid, flexible work such as running errands (TaskRabbit), giving lifts (Uber) or delivery services (Deliveroo or Hermes), where people are offered piece-work through a website or app.\n\nThere\u2019s a debate about whether workers who regularly take these contracts are really \u2018self-employed\u2019. Even if their contract says that they are, what matters legally is the reality of the working situation.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about inadequate rates of pay, lack of emergency leave, complicated pay and bonus systems, and poor job security. An employment tribunal recently ruled that Uber drivers are \u2018workers\u2019, not self-employed contractors as their contracts stipulated. This gave them basic protections, although fewer than a contractual \u2018employee\u2019 would have.", "lang": "en"}
