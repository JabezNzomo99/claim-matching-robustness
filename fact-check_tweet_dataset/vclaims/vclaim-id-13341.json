Did she actually say that?\n\nA: No. The meme falsely attributes a fictitious quote to Omar.\n\nIlhan Omar was one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress this month.\n\nThe Somali-American, who will represent Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District in the U.S. House, has not shied away from her faith. She recently announced plans to challenge a 181-year-old ban on hats in the House so that she can wear her religious headscarf.\n\nBut a meme distributed through posts on Facebook uses Omar\u2019s religion to spread a fictitious and inflammatory quote, juxtaposing the falsehood alongside an actual statement she made last year.\n\nThe meme, which shows Omar on the Sept. 18, 2017, cover of Time magazine, erroneously asserts that she said, \u201cI think all white men should be put in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam.\u201d\n\nWe could find no such quote by Omar in her Time interview \u2014 part of the magazine\u2019s series, \u201cFIRSTS: Women Who Are Changing the World.\u201d Nor could we find evidence that Omar had said that elsewhere.\n\nOmar, currently a Minnesota state representative, did make the other statement included in the meme: \u201cI am America\u2019s hope and the president\u2019s nightmare.\u201d Omar said that during a July 2017 interview with Comedy Central\u2019s Trevor Noah.\n\nThe meme was also shared widely on Twitter, where Omar responded to such tweets, including one that labeled her a \u201cterrorist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said facts mattered?\u201d she wrote, with an emoji shrug.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cIlhan Omar \u2013 Fighting for a better life for all Americans \u2013 Extended Interview.\u201d The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. Comedy Central. 13 Jul 2017.\n\nOmar, Ilhan (@IlhanMN). \u201cNo one puts a scarf on my head but me. It\u2019s my choice\u2014one protected by the first amendment. And this is not the last ban I\u2019m going to work to lift.\u201d Twitter. 17 Nov 2018.", "lang": "en"}
