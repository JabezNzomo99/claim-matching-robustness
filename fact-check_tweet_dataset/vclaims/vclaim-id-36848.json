No, that's not true: The story was fabricated by a Canadian entertainment website that publishes fictional stories about bizarre crimes, weird sexual acts, and other made-up events.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on January 13, 2020, titled \"Minnesota man suffers extreme frostbite to genitals after drunken sex with snowman he mistook for ex-wife\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nA Minnesota man in Red Lake has suffered extreme frostbite to his genitals after allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with a snowman. Russell Baker, 42, was rescued after being found unconscious and barely clothed on a neighbor's lawn last week by Red Lake police. Neighbors called 911 after witnessing a \"drunk naked man in full erection having sex with a snowman\" according to the official 911 correspondence.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe article is completely fabricated and is a work of satire.

For example, here:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often, their stories feature an image showing a random mugshot found in a gallery on the Internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
