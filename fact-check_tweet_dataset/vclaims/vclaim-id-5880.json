The photograph was captured on August 6, 2014 at the Spousal Symposium during the U.S.-Africa Summit in Washington, DC. ( here ).\n\nThe photograph\u2019s description explains that \u201cThe symposium, sponsored by first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush, focuses on the role the spouses of world leader\u2019s play and the impact of investments in education, health, and economic development through public-private partnerships.\u201d\n\nA video of the symposium can be found here . Obama does not say the quote in these claims.\n\nA Google search of the quote only brings up meme pages, blogs and social media posts.\n\nObama has made public remarks about sexual assault and harassment, albeit not as presented in the Facebook claims.\n\nIn October 2016, Michelle Obama gave a speech responding to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump \u201cmaking demeaning and predatory remarks about women in 2005\u201d ( here , here ). At a Hillary Clinton Rally in New Hampshire on October 13, she told the crowd, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful, it is intolerable.\u201d\n\nA year later, she spoke out in support of the #MeToo movement ( here ).\n\nIn a November 2017 speech, the former first lady commented on the wave of sexual harassment scandals that had hit various industries. Obama said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sick it makes me, the more I see the uncovering of the truth that all us women know has been out there, that there is an ugliness there.\u201d She continued to call herself \u201cone of the lucky ones\u201d for having been surrounded by positive male presences in her life ( here ).\n\nReuters found one instance of Obama speaking about a \u201csex symbol\u201d, but it is not about herself. In 2013, Entertainment Tonight asked Michelle Obama what she thinks of her husband Barack Obama being thought of as a \u201csex symbol\u201d. She responded: \u201cHe\u2019s got a little swag, you know. That\u2019s okay, I mean, I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to suggest Michelle Obama ever said this quote.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
