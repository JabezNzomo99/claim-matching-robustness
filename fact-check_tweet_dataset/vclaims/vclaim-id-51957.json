He said that this is a painted apple and not the actual colored one.\n\nThe video has been shared by a Facebook page named \u2018OMG\u2019. When Vishvas News performed the social scanning of the page we found that the page has 5.4K followers.\n\nConclusion: A viral video on Facebook purporting to shows a blue-colored apple made in China is fake.
