He urged the states to use this money to work with local and federal governments and industry to find on-shore solutions to recycling. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s claim that NSW raises $750 million each and every year from waste levies and that only 18 per cent goes back to the waste industry via councils.\n\nNSW budget 2018-19 papers show $726 million in revenue was collected in waste and environment levies in 2016-17. [2]\n\nNSW budget 2019-20 papers show the figure rose to $769 million in 2017-18 with a steady revenue stream for the following years - $772 million in 2018-19 and $771 million in 2019-20. [3]\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s claim that NSW raises over $750 million each and every year to be mostly true.\n\nA spokesperson for the NSW Local Government Association (LGNSW), a member of ALGA, told AAP FactCheck Mr O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s claim that only 18 per cent of the NSW government\u2019s waste levy revenue was returned to local government was sourced from the ALGA 2018-19 budget submission. The submission estimated 18 per cent of waste levy revenue contributed by local governments was returned to councils. [4]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined if only 18 per cent of the amount local government paid towards the state government waste levy was returned.\n\nThe LGNSW submission relied on 2017-18 NSW budget figures for its calculation. It estimated $2.13 billion would be collected through the waste and environment levy across the four financial years from 2017-18 to 2020-21. [5]\n\nAccording to a review of the NSW waste and environment levy commissioned by the NSW Environment Protection Authority and conducted by KPMG, local government contributes 32 per cent of levy revenue. On the 2017-18 budget figure estimates of $2.13 billion, 32 per cent is $682 million. [6]\n\nNSW government hands back waste levy funds to local government for recycling via the Waste Less, Recycle More (WLRM) initiative. The initiative gave local government $70 million over four years plus, according to LGNSW, the chance of applying for a further $100 million. [7]\n\nThe LGNSW submission assumed a success rate of 50 per cent for the contestable $100 million, meaning $120 million could go to local governments in total across four years.\n\nThat means 17.6 per cent share or $120 million goes back to local council for waste management and recycling from a pool of $681.6 million contributed by local governments to the state waste levy revenue, or just under 18 per cent as Mr O\u2019Loughlin claimed.\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s claim that only 18 per cent of funds collected from local governments through the waste is returned to be mostly true. The minor problem is that the 18 per cent was calculated on 2017-18 NSW budget figure estimates, not on higher more recent figures published in the 2019-20 NSW budget, which Mr O\u2019Loughlin also referenced.", "lang": "en"}
