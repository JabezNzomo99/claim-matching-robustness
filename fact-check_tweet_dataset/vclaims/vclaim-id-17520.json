Images of the last rites show the slain security personnel receiving state honours. Their bodies were not wrapped in cardboard boxes, as claimed on social media.\n\nImages or videos depicting unrelated events are often circulated on social media with a changed narrative. A similar pattern was observed after the recent Sri Lanka Easter bombings and Indian army\u2019s Balakot airstrike in February.", "lang": "en"}
