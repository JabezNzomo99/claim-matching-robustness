The claim is false; the montage features shots from two different episodes, one of which has been digitally altered to include the words \u201ccorona virus\u201d.\n\nThe screenshots have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in various languages, including English, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\u201cThe simpsons predicted Coronavirus,\u201d claims one post on a Facebook page with more than 600,000 followers.\n\nThree of the four accompanying pictures are from Season 4, Episode 21 of the hit TV show, as the caption claims.\n\nThe episode, \u201cMarge in Chains\u201d, features a virus that spreads from Japan to Springfield in packages. However, the illness is described as Osaka flu -- not coronavirus -- in a report read by the show's newsreader Kent Brockman.\n\nThe image in the bottom-right corner is from a different episode. AFP ran a keyword search for \u201capocalypse meow\u201d -- visible in red behind the yellow \u201ccorona virus\u201d title -- and found that the screenshot was taken from an episode broadcast in 2010.\n\nThe episode, \u201cThe Fool Monty\u201d, features a plot by the media to release a man-made disease known as \"house cat flu\".\n\nDuring a news bulletin, Kent Brockman is pictured alongside a title reading, \u201cApocalypse Meow\u201d, which has since been doctored to add the term \u201ccorona virus\u201d in the widely-shared social media posts.\n\nThe World Health Organization previously debunked false claims that people could contract the novel coronavirus from parcels arriving from China.\n\n\u201cIt's very unlikely that you can get the COVID-19 just by touching the outside of a package sent from China or another country,\u201d WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cViruses generally cannot survive more than a few hours on porous materials such as paper or cardboard.\u201d\n\nRead more about misinformation on the novel coronavirus here.", "lang": "en"}
