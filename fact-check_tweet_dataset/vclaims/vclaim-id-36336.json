These total three seats, and are a far cry from the 36 seats being claimed to have minuscule margins that could have put the BJP in sight of victory. \n\n\n\nDelhi Elections: AAP Steals The Show, Poised To Win 62 Seats Out Of 70\n\nIn the elections, whose results were declared on February 11, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) retained power with authority, winning 62 of the 70 seats up for grabs, with the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) winning in the remaining 8. The Congress drew a blank.\n\n\n\nBOOM received the message on its helpline (7700906111).\n\nBOOM found this to be viral on Twitter as well, with even a Lok Sabha MP, Satyadev Pachauri (BJP, Kanpur) tweeting this information, garnering him more than 1,300 likes and close to 600 retweets.\n\nBOOM also found this message to be viral on Facebook too.\n\nTherefore, BOOM looks at Election Commission of India data to check the margins of victory. \n\n\n\nAccording to official Election Commission of India data, there are no seats with margins of less than 100, which does not corroborate claims carried by message stating that 8 seats were lost by the BJP with a margin of less than 100 votes. \n\n\n\nThere are only 2 seats won by AAP with a margin of less than 1,000. These seats are those below:\n\nIn Bijwasan, Bhupinder Singh Joon of AAP - garnering 57,271 votes - defeated BJP's Sat Prakash Rana - earning 56,518 votes - by a margin of 753 votes, and it is the smallest victory margin this election.\n\nIn the second smallest margin of victory, the BJP's Abhay Verma - getting 65,735 votes - wrested the Laxmi Nagar seat from incumbent AAP MLA Nitin Tyagi, who got 64,855 votes. In this fight, the margin of victory was just 880 votes.\n\nThere is also one seat where the margin of victory is less than 2000 votes.\n\nIn Adarsh Nagar, incumbent AAP MLA Pawan Sharma - who received 46,892 votes - held on to his seat with 1,589 votes. His closest opponent, the BJP's Raj Kumar Bhatia, received 45,303 votes. This margin is the third smallest witnessed in the recent Delhi elections.\n\nThe fourth smallest margin was witnessed in the Kasturba Nagar seat, when current AAP MLA Madan Lal retained his seat with a margin of 3,165 votes against the BJP's Ravinder Chaudhary. This margin is much higher than the upper ceiling of 2,000 votes being claimed by the viral message.\n\nTherefore, data shows only three seats having a margin of less than 2,000 votes, with no evidence of 36 seats.\n\nOfficial data from the Election Commission of India can be found here.\n\nBOOM has done a roundup of the top seven fake news trends around the Delhi elections, which can be watched below.", "lang": "en"}
