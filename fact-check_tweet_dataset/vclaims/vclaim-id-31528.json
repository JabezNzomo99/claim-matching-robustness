These photos have been used in a misleading context; they show a private firm distributing free face masks to locals in Manila\u2019s Chinatown, and while the Philippine government did once provide masks free of charge, it has since issued a statement discouraging its use.\n\nThe photos were published on Facebook here on February 1, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cThe Philippine government is giving out masks for free! / Businesses are giving out free masks on the street! / #817breakdowncrying / #Go #GotothePhilippines\u201d.\n\nThe photos were also shared on Facebook here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThese photos, however, are being used in a misleading context; they actually show a private firm distributing free face masks to locals in Manila\u2019s Chinatown. The Philippine government did previously provide masks free of charge sporadically, but the Department of Health has since issued a statement discouraging the public from using them.\n\nAFP conducted several keyword searches to find this video on the Facebook page of the Philippine TV network ABS-CBN dated January 31, 2020, which match the photos being shared in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the ABS-CBN video:\n\nThe ABS-CBN video is captioned: \u201cLOOK: An establishment in Ongpin gives away free surgical masks in Ongpin, Sta. Cruz, Manila, Friday. / It is owned by a Chinese who has lived in the Philippines for 10 years. #coronavirus #nCoV\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of a photo the misleading post (L) and the ABS-CBN video (R), with the distinctive identifiers \u2013 a woman in pink distributing the masks and purple and blue boxes \u2013 circled red by AFP:\n\nCloser examination of the first photo in the misleading Facebook post showed the shop sign of a Korean restaurant reading \u201cONGPIN BRANCH\u201d. Ongpin is the name of the central street that runs through Manila\u2019s Chinatown, and the Google Street View imagery of the street appears to match the location shown in the photo, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nThe face mask giveaway in Manila\u2019s Chinatown was also reported by other local media here.\n\nManila\u2019s city government has previously distributed limited numbers of face masks to some schools, health centers and select districts in January 2020, according to government press releases published on its website here and here, and Twitter here.\n\nHowever, a representative from the city\u2019s Public Information Office told AFP via SMS on February 18, 2020, that such projects have been halted.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far there is no ongoing distribution because such activities have finished.\u201d\n\nThe Philippine Department of Health has in fact issued numerous public advisories, such as this and this, discouraging the use of face masks.\n\nIts latest guideline states, in part: \u201cUse of surgical face masks is ONLY recommended for: a. Persons caring for the sick; b. Persons with respiratory infection/symptoms coughing, sneezing, and/or have fever; c. Healthcare and other frontline workers\".\n\n\u201cPeople in good health do NOT need to use face masks.\u201d\n\nAs of February 19, 2020, the death toll from the novel coronavirus outbreak has reached 2,000. More than 74,000 have been infected in mainland China alone, and hundreds of others overseas. Here is the latest AFP report on the ongoing viral epidemic.", "lang": "en"}
