However, the above-displayed picture doesn\u2019t show one of them.\n\nThis photograph was taken by Dusty Klifman, an underwater photographer who runs the Blueyes Below social media pages, and shows a boat that sank near Traverse City, Michigan. While Klifman\u2019s photograph shows a real sunken boat, the original picture did not feature a Trump flag. The flag was digitally inserted into the image to capitalize on the hoopla surrounding the Trump boat parade.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the real photograph (right), and the doctored image (left):\n\nA few days later, he shared a video of the boat:\n\nKlifman shared the real picture on Facebook in June 2020 \u2014 months before the Trump boat parade \u2014 along with a message stating that this photograph was taken off the coast of Traverse City. According to a report from MLive, which appears to be about the same incident \u2014 judging from details provided by Klifman on Facebook \u2014 the above-displayed boat sank in Grand Traverse Bay on June 19, 2020. The U.S. Coast Guard, as well as a local good Samaritan, successfully rescued all 10 people aboard.\n\nHere\u2019s an image from the Coast Guard and an excerpt from MLive about the real story behind this sunken ship photo:\n\nA U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew, local authorities and a Good Samaritan all helped rescue 10 people from a fast-sinking boat on Grand Traverse Bay earlier today. The incident began about 2:30 p.m. when the Coast Guard\u2019s Sector Sault Ste. Marie Command Center took a distress call via radio from a 30-foot boat that was reportedly taking on water in the bay near Traverse City. But as the people were being transferred off the sinking boat, the vessel began to go under the water rapidly. This forced everyone into the water. The Coast Guard\u2019s rescue swimmer was able to help get everyone back to shore with the assistance of the Good Samaritan, authorities said. The vessel sank in 250 feet of water.\n\nWhile this viral image was not taken at the Trump boat parade in Texas (it actually shows a boat that sank in Michigan with a digitally manipulated Trump flag), five boats did sink at the Trump event.\n\nTCSO says five boats sank during the event. At this time, three were towed out of the water and two remain submerged. Officials say all the distress calls were resolved without injury or loss of life. Most boats that were taking on water, or even fully submerged, were hooked up and towed before they sank to the bottom of the lake. According to a press release TCSO says, when the large number of boats began moving together, the wakes generated large waves in areas where participating boats were dense. Law enforcement says they have found no evidence of foul play associated with any of the incidents.", "lang": "en"}
