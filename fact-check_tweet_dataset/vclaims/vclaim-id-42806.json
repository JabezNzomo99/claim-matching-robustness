No, that's not true: This is a fake story published by a satire website. The publisher is infamous for trolling conservative readers with sensational claims, mostly about Democrats. These articles are often plagiarized by other websites without the proper satire warnings.\n\nThe claim originated in an article published by wearethellod.com on April 14, 2020 titled \"Pelosi Has 100-Year-Old Ten Commandments Monument Removed from Capitol\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nNothing in this story is real. There is no Ten Commandments monument at the U.S. Capitol. The man who received the tablets from God does appear above the entrace to the House chamber.

He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com, bustatroll.org or bebest.website. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news.
