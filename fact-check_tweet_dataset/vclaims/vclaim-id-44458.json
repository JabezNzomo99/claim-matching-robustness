China PM who told we'll translate the Quran as our own realised that the only one way to protect from the korona virus.. It is noteworthy that a recent report revealed that the Chinese government has planned to rewrite the Quran to \u201creflect socialist values.\u201d\n\nThe 45-seconds video was also shared by one Khan Shahbaaz Ali Khan on Facebook on February 3, 2020, drawing 370 shares so far. The video is viral on Facebook and Twitter with the same narrative.\n\nAlt News has received several queries on its mobile application to verify the video.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple keyframes with the help of digital verification tool InVid. A reverse-search of one of the frames on Yandex revealed that the video is from Malaysia and not China thus, unrelated to the recent Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe video was first uploaded by Associated Press on July 21, 2015, during former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\u2019s visit to Beijing\u2019s Nan Xia Po mosque where he took part in Friday prayers.\n\nTherefore, a four-year-old video of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi visiting a mosque in China is falsely shared as Prime Minister of China visiting a mosque during Corononavirus outbreak in the country. It is noteworthy that Li Keqiang is the current Chinese PM. He has been in office since 2013. Furthermore, the incumbent PM of Malaysia is Mahathir bin Mohamad.", "lang": "en"}
