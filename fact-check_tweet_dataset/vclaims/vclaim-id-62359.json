Sarah Elago, Kabataan Party List Rep namunbdok (sic) kasama ang mga bagong narekrut (Sarah Elago spotted! Sarah Elago, Kabataan Party List Rep went to the mountain with new recruits).\" The posts contained hashtags against the CPP-NPA-National Democratic Front.\n\nThe facts: The caption in these posts misrepresent a photo that Kabataan Representative Sarah Elago herself posted from a hike for a cause event in March 2020. Rappler had previously fact checked another misrepresented photo of Elago from the same event.\n\nThe photos were taken during a hike organized by SheDecides Philippines and Trail AdvenTours. The hike was held on March 1 at Mount Binutasan, Tanay, Rizal to help adolescent girls affected by the Taal Volcano eruption.\n\nElago, who was one of the participants in this hike, posted the photo herself on Instagram on March 1 with the caption, \"Today, She Decides, together with Trail Adventours, led 'SheHikes, so SheDecides,' a symbolic goal-setting campaign that seeks to provide menstrual and hygiene kits to adolescent girls affected by Taal Volcano eruption.\"\n\nWeeks after the event, Rappler spotted and fact-checked posts that falsely claimed that Elago attended the anniversary of the New People's Army and which also misrepresented one photo that Elago herself posted from the hiking event as proof of the claim.\n\nBangon Bisayas and Mark Laurence L Zalasar also have a history of posting false claims. Earlier they posted a false quote attributed to Elago, saying children are not their parents' property and threatening to destroy their future. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
