Why?\n\n McConnell: In the last 100 years, three presidents suffered big defeats in Congress in their first term and then won reelection: Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and the most recent example, Bill Clinton. I read a lot of history anyway, but I am trying to apply those lessons to current situations in hopes of not making the same mistakes.\n\nNJ: What have you learned?\n\n McConnell: After 1994, the public had the impression we Republicans over promised and under delivered. We suffered from some degree of hubris and acted as if the president was irrelevant and we would roll over him. By the summer of 1995, he was already on the way to being reelected, and we were hanging on for our lives.\n\nNJ: What does this mean now?\n\n McConnell: We need to be honest with the public. This election is about them, not us. And we need to treat this election as the first step in retaking the government. We need to say to everyone on Election Day, \u201cThose of you who helped make this a good day, you need to go out and help us finish the job.\u201d\n\nN.J.: What\u2019s the job?\n\n McConnell: The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\n\nNJ: Does that mean endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president?\n\n McConnell: If President Obama does a Clintonian backflip, if he\u2019s willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it\u2019s not inappropriate for us to do business with him.\n\nNJ: What are the big issues?\n\n McConnell: It is possible the president\u2019s advisers will tell him he has to do something to get right with the public on his levels of spending and [on] lowering the national debt. If he were to heed that advice, he would, I imagine, find more support among our conference than he would among some in the Senate in his own party. I don\u2019t want the president to fail; I want him to change. So, we\u2019ll see. The next move is going to be up to him.", "lang": "en"}
