However, he did not refute news reports from November 2016 that said it was 83 ballots in two stacks.\n\nHowever, the ballots were erroneously sent to the address because of a bug in the county's computer system that tracks voting records \u2014 not because someone or something was trying to cheat the elections system or commit fraud.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles County Registrar's Office, which oversees voting systems for the area, too many ballots were sent to a single Los Angeles apartment in November 2016.\n\nIn late May 2020, as U.S. President Donald Trump rallied his supporters against vote-by-mail systems during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, social media posts called attention to a 2016 incident in Los Angeles where 83 mail-in ballots were apparently sent to a single residence \u2014 an example, critics claimed, of voter fraud and the ballot-casting method\u2019s room for error in U.S. elections.\n\nSeveral Facebook and Twitter posts shared a link to a Daily Mail story from Nov. 3, 2016 \u2014 a story that used reporting and photographs from a Fox News article published on the same day titled, \u201c\u2018Voter fraud\u2019? California man finds dozens of ballots stacked outside home\u201c.\n\nBoth stories allege an incident in the days before the 2016 presidential election that can be summarized like this: A resident of an apartment complex in Los Angeles\u2019 San Pedro community found two stacks of mail-in ballots, totaling 83, on top of a mailbox he shared with his building. The ballots were unopened with different names listed as their recipients, though the packages all had the same destination address: a single apartment in the complex that\u2019s home to one 89-year-old woman. The stories portray the incident as a possible case of voter fraud.\n\nYet a TV news station, NBC4 Los Angeles \u2014 KNBC, wrote a news story the following day, confirming that 83 ballots were sent and addressed to the apartment belonging to the 89-year-old woman without speculating as to why.\n\nFor Snopes\u2019 investigation into the claim, we looked at the following: that 83 ballots were sent to a single Los Angeles apartment and that that action was part of a nefarious scheme by something or someone to illegally cheat the voting system.\n\nWe reached out to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder/county clerk, which oversees voting and elections systems for the area, and confirmed too many ballots were indeed sent to a single Los Angeles apartment in November 2016 \u2014 proving one part of the as claim true.\n\nIn an email to Snopes, a spokesman for the agency did not confirm the exact number of ballots mistakenly sent to the apartment in the incident; however, he did not refute the Daily Mail story that reported 83 ballots in two stacks.\n\nBut here\u2019s what the 2016 stories did not say: The ballots were erroneously sent to the apartment because of a malfunction in the county\u2019s computer system that tracks voting records, according to the spokesman. He said:\n\nIn other words, the voting information of numerous residents was accidentally attached to one file \u2014 presumably the 89-year-old woman\u2019s \u2014 and so ballot postage for those residents printed with just her address on them.\n\nOfficials contacted the county residents who didn\u2019t receive their ballots due to the error, and then re-issued those people ballots, as well as took other precautionary measures so the problem wouldn\u2019t happen again, the spokesman said. Advocating for the widespread availability of mail-in ballots in 2020 during the pandemic, he said in reference to the 2016 case:\n\nThe online claims in spring 2020 aiming to raise Americans\u2019 suspicion of the ballot-casting system were headed by Trump. As states scrambled to reform their voting systems to meet rules on social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis, the president railed against mail-in voting, spreading false claims that the voting method invites illegal activity. (Research by political science experts show that voter fraud is slightly more common with mail-in voting than in-person voting at polling places, but the country\u2019s total number of voter-fraud cases is minuscule in comparison to the number of ballots cast; therefore, it\u2019s problematic, or at best misleading, to put numbers for each voting method up against each other.)\n\nIn sum, given that the Los Angeles County registrar confirmed too many ballots were sent to a single apartment in November 2016 as a result of a bug in the county\u2019s elections management system, but that no evidence shows the issue was a result of illegal voter activity, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of truth and falsehood.", "lang": "en"}
