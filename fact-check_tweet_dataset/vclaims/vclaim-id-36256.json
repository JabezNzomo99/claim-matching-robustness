Joe Biden: \u2018Bingo!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe post misrepresents Biden\u2019s remark, which he made in an interview with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that was broadcast in August 2019.\n\nCooper asked him about gun owners who are concerned that \u201ca Biden administration means they\u2019re gonna come for my guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBingo, you\u2019re right, if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period,\u201d the former vice president responded.\n\nHe went on to say that he would institute a national buyback program, but \u201cthat\u2019s not walking into their homes, knocking on their doors, going through their gun cabinets, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no legal way that I\u2019m aware of that you could deny them the right if (they) had legally purchased them, but we can in fact make a major effort to get them off the street and out of the possession of people,\u201d Biden said when asked if people could keep weapons they already have.\n\nWhen he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, Biden led the administration\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful push for a plan to curb gun violence after the massacre of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.\n\nThe plan included a call for a reinstated ban on assault rifles, an effort to close background check loopholes, and limits on magazine capacity -- measures that Biden is again pushing for now.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign website describes gun violence as a \u201cpublic health epidemic\u201d and outlines steps he would take on firearms if he wins the presidency.\n\nAmong those is a requirement that assault weapons already in circulation be either registered under the National Firearms Act -- as is currently the case for silencers, short-barreled rifles and automatic firearms -- or sold to the government.\n\nHe also wants to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nAmerica is plagued by frequent gun violence, but little action has been taken at the federal level to curb it, with the National Rifle Association lobbying heavily against gun control measures.\n\nNearly 40,000 people died from firearms-related injuries in the United States in 2017, according to the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhile mass-casualty attacks involving military style rifles grab headlines, handguns are the most common type of firearm used in homicides in the United States, according to statistics released by the FBI.", "lang": "en"}
