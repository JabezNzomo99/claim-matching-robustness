Scott Walker\u2019s 2011 collective-bargaining law and will begin deducting pension contributions from those workers not already making them.\n\nTo help offset the pension contributions, Barrett wants to give 3.9 percent raises for general city employees. The plan, which carries a price tag of $4.8 million, would not apply to police and firefighters. They were exempted from the provisions of Act 10.\n\nCity officials say most fire and police personnel pay little or nothing toward their pensions and -- unlike most other city employees -- still can negotiate over benefits and pay.\n\nEast Side Alderman Nik Kovac said Barrett\u2019s plan for raises seems reasonable.\n\nAnd in a Sept. 30, 2014 Fox6 TV interview, Kovac addressed the disparities between different groups of city employees under Act 10.\n\nPolice and fire officials \"are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting a zero or 1 percent raise,\" Kovac said. \"That imbalance, the longer it continues, is going to hurt morale and make it harder and harder to run the city in a fair manner.\"\n\nFour percent vs. nothing? Routinely? That got our attention.\n\nOn Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac\u2019s claim, saying they have not seen a raise in two or three years.\n\n\"Nic, where are you getting 4% annually?\" a Fire Department employee commented. \"This is not just misleading, it\u2019s wrong.\"\n\nWhat are the real numbers?\n\nWhen we asked Kovac for backup, he said he spoke off the cuff with the TV reporter.\n\nIn doing so, he misspoke.\n\nAfter checking the recent history of raises with the city budget office, Kovac said he should not have said \"routine\" or \"annual\" in regards to 4 percent raises for police and fire.\n\nMaria Monteagudo, the city\u2019s employee relations director, sent us the base pay increases for city employees back to 1991.\n\nHere are the percentage raises from 2010 to present. (Fire and police unions ratified contracts for 2010-2012 after Act 10 took effect in 2011).\n\n\n\nIn 2012, firefighters and police received raises in the 4 percent range while general employees received nothing. But that was a one-year blip.\n\nWith that exception, across-the-board raises have been small or nonexistent for all city employees dating to 2010, the year before Act 10.\n\nOne important note: For 2013 and 2014, public safety employees have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. So while they have received nothing so far, they could still receive raises retroactively once a contract agreement is reached.\n\nGeneral city workers and managers received small raises for those two years. That was done without collective bargaining for most of those workers, because the largest labor union representing city employees was not recertified under Act 10 rules, Monteagudo said.\n\nBefore 2010, city employees of all types typically got 2 percent to 3 percent raises with small variations. Unionized workers typically were around the top of that range, with non-represented managers closer to the low end.\n\nWithin the union ranks since 2007, police and fire raises have outstripped those for general workers.\n\nMandatory furloughs, including of police and fire workers, have cut further into pay. Barrett\u2019s 2015 budget would eliminate furloughs for non-uniformed workers, while their future use for police and fire workers would depend on the outcome of labor negotiations.\n\nKovac said police and fire workers \"are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises.\"\n\nThat scenario was seen in 2012, but so far has not reappeared. Uniformed workers have had a leg up on general employees since Act 10, but only marginally in a time of austerity.", "lang": "en"}
