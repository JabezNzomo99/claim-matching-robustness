But there is little evidence that the UN has ever recommended a specific ratio.\n\u2022 None Experts say the number of police officers alone will not solve South Africa\u2019s crime problem and quality of policing also matters. \n\n\n\n\n\nthe first step to creating a country where all people feel safe is to \u201cincrease police visibility by employing more police women and men\u201d.\n\nreaffirmed Ramaphosa\u2019s call to expand the police force. He said a United Nations standard stated that there should be one police officer for every 220 people in the country.\n\n\u201c[In] South Africa at the present moment we are one to 383,\u201d he\n\n. He gave this figure as 193,000 officers. To make the ratio 1:220, Cele said \u201cwe are 60,000 down\u201d.\n\nDo his numbers add up? And does the UN have a recommended ratio?\n\nThe police-population ratio shows the number of police officers serving a community. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100.\n\nAfrica Check spoke to the minister\u2019s spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, who said the ratio was a \u201csimple calculation\u201d based on the number of people living in South Africa and the number of police officers. \u201cIf you take into account that we only have 193,000 in our network, it then gives you a ratio of one police officer to 383 people.\u201d\n\nThe most recent population estimate for South Africa is\n\n. According to the police\u2019s latest\n\ntotal employees in the department as at March 2018. Based on this figure the ratio is 1:298 - not the 383 cited by Cele.\n\nHowever, included in the police\u2019s staff are\n\norganisational and administrative support to the police.\n\nas \u201cthose whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders\u201d.\n\n. The toolkit highlights the difference between \u201csworn staff\u201d (police officers who have the power to arrest and search) and \u201cun-sworn\u201d staff (who typically perform administrative and support functions).\n\nIf the public service act employees are excluded from the calculation, then the ratio is one police officer to 383 people. (\n\nCele\u2019s police-population ratio of 1:383 is therefore mostly correct, if administrative staff are excluded. But does it fall short of the UN standard?\n\nCele\u2019s spokesperson Reneilwe Serero told Africa Check that information on the UN\u2019s recommended police ratio could be found on the \u201cUN\u2019s website\u201d. But we couldn\u2019t find the 1:220 ratio listed anywhere.\n\nIt is a ratio that is often cited in many countries, and it varies a lot. In 2017 Africa Check\n\na similar claim, when Kenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta claimed that one police officer serves every 390 of his citizens. This, Kenyatta said, was against a UN recommendation of 1:450.\n\nIn Nigeria, while seeking more personnel,\n\nThe UN did not respond to our queries about if they have any ratio. However, we managed to trace the often-cited ratio back to the United States\u2019\n\nof occupied Germany in 1945. Back then one American policeman oversaw 450 German civilians. Its success at the time has tended to inform international policing, with the ratio being\n\nfrom one UN document to another over the years.\n\nThe Institute for Security Studies has also tried to trace down the origins of the ratio.\n\n\u201cThat concept has been used since I can remember,\u201d Lizette Lancaster, manager of the institute's crime and justice information hub, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cPerhaps a ratio did exist somewhere on some website at some stage. How it was calculated, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been taken as fact for years.\u201d\n\nRecommended ratio may not be helpful\n\n, told Africa Check that he didn\u2019t believe a UN recommended ratio existed.\n\n\u201cI doubt that agreement on such a number would be possible. I am not sure where the numbers that are used come from, but for them to carry \u2018official status\u2019 they would need to have been included in the UN standards and norms on crime prevention and criminal justice. They are not there,\u201d said Shaw.\n\n\u201cEven if such a number existed, I don\u2019t think it would be particularly helpful.\u201d\n\nHe said that while the number of police is an important factor, it is also necessary to consider what the police do and how they are trained.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is wrong to debate the numbers of police but it should be combined with a discussion of how overall policing can be improved.\u201d\n\nLancaster also argued that the number of police in itself is not going to reduce crime. \u201cWe know that South Africa is quite unique, we have very high violent crime rates. In certain areas we know there is a dire need for more police officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut police need to be deployed where it matters the most, we need more targeted policing, and better trained police officers.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
