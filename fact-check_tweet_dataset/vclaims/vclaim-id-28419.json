These images were found on a news website from Egypt, Sharkia Today. It may be noted the report is dated August 25, 2017, and is titled, \u2018A young man disguises himself as a woman to kidnap children in the gathering, and the people hand him over to the police\u2019 (translated from Arabic). The incident had occurred in Cairo. Alt News found another news report on the same incident.\n\nIn this report, Alt News found the same photograph which has been doing the rounds.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the above image dates back to at least 2017, and is not related to the recent protest at the Jamia Milia Islamia.", "lang": "en"}
