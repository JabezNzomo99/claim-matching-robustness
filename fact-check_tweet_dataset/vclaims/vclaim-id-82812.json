The Washington Post\u2019s education team found his ad devoid of context and flimsy with the facts, so we also decided to take our own look at his claims.\n\nIn the ad, Trump characterizes Common Core as a federally imposed program. Later in the ad, he says: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end Common Core.\u201d The call to get rid of Common Core and its federally coerced curriculum is popular rhetoric among Republicans \u2014 but it\u2019s a mischaracterization of the educational effort.\n\nCommon Core is not affiliated with No Child Left Behind, the unpopular law pushed by then-President George W. Bush in 2001. There may be confusion over the federal government\u2019s role in Common Core because of President Obama\u2019s Race to the Top initiative, according to the U.S. News & World Report. Common Core standards align with Race to the Top standards, so applicants for Race to the Top grants who had adopted Common Core had points added to their score to qualify for grants, according to the U.S. News & World Report\u2019s \u201cGuide to Common Core.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Trump confused Common Core with No Child Left Behind. But he should know that No Child Left Behind has already been replaced by a new law, the Every Child Succeeds Act, which was signed into law on Dec. 10, 2015.\n\nTrump made this argument in his presidential campaign announcement speech, saying the United States is \u201c26th in the world \u2014 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like Third World countries.\u201d (We found the international comparisons are mostly of industrialized countries and regions. Trump didn\u2019t repeat the \u201cThird World\u201d point in the ad.)\n\nAmerican students are struggling in math, compared to other industrialized countries. The United States ranked 27th out of the 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is below average among OECD countries. The United States ranked close to the OECD average in reading and science.\n\nThere likely is not a connection between Common Core standards and the 2012 PISA report. For one, these U.S. rankings have not changed significantly in the three academic performance criteria over time, according to the OECD. As Brown noted: By 2012, few states had begun using the Common Core standards to shape classroom instruction.\n\nThe United States does spend more per student than most countries. But Trump goes too far saying in such absolute terms that the United States spends more than \u201cany other country in the world. By far. It\u2019s not even a close second.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the United States spent $11,841 per full-time-equivalent student on elementary and secondary education, according to the National Center for Education Statistics Condition of Education 2015 report. That was 35 percent higher than the OECD average of $8,789. For post-secondary spending, U.S. expenditures were $26,021 per student \u2014 nearly double the OECD average of $13,619.\n\nA country\u2019s wealth is associated with per-pupil spending, the report showed. Out of OECD countries, the 10 countries with the highest GDP per capita also had per-pupil spending that was higher than OECD average. The inverse was the same for countries with the lowest GDP per capita.\n\nTrump inaccurately asserts that Common Core is a program enacted from Washington, imposed on local governments. But it has been, and still is, a state-led effort where governors and school chiefs set the standards. It has been a state-led effort, and states have opted into adopting the standards. Then, they have revised the standards to fit their state and allowed state and local school districts to shape the curriculums for themselves.\n\nMoreover, Trump exaggerates the United States\u2019 per-pupil spending and test scores relative to other countries. The comparisons available show how the U.S. fares compared to industrialized, member countries of OECD. Yet Trump makes broad assertions that do not clarify this point. Trump and his campaign haven\u2019t bothered to defend this point to us, but we\u2019d encourage him to clarify U.S. rankings among OECD countries.", "lang": "en"}
