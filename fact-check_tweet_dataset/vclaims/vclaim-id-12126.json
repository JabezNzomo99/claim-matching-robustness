The Pew Research Center, meanwhile, found the number had dropped to about 10.7 million in 2016. One recent study suggested much higher numbers \u2014 with a mean estimate of 22.1 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. \u2014 but some, including Fix and his colleagues, have contested its methodology and findings.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Fix said, \u201cunauthorized (immigrants) have for decades been barred from all cash and in-kind public benefit programs \u2014 and applications for those programs have been screened through the SAVE,\u201d referring to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. He also noted that they are \u201cbarred from federal employment\u201d and that \u201capplications for employment for federal positions are themselves screened\u201d through the E-Verify system.\n\nMany of the public-benefit restrictions on unauthorized immigrants were codified in a 1996 welfare reform law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2016 report that such immigrants are not eligible for programs including SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program); Supplemental Security Income; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; and Medicaid.\n\nSome exceptions: treatment under Medicaid for emergency medical conditions, temporary in-kind emergency disaster relief and immunizations. Immigrant children are also not barred from accessing public education.\n\nBut none of this lends credence to the unsupported claim that \u201c18 million illegal immigrants\u201d are receiving \u201cgovernment checks.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nPassel, Jeffrey S., and D\u2019Vera Cohn. \u201cU.S. Unauthorized Immigrant Total Dips to Lowest Level in a Decade.\u201d Pew Research Center. 27 Nov 2018.\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security. \u201cPopulation Estimates \u2013 Illegal Alien Population Residing in the United States: January 2015.\u201d December 2018.", "lang": "en"}
