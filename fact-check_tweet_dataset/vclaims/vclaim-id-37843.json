It is located approximately 30km from the Huanan Seafood Market, the market identified as the possible initial site of infection.\n\nA report in the Washington Post newspaper cited experts stating there is no evidence linking the lab to the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.\n\nUS fact checkers Politifact have labelled the claim the virus was a bioweapon created in a lab near Wuhan as \u201cunproven\u201d.\n\nPolitifact concluded: \u201cAs of now, however, the lab\u2019s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\nIn the description of the Facebook video posted by STFN Reloaded is the claim there are \u201c100,000 plus\u201d cases of the \"Wuhan super virus\" in Wuhan. The same claim that \"100,000 people are infected\" is made in the video at about the 11min 45sec mark.\n\nAccording to the Wuhan Coronavirus Global Cases reporting tool created by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the tally of confirmed cases was 3,554 in Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan is located, and 6,165 worldwide as of 1200 AEST January 30, 2019.\n\nDingxiangyuan, a community driven website for Chinese physicians, reported a total of 2261 confirmed cases in Wuhan and 4586 in Hubei province at 12pm AEST January 30, 2019. The numbers are taken from rolling updates on China\u2019s main public television network China Central Television (CCTV) and official Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily.\n\nThe National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (NHC) reported at 0300 AEST on January 30, 2019, that 7,711 cases had been confirmed in China, with a further 12,167 suspected cases. The NHC did not break down the statistics by province or city.\n\nAll three sources put the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China, let alone the city of Wuhan, well below the \u201c100,000 plus cases in Wuhan\u201d claimed in the Facebook post and video.", "lang": "en"}
