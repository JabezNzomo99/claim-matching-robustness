{"title": "Putin: Why He Says He Has No Strong Rivals", "subtitle": "Putin explains that the reason he faces no serious rivals for the presidency is due to the accomplishments of Russia during his tenure, and implies that the opposition has no program. However, both domestic and foreign analyses of the past 17 years say that Russia\u2019s accomplishments have been largely negated thanks to Putin\u2019s own policies. There also are domestic political reasons why Putin\u2019s rivals are weakened, which he does not mention.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 15, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3360", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-news-opposition/28920988.html", "vclaim": "At his annual year-end press conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained to reporters why he has not had any competitive rivals for the presidency in nearly twenty years.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would be happy if we had a balanced political system,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI want this, and I will work towards this. And a balanced political system is unthinkable without competition.\u201d Putin went on to talk in statistical details about Russia\u2019s economic and demographic achievements over the past 17 years since he first won the presidency in 2000.\n\nWhile it is true that Russian living standards dramatically improved in last decade, driven mainly by high commodity prices, and Putin can claim credit for backing sensible economic policies such as tax reform, which increased state revenues, according to recent analysis by the World Bank, Russia\u2019s economy is far from stable and a high share of the population remains vulnerable.\n\nRussia has been facing a significant rollback in living standards in recent years. GDP growth has been hit hard. Since 2014, the country has experienced an increase in the number of citizens living in poverty, with nearly 20 million people living on less than $139 a month. Many of Russia\u2019s regions are struggling under the weight of their debts.\n\nWhile Putin speaks of a \u201cbalanced political system,\u201d the Russian president\u2019s rule has been characterized by a consolidation of power, Freedom House labeling Putin\u2019s government as \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, and a legislature dominated by his United Russia party, Putin is able to manipulate elections and inhibit formal opposition,\u201d said Freedom House in it\u2019s 2017 profile of Russia.\n\nAnalysts identify in Russia two types of opposition, often called systemic and non-systemic. The former refers to Russia\u2019s formally registered opposition parties such as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF). Non-systemic opposition refers to challengers such as the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, and the late politician Boris Nemtsov, assassinated in Moscow in February of 2015.\n\nWhile systemic opposition candidates have run against Vladimir Putin in elections, their parties typically do not oppose the president\u2019s initiatives in Parliament. In one instance, LDPR presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky called elections in Russia \u201cworthless,\u201d and suggested that Putin should be given the title \u201csupreme commander\u201d\n\nNon-systemic opposition candidates and activists are typically hampered by extremely complicated and ever-changing election rules, lack of state media coverage , state-media run smear campaigns and attacks by pro-government individuals. Allegations of election fraud are also common in Russia.\n\nIn one remarkable moment in Putin\u2019s four hour press conference, an opposition candidate for president rose to question him. Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of a Putin political mentor, was a TV reality host and is now a reporter for TV Rain.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that today opposition candidates are not allowed to take part in elections, or they run into problems. I can feel it myself,\u201d she told the president.\n\nDescribing why she thinks the political competition is absent in Russia, Sobchak said: \u201cAll of it is simply connected with fear. People understand that to be an opposition member in Russia means that you will either get killed, or go to jail.\u201d\n\nPutin dismissed Sobchak and other opposition candidates, saying they do not offer positive solutions for Russia\u2019s problems.", "lang": "en"}
