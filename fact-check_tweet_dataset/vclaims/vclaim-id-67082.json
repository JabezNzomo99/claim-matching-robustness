It is carved in stone. No one knows who is the sculptor. This is in #Naga_Vasuki temple, #Prayag. We always feel proud about Tajmahal, ignoring vast #cultural_heritage which remained unnoticed even today, \u201d the post claimed.\n\nFacebook posts can be seen here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the post and found the claim to be misleading.\n\nWe put the picture through Reverse Image Search and found a Pinterest link of the same image. According to the link, the picture is of an artistic banyan tree at Utsav Rock Garden in Karnataka.\n\nTaking a cue from the above, we checked the official website of Utsav Rock Garden and found this image on the site.\n\nWe also searched for Nagvasuki Temple which is situated in Prayagraj and after an extensive search, we did not find pictures of any such sculpture at the temple.\n\nThe above information proves that the sculpture is not from Prayagraj. Hence, the post is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
