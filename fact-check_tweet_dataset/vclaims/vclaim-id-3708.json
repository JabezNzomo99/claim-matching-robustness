In December, Trump signed a directive calling on NASA to return to the moon and to boldly go where no man has gone before.\n\nUnder Trump, NASA announced plans for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, which would be built in the 2020s. This is a key step, since astronauts would use this platform orbiting the moon as a testing ground in deep space and then as a hub between Earth and Mars.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, NASA began to work on a reusable rocket ship designed to take crews from Earth to Mars and then back and forth from Mars to the moon platform. (\u201cOur next goal is to get to Mars,\u201d Obama said in 2016.)\n\nThe plan, in a nutshell, is to hopscotch from Earth to the moon to Mars over several decades. NASA does not yet have a solid target date for landing on the Red Planet. The first big step is building the moon-orbiting gateway and then traveling to the area around Mars, such as \u201clow-Mars orbit or one of the Martian moons,\u201d NASA says.\n\nAfter all this, NASA says, the next step would be sending astronauts to land on Mars, perhaps sometime in the late 2030s. (Elon Musk of SpaceX is building his own spaceship and says it could be test-flying to Mars in 2019. But word to the wise: Musk adds there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance you will die.\u201d)\n\nIn a 1999 speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Clinton said this project was \u201cchallenging schoolchildren around the nation in conjunction with NASA to design a community that they would want to live on the planet Mars in the year 2030.\u201d\n\nMore recently, during the 2016 race, Clinton\u2019s campaign submitted written responses to questions about space travel from ScienceDebate.org. She said one of her goals would have been to \u201cadvance our ability to make human exploration of Mars a reality.\u201d (In response to the same questions, \u201cTrump did not formally support a human Mars exploration program or other specific initiatives,\u201d Space News noted.)\n\n\u201cToday, thanks to a series of successful American robotic explorers, we know more about the Red Planet than ever before,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cA goal of my administration will be to expand this knowledge even further and advance our ability to make human exploration of Mars a reality.\u201d\n\nPresumably, this would have meant supporting the same \u201cJourney to Mars\u201d initiatives that have enjoyed Obama and Trump\u2019s support. Jake Sullivan, who served as Clinton\u2019s top policy adviser during the campaign, confirmed that Clinton \u201cproposed to advance plans for human exploration of Mars.\u201d\n\nClinton even visited a factory in Michigan making parts and tooling for the Space Launch System. That\u2019s the rocket for the Orion spaceship NASA is building for the Mars voyage and other deep-space destinations. \u201cI got to see what\u2019s happening here to help build the SLS rocket that is going to go from Macomb to Mars,\u201d Clinton said in August 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the American plan for Martian colonization would be unfolding any differently had Clinton won the presidency, since NASA\u2019s \u201cJourney to Mars\u201d initiative predates Trump and builds on what Obama did. And in any case, Americans are not expected to be walking on Mars during the four or eight years of the current administration.", "lang": "en"}
