The chain is like a disaster. You bring one person and you end up with 32 people.\u201d\n\nSince last October\u2019s truck attack in Manhattan, President Trump has claimed without evidence that an Uzbek man who was charged in the attack had sponsored 22 to 24 relatives who moved to the United States through \u201cchain migration,\u201d or family-based immigration.\n\nOn Monday, he appeared to have added a few relatives to this count and applied it more broadly to all immigrants.\n\nAmerican green card holders can sponsor only their spouses and unmarried children for permanent residence. American citizens can also sponsor their parents, siblings and married adult children.\n\nAs The New York Times has previously reported, studies have estimated that a single immigrant has, on average, sponsored 2.1 to 3.45 foreign relatives \u2014 a tenth of Mr. Trump\u2019s dramatic figure.", "lang": "en"}
