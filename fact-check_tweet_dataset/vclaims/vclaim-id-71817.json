According to conspiracy theorists whose claims often go viral, they are crisis actors playing parts in a fabricated tragedy.\n\nAdd to that false narrative the skepticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s critics and you get a social media post like like this one.\n\nIt features two photos. The first is of Trump leaning over a person in a hospital bed. The second is of Ivanka Trump standing with her arm around a girl\u2019s shoulder. The text says: \"This little girl is Emma Breier, daughter of former Trump appointee Kimberly Breier. Wasn\u2019t it sweet of her to pose as a victim in El Paso with Uncle Donny??\"\n\nThis Aug. 12 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ll cut to the chase: The photo of patient is in the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, not El Paso. Our reporting shows she is a survivor of the mass shooting outside a bar in Dayton on Aug. 4 that left 10 people dead, including the suspect. She is an adult, though, not a little girl as the Facebook post suggests, and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor, much less the daughter of a Trump appointee.\n\nThe first photo was published among others on The White House\u2019s Instagram page on Aug. 7 with this caption: \"The President and First lady met with survivors and family members in Dayton, Ohio, this afternoon.\"\n\nSharon Howard, a spokesperson for the Miami Valley Hospital, would not comment directly on the Facebook post\u2019s allegations. But she told us that all of the hospital\u2019s patients are adults and all of the photos the White House released following the president\u2019s visit are legitimate.\n\nWhile Trump was at the hospital, Howard said, he met with the three patients who were still checked in following the shooting, and he met with their families, first responders and the medical team that treated the patients.\n\nHe did not meet with any other patients while he was there, she said.\n\nIvanka Trump posted the second photo on Twitter on Aug. 7 and tweeted: \"Thank you @WHAAsstSecty Kim Breier for your friendship and service. While Jared and I will miss working with you, we are happy that Emma will now get to see more of the mom she is so proud of!\"\n\nOn Facebook, Ivanka Trump\u2019s photo was cropped to exclude the image of Kimberly Breier, the assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere, who resigned this month.\n\nThese images are of two different people.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
