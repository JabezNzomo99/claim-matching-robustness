This is a series of levels that hospital trusts can say they are at to indicate how much pressure they are under.\n\nOPEL 1 is the least severe and is used when hospitals can \u201cmaintain patient flow and are able to meet anticipated demand within available resources\u2026 Additional support is not anticipated\u201d.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, OPEL 4 is when \u201corganisations [are] unable to deliver comprehensive care\u201d and \u201cthere is increased potential for patient care and safety to be compromised\u201d. OPEL 4 also means that external support for the trust is required.\n\nThe guidelines also say that \u201cWhere multiple systems in different parts of the country are declaring OPEL 4 for sustained periods of time and there is an impact across local and regional boundaries, national action may be considered.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported that most of the 23 trusts it described as being on \u2018black alert\u2019 had actually gone onto OPEL 4. The Department of Health told us that it doesn\u2019t use this phrase.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked NHS England whether or not the Guardian\u2019s figure is accurate. The latest published figures are for 7 and 8 January.\n\nOn these two days there were no OPEL 4s, but 52 trusts had reported an OPEL 3. This means that the trust was \u201cexperiencing major pressures compromising patient flow\u201d and that some outside help might be needed.\n\nSince 31 December there have been 74 hospital trusts which said they were at OPEL 3 or 4 on one or more days. That\u2019s just under half of all trusts in England. Eight of these said they were at OPEL 4.", "lang": "en"}
