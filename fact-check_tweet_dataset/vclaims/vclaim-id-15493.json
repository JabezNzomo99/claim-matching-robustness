Not only does the Pakistani flag has a white stripe at the left hand, the crescent and star on it are also positioned differently than the IUML flag.\n\nHowever, time and again attempts have been made to pass off IUML flags at Congress rallies in Kerala as Pakistani flags.\n\nThe flags shown in all the viral posts are the IUML banners. Waving the green banner with an imprint of crescent and moon is a regular affair at IUML as well as Congress rallies in Kerala.\n\nSeveral videos of the pre-nomination rally were also shared with captions of Pakistani/Islamic flags being waved by Congress supporters. Twitterati were on a roll sharing videos from Wayanad claiming there were more 'Pakistani flags' in the rally compared to the Indian tricolor.\n\nThe flags raised at Congress' Wayanad rally - uniformly green with a crescent and moon imprint at the corner - is quite different from the national flag of Pakistan.\n\nIUML Office Passed Off As Congress Office In Kerala\n\nThe caption with this viral post claims that it is the Congress' party office in Kerala. However, when BOOM inspected the image minutely, at least two evidences were spotted which pointed out that it was an IUML office and not Congress'.\n\nThe image on the top left corner of the picture - that of a ladder - depicts the party symbol of the Indian Union Muslim League.\n\nAlso, the poster below the party symbol is that of Syed Muhhamedali Shihab Thangal. Shihab Thangal, president of the Kerala State Committee of the IUML, passed away in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
