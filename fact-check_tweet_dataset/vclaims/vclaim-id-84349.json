They are not legalised in the country and are distributed illegally.\"\n\n\"The ban on e-cigarettes is a ministry initiative and decision,\" Dr. Chakma continued.\n\nThe ordinance plans to impose hefty fines of up to Rs. 1 lakh and/or jail for 1 year for first time offenders, fine of Rs. 5 lakh and/or jail for 3 years for repeat offenders. Storage of e-cigarettes can lead to a fine of Rs. 50,000 and/or a fine of 6 months.\n\nE-cigarettes work on the principle of vaping.\n\nVaping is when a liquid is heated to turn into steam for inhaling purposes. E-cigarettes are heated and the vapors of nicotine as well as the flavours are then inhaled.\n\nE-cigarettes are considered to be less harmful than traditional smoking. But, a recent string of studies is changing this perspective.\n\nE-cigarettes were marketed as tools for reducing smoking but are in turn equally addictive for consumers.\n\nThe number of vapers increased by 1.5 million in 2018 in the United States, according to the Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention.\n\nVaping leads to the shortness of breath, fever and fatigue after several days of vomiting, as well as lung irritation.\n\nBOOM spoke to Dr. Aditya Agarwal, pulmonologist at Opera House Clinic to understand the ill-effects of vaping.\n\n\"I think e-cigarettes are equally harmful if not more, as cigarettes. This is replacing one form of smoke with another.\"\n\n\"We come across a lot of patients who want to quit smoking and have moved to e-cigarettes and have still continued to have health issues,\" Dr. Agarwal continued.\n\nHe even stated that e-cigarettes also contribute to lung diseases including pneumonia.\n\nStudies across the world have suggested various ill-effects of flavoured e-cigarettes. From harming the cardiovascular system, impairing lining of the lungs and causing troubles in breathing, reducing the body's ability to fight infections, causing irritation, to the death of six individuals in USA.\n\nThe study saying that flavours in e-cigarettes can cause irritation was conducted by Duke and Yale Universities. They scientifically proved that not only nicotine but the other flavours are also carcinogenic and harmful.\n\nWhile vaping, the flavours are mixed with solvents, which when heated are left over and can lead to lung inflammation. The study also mentions the scientific conversion of flavours such as vanilla, cherry, citrus, ad cinnamon mix with other chemicals to form acetals which act as irritants.\n\nThe products do not mention using these products.\n\nAn independent body called Association of Vapers India (AVI) is opposing the government's move to ban vaping and believes it is a healthy alternative to quitting smoking.\n\nBOOM contacted Samrat Chowdhery, the spokesperson for the association but has not heard back from him. The story will be updated on the basis of his response\n\n30 countries have currently banned e-cigarettes with USA in the pipeline to ban flavoured e-cigarettes.\n\nNicotine is not the only toxic compound in the e-cigarettes as the studies suggest.\n\nAfter 6 deaths of youngsters reported in the United States due to vaping and another 450 cases of complaints of lung problems due to vaping, US President, Donald Trump stated that he would ban the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes in the country.\n\nJuul, which is one of the leading brands of flavoured e-cigarettes is ideally supposed to be consumed by people over 21. However, there has been a rampant increase in teen vaping cases and consumption of Juul in the United States.\n\nUK on the other hand, faced flak for suggesting that they would not face such an issue. This would be due to the yellow card system they have in place to regulate the quality, safety, and distribution of flavoured e-cigarettes under the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.\n\nThis agency encourages vapers to report any bad experiences.", "lang": "en"}
