Prof. Osinbajo is the running mate of President Muhammadu Buhari under the flag of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the presidential election rescheduled for this Saturday.\n\nThe trending news on Twitter was that Mr Osinbajo resigned his position to protest his alleged exclusion from a security meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe vice president, having noticed the rumour immediately took to his verified Twitter handle to debunk it.\n\n\u201cMisleading/FAKE news is on the rise especially in this season when Nigerians will make a choice about who will govern them for the next four years. I have not resigned! I remain committed to the service of the Nigerian people under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari\u201d, he wrote on Twitter.\n\nDubawa understands that this is election period and there is danger in posting or reposting information online without verifying them. Even if you retract that tweet or online post, the message has already been sent.\n\nThe presidential election is only two days away and false/politically motivated messages are expected to be on the rise. Just as it is your inalienable right to express yourself online, it is also your obligation to ensure that your \u2018expression\u2019 does not cause the loss of another\u2019s life or future!\n\nCONCLUSION: Based on the swift reaction of Mr Osinbajo, Dubawa can authoritatively report that the Vice President did not resign his position.", "lang": "en"}
