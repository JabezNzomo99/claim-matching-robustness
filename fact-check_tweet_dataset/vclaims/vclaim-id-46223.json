It is being claimed that the woman is Dr Vandana Tiwari who went to Uttar Pradesh last week to get tested for Covid-19, but got attacked by Islamic Jihadis. She was badly injured and susequently died on Thursday, the claim said.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral post is misleading. This case is from Madhya Pradesh and not Uttar Pradesh. UP Police tweeted about the same.\n\nAlso, this is true that the woman in the viral post is Vandana Tiwari. She was a pharmacist at the government medical college in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIndia Today contacted her husband Lokendra Sharma, who told us that Vandana was on Covid-19 duty but died due to brain hemorrhage. She was staying at the medical collage at the time.\n\nAccording to media reports, she got brain hemorrhage while she was on duty. Later, she was referred to Gwalior.\n\nAs per the media reports, she was in a coma and died on April 7. However, there is no mention of any attack on her in any media report. Her death certificate can be seen here.\n\nLokendra also denied the claims that his wife went to Uttar Pradesh for a Covid-19 test and got attacked by any Jihadis.\n\nIt is clear that Vandana Tiwari died of brain hemorrhage and not coronavirus.\n\nUpdate: The health worker Vandana was a pharmacist and not a Doctor. We are updating this in the story.", "lang": "en"}
