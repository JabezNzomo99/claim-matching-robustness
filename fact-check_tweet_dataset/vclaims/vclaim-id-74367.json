Below the text is an aerial photo of a very large crowd of people massed across a city bridge over a waterway and along the banks on either side.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 750 times. The same image, claiming to be from the Germany protest, has been used in other posts such as here and has also been shared multiple times on Twitter including here and here.\n\nLarge crowds did indeed gather in Berlin on Saturday, August 1 to protest against measures put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Germany but the photo in the post is not of those crowds, which were much smaller.\n\nThe march, which reportedly included violence against police and were attended by some people claiming the pandemic is a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d drew between 17,000 to 20,000 people according to news reports. The marchers were criticised by Berlin\u2019s mayor for not wearing masks or social distancing, and more than 130 people were arrested, according to Deutsche Welle news.\n\nThere were also reports anti-vaccination and far-right groups were involved.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search of the photo in the post using Tineye reveals that the photo used on the Facebook post is not from the German protest but rather from a large music festival held in Switzerland in 2019. It is from a gallery of photos shot at a music festival called Street Parade held in Zurich, Switzerland in 2019.\n\nDescribed as one of the world\u2019s biggest house and techno events, Street Parade reportedly draws up to 1 million visitors a year to the festival.\n\nA similar image taken at the same event is available on the Street Parade website in the multimedia gallery.\n\nThe 2019 event drew a crowd of 850,000 people according to organisers, many times more than the 20,000 estimated to be at the Berlin protest on the weekend.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the photo in the Facebook post is not a photograph of the protest march held in Berlin on August 1, 2020 and as such is misleading about the number of people who attended.
