They\u2019re trolling. They just want you to wash your fruit.\u201d\n\nThe controversy follows a popular TikTok trend that revealed little white maggots crawling out of strawberries after they were washed in warm saltwater for about 30 minutes.\n\nThe little creatures in the fruit are known as the spotted wing drosophilas, which lay eggs inside strawberries. They then hatch and crawl out after being washed in the warm saltwater solution.\n\nThe invasive fly arrived in the USA in 2008 and eventually spread nationwide.\n\nSriyanka Lahiri, an assistant professor and strawberry and small-crop entomologist at the University of Florida, told USA TODAY that the creature is mainly attracted to sweet and fermenting fruit, such as strawberries and blueberries.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so sneaky that they\u2019re the only pest that can be transported to the grocery store,\u201d Lahiri said. She said not every strawberry or blueberry will be affected, nor should people be too concerned about the creature.\n\nShe said female spotted wing drosophilas lay eggs inside perfect, ripe and undamaged fruit, \u201cand that\u2019s where you see the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis species is able to make a very fine incision that can\u2019t be seen with a naked eye and lays its eggs in there. When the picker gets the fruit, they can\u2019t even see that there\u2019s an egg because it\u2019s deep in the fruit,\u201d Lahiri said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it escapes detection, and it\u2019s not possible to detect that a fruit has been infested,\u201d she said.\n\nDo the bugs cause any harm?\n\nThere are no studies that have found spotted wing drosophilas, or other bugs in fruit, are harmful for human consumption. Lahiri said the bugs are just part of eating fruits, vegetables and anything else that grows out in fields.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that most fruits, stored grains, they have some level of insect infestation that is impossible to get rid of,\u201d she said.\n\nHaving a few pests is more favorable than a zero-tolerance policy, which would force growers to apply a large amount of insecticides, posing an even bigger problem for farmers.\n\nIt is TRUE that small bugs can come out of strawberries after washing them with saltwater, depending on how ripe and fresh the fruit is. Experts contacted by USA TODAY confirmed that spotted wing drosophilas can lay eggs inside berries; however, they said there is nothing to worry about and the fruits are safe for consumption.\n\u2022 USA TODAY: 'Bugs and maggots may crawl out of strawberries washed in saltwater.
