There\u2019s no evidence that\n\nwe drink it gives water these specific curing powers.\n\nhas researched the meme\u2019s advice and found it \u201c\n\nAnd cardiac surgeon Dr A Marc Gillinov of the\n\nin the US says \u201cthere is no data to suggest that \u2018when\u2019 you drink water matters. Choose water over most other drinks. But don\u2019t schedule your drinking according to a fictitious claim.\u201d\n\nthis advice as \u201cvirtually meaningless\u201d. Which internal organs would it \u201cactivate\u201d? The liver? The lungs? The heart? If these organs weren\u2019t active, we\u2019d be dead. And \u201ca glass of water is unlikely to help us\u201d.\n\nDrinking water first thing in the morning is healthy \u2013 it\u2019s healthy at any time of the day. But we don\u2019t have to do it to \u201cactivate\u201d our internal organs.\n\narticle titled \u201cWater myths debunked\u201d says it \u201cfound no research backing up this claim\u201d.\n\nIt quotes Dr Michael Rosenfeld, a lecturer in human metabolism, as saying he had \u201cnever heard of this claim\u201d and concludes it is \u201clikely a myth\u201d.\n\nIn fact, drinking extra water isn\u2019t needed for digesting food, at any time. Dr Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital in the US told news site\n\nthat \u201cdrinking water is not necessary for digesting food, because the body is very efficient at secreting and reabsorbing its own fluids\u201d.\n\n\u201cdrinking water before a bath or shower \u2013 or at any other time for that matter \u2013 does NOT lower blood pressure\u201d. It quotes biomedical researcher Dr Judith Airey as saying that \u201cgenerally, increasing the amount of water that is consumed will not increase the amount of sodium lost by the blood, so blood pressure will not be lowered\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn fact, drinking water can actually cause a very short term increase in blood pressure in some people, particularly those with some types of very low blood pressure. This is only temporary and has no long term impact on blood pressure.\u201d\n\narticle concludes that this is also a myth.\n\n\u201cYour blood pressure will not be affected because it is under the tight control of various hormones. If you are severely dehydrated and your blood pressure drops below the normal level, that system of hormones will cause you to feel thirsty. In the case of dehydration, drinking water will actually help increase blood pressure to a normal level.\u201d\n\n1 glass before going to bed avoids stroke or heart attack?\n\nIn an article examining bad advice for heart health,\n\n\u201cmost heart attacks occur in the day, generally between 6am and noon. Having one during the night, when the heart should be most at rest, means that something unusual happened\u201d. So even without the glass of water, you would be unlikely to have a heart attack at night.\n\nThe University of Washington looked into\n\non decreasing our risk of heart attack and stroke by the American Heart Association, US Centers for Disease Control and other US health organisations.\n\n\u201cThese recommendations include keeping a healthy weight, staying physically active, eating healthy, managing stress, and refraining from smoking,\u201d it says. \u201cDrinking a glass of water before bed is not on the list.\u201d\n\nMore than this, if you have to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom because you drank a lot of water before going to sleep, \u201cthis actually heightens your risk of heart attack and stroke because your sleep cycle is interrupted\u201d.\n\nSo this advice is also a myth. -", "lang": "en"}
