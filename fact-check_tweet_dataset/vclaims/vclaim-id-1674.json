{"title": "The cost of cutting corporation tax", "subtitle": "It could reduce the government\u2019s income, but we haven\u2019t seen estimates for the overall effect.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1674", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/cost-cutting-corporation-tax/", "vclaim": "In her recent speech on exiting the EU, Theresa May said that if the UK failed to strike a favourable new trade deal with Europe, then among other things:\n\n\u201c...we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world\u2019s best companies and biggest investors to Britain.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if the UK fails to strike a favourable trade deal, it always has the option of reducing corporation tax and drawing multinational investment and tax revenue away from its European neighbours.\n\nEmily Thornberry made a reference to this on last night\u2019s Question Time:\n\nThese figures are estimates from the Labour party, and Ms Thornberry has quoted them incorrectly. The \u00a3120 billion includes estimated money lost to tax reductions that have already happened or are already planned, not just the ones the Prime Minister is suggesting in her speech.\n\nThe Labour Party has estimated the direct effect of cutting corporation tax to the same rate as Ireland would build up to a \u00a363 billion loss in tax revenue over the next five years. Ireland has the lowest tax rates in the OECD, an organisation of rich countries.\n\nIn other words, Labour estimates that the direct costs of carrying out Theresa May\u2019s suggestion are about half what Ms Thornberry suggested.\n\nAnd these figures only account for the direct effect of cutting corporation tax. That is, they don\u2019t account for the way that different tax rates might affect where companies choose to locate and invest.\n\nFor example, companies might choose to move their operations to the UK and pay lower rates, rather than locate elsewhere. They might also comply more readily with tax laws.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that either of these things would happen.\n\nBut because Labour\u2019s estimates only account for the direct effect they shouldn\u2019t be treated as complete estimates for the overall impact of cutting corporation tax on government finances, or assumed to be the only ones out there.\n\n\u00a360 billion lost tax receipts over the course of this parliament would still create a sizeable hole in the government\u2019s annual income. It\u2019s equivalent an average annual loss of between \u00a312 billion and \u00a313 billion a year, out of an average income of about \u00a3800 billion a year over the same time period.\n\nWhen Jeremy Corbyn made a similar claim in parliament this week, Labour supplied us with this table of estimates:\n\nLabour based its estimates on calculations by HMRC and consultation with the House of Commons Library, a research service for MPs. The figures are estimates for the direct effects of tax cuts and aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe first line estimates the tax lost each year because of cuts to corporation tax rates since 2010, running up to \u00a356 billion between 2016-17 and 2021-22.\n\nThe second line estimates the extra losses that might come from cut corporation tax further and became a \u2018tax haven\u2019, as Labour puts it. If we had the same corporation tax rate as Ireland, Labour suggests the government would lose another \u00a363 billion between 2017-18 and 2021-22.\n\nA recent Labour press release also quoted these figures incorrectly. It said:\n\nThat claim doesn\u2019t match the estimates supplied to us by the Labour party.\n\nThe table it sent us suggests that the direct costs of cutting corporation tax to match Ireland would be about \u00a363 billion over the next five years, on top of existing \u2018corporate giveaways\u2019 worth about \u00a356 billion.\n\nCombined together, these would add up to an accumulated cost of nearly \u00a3120 billion, not accounting for the indirect effects of tax cuts.", "lang": "en"}
