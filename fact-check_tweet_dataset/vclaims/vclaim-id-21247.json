Many news organisations had reported the story and carried the photograph, out of which an article from Outlook reported, \u201cThis Madrasa has become a center for modern education, where along with Arabic and English, Sanskrit is also taught (translated from Hindi)\u201d. It further states, \u201cThe specialty of this Madrasa is that Sanskrit is being taught by a Muslim teacher. Probably, this is the first time ever that Sanskrit is also being taught in Madrasa\u201d.\n\nIt has often been observed how false imagery is woven out of thin air and pushed relentlessly. All it takes is a minor tweaking of a photograph. Despite being called out multiple times for posting and sharing misinformation, some notorious pages, groups, and accounts continue to spew venom on social media.", "lang": "en"}
