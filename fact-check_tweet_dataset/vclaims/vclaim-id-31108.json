Several of her books, including \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d and \u201cDaniel Deronda,\u201d are widely considered classics.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that she authored the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. A search of the George Eliot Archive\u2019s collection of her novels, essays, poems and translations turned up no record of the quote. It doesn\u2019t appear in her collected letters either. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Say, \u2018Be Yourself; Everyone Else Is Already Taken\u2019?)\n\nThe Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic.\n\n\u201cGeorge Eliot did not make that statement,\u201d said retired Boston College professor Rosemarie Bodenheimer in an email to the Caller. \u201cNor did she believe what it says.\u201d\n\nThe quote may actually have evolved from a line in Adelaide Anne Procter\u2019s 1859 poem \u201cA Legend of Provenance,\u201d according to the website Quote Investigator. In that poem, Procter writes, \u201cNo star is ever lost we once have seen, we always may be what we might have been.\u201d\n\nTwo decades later, in 1881, the alleged quote appeared in the monthly journal \u201cLiterary News,\u201d after the editors asked the readers to submit their favorite Eliot quotes for a contest. It was included in the unvetted list of submissions without citing a source, according to Quote Investigator.\n\n\u201cProcter\u2019s statement would have been rephrased and then reassigned to Eliot,\u201d writes Quote Investigator. \u201cThis process may have occurred in the mind of the individual who sent the quote to \u2018Literary News.'\u201d", "lang": "en"}
