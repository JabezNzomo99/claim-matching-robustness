Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Message with a list of persons ready to donate Plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. Fact: Message with the same names was shared earlier in 2016 as the list of persons ready to donate blood. It is now being circulated as the list of persons ready to donate plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched on Facebook with a contact number in that list, it was found that the same list went viral in 2016. But the message then was shared as a list of \u2018Blood donors ready to help\u2019 unlike the current message that claimed it as the list of persons ready to donate plasma in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment. The same message with the title as \u2018Blood donors ready to help\u2019 was also shared in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nWhen we tried calling a few numbers in that list for clarification, some of the numbers were out of service and the rest haven\u2019t picked up calls. However, to be eligible for plasma donation, a person should have already been contracted with COVID-19 and recovered from it. But it is quite unlikely that the same set of 60+ persons whose names got circulated as \u2018blood donors\u2019 in the past were contracted with COVID-19 and are willing to donate their plasma to others.\n\nTo sum it up, a message shared as a list of blood donors in the past is now being circulated as \u2018Plasma donors in Mumbai for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
