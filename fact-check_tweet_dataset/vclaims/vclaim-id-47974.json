That turns out to be based on an erratic series of estimates drawn from a government survey that isn\u2019t even designed to measure income.\n\nTo be sure, incomes have risen substantially since Trump took office. As we reported last month, the Census Bureau\u2019s measure of median household income increased $1,400 (after adjusting for inflation) or 2.3% during Trump\u2019s first two years in office. All indications are that incomes have risen even more in 2019, with inflation-adjusted weekly paychecks rising 0.4% since December, and the stock market hitting new heights. But a $5,000 gain would be more than triple what the official figures show from Trump\u2019s first two years, and it\u2019s unlikely the total gain has suddenly surged to the level Trump claims.\n\nTrump first made the $5,000 claim on Oct. 16, saying, \u201cWe have numbers that just came out where not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I\u2019ve been president.\u201d It has become a favorite talking point. Trump made the claim again on Oct. 21, Oct. 23 and Oct. 25.\n\nHe draws his figures from an Oct. 10 item by the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Stephen Moore, whom Trump tried unsuccessfully to appoint to the Federal Reserve Board earlier this year. Moore in turn bases his analysis on monthly figures from Sentier Research, run by two former Census executives.\n\nEvery month, Sentier produces an estimate of median household income for the previous 12 months, which it bases on a single question included in the Current Population Survey. The Census Bureau conducts the CPS every month for the Bureau of Labor Statistics; its principal purpose is determining the unemployment rate, and Census states flatly that it is \u201cnot an income survey.\u201d\n\nIndeed it isn\u2019t. The CPS questionnaire contains only a single, catch-all question about income during the preceding 12 months, and it is not very precise. It doesn\u2019t ask for an exact figure, but rather asks respondents to choose one of 16 broad ranges \u2014 for example, from $40,000 to $49,999, or \u201c$150,000 or more.\u201d From those mushy responses, Sentier produces a single dollar estimate.\n\nWe looked at Sentier\u2019s most recent report, issued Oct. 30, and also at its underlying monthly figures, which Sentier provided at our request. The estimates do show a gain of $5,227 between January 2017, the month Trump took office, and September of this year.\n\nBut those monthly figures often take wide swings from month to month. Once, in August 2014, the estimate plunged by $1,238, or more than 2% \u2014 only to bounce back by a nearly equal amount the following month. Since January 2000, when the Sentier series starts, we find 21 times when the estimate of annual household income went up or down by 1% or more in a single month.\n\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s annual figures \u2014 which show a more modest increase during Trump\u2019s tenure \u2014 have a far more solid statistical basis. The official figures are based on a once-a-year \u201cAnnual Social and Economic Supplement\u201d to the CPS. This year the ASEC sampled about 95,000 households. That\u2019s a far larger sample than the survey Sentier uses; the monthly CPS sample is roughly 50,000, but the income question is asked of only 1 in 4 each month \u2014 or about 12,500 people.\n\nThere are other reasons to trust the official ASEC income figures more. They are based not on a single, catch-all question that only asks for broad ranges, but instead on a battery of questions probing for exact dollar amounts of income from each of many sources: employers, businesses, farms, property rental, and more than a dozen other categories including Social Security, veterans benefits and child support payments. All those exact dollar amounts are then added to produce a dollar amount of total income for each household.\n\nThe ASEC is also conducted in February, March and April of each year, a time of year when respondents typically have access to tax records. That should minimize the amount of guesswork involved.\n\nThe Sentier figures are not without value. They are more timely than the annual Census figures and useful for spotting possible trends. They show a $1,808 increase since December 2018, for example, that is consistent, in direction at least, with the increase in average weekly paychecks we mentioned previously.\n\nHow have incomes fared under past presidents? That\u2019s complicated. Due to a change in the Census survey questions in 2014 (which picked up some sources of income that were previously missed) and a change begun this year in the way Census processes the data, the figure for 2018 isn\u2019t strictly comparable to historical figures for past years.\n\nFortunately, Census officials have published \u201cadjusted estimate\u201d figures showing what median household income would have been for past years, had the current questionnaire and processing procedures been in place.\n\nOn that adjusted basis \u2014 which we judge to be the most accurate for making historical comparisons \u2014 the increase during Trump\u2019s first two years would be $1,638, or 2.7%.\n\nThat\u2019s still nowhere near the rise indicated by the Sentier data, but it does exceed the rise during Obama\u2019s eight years \u2014 when adjusted median income rose $1,100 (in 2018 dollars), or 1.8%. And it\u2019s vastly better than the change during George W. Bush\u2019s eight years, which were plagued by two recessions. During Bush\u2019s time, adjusted median income fell $2,660 (also in 2018 dollars), a decline of 4.2%.", "lang": "en"}
