This is false; the photographer who took the photos in Italy said he did not see anything suspicious, and other images suggest the girl is Obama\u2019s niece.\n\n\u201cHe see he got caught,\u201d claim Facebook posts trying to paint Obama and Clooney as being among the liberal politicians and celebrities whom the widespread conspiracy theory claims are pedophiles.\n\nThey include at least three photos of the former US president and the actor on a boat, accompanied by a young looking girl the posts imply is a victim.\n\nIn one of the images, a red arrow points to Clooney\u2019s hands on his belt while a second points to the head of the girl. In another, the girl is circled in yellow with her arms extending outwards while holding a piece of fabric, leaving some commenters wondering if she is taking off her shirt.\n\nSome versions of the claim feature a fourth photo of Obama in the Oval Office, a young girl sitting on his lap.\n\nAll four photos are real, but social media users are drawing false conclusions about them.\n\nThe girl sitting in Obama\u2019s lap is his niece. The photo was taken on December 4, 2015 by official White House photographer Pete Souza, who published the photo on his personal blog with the caption: \u201cThe President snuggles with his niece Savita Ng after his sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, and her family dropped by the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nThe photos on the boat were taken in June 2019 on Italy\u2019s Como Lake, when Obama and his family visited Clooney in a mansion there.\n\nMatteo Bazzi, a photographer for the Italian news agency ANSA, confirmed to AFP via LinkedIn that he took the photos from that angle. Bazzi agreed to look through his photos from that day, and did not spot anything suspicious happening on the boat.\n\n\u201cI was not aware of this gossip,\u201d Bazzi said.\n\nWhile the photos used in the posts suggest that Clooney and Obama were among men on the boat, other photos show that they were accompanied by Clooney\u2019s wife Amal, Obama\u2019s wife Michelle and their daughters Sasha and Malia, as well as other friends and relatives.\n\nOne video posted on Instagram by a local newspaper shows all the guests coming back to a hotel, with the young woman preceding all the others. Translated from Italian, the caption reads, \u201cFirst come the daughters and relatives.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is not certain that the girl is Savita Ng, her father Konrad Ng posted photos on Instagram geotagged Lake Como on June 25, 2020, including a video shot from a boat on the lake, suggesting that the family was present.\n\nNg also posted a photo geotagged in the southern French city of Avignon just days before, where the Obamas were also vacationing prior to Como.\n\nThe first suggestions of foul play appears to have emerged from the now-suspended Twitter account @WinstonCovfefe just days after the Obamas\u2019 Italian vacation in August 2019. Fact-checking website Snopes pointed out that the account was responsible for other hoaxes in the past.\n\nAs the photos resurfaced in August 2020, most versions of the hoax featured the hashtag #SaveTheChildren or #SaveOurChildren, while some YouTube videos and tweets provide more explicit information accusing the two men of molesting the child.\n\nStarting in July 2020, the two hashtags were appropriated by followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. QAnon adherents believe that a secret \u201cDeep State\u201d cabal is composed of various liberal personalities including the Clintons, the Obamas, or Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, whom President Donald Trump aims to take down.\n\nThe theory holds that these personalities all secretly engage in perverted pedophilic behaviour, which provides a narrative for the Clooney and Obama photos.\n\n\u201cWhat QAnon has done is they folded in several forms of anti-pedophile conspiracy investigations that previously existed online to sort of streamline them for a more mainstream conservative audience,\u201d Brian Friedberg, a researcher at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, told AFP, adding that any theory can be worked into its canon.\n\nOnce a marginal theory, QAnon is moving into the mainstream through politicians, including one who recently won a primary contest in Georgia.\n\nAFP has debunked other false QAnon claims in the past.", "lang": "en"}
