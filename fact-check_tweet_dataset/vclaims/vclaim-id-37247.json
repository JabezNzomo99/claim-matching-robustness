Kavanaugh and what Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows on these issues.\n\nWith Trump campaign officials under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible collusion with Russia to unduly influence the 2016 campaign, some Democratic senators have expressed concern that Kavanaugh was hand-picked by Trump in the event that Mueller enters an indictment against the president.\n\nThose senators have pointed to pieces Kavanaugh penned in 1998 and 2009 that make clear Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion that a sitting president should not be criminally investigated or indicted. Whether that means Kavanaugh would rule as a Supreme Court justice that an indictment against Trump would be unconstitutional is another matter. Kavanaugh says he has \u201ca completely open mind\u201d on that question and has never publicly taken a position on it. But he has said and written plenty on the subject. We\u2019ll lay out some of that record and leave it to readers to decide.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cIt seems that you [Kavanaugh] have made \u2014 you may have intrigued him [Trump] for another reason \u2014 your expansive view of executive power and executive immunity. You\u2019ve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Patrick Leahy at Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing on Sept. 4.\n\n\u201cYou personally urged [independent counsel Kenneth] Starr to be aggressive, confrontational and even graphic in his questions [for President Bill Clinton] \u2014 we\u2019ve seen your memo on that one. But a few years later after working in a Republican White House, you totally reversed your position and argued that presidents should be above the law and granted a free pass from criminal investigation while in office. \u201d \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin at the Sept. 4 hearing.\n\n\u201cYou displayed expansive views on executive immunity from the law. If you are in that seat, sir, because the White House has big expectations that you will protect the president from the due process of law, that should give every senator pause.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse at the Sept. 4 hearing.\n\n\u201cBut these are not normal times. Instead we are here to decide whether or not to rubber-stamp Donald Trump\u2019s choice of a pre-selected political ideologue, nominated precisely because he believes a sitting president should be shielded from civil lawsuits, criminal investigation and prosecution, no matter the facts.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Mazie Hirono at the Sept. 4 hearing.\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: Kavanaugh has an interesting history on the issue of criminal investigations involving a sitting president, given that he was once a member of independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s legal team, whose investigation ultimately led to impeachment hearings against President Clinton. Kavanaugh was a lead author of the Starr Report. He later went on to work in the White House counsel\u2019s office under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003, and then as staff secretary to Bush. His position on whether a president ought to be subject to criminal investigation changed after his time on Starr\u2019s team.\n\nGeorgetown Law School conference, February 1998. Politico dug up a video of a panel discussion about the Independent Counsel Act at a Georgetown Law School conference in February 1998. At the event, Kavanaugh raised the issue of \u201cwhether the president is subject to criminal indictment at all, which is a question that has been a lurking constitutional issue for a long time and which at some point here should be resolved so we can determine whether the Congress or an independent counsel should investigate the president when his conduct is at issue.\u201d\n\nAnswering his own question, Kavanaugh said, \u201cI tend to think it has to be the Congress. \u2026 It [criminal investigation of a president] is war, and if it\u2019s going to be war it\u2019s gotta be Congress, not an isolated prosecutor appointed by three judges we\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d\n\nModerator Mark Tuohey then asked for a show of hands among the panelists, \u201cHow many of you believe, as a matter of law, that a sitting president cannot be indicted during the term of office?\u201d\n\nKavanaugh was among those who raised their hands.\n\nGeorgetown Law Review, 1998. That same year, in an article for the Georgetown Law Review, Kavanaugh wrote that whether \u201cthe Constitution allows indictment of a sitting President is debatable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Framers thus appeared to anticipate that a President who commits serious wrongdoing should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate \u2014 and then prosecuted thereafter,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cThe Constitution itself seems to dictate, in addition, that congressional investigation must take place in lieu of criminal investigation when the President is the subject of investigation, and that criminal prosecution can occur only after the President has left office.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh said that since the Constitution \u201cdoes not explicitly address\u201d the question of whether a president is subject to criminal indictment while in office, Congress ought to settle the matter definitively.\n\n\u201cCongress should establish that the President can be indicted only after he leaves office voluntarily or is impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted and removed by the Senate,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cRemoval of the President is a process inextricably intertwined with its seismic political effects. Any investigation that might conceivably result in the removal of the President cannot be separated from the dramatic and drastic consequences that would ensue. This threat inevitably causes the President to treat the special counsel as a dangerous adversary instead of as a federal prosecutor seeking to root out criminality.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Law Review, 2009. In 2009, Kavanaugh published another lengthy opinion on the issue in an article in the Minnesota Law Review in which he again described the issue as debatable, though (in a footnote), he used different words. \u201c[A] serious constitutional question exists regarding whether a President can be criminally indicted and tried while in office.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel twice concluded \u2014 in 1973 and 2000 \u2014 that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though that has never been tested before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn his Minnesota Law Review piece, Kavanaugh reiterated that a sitting president should not be indicted, and he argued that Congress ought to make that clear in law.\n\n\u201cHaving seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is, I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cThe country wants the President to be \u2018one of us\u2019 who bears the same responsibilities of citizenship that all share. But I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh acknowledged this was \u201cnot something I necessarily thought in the 1980s or 1990s,\u201d a period during which he served on independent counsel Starr\u2019s team investigating Clinton.\n\n\u201cLike many Americans at that time, I believed that the President should be required to shoulder the same obligations that we all carry,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cBut in retrospect, that seems a mistake. Looking back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas. Such an outcome would ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis. \u2026 And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh wrote that Congress ought to consider enacting a statute to defer any civil or criminal investigations or prosecutions of presidents until after they leave office.\n\n\u201cIn particular, Congress might consider a law exempting a President \u2014 while in office \u2014 from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cCriminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics.\u201d\n\nSome have argued that Kavanaugh\u2019s calls for Congress to settle the issue suggest that short of congressional action, he believes indictment is now constitutional.\n\nIn an opinion piece published by Bloomberg, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman makes such an argument.\n\n\u201cProperly understood, Kavanaugh\u2019s expressed views actually support the opposite conclusion: that the president can be investigated and maybe even indicted unless Congress passes a law saying he can\u2019t \u2014 which Congress has not done,\u201d Feldman wrote.\n\n\u201cIf a law by Congress is necessary to fix the problem, it follows that without such a law, it is perfectly permissible under the Constitution to investigate a sitting president, as Starr did,\u201d Feldman wrote. \u201cAlthough Kavanaugh didn\u2019t expressly say that a sitting president may constitutionally be indicted, it is a plausible implication of his article. Otherwise, there would be no pressing need for Congress to pass a law saying that he could not be. The courts could intervene and save the president from indictment.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh confirmation hearing, Sept. 5. There is often a good amount of reading the tea leaves to gauge how a Supreme Court nominee might rule on a given subject. And during the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh refused to reveal how he might rule on the constitutionality of an indictment of a sitting president. And he warned not to interpret his opinions in the Minnesota Law Review as answering that question.\n\n\u201cI proposed some ideas for Congress to consider,\u201d Kavanaugh said at the confirmation hearing. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom-line point. They were ideas for Congress to consider. They were not my constitutional views.\n\n\u201cIf a case came up that \u2014 where someone was \u2014 someone was trying to say this is a constitutional principle, I would have a completely open mind on that because I\u2019ve never taken a position on the Constitution on that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only put out proposals for you all to study, to think about the balance of a president fighting a war, leading a war and a president subject to say, ordinary civil lawsuits as in the Clinton versus Jones case.\u201d\n\nAs for the claims that Kavanaugh thinks presidents are \u201cabove the law,\u201d as Durbin put it, Kavanaugh disputes that.\n\nKavanaugh has said that while he doesn\u2019t think presidents should be criminally indicted, he does think that Congress can and should act as a check against presidential misconduct. And, as he said in 2009, presidents should still face potential criminal consequences once they leave office.\n\n\u201cThe point is not to put the President above the law or to eliminate checks on the President, but simply to defer litigation and investigations until the President is out of office,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in his piece for the Minnesota Law Review.\n\n\u201cA second possible concern is that the country needs a check against a bad-behaving or law-breaking President,\u201d Kavanaugh added. \u201cBut the Constitution already provides that check. If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available.\u201d\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh reiterated that position, saying, \u201cNo one is above the law in our constitutional system. \u2026 Under our system of government, the executive branch is subject to the law, subject to the court system. \u2026 It\u2019s an important part of the constitutional structure.\u201d\n\nOn subpoenas and self-pardons: During the confirmation hearing, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked Kavanaugh about comments he made nearly two decades ago that raise questions about whether he believes a sitting president can be made to respond to a subpoena. At issue are comments Kavanaugh made at a lawyer roundtable sponsored by The Washington Lawyer and published in 1999 regarding U.S. v. Nixon, in which the Supreme Court ruled against then-President Richard Nixon and required him to turn over audio tapes.\n\nBloomberg reported that Kavanaugh said then, \u201cMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided \u2014 heresy though it is to say so,\u201d and that \u201cMaybe the tension of the time led to an erroneous decision.\u201d\n\nAsked about that comment during his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh said the quote was \u201cnot in context\u201d and was a \u201cmisunderstanding of my position.\u201d Kavanaugh called the court\u2019s decision on Nixon \u201cone of the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history.\u201d\n\nBut Kavanaugh would not say what he would do under different circumstances when Feinstein asked broadly, \u201cCan a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?\u201d\n\nKavanaugh said he would follow the lead of past Supreme Court nominees and would not respond to \u201ca potential hypothetical.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh also deflected when asked if the president has \u201can absolute right to pardon himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that I have not written about, it\u2019s a question, therefore, that\u2019s a hypothetical question that I can\u2019t begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
