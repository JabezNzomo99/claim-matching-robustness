No, that's not true: a fake news website using the logo and layout of Fox News copied a story from two years ago made up by a satire website and changed the location. It is not real.\n\nThe story reappeared in an article published by foxnews-us.com (not foxnews.com) on August 28, 2018 titled \"Augusta man shoots off his own penis taking selfies with gun\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAUGUSTA, GA - A 20-year-old man is in stable condition Sunday afternoon after the gun he was posing naked with accidentally discharged and shot off his penis. \"We've never had someone shoot off their own junk before,\" the police said in a statement. \"There was a man who shot off his foot, a middle-schooler shot her guinea pig, and even a baby was able to shoot both his parents, but never someone's own junk.\"\n\nThat's almost exactly the same story that appeared in The Valley Report two years ago:\n\nThe image used to illustrate the story has been floating around the internet for years:\n\nNote that the man is holding a revolver (a gun in which the bullets are kept in a rotating cylinder) along with an elongated magazine typically used in a semi-automatic pistol (and he is holding it backwards).\n\nWe wrote about foxnews-us.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Paducah Man Did NOT Have Sex With Horse, Did NOT Say It Gave Consent By Winking\n\u2022 Fake News: Myrtle Beach Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath\n\u2022 Fake News: Bloomington Police Did NOT Discover Over 200 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employee's Home\n\u2022 Fake News: Bartlesville Woman NOT Awarded $1.4 Million After Suing Male Co-Workers For Excessive Farting.\n\u2022 Fake News: Battle Creek Woman NOT Arrested For Stinking Up Toilet And Closing Down Restaurant\n\nAs you can see the site has been on a roll recently copying old hoaxes from other sites and republishing them as new with some details such as the location altered.", "lang": "en"}
