In fact, it\u2019s not a genuine video of any weather system approaching any coastal city. This is actually a composite of at least two different images.\n\nThe foreground of this animated image was taken from a stock photograph of Miami Beach, Florida. The cloud portion of this image appears to come from a May 2016 photograph of large supercell storm over Leoti, Kansas:\n\nDigital artist Brent Shavnore first put these two images together for an artwork he shared to his Instagram page in April 2019:\n\nShavnore\u2019s artwork was later animated by Instagram user @TheGlitch.org:\n\nShavnore\u2019s Facebook page describes his artwork as \u201cmind blowing dreamy images of seascapes and anything imaginable.\u201d While much of his work borders on the surreal, this isn\u2019t the first time that someone has tried to pass off one of his pieces as genuine. In May 2018, another one of his digital creations was shared as if it were a genuine photograph of Subtropical Storm Alberto approaching Pensacola Beach.", "lang": "en"}
