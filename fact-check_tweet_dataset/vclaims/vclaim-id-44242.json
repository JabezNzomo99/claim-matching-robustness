The economy has grown by roughly this level since 1990, under both Conservative and Labour governments, not just this current government.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2018 the UK\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions fell by 39% and the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions fell by 44%.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s 42% figure could refer to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (not just CO2) between 1990 and 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these figures can only tell us so much. For example, they exclude greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping.\n\nThey also don\u2019t factor in the emissions produced from any international goods and services that are then consumed in the UK.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says: \u201cService-focused countries tend to create indirect emission by outsourcing the manufacturing of consumer items to countries with lower labour costs such as China.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cTherefore, any apparent decline in territorial CO2 emissions is overestimated. However, in recent years the UK has made genuine efforts in cutting down both its territorial and consumption-based emissions despite continued growths in its GDP per head.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous ways to measure the economy, but one of the most common is to look at Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the total value of everything that happens within a country\u2019s economy.\n\nUnder Conservative-led governments since 2010, the UK\u2019s GDP has grown by around 20% (depending on exactly when you start counting), not 73% as Mr Johnson said. We\u2019ve asked his office for more information.\n\n73% is how much the economy grew between 1990 and 2017, which comprised 13 years of Labour government, more than 10 years of Conservative government and five years of the Coalition.", "lang": "en"}
