The letter is in the name of Dr M.B. Patil, a Congress leader, and is dated 10th July, 2017. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: M.B. Patil wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi about the strategy of dividing Hindus and uniting Muslims to win the elections. Fact: M.B. Patil held a press conference and said that the letter in circulation is fake. Also, there are no organizations with the names \u2018Global Christian Council\u2019 and \u2018World Islamic Organization\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the \u2018M.B. Patil\u2019s letter to Sonia\u2019 on Google, it is found that Karnataka Congress has tweeted against the BIP Karnataka\u2019s tweet on the letter being circulated in social media. Karnataka Congress has tweeted that this fake letter was first published in 2018 by Post Card news, which later deleted the article, but it was recirculated by the BJP Karnataka just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in the state. Karnataka Congress leader M.B. Patil, also, held a press conference to rebut the false claims made by the BJP Karnataka. Also, if the names of the religious organizations cited in the letter are searched on Google, it can be found that so such organizations exist. The letter was also viral last year, just before the Karnataka Assembly Elections, then AltNews wrote an article to debunk the false claim. So, the letter in the post is fake .\n\nFinally, M.B. Patil\u2019s letter to Sonia Gandhi about the \u2018Divide Hindus \u2013 Unite Muslims\u2019 strategy in Karnataka is fake.", "lang": "en"}
