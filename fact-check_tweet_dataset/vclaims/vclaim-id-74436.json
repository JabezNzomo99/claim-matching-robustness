Airtel's response to bigoted customer request causes social media storm", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2018-06-19T11:42:17+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-74436", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/did-gaganjot-replaces-shoaib-airtels-response-to-a-bigoted-customer-causes-a-social-media-storm/", "vclaim": "\u201cDear Shohaib, as you\u2019re a Muslim and I have no faith in your working ethics because Kuran may have different version for customer service, thus requesting you to assign a Hindu representative for my request. Thanks\u201d. This statement was tweeted by an Airtel user who refused to be served by a Muslim employee after making insulting and prejudiced statements about his religion. What should an organization do in such a situation? What should its policy be? Should it stand by its employee when he faces discrimination because of his religion? Should it make a strong statement that such behavior towards its employees is unacceptable? It seemed that Airtel complied with the request and a \u2018Gaganjot\u2019 took over the case, replacing \u2018Shohaib\u2019.\n\nAirtel\u2019s response caused huge outrage on social media. Faced with a backlash from angry netizens, it sought to stem the damage. The customer care team sent out a follow-up response from a team leader to the customer stating \u201cwe absolutely do not differentiate between customers, employees and partners on the basis of caste or religion. We would urge you to do the same.\u201d It may be noted that Airtel responded to this controversy several hours after it was pointed out on social media.\n\nA report by The Hindu has quoted the spokesperson of the company who said, \u201cAt Airtel, we do not differentiate between customers or our employees/partners on the basis of caste or religion. If a customer contacts us again for an ongoing service issue, then the first available service executive responds in the interest of time. We request everyone not to misinterpret and give it unnecessary religious colour. The said customer has been responded to.\u201d\n\nThe social media user in question, Pooja Singh (@pooja303singh) describes herself as a management professional who is a \u201cProud Indian/ Proud Hindu/ Nation First/ Love our army\u201d. As is the case with many such \u201cproud nationalist\u201d profiles, this user too is followed on Twitter by prominent leaders of the ruling party.\n\nSingh has since retweeted several tweets of like minded people who have come out in her support. She has also posted a screenshot of selected responses to her tweet alleging abuse.\n\nThe Airtel incident comes on the heels of a similar incident involving Ola cabs. When a customer canceled his booking because the driver was a Muslim, Ola\u2019s response to him won it many accolades.\n\nBoth the responses of Ola Cabs and Airtel will go down as management case studies on how to handle racial / religious abuse by customers. The values that a brand stands for are demonstrated not by lofty statements on a \u2018Vision Document\u2019 but by its responses in real-time to the challenging situations it faces.", "lang": "en"}
