Some of the sample tweets were as follows:\n\u2022 \u201cWhy has the Left suddenly become active to take the farmers\u2019 cause? Why is that only farmers from northern Maharashtra participating in the farmers\u2019 morcha? #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIn the Year of 2016-17 Maharashtra Govt invested 56000 Cr in Agriculture #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cUrban Maoist cadres are participating in it, they are poor tribals and not farmers. Their demand is about farming rights in forest. Communist want another incident like like bhima koregaon, Congress, NCP providing tacit support for this. #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\nAlt News spotted a copy of the Google Doc circulating in a WhatsApp group of BJP supporters and decided to counter it on Twitter in a series of tweets.", "lang": "en"}
