Forbes estimated his net worth to be $4.1 billion in 2019.\n\nAside from his lucrative business ventures, Perot was well-known for the two independent presidential runs he made in the \u201990s. A key feature of his campaigns was 30-minute political infomercials in which he discussed the economy, jobs and the national debt.\n\nAt least one member of the Perot family has engaged in politics through donations. According to FEC records, the late billionaire\u2019s son donated $5,600 to Trump in March. There\u2019s no evidence, however, that Perot left $100 million to Trump\u2019s campaign in his will.\n\nHad he done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The family also did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, nor has it put anything on the memorial website.\n\nA big donation received in such a manner would likely prompt a statement \u2013 or at least a tweet \u2013 from Trump\u2019s camp as well.\n\nThe claim comes from an article published on PotatriotsUnite.com, a parody news website dedicated to \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery, or as Snopes calls it: Junk News.\u201d The article, which put up the headline \u201cRoss Perot Left $100 Million to the Trump 2020 Campaign,\u201d is satirical in nature and should not be treated as fact.", "lang": "en"}
