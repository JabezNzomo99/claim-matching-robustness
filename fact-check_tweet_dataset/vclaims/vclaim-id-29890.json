There is also another claim that food heated in a microwave oven has radiation. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: The Japan government has decided to dispose of all microwave ovens by this year-end. Fact: No such decision was taken by the Japan government. The news was first published by a satirical Russian website. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google whether the Japanese government has taken such a decision, it was found that no credible news agency has reported about any such decision and the news was first published by a Russian website [\u2018panorama\u2019] in March-2019. On the website, in the \u2018Disclaimer\u2019, it can be read that all the articles on the website are satirical and fictitious. So, the Japanese government has not decided to ban or dispose of microwave ovens. Previously, the same claim has also been debunked by Snopes. \n\n\n\nOn the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018food cooked in a microwave oven does not become \u201cradioactive\u201d.\u2019 Even in the article by US Food and Drug Administration on the \u2018Microwave Oven Radiation\u2019, it can be read that \u2018the microwave energy is changed to heat as it is absorbed by food, and does not make food \u201cradioactive\u201d or \u201ccontaminated\u201d.\u2019\n\nOther myths and realities regarding microwave ovens can be seen on the websites of \u2018Yashoda Hospitals\u2019 and \u2018Harvard Medical School\u2019.\n\nThere are also some other recommendations, in the post, allegedly recommended in a conference held at \u2018Kashira Cancer Center\u2019. But, when searched on Google, there is no information regarding the existence of \u2018Kashira Cancer Center\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, Japan\u2019s government is not disposing of microwave ovens. Microwave ovens do not make the food \u2018radioactive\u2019\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
