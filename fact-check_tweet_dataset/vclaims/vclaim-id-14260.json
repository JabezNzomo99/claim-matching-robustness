In a controversial move, Barr supplied a key legal judgment where Mueller declined to reach one.\n\nWhile the special counsel cleared Donald Trump of conspiring in Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, Barr said, Mueller left unresolved another major question that has dogged the president: whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nIn a move that left legal experts divided, Barr reasoned that Mueller\u2019s silence \"leaves it to the attorney general to determine\" if Trump obstructed justice. Barr and the deputy attorney general concluded the president had not done so.\n\nThe Mueller report summary appears to have quieted talk of collusion. But for some legal experts, the more equivocal findings on obstruction are fueling new questions. Others say it\u2019s simply time to give it all a rest.\n\nAccording to Barr, Mueller\u2019s report laid out evidence on both sides of the obstruction question. He said Mueller wrestled with \"difficult issues\" of law and fact, but ultimately \"did not draw a conclusion \u2014 one way or the other.\" The report does not conclude Trump obstructed justice, Barr said, but does not exonerate him, either.\n\nPrecisely why Mueller declined to draw a legal conclusion about obstruction remains a mystery.\n\n\"Robert Mueller clearly found that there was substantial evidence of obstruction,\" Benjamin Wittes, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said on MSNBC. \"The question is: Why should he not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment there?\"\n\nBradley Moss, a national security attorney, told us Mueller may have handed off the question to Barr because it was ultimately a highly sensitive political question.\n\n\"He may have felt it was not one for him \u2014 an unelected special counsel \u2014 to render judgment on,\" Moss said. \"It was something for the political part of DOJ to address.\"\n\nOne lingering question is to whom Mueller intended to leave the obstruction question.\n\nFor example, had Mueller intended for Barr to weigh in in such short order, or did he hope the Justice Department would investigate further before reaching a legal conclusion, perhaps even interviewing Trump in person? Had Mueller meant for Congress to probe, possibly through an impeachment proceeding?\n\n\"Mr. Mueller could have concluded that interviews of sitting presidents for obstruction matters are better done within the context of a congressional impeachment investigation,\" Neal Katyal, a former top Justice Department official, wrote in the New York Times. \"Or Mr. Barr could have concluded that the attorney general, not a special counsel, should carry out such an interview.\"\n\nBut former prosecutors told us Mueller\u2019s restraint shows he intended to leave the obstruction question up to Barr\u2019s judgment.\n\n\"At this stage he is the only authority who can really make this decision,\" said Ric Simmons, a law professor at the Ohio State University and former prosecutor. \"The Department of Justice must decide whether or not to prosecute a person for a federal crime, and for a case and potential defendant who is this high-profile, the decision had to be made at the highest level.\"\n\nMark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and former assistant U.S. attorney, said the division of labor was in keeping with the Justice Department\u2019s sharp delineation between investigators and prosecutors.\n\n\"Here, I think Mueller stayed in his lane as the investigator, and Barr played the role of the prosecutor,\" he said. \"The investigator presents facts to the prosecutor. It is then the prosecutor\u2019s job to decide whether or not to take the case to a grand jury (in this case, the House) seeking a charge.\"\n\nBarr\u2019s letter was essentially a \"declination memo,\" Osler said, referring to the letter written by a prosecutor (not an investigator) to explain to superiors why a case was not taken further.\n\nRobert Weisberg, a professor at Stanford Law School and an expert on criminal law and criminal procedure, said Barr\u2019s hand may have been forced.\n\n\"Assuming Mueller really did not want to decide,\" he said, \"then Barr had no choice but to make a charge or no charge decision.\"\n\nYet even if Barr\u2019s move was duly authorized, some believe his decision may have overlooked key evidence.\n\n\"It is wrong for Barr to conclude that there was no evidence of corrupt intent given that Trump was never interviewed in person about the obstruction issue,\" said Jens David Ohlin, a law professor at Cornell Law School. \"The best way of establishing or disproving intent is to hear from the individual in question.\"\n\nBut Moss, the national security attorney, pushed back on the notion that Barr had rendered a hasty decision about a two-year long investigation over the span of a weekend. He noted that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw Mueller\u2019s investigation, had co-signed Barr\u2019s memo.\n\n\"No doubt they had already been internally deliberating for months now,\" he said. \"So I'm sure they had some sense already of what they would view as sufficient to possibly meet an obstruction charge.\"\n\n\"I think that argument, that angle \u2014 it's dead,\" he said. \"It's over.\"", "lang": "en"}
