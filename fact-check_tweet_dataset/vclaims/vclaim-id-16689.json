They then attacked Hitler's ally Italy, and the slog up the Italian boot took much longer than expected. Stalin reportedly assumed that the West's delays in opening the second front was motivated by anti-Communism. That is very doubtful. It was prompted by Churchill's (and to a certain extent FDR's) reluctance to commit to a cross-Channel invasion until the requested numbers of troops and amount of materiel had been transported to the U.K.\u201d\n\nDavid Glantz, a leading American military historian of the Soviet role in World War II, agreed that Churchill\u2019s record vis-\u00e0-vis Bolshevism, specifically his alleged desire to \u201cbleed\u201d the Red Army while weakening the Wehrmacht, was not a contributing factor in that delay.\n\n\u201cIn truth, however, the western Allies lacked the strength and will to mount cross-channel operations in 1942,\u201d Glantz said. \u201cEvidencing that fact was the failed landing at Dieppe, France, in August 1942, which clearly demonstrated that the Allies were not capable of launching a direct attack across the channel without disastrous casualties and significant risks. The course and cost of the 6 June Operation Overlord essentially justified that delay. Therefore, the Allies sought more limited second fronts in Greece and Italy to weaken Germany before cross-channel operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe armed forces of the British and American armies were barely capable of beating the Germans,\u201d he said. \u201cHow they burst through German defenses was through a willingness to pay the blood price. The U.K. could not pay the full price of that campaign because they were already bleeding in Southeast Asia (and beyond).\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not Normandy was a game changer, that term can mean \u201cmany things, although D-Day was definitely a game-changer on the Allied side,\u201d Boire said.\n\n\u201cIt changed the way we waged war; it contributed to the victory. \u201c\n\nStephen Van Evera, a professor of political science at MIT, told Polygraph.info the Normandy landings \u201cwere one of the four great game-changer operations of World War II.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe others were the December 1941 defense of Moscow, and the 1942-43 defense of Stalingrad, and Kursk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Allied success at Normandy vastly increased the ability of the allies to put military pressure on Nazi Germany and markedly shortened the war.\u201d\n\nKeylor likewise said D-Day was a game changer in that \u201cit resulted in the opening of a second front in Western Europe, which Stalin had been pressing for since 1942.\"\n\n\u201cIt took some of the pressure off of the Red Army on the eastern front,\" he said, adding that the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk were definitely also game changers.\n\n\u201cHad {Kursk and Stalingrad] gone the other way, the war would have been prolonged many months and perhaps years,\" Keylor said.\n\nGlantz shares the view that D-Day was a game-changer.\n\n\u201cYes, it was a game-changer in the sense that the Allied (American, British, and Canadian) landings ultimately shortened the duration of the war by forcing Germany to shift forces from East to West and by distracting German attention from disasters looming in the East. It also bolstered the Soviet (Stalin\u2019s) motivation to hasten the Red Army\u2019s offensive operations,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Glantz also said D-Day was not the decisive factor it is portrayed as having been by U.S. observers.\n\n\u201cThe Soviets had expelled Axis forces from much of Russia proper, destroyed the armies of almost all of Germany\u2019s Axis allies (Italy, Romania, and Hungary) or forced them to withdraw from the war, begun the liberation of Poland and Romania, and were about to mount multiple successive offensives aimed at clearing German forces from Belarus and all German occupied territory east of the Vistula River in Poland and the Carpathian Mountains in Romania,\u201d he said.\n\nEnsuing Soviet offenses destroyed German army groups on the eastern front and inflicted more than 1 million casualties on the Wehrmacht, \u201cpropelling the Red Army\u2019s forces westward,\u201d Glantz said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, beginning on 25 July, the Allies broke out of the Normandy bridgehead, forcing a costly German withdrawal and seriously damaging Army Group B by mid-August, and driving German forces across the Seine River and through Paris by 25 August. These tit-for-tat offensives against Germany from East and West produced \u2018chicken or egg\u2019 arguments between the Allies regarding who did what to whom, when, and why. The net result, however, was that simultaneous offensives by American, British, and Canadian forces from the West and the Red Army\u2019s forces from the East certainly hastened ultimate German defeat.\"\n\nThat said, according to Keylor, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s resentment towards \u201cthe hoopla devoted to the D-Day landings\u201d is understandable, given the Soviet sacrifice during the war.\n\n\u201cThe Russians lost millions of people in the war while the Americans and British were reluctant to take the pressure off. In the end, it was the Red Army that drove the Germans out of the then Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Boire said that rather than being able to focus on a just cause, Putin has trouble recognizing \u201cthis Allied effort\u201d due to domestic political concerns.\n\nAs for the alleged lack of Allied support, Glantz said that just as in the past, \u201cthe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs fails to mention sizable U.S., British, and Canadian aid to the Soviet Union and Red Army in the form of Lend-Lease.\u201d\n\nWhile he said the impact of Allied weapons\u2019 deliveries is open to debate, the supply of other strategic materials and foodstuffs were vital to the Soviet war effort.\n\n\u201cEvidencing this fact is the ubiquitous presence of the words \u2018Studebaker\u2019, \u2018Duglas\u2019, \u2018Kobry\u2019, \u2018Villis\u2019, \u2018Dodzh\u2019, and \u2018SPAM\u2019 in the vocabulary of the Russians,\u201d Glantz said.\n\nSome Russian academics also hold that view.\n\nOleg Budnitsky, director of the International Center for the History and Sociology of World War II and Its Consequences at the Higher School of Economics, told the Russian government publication Russia Beyond the Headlines\" that the supplies provided to Russia via Lend-Lease, adjusted to the 2003 exchange rate, amounted to $130 billion.\n\n\u201cThe importance of economic cooperation with the U.S., UK and Canada cannot be overestimated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese supplies were critical in some key areas. For example, in the beginning of 1942, Western tanks fully replenished Soviet losses, and exceeded them by three times. About 15 percent of the aircraft used by Soviet air forces were supplied by Allies, including the P39 AirCobra fighter and the A20 \u2018Boston\u2019 bomber. The Allies supplied 15,000 state-of-the-art machines at that time; for example, famous Soviet ace Alexander Pokryshkin flew Air Cobra, as did the rest of his squadron. He shot down 59 enemy aircraft, and 48 of them were thanks to American military equipment.\u201d\n\nThus, while matters of history are always open to debate, Polygraph.info finds that, based on the historical record, any claim that D-Day was not a \u201cgame changer\u201d is false.", "lang": "en"}
