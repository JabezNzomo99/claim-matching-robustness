No, that's not true, the image claiming that she did originated on a Facebook page that was set up to troll conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing fake news so they could be mocked for it.\n\nThe meme claiming Clinton was behind the website was published on April 18, 2018 by Facebook page \"America's Last Line Of Defense\" (archived here) and it contained following text:\n\nThe website cannot have been founded on that date because it does not exist.
