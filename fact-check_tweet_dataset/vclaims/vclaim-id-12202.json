But is there research to back the claim?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we can safely dispel this misconception,\u201d Leith Meyer, director of the Centre for Veterinary Wildlife Studies and associate professor in veterinary pharmacology at the University of Pretoria, told Africa Check.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the response of wild elephants to humans they definitely do not see us as cute. Rather they see us as a threat.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeyer explains that in the wild, elephants\u2019 past experiences \u201chave produced an evolutionary hard wiring that causes them to treat us the way that they would other big predators, like lions\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe idea that elephants find humans \u201ccute\u201d likely comes from trained elephants who have become used to people, and who rely on them for their survival, Meyer says. Elephants in these situations may abnormally alter their behaviour \u201cto ensure that they survive\u201d.\n\n\n\nLynette Hart, an author of a 2017 study looking at elephant-initiated interactions with humans at Knysna Elephant Park in South Africa\u2019s Western Cape province, told Snopes in an earlier fact-check of the claim that tame elephants \u201cpreferentially and favourably interact (and initiate these interactions) with humans with whom they have a special relationship\u201d. \n\n\n\nMeyer says it\u2019s difficult to know how tamed and rescued elephants see their human keepers, and while strong bonds can form they \u201cshouldn't be attributed to human emotions but rather assessed based on how elephants behave and interact with each other\u201d.\n\nThere has been a lot of research on the parts of the human brain that light up in response to certain thoughts and emotions, using a technology called\n\n(MRI). But Meyer says this research isn\u2019t possible in elephants, for a number of reasons:\n\u2022 None An MRI device large enough for an elephant\u2019s head hasn\u2019t been developed.\n\u2022 None The elephant would have to be awake for the MRI scan of its brain reactions to be effective, and it would be almost impossible to keep the animal still enough to take the scan. (There has been some success in taking\n\u2022 None Even if a functional MRI scan of an elephant\u2019s brain were possible, there would be no way to know if the activated areas were used for the same functions or emotions, as human and elephant brains work differently.\n\nHumans respond to baby animals as part of \u2018nurturing instinct\u2019\n\n\n\nResearch on cuteness and the parental brain shows that \u201ccuteness\u201d is one of the major ways human babies ensure they get the attention and care they need to survive. Baby-like features trigger a positive response in the parts of our brains linked to emotion and pleasure.\n\n\n\nThis nurturing instinct could explain our affection for young animals, and even for objects with baby-like features, such as dolls and teddy bears.\n\n\n\nAfrica Check traced the original of the photo used in the meme to Jan Van Huyssteen, who snapped it in South Africa\u2019s Sabi Sands Game Reserve. The image was most likely taken off an online blog on African elephant insights in 2014. Van Huyssteen said he was not aware that his \u201cimage was being abused\u201d.\n\nThe meme hit online image sharing platform Imgur on 9 December 2017. From there, it was shared to Tumblr.", "lang": "en"}
