The actual photo showed Obama bestowing the honor upon former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAmid the criminal trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein \u2014 and his Feb. 24 conviction on sexual assault and rape charges \u2014 a doctored image circulated on Facebook, falsely suggesting that Weinstein was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe bogus image erroneously shows former President Barack Obama awarding Weinstein with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. In reality, Weinstein was never among the recipients of the medal during the Obama administration.\n\nMany of the recent posts spreading the fake photo used the image to defend President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to give the medal to conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh, who received the honor during Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Feb. 4.\n\n\u201cFor all the Democrats complaining about President Trump giving Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Honor look who Obama bestowed that honor to !!!!!!!\u201d one Facebook post reads.\n\nReverse image searches of the Weinstein picture lead to a Getty Images photo of then-Vice President Joe Biden receiving the medal in early 2017. Key details of the original image \u2014 such as Obama\u2019s facial expression, the position of his hand, and Biden\u2019s tie \u2014 make clear that Weinstein\u2019s face was edited into the picture.\n\nThe false photo has been in rotation for some time \u2014 it has been grouped with other altered, fake images involving Anthony Weiner and Bill Cosby \u2014 despite fact-checking by other organizations, such as Snopes and PolitiFact.\n\nWeinstein was a longtime Democratic donor who backed Obama and wielded considerable social status. He visited the White House in 2013, for example, for an event for high school students that centered on careers in film. The Obamas\u2019 eldest daughter also interned for Weinstein\u2019s company.\n\nIn October 2017, following the publication of investigative news reports by the New York Times and the New Yorker detailing Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct, Obama released a statement saying he and Michelle Obama were \u201cdisgusted by the recent reports\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
