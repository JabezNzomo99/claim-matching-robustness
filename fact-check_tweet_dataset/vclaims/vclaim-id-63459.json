Trump never posted the tweet in question.\n\nPresident Donald Trump posted dozens of tweets over the course of Memorial Day weekend, including some that peddled a baseless conspiracy theory involving a TV news host.\n\nBut Facebook users are taking aim at Trump over a tweet the president didn\u2019t post.\n\n\u201cMemorial Day is a special day,\u201d the fake tweet reads. \u201cA day to look back at the sacrifices that have been made for our country. I\u2019ve sacrificed alot to be your president and to Make America Great! America is now GREAT do to my sacrifices. Only losers and haters don\u2019t see that!\u201d\n\nThe fake screenshot includes a timestamp of 8:05 a.m. on May 24.\n\nThere is no evidence Trump ever posted that tweet. It does not appear on his account or in the Factba.se database, which records Trump\u2019s deleted tweets. It also is not in ProPublica\u2019s log of the president\u2019s deleted tweets.\n\nThe fabricated tweet uses language seen in actual tweets from Trump, including a reference to his 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d He has also used the terms \u201chaters\u201d and \u201closers\u201d on Twitter to describe his critics.\n\nOn May 24, Trump posted on Twitter 35 times \u2014 either original tweets or retweets \u2014 according to the Trump Twitter Archive.\n\nAmong his tweets that day was a post about a debunked conspiracy theory involving Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who hosts MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Another defended his playing golf amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also used a tweet that day to cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots. Election experts have previously told us that while voter fraud via mail-in ballots is more common than in-person voting fraud, it\u2019s still rare \u2014 including in the five states that already vote primarily by mail.\n\nThe next day, Trump posted several tweets recognizing Memorial Day. But none of those resembled the fake tweet connecting the president\u2019s own \u201csacrifices\u201d to the holiday.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
