I don\u2019t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he felt any empathy for the Native Americans who played an important \u201cif subordinate\u201d role in his Western films, Wayne responded, \u201cI don\u2019t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders in Orange County characterized the resolution as being part of a \u201cnational movement to remove white supremacist symbols and names.\u201d The announcement followed weeks of sustained protests over structural racism and police violence, which were sparked by the police in-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man whose final moments were captured in a viral video that sparked widespread outrage.\n\nThe small airport lies between the cities of Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Newport Beach, the latter of which served as Wayne\u2019s home for years. The name of the airport was changed from Orange County Airport to John Wayne Airport in 1979, the year Wayne died.", "lang": "en"}
