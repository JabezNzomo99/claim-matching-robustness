The claim is misleading; health experts told AFP that while coffee may temporarily alleviate pain, combining it with lime could actually worsen headaches; Thailand\u2019s Department of Health advised people suffering from headaches to consult a doctor instead of using home remedies.\n\nThe claim was published here on Facebook on August 30, 2019. It has been shared more than 500 times.\n\nThe post's Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cIf you frequently get headaches and it doesn\u2019t go away, try drinking black coffee mixed with lime. The result [positively] impacts the body.\u201d\n\nThe post includes a link to this report published by Herbtrick, a Thailand-based health and lifestyle blog, on August 28, 2019.\n\nThe report states that coffee mixed with lime juice will \u201cexpand the blood vessels\u201d and \u201crelieve energy in the liver\u201d to treat migraines.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cBenefits coffee mixed with lime juice:\n\n \"- In coffee there is a beneficial substance called vasoconstrictors and caffeine, which can help fight migraines\n\n \"- Helps to expand the blood vessels, which can reduce migraines. The effect can be obtained by mixing in lime juice\n\n \"- Others countries have divided food into categories such as hot, cold and warm and naturally cold. Food is also divided into 5 flavours: sour, sweet, spicy, salty and bitter. Coffee is classified cold and bitter. When you roast it, the temperature of the food rises.\n\n \"- Limes are considered cold and naturally sour. Combining both ingredients helps to relieve energy in the liver, which is one of the causes of migraines.\u201d\n\nMigraines are \u201ca strong headache that often comes with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light\u201d, according to US-based health publisher WebMD.\n\nA similar claim was also shared here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nTipradee Kongsuwan, a nutritionist at the Bureau of Nutrition under Thailand\u2019s Department of Health, told AFP by phone on August 18, 2020: \u201cDrinking black coffee mixed with lime juice can\u2019t cure headaches. Caffeine in black coffee can help relieve headaches but you shouldn\u2019t drink more than 2-3 cups per day, as it can affect your blood pressure.\n\n\u201cIn fact, limes can actually make headaches become more severe. Those who suffer from frequent headaches should go to see a doctor, and not drink black coffee mixed with lime juice, or other home remedies.\u201d\n\nDr. Adichan Chuajinda, a specialist doctor at Thailand\u2019s Phra Nangklao Hospital\u2019s Department of Internal Medicine also said he would not recommend drinking coffee mixed with lime as a cure for migraines.\n\nSpeaking to AFP by phone on August 19, 2020, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of [drinking black coffee with lime] being a cure for migraines. Black coffee has caffeine that can relieve mild headaches but it won\u2019t cure strong headaches like migraines.\n\n\u201cDoctors do not recommend or warn against eating lime when you have a headache. I think the best way is to see the doctor when you are having a headache, so that they can diagnose your condition and treat it accordingly.\u201d\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, Thailand\u2019s Anti-Fake News Centre, a government-run platform within the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, published this report on August 17, 2020. It labelled the claims in the misleading post as \u201cfake information\u201d.\n\nThe Thai headline reads: \u201cFake news, do not share! Drink coffee mixed with lime treats headaches.\u201d\n\nIt reads in part: \u201cThe Bureau of Nutrition at the Department of Health under the Ministry of Public Health clarifies that drinking black coffee with lime to relieve migraine headaches is not true. While one cup of coffee may help relieve migraines, high doses of lime may trigger an increase in migraines in some people.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
