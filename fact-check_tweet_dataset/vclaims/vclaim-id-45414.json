This will be made legal through House Resolution 6666 or the \"COVID\u201319 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act,\" which was introduced by Congressman Bobby Rush on May 1.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the rumors began in March, when Gates participated in an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit on COVID-19. In a response to a question on how businesses will operate moving forward, Gates said, \"Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.\"\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has pledged more than $1 billion for COVID-19 vaccine research and delivery, told the BBC, \"The reference to 'digital certificates' relates to efforts to create an open-source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing.\"\n\nThere have been a number of fact checks by organizations across the world on false claims about Gates and a microchip in COVID-19 vaccines. Among them are fact check articles by Open in Italy, Ag\u00eancia Lupa in Brazil, Politifact in the US, Ellinika Hoaxes in Greece, Faktograf in Croatia, Demagog in Poland, and D\u00e9crypteurs-Radio in Canada.\n\nThe US' HS 6666 does not mention forcible entry of homes to vaccinate residents. If passed into law, the bill will allow the secretary of health and human services to award grants to entities for COVID-19 diagnostic testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. This will be done through mobile health units or providing testing or quarantine services in patients' residences, as necessary. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
