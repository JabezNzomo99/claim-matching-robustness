The posts are false: they use an image that has been manipulated from an original published in 2013 that shows no links to communists, and Gerindra has not made any announcement about an alliance.\n\nOne of the posts is this February 3 entry that has nearly 4,000 reactions. Below is a screenshot of the post.\n\nIn the photo, Subianto is seen holding a marker as he stands next to a whiteboard with the words \u201cGERINDRA + PKI\" circled and \"MENANG\u201d below them. \"Menang\" translates to \"win\".\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates as: \u201cGerindra has been planning this for a long time. Now it\u2019s a reality.\u201d\n\nSubianto is the sole challenger against incumbent Joko Widodo in presidential elections to be held in April 2019.\n\nThrough a Google reverse image search, AFP found the photo in the misleading Facebook posts was a doctored version of one that appeared in this article by Tempo, one of Indonesia\u2019s most well-known news groups, in 2013 with a headline that translates as: \u201cPrabowo claims he practices Western values\u201d.\n\nIn the original image, the whiteboard is marked with figures concerning tax revenue and gross domestic product. There is no reference to any political party or communism.\n\nBelow are the screenshots of the doctored image and the genuine Tempo photo that clearly show Subianto holding the same marker with his hands in exactly the same position, and in the same setting, except for the different writing on the whiteboard.\n\nThe Tempo article talks about Subianto\u2019s opinion on western values, including \u201chumanism, liberal democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the Indonesian elite who practice Western values. I highly respect Western values as I was raised in a Western-minded environment,\u201d Subianto was quoted as saying.\n\nGerindra has made no announcement of any alliance with the PKI. Here is the party\u2019s website, Twitter account and Facebook page, none of which show any declaration of an alliance with the communists.\n\nAny association with communism in Indonesia can be grounds for criminal charges under this law.\n\nThe law is titled: \u201cThe Disbandment Of The Indonesian Communist Party, The Declaration Of It As A Prohibited Organisation In All Regions Of The Republic Of Indonesia And The Prohibition Of Any Activities To Disseminate And Develop The Teaching Of Communism/Marxism-Leninism.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
