A reverse image search shows that the subject of the photograph is not Joe Biden, but Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, often referred to as AMLO.\n\nThe image stems from a video shared online on March 14, 2020 by Lopez Obrador\u2019s official Twitter account, ( here ). The frame in question is visible around the 20 second mark of the video.\n\nAt the time, Lopez Obrador, 66, was criticized for continuing to exchange hugs and kisses at his public events amid health concerns over the new coronavirus, the BBC reported on March 17 ( here ). \u201cThe rest of the world is in quarantine, and our president goes around kissing people,\u201d wrote one critic on Twitter ( here ).\n\nJoe Biden has faced allegations that he has made women uncomfortable with his use of physical contact. Biden told reporters in July 2019 that he was taking the complaints about his personal conduct seriously, but stopped short of apologizing ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked posts claiming Joe Biden had inappropriately touched a young boy. Those claims were based on a picture of him comforting his grandson at the boy\u2019s father\u2019s funeral ( here ).\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
