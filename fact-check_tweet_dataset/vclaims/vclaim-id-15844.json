Eighteen states run their own tax-credit scholarship programs, according to EdChoice. DeVos\u2019s plan is to support such state programs with a new federal tax credit. (The libertarian Cato Institute says tax-credit scholarships are better designed and more legally sound than vouchers.)\n\u2022 None States would have the option of participating, but they would not be forced to do so. \u201cEach participating state will determine how it will structure its program, including eligible students, education providers, and education expenses,\u201d the Education Department says.\n\u2022 None Participating states would have to identify \u201cscholarship-granting organizations.\u201d These are typically nonprofit organizations that offer scholarships to low-income or special-needs students.\n\u2022 None Individuals and businesses donating to these scholarship-granting organizations \u201care eligible to receive a non-refundable, dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit, but no contributor will be allowed a total tax benefit greater than the amount of their contribution,\u201d the Education Department says.\n\u2022 None Then, depending on how a state structured its program, the scholarships could be used for a range of expenses. \u201cFamilies receive and control the use of scholarships for their child\u2019s elementary and secondary education, which may include career and technical education, apprenticeships, and dual and concurrent enrollment,\u201d the Education Department says, as well as \u201cprivate and home education,\u201d \u201cadvanced, remedial, and elective courses,\u201d \u201cindustry certifications,\u201d \u201cspecial education services and therapies,\u201d \u201ctransportation to education providers outside of a family\u2019s zoned school,\u201d \u201ctutoring, especially for students in low\u2010performing schools,\u201d and \u201csummer and afterschool education programs.\u201d\n\nFederal taxpayers may not be funding these scholarships directly, but they would be footing up to $5 billion of the cost in lost revenue from the new tax credits. That means forgoing revenue that could have been used on building roads or paying teacher salaries.\n\nThe most transformative education proposal in the President\u2019s Budget Request is not a part of the Department of Education\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget, but rather is proposed in the request for the Department of Treasury. It is a federal tax credit for voluntary donations to State-designed scholarship programs for elementary and secondary students, capped at $5.0 billion per year. This tax credit is available to individuals and domestic businesses. The donations will empower States to offer scholarships that can be used on a wide range of public and private educational activities. States, not the federal government, will determine family eligibility requirements and allowable uses of scholarship funds. Because it is a tax credit, it will not divert a single dollar away from public schools or teachers.\n\nThe 2020 Request promotes fiscal discipline and supports priorities to improve the quality of education and prepare students for the workforce of the 21st century. The Request would implement fundamental reforms aimed at reducing the size and scope of the Federal role in education, while empowering States, communities, and parents to improve the performance of our schools and postsecondary institutions. As such, the Request eliminates funding for 29 programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, are ineffective, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Education Department is justifying the proposed cuts to its budget in terms of \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d and \u201cthe President\u2019s overall goal of increasing support for national security and public safety without adding to the Federal budget deficit.\u201d DeVos and the Trump administration are choosing to fund the tax credits while choosing to cut the department\u2019s programs.\n\n\u201cWhile the tax credit would forgo revenue from federal coffers, it certainly would not draw on dollars headed to public schools,\u201d wrote Nat Malkus, of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cEFS would be no more in competition with public-school funding than would investments in highways or defense expenditures. And while it would support private school choice in some states \u2014 as states have the responsibility and flexibility to set the contours of the programs \u2014 it could just as easily be used to drive educational options that are much more popular on the left.\n\nGetting down to brass tacks, the federal government would be forgoing up to $5 billion in revenue to cover the cost of DeVos\u2019s Education Freedom Scholarships. Private actors may be fronting this money with their donations, but they would get a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in return. That\u2019s money that could have been put to another use, such as public schools or the military.\n\nWe were on the fence between Two and Three Pinocchios. But as we looked through the Education Department\u2019s budget request, we found unequivocal statements that some programs were being cut as a matter of \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d or to meet \u201cthe President\u2019s overall goal of increasing support for national security and public safety without adding to the Federal budget deficit.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
