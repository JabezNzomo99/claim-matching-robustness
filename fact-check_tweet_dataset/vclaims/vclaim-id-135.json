A device similar to the one in the video can be seen here. (here)\n\nProfessor Jie Zhang, Chair of Wireless Systems at the University of Sheffield, told Reuters that an RF meter like the one shown in the video measures \u201cthe level, or more specifically, electrical field strength and power density, of electromagnetic (EM) wave generated by RF radiation\u201d.\n\nThe narrator in the video claims the meter reading shows \u201cvery toxic radiation for the people who live in this area\u201d. This claim is false.\n\nRadiation is energy that travels and spreads as it goes. Radio waves are the lowest-energy form of radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum. At the highest end are gamma-rays and X-rays, both used in medical imaging. (imagine.gsfc.nasa.govt/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html)\n\nGamma- and X-rays are both types of ionising radiation, meaning that they carry sufficient energy to detach electrons from atoms or molecules. Radio waves can\u2019t do that \u2013 they are non-ionising.\n\nAt high levels, Zhang said, ionising radiation can be toxic. But the meter shown in the video can only detect RF radiation with a frequency lower than 8 GHz (gigahertz), which he noted was much lower than ionising frequency.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says that although exposure to very high RF intensities can result in the \u201cheating of biological tissue and an increase in body temperature\u201d, low levels are not considered dangerous. (here)\n\n\u201cAt relatively low levels of exposure to RF radiation, i.e., levels lower than those that would produce significant heating, the evidence for production of harmful biological effects is ambiguous and unproven,\u201d the FCC states.\n\nAccording to Zhang, the level of RF radiation detected on the meter shown in the video, which appears to display a highest \u2018average\u2019 meter reading of 26,293 microwatts (or 0.026293 watts) per square metre, would be too low to produce an increase in body temperature.\n\nHealth bodies like the World Health Organisation and Public Health England have stated that no adverse health effects have so far been linked to 5G frequency exposure. (here)\n\nReuters has previously debunked online claims that 5G technology caused the global coronavirus outbreak.
