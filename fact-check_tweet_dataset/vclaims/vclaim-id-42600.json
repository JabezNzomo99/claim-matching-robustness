There is no truth to the claim that former President Barack Obama has fled the United States for a private island.\n\nThe claim originated in an article published by ObamaWatcher.com on March 19, 2020 titled \"Obama Family Flown to Private 'Safe Island'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies.
