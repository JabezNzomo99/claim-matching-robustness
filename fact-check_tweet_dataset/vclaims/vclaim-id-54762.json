The claims are false and started circulating after an education expert called for an end to the academic year, an idea rejected by the Department of Basic Education.\n\nBy April 21, COVID-19 had claimed the lives of 58 people in South Africa, with a total number of 3,465 confirmed cases.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the government announced a lockdown starting on March 27. The confinement is set to end on April 30.\n\nA Facebook post shared more than 740 times on April 15 reads: \u201cLearners From grade 1-11 will be promoted to the next grade and this academic year has been cancelled. Wow\u201d.\n\nThe post also has been shared here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claims echo the ideas of South African education expert Jonathan Jansen, who argued here and here that the current school year should be scrapped in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. South Africa's academic year runs from January to December.\n\nIn a column titled \u201cLet\u2019s face facts, the 2020 school year is lost. So what to do?\u201d, Jansen suggests that schools automatically promote pupils in grades 1 to 11.\n\n\u201cOne, scrap the academic school year; even a \u2018trimmed down\u2019 curriculum will soon be meaningless for the school system as a whole. Two, pass every pupil in grades 1-11 for organisational reasons (we need to enrol a new Grade 1 class and Grade 8 class without clogging up the system), educational reasons (we can only assess what has been taught and learnt) and equity reasons (we should assess on the basis of opportunity to learn, which was unequally distributed in the lockdown even more than is usually the case),\u201d wrote Jansen.\n\nElijah Mhlanga, the spokesman for the Department of Basic Education, penned a response headlined \u201cJansen got it wrong -- 2020 school year isn\u2019t lost\u201d.\n\nIn an interview on April 17, Mhlanga reiterated that scrapping the school year was ill-advised.\n\n\u201cWe find that type of advice is premature, irresponsible, ill-conceived as well as misinformed because the school year can still get back on track. If you look at the number of school days that we were supposed to have in 2020, it\u2019s 198 days -- when schools were forced to close, we only had two days left in the first term,\u201d said Mhlanga.\n\n\u201cIn this term, we are supposed to have 50 days, by the end of this lockdown \u2026 we would have lost about 23 days of this new term, so we believe with that we still have a lot of time and there is still a lot of work that can be done.\u201d\n\nHe said suggesting that pupils from grade 1 to grade 11 should be passed was a \u201cterrible message\u201d to send to young people.\n\n\u201cThere is a plan to phase in education, in terms of the grades that we have in the basic education system -- the proposal has been sent to the National Coronavirus Command Council,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a phased-in approach, so you shouldn\u2019t be expecting all learners back in school at once, there are 13 million learners in the system.\u201d\n\nAs reported here, the phased approach relies on the lockdown in South Africa finishing at the end of April as scheduled. In an attempt to address social distancing, the draft plan proposes that schools reopen with grades 12 and 7 on May 6, followed by grades 11 and 6 on May 20, with the rest returning as follows:\n\u2022 grades 2 and 1 on July 8 and", "lang": "en"}
