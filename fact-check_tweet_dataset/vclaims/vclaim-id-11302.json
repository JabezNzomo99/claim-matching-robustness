So I have become atheist. When our brothers and sisters talk about God, creator, I can only face-palm.\u201d He laughed, perhaps a bit too hard.\n\nThere is no truth to this article. The Good Lord Above is a fake news web site that does not publish factual stories (but, unlike many other satire or hoax news sites, is at least up-front about its raison d\u2019etre):\n\nThou shalt remember that The First Amendment protects satire as a form of free speech and expression. TheGoodLordAbove uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. TheGoodLordAbove is not intended for readers under 18 years of age.\n\nThe Good Lord Above has also been responsible for stories that have been published as humor but passed around as real, including Donald Trump labeling Jesus a \u201csocialist loser,\u201d a Noah\u2019s Ark theme park getting destroyed by a flood, and the arrest of the entire Goldman Sachs executive board by the FBI.", "lang": "en"}
