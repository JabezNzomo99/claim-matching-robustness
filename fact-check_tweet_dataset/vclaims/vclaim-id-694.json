The bill states that the ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 60 day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban.\n\n Though the ban has created a clear divide among the citizens of California, it\u2019s said to be widely supported by political figures across the state. Many politicians and citizens alike feel that that ban is a clear infringement of California citizen\u2019s second amendment rights, however; many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control.\n\nAs .45 ACP ammunition is enormously popular, the article immediately caused a furor in gun and ammunition forums and on social media.\n\nSome were taken in initially, particularly since the article was also published under the now-suspended spoof web address NYTimes.com.co, but commenters quickly discovered that the story was a hoax.\n\nNational Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.

On 9 December 2015, the New York Times breathed new life into the piece when it published an editorial titled, \u201cAn Opening for States to Restrict Guns,\u201d which linked to the hoax site in the following paragraph:\n\nWhile California does restrict certain types of \u201cunreasonably dangerous ammunition,\u201d such as bullets designed to penetrate body armor or metal, .45 ACP ammunition has not been banned.", "lang": "en"}
