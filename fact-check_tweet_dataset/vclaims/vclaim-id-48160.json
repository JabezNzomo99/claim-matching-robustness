The display picture of the article is of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nSocial media users, while sharing the article, have demanded that since Angela Merkel\u2019s Germany has sent China an invoice of \u00a3130 billion for coronavirus damages, India should do the same and send Beijing an invoice of \u00a3300 billion. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the headline of Express\u2019s article is misleading. The German government has not sent any such bill to China. It was actually a tabloid newspaper in Germany called \u201cBild\u201d which issued a mock bill to China after assessing damages to the country\u2019s economy due to Covid-19. The newspaper said China owes Berlin around 149 billion (\u00a3130 billion) for coronavirus damages.\n\nThe misleading post is being widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe \u201cExpress\u201d article says in the very first paragraph that \u201cBild\u201d has put together a \u00a3130 billion invoice that Beijing \u201cowes\u201d Berlin, but the misleading display headline, along with Merkel\u2019s photo, gave the impression that the German government had sent the bill to China.\n\nThe inside headline of the article was later changed with a clarification that it was not the German government that estimated the bill for coronavirus damages (that should be paid by China), but rather the leading German news publication \u201cBild\u201d.\n\nSome global media houses had also covered the news that \u201cBild\u201d demanded China pay billions in coronavirus damages.\n\nFact-check website Full Fact has also debunked the misleading news.\n\nAs of April 21 evening, Germany reported almost 1.5 lakh coronavirus cases with close to 5,000 deaths. More than 95,000 people have also recovered.\n\nAlso read | There is a vaccine against coronavirus. Behavioural vaccine", "lang": "en"}
