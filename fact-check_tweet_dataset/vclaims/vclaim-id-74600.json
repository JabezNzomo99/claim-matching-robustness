Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates.\n\nThe first caveat to know is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for \"pregnancy services.\" That\u2019s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading claims .\n\nOn the , \"pregnancy services\" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s the section from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report that contains those categories.\n\nTo arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements from the chart: prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653). Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories.\n\nFor several reasons, that\u2019s a misleading way to analyze the data.\n\nReferrals for prenatal care not in equation\n\nNot all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700 clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus. As a result, many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care.\n\nHow many? It's impossible to know.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not record how many pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers, said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.\n\nIf referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by how much \u2014 and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not specifically track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption.\n\nTesting and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at more than 4.47 million.\n\nContraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception kits, and sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million services. Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams, account for 935,573 services.\n\nAs show on the chart above, there were also more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments, or 65,500 \"family practice services.\"\n\nOver the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year.\n\nOf all services, abortions account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to .\n\nBut looking at the share of abortions per patient (and assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to 12 percent.\n\nhave taken issue with Planned Parenthood\u2019s measurement of \"services.\" Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.)\n\nSmith said, \"Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions.\"\n\nAn anti-abortion group puts the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes \"pregnancy services\" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information. What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers. Without that information, we don't know an accurate percentage of \"pregnancy services\" that were abortions. Neither, however, does Smith.\n\nUPDATE: After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on the record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on the record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information. We've updated this fact-check to include her comments.", "lang": "en"}
