It\u2019s a marketing ploy that mimics a site and even fakes comments by what it claims are real people.\n\nClicking on any other category mentioned on the page takes you to an ad for Radyance.\n\nThe images are photoshopped, the success stories are concocted and the names are fictitious. Worryingly, the images have been stolen from bloggers and make-up tutorials .\n\nAnkita Srivastava is one such woman whose picture has been misused and given a fake identity of Neha Pawan from Hyderabad.\n\n\u201cThe company is using my images without my permission. I have never endorsed their product,\u201d Srivastava, whose make-up tutorial videos on You Tube are widely popular, told BOOM in an email.\n\nWe found another blogger whose real identity is Bhumika Thakkar and not Sadhana Malhotra as the ad states.\n\n\u201cYes they have lifted images from my blog and using it for their fake ads. Is there a way out?,\u201d Thakkar asked us in an email.\n\nBuried at the bottom of Fit Daily's page is a disclaimer that states it's an advertisement and not a blog, news article or consumer protection update.\n\nBOOM found the exact same images on a site called Eunoia Plus.\n\nEunoia Plus did not respond to an email from BOOM. According to its website it is a digital marketing company based in Nagpur, Maharashtra. Contact numbers listed were constantly busy and unreachable.\n\nWe also came across another website called Consumer\u2019s Guide, a site dedicated to 'Skin Whitening Education.'\n\nIn its post titled \u2018Skin Whitening Trick That Works\u2019, the website ranked Radyance Skin Whitening Serum as its 'Top Choice.'\n\nHowever, the post is authored by one Rishika Verma, who has used an image of actor Anushka Shetty, as her display picture.\n\nAt the time of writing this story over 220 complaints against Radyance were posted on the Indian Consumer Complaints Forum, a website not affiliated to any government body. A summary of the complaints are listed below.\n\n2. The maximum retail price (M.R.P) on the package stated Rs. 4,400 but the product was being sold for Rs. 1,692.\n\n3. The contact numbers printed on the packaging were U.S. based but the manufacturer's address either said Delhi, Gurgaon or Shimla.\n\n4. Some of the ads for Radyance showed a white bottle but customers received a black bottle.\n\n5. Several complainants stated that after placing an order, a representative named Neha Gupta would send them a text message saying that they(the customer) had accidentally ordered only 'Radyance Night Complex' without 'Radyance Day Elixir'.\n\nNeha's text message explained how both creams were needed for the solution to work.\n\nThe company would then go ahead and order Radyance Day Elixir costing Rs. 1170 without seeking the customer\u2019s permission. Requests to cancel the second order were ignored.\n\n(To be in continued...\n\nClick here to go to Part 2\n\nIn Part 2, we order Radyance Skin Brightening Complex to fact check the claims against it and uncover the identities of people behind the company. )", "lang": "en"}
