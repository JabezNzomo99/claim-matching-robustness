In the 72-second broadcast, a person giving a voice-over can be heard saying, \u201cViolent clashes in Surat after Municipality team tried to demolish a temple late on Tuesday night. The state government has gone on a major demolition drive\u201d. Along with the video, the user tweeted a caption that reads, \u201cModi demolished 50 Temples. To give the land to Ambani\u2019s.\u201d The video has been retweeted more than 500 times so far.\n\nWith a keyword search on YouTube, Alt News found that news report is at least 10 years old and published by NDTV. The anchor introduces the report saying, \u201cGujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has a new campaign, to demolish illegal constructions, including temples. The new demolitions have sparked off outrage in the Sangh Pariwar and traditional Modi supporters.\u201d\n\nThe November 19, 2008 report talks about the demolition of over 50 temples in the state capital Gandhinagar. According to a statement given by then Collector of Gandhinagar Sanjeev Kumar, the demolition drive targeted all illegal construction and not just religious ones. It has been mischievously clipped to edit out the context and important information which would otherwise suggest that it was during the time when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n\nHowever, subsequent reports byIndia Today from November 21, 2008 stated, \u201cUnder pressure from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has put on hold the demolition drive against unauthorised temples in the state capital of Gandhinagar.\u201d The decision reportedly came after then CM\u2019s meeting with Ashok Singhal, who had dubbed him \u201cAurangzeb\u201d for his temple-razing drive.\n\nA video of a 10-year-old news report on the demolition drive taken by the BJP-led state government in Gujarat was mischievously clipped to remove the context and shared on social media with an attempt to portray it as a recent decision of the central government.", "lang": "en"}
