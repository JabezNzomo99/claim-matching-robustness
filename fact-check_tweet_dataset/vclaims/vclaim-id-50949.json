The claims are false and were tweeted by a fake Twitter account posing as the national broadcaster ZBC Online.\n\nThe tweet, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been retweeted more than 1,300 times and received more than 2,600 likes. It reads: \u201cBreaking News. Deputy Minister of Defence Cde Victor Matemadanda has warned the US that if they do not retreat from Iran, Zimbabwe may be forced to intervene.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was published by a Twitter account purporting to be Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, ZBC News Online. The account was created in December 2019.\n\nBy contrast, the broadcaster\u2019s official account, which appears on its website, was created in July 2012 and has over 270,000 followers.\n\nOther clues that distinguish the two accounts? The copycat account has an underscore character at the end of its name, while the real ZBC Twitter account includes a photograph of the ruins of Great Zimbabwe in its header.\n\nThe false tweet has also been posted on Facebook here and here with similar claims.\n\nAsked by AFP to verify the claims made in his name, Matemadanda denied issuing any statement warning the US to refrain from conflict with Iran: \u201cI did not say what was attributed to me and never had an interview to that regard,'' he said via WhatsApp.\n\nSearches on government websites and social media accounts also found no official statement regarding Zimbabwe\u2019s position on current US-Iran relations.\n\nAs reported by AFP, Iran announced on January 14, 2020, its first arrests over the accidental downing by missile of a Ukrainian passenger jet, as protesters vented their anger over the catastrophic blunder for a fourth consecutive day.\n\nIt came after top Iranian military commander, Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq on January 3, 2020, as reported by AFP here.\n\nIran retaliated by firing missiles on Iraqi military bases housing US troops, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe tit-for-tat spat has led to a flurry of false social media posts.\n\nAFP Fact Check previously debunked misleading claims that US President Donald Trump had secured commitments of troop support from Botswana and South Africa.\n\nAnother AFP debunked claim said Trump had warned of an attack on Nigeria for backing Iran.", "lang": "en"}
