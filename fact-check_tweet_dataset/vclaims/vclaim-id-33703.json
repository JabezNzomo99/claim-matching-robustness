But the state has in fact made no such move.\n\n\u201cYesterday Virginia announced the End of Youth Hunting!\u201d the posts read. \u201cThe Governor said that no kid under 18 will be allowed to shoot a gun. This is the end of a 400 year tradition of kids helping put food on their family\u2019s table. It\u2019s a sad day in the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what date \u201cyesterday\u201d refers to, but we searched for any announcements by the state government and could find no evidence to support the claim.\n\nA spokeswoman for the state\u2019s Department of Game & Inland Fisheries told FactCheck.org the posts are \u201cuntrue\u201d and provided us with a statement from the agency.\n\n\u201cThere are no changes to currently scheduled youth hunting days. All current laws and regulations pertaining to hunting in Virginia are in effect as shown on the DGIF website and the current Hunting & Trapping in Virginia Digest,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAny changes to hunting laws would require action either by the Virginia General Assembly or the Board of Game and Inland Fisheries, and currently no such changes are proposed.\u201d\n\nThe department\u2019s website outlines a number of youth hunting events that have been and will be held \u2014 including a youth and veterans hunting day for waterfowl in February, which will permit those 15 years old and younger to hunt, within certain restrictions and requirements. The department referred us to existing statutes in state law that spell out the legal parameters for youth hunting.\n\nConfusion regarding the age \u201cto shoot a gun,\u201d in the words of the viral posts, appears to stem from a gun control proposal pushed by Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. A spokeswoman for the governor told the Associated Press that the proposed legislation would not have an effect on \u201cresponsible\u201d hunters.\n\nThe proposed legislation would modify existing law, making it \u201cunlawful for any person to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any person under the age of 18\u201d (instead of 14, as the current law states). That crime would also be classified as a felony, rather than its current misdemeanor status.\n\nThe same bill leaves intact a provision in existing law that makes it \u201cunlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a child under the age of 12 to use a firearm except when the child is under the supervision of an adult.\u201d So, even under the proposal, state law would continue to allow certain instances of minors under 12 to use firearms in supervised settings.\n\nThe proposal is a part of a larger package of gun control measures that Northam proposed during a special session in July \u2014 weeks after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May \u2014 but the bills have not advanced in the Republican-controlled legislature. In other words, they haven\u2019t been passed, let alone signed into law. \n\n\n\nAfter Democrats won control of the state legislature this month, Northam said those gun control measures would be reintroduced.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
