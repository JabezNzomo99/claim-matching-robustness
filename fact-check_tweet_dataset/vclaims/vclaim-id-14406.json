No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that often posts fictional articles about weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or general oddities. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on November 29, 2018 titled \"Man who had woman's brain transplanted has five car crashes in two weeks\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA man who had his own brain replaced by a woman's brain in September during a groundbreaking medical procedure had five car accidents in less than two weeks since he was released from the hospital. 53-year old Phil Robertson from Scranton in Pennsylvania was miraculously saved from a brain cancer a few months ago by undergoing a successful brain transplant.

James Boysen, who is 55 and from Texas, was missing the whole of the crown of his head after treatment for a rare type of cancer. He was also given a new kidney and pancreas during the procedure.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
