Antonio Trillanes IV should take a \u201cneuro-psychiatric test\u201d is unsubstantiated.\n\nReferring to Senate President Vicente Sotto III and senators Richard Gordon, Panfilo Lacson Sr., Juan Miguel Zubiri and Manny Pacquiao, Tulfo also claimed in the show, broadcast through Radyo Pilipinas 1 (DZRB 738), the five lawmakers said they would rather not \u201cengage\u201d Trillanes in an argument. .\n\nIn the Aug. 17 episode, which ran for almost 90 minutes, Tulfo said:\n\nTulfo\u2019s statement about the lawmakers is baseless.\n\nIn fact, four of the five senators\u2019 offices have refuted the claim.\n\nSenate President Sotto\u2019s office has yet to comment on Tulfo\u2019s claim.\n\nAt least one website -- pinoythinking.net -- published a story based on Tulfo\u2019s statement, carrying a three-minute clip of the Tutok episode and the headline, \u201c5 Senators Advised Trillanes To Take Neuro-Psychiatric Test.\u201d Mainstream media did not report on the alleged advice of five lawmakers for Trillanes to undergo psychiatric evaluation.\n\nTulfo made the unsubstantiated claim two days after Trillanes said he would press plunder charges against him, his brother Benjamin (Ben) and sister, former Tourism secretary Wanda Tulfo-Teo. The Tulfo siblings are involved in the controversial P60 million advertising deal between the Department of Tourism then under Tulfo-Teo and Ben Tulfo's production company Bitag Media Unlimited Inc. The deal is being investigated by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.\n\nErwin Tulfo\u2019s claim could have reached more than 6.2 million people through pinoythinking.net\u2019s story and a copy of the episode uploaded on his Youtube channel alone.\n\nSocial media traffic to the story largely came from the pages Duterte Kami, Pinoy Thinking, Rodrigo Duterte 16th President.\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
