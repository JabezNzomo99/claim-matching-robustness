And we\u2019re using UCAS figures for the number of young people who've been accepted for a place at university, as these are the most up to date numbers.\n\nLooking at other types of students, like mature students or part-time students, may change the picture. For example the overall numbers of mature students has been falling recently.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Labour party what Ms Rayner was referring to when she said the number had gone down. From the measures we\u2019ve looked at, more disadvantaged students than ever are going to university.\n\nMore young people from disadvantaged areas are going to university\n\nIn 2016 the entry rate for 18 year olds living in the most disadvantaged areas increased to the highest on record\u201419.5% for England.\n\nDisadvantage here is measured according to the rate of participation in higher education by young people in each area, so the most disadvantaged areas are those with the lowest rates of participation by young people.\n\nThe rate for those in the most advantaged areas in 2016 increased slightly to 46.3% in England.\n\nThe gap between the likelihood of young people from the most disadvantaged areas going to university and those from the most advantaged is narrowing, based on cohort entry rates. These look at how many young people from one year group go to university at age 18 or 19.\n\nThose from the most advantaged areas ae still significantly more likely to go to university though, with the gap in entry rates between the most and the least advantaged areas still at 33 percentage points.\n\nThe same is true for young people grouped by a broader measure of disadvantage\n\nUCAS have released data on a new measure: the \u2018multiple equality measure\u2019 (MEM), for the first time for 2016.\n\nThis looks at things like a person\u2019s sex, ethnic group, where they live, whether they to a private or state school, and whether they received free school meals\u2014all factors which have traditionally affected whether someone is likely to go to university. Based on a combination of these factors 18 year olds are placed into one of five groups. \u2018MEM group 1\u2019 is the most disadvantaged and \u2018MEM group 5\u2019 is the most advantage.\n\nOn this measure all 5 MEM groups have seen growing participation rates, and reached record highs in 2016.\n\nThe most disadvantaged pupils on this measure increased their participation by 5.8 percentage points between 2006 and 2016 (from 7.8% to 13.6%).\n\nThis was faster than the growth in participation for the most advantaged group, where participation increased by 5.1 percentage points (47% to 52.1%), but not as fast as those in the middle group (group 3) where participation increased by 8.7 percentage points (from 23.2% to 31.9%).\n\nOn the MEM measure the gap between the participation rate of the most and least advantaged pupils decreased slightly between 2006 and 2016 (-0.7 percentage points).\n\nWe don\u2019t know for sure how the participation in higher education of disadvantaged groups would change if a policy to scrap tuition fees was adopted.\n\nThe IFS has said that, as higher earning graduates currently repay the most of their loans, it is these graduates who would benefit the most from not having to out take a tuition fee loan.", "lang": "en"}
