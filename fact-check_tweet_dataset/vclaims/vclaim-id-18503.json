The claim is false; the picture actually shows a marine animal called a sea pen.\n\nThe image appeared on this June 25, 2019, post on Facebook and has been shared more than 3,700 times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\n\u201cTHE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD !!!!\n\n MEGAPUSPA flower is blooming on the summit of the Jayawijaya Mountains, Papua (there is the only one in the world, in Papua). It only blooms once in 33 years. A perfect bloom happened at 2:30pm Indonesian eastern time today. INDONESIA\u201d.\n\nThe Jayawijaya Mountains are located in Indonesia\u2019s province of Papua. Trikora Peak is the range\u2019s highest point, reaching 4,750 metres (15,580 feet), according to Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nThe photo was also shared here, here, and here on Facebook with similar, misleading claims in late June 2019.\n\nThe same photograph has also been misrepresented in Indonesian-language Facebook posts from 2016, like here, here and here, which claim it shows a flower called nagapuspa that bloomed in the Jayawijaya Mountains.\n\nA search on Facebook found the photo has also been circulating with a similar claim since 2016, for example here, where the \u201cflower\u201d is referred to as a \u201cNagapuspa\u201d.\n\nA Google image search found the same photo has circulated online since at least 2015 with claims it shows a rare \u201cNagapushpa\u201d flower in the Himalayas. American fact-check outlet Snopes debunked that claim on January 25, 2016.\n\nThe Snopes report said: \u201cThis photograph does not depict any type of flower or plant; it was taken in 2013 by Gordon J. Bowbrick, who identified the pictured creature as a sea pen, a marine invertebrate known as an anthozoan.\u201d\n\nA link included in the article to Bowbrick\u2019s original image on photo.net is no longer accessible, but was archived here on July 20, 2013.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the archived page:\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the archived link (R):\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Britannica, a sea pen is \u201cany of the 300 species of the order Pennatulacea, colonial invertebrate marine animals of the class Anthozoa (phylum Cnidaria). The name sea pen derives from their resemblance to quill pens. They occur in shallow and deep waters from polar seas to the tropics.\u201d\n\nDwi Suprapti, WWF Indonesia\u2019s marine species conservation coordinator, told AFP in an interview that the image does indeed show a sea pen.\n\nThe nagapushpa does exist, but it is an evergreen tree in the Himalayas.", "lang": "en"}
