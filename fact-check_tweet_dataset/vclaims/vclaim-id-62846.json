The claim is misleading; the image is not a genuine document from the period, experts say; the text in the purported document corresponds with a 2008 advertisement for a TV documentary series in Australia.\n\nThe image was posted on Facebook here on June 15, 2020. It has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption states: \u201cAboriginal people in Australia did NOT automatically gain citizenship in 1948 - this is what really happened.\u201d\n\nThe post includes a purported copy of a \u201cGeneral Certificate of Exemption\u201d that appears to be issued under the \u201cAborigines Protection Act 1909-1943, Section 18c\u201d.\n\nThe purported certificate, which was described as \u201cyour chance to be free of the Aborigines Protection Act and live like a white man\u201d, includes three special conditions:\n\n\u201cSpeaking in native language - Prohibited\n\n Engaging in Dance, rituals native customs - Prohibited\u201d\n\n Associating with fellow indigenous people (including family) - Prohibited\u201d\n\nThe image was also shared on Facebook here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading; the image is not a genuine \"Certificate of Exemption\".\n\nA keyword search on Google found this certificate, which included almost identical wording to the text in the misleading posts. It also appeared to be signed on the same date.\n\nThe logo of Australian public broadcaster SBS can be seen in the bottom left-hand corner of the image.\n\n\u201cThe SBS advertisement for First Australians which depicted a certificate of exemption did not contain an original document,\u201d an SBS spokesperson told AFP in an email dated June 24. \u201cThe content in the certificate, including sub-headings, is based on information provided in the documentary series First Australians and provided by the producers of the documentary series.\u201d\n\nThe original advertisement for SBS\u2019s 2008 series First Australians was published in The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Good Weekend magazine, according to Australian public broadcaster ABC.\n\nAFP obtained a copy of the ad from the State Library of New South Wales\u2019s print media archive. The SBS ad, as seen in the screenshot below, was published in the October 25, 2008, issue of Good Weekend.\n\nBoth the image in the misleading posts and the SBS ad referenced section 18c of an Aborigines Protection Act 1909-1943.\n\nA keyword search found this Aborigines Protection Act 1909 under the New South Wales legislation. It is described as the \u201cfirst piece of legislation that dealt specifically with Aboriginal people\u201d in the state.\n\nThe act provided legal powers to the Aborigines Protection Board, which was established in the 1880s to manage Aboriginal reserves and the welfare of the Aboriginal people living in New South Wales at the time.\n\nWhile the 1909 act did not mention a certificate, its 1943 amendment did.\n\nSection 18c of the Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1943 created a certificate that would allow an Aboriginal person to apply to the Aborigines Welfare Board to be free from the provisions of the act.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1943\u2019s section 18c with information about the certificate highlighted in yellow by AFP:\n\nVarious versions of the certificate of exemption issued by the New South Wales government under the 1943 act can be viewed here, here and here.\n\nNeither the 1943 act nor the exemption certificates from New South Wales mentioned any prohibitions on Aboriginal people\u2019s rights to speak their native languages, associate with other Indigenous Australians, and/or engage in their customs, as listed in the misleading posts. \n\n\n\nThe image in the misleading posts indicated that the \u201ccertificate\u201d was issued by Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nThe National Archives of Australia (NAA), a government agency responsible for managing Australian Government records, told AFP in a June 24 email they could not locate any certificates of exemption issued by Australia\u2019s federal government.\n\nKatherine Ellinghaus, a La Trobe University associate professor of history who conducted research on Australia\u2019s Aboriginal exemption policies, told AFP that while no official certificates were issued like in New South Wales, policies that allowed Aborignial people to be exempted from the corresponding legislation were in place in the Northern Territory, as well as the states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\n\u201cThey more or less ended in 1967 when a referendum shifted the responsibility for Aboriginal affairs from the states/territories to the federal government,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Ellinghaus, there is no record of exemption policies in the Australian Capital Territory and the states of Victoria and Tasmania, the rest of Australia\u2019s six states and two territories.\n\nUpon reviewing the \u201cspecial conditions\u201d noted in the misleading posts, Ellinghaus said: \u201cNowhere on the certificates, or in the legislation, [does it say] that people should not speak their language, or talk about their Aboriginality or practice their culture or avoid family.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the \u201cspecial conditions\u201d section on the Certificate of Exemption referenced in the misleading posts are not real, they are an accurate representation of how Australia\u2019s exemption policies damaged indigenous communities, Ellinghaus said.\n\n\u201cIt was the application process and ongoing surveillance that prohibited people from speaking their language, engaging in cultural activities and associating with non-exempt people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no doubt that exemption policies caused a traumatic loss of identity, culture and land and had a very real impact on people's lives and families through generations.\"", "lang": "en"}
