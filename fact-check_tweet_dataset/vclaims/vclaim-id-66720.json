Martinez said: \"This would be $36 million that would benefit the wealthiest Austinites the most. The majority of Austinites rent and would see no financial benefit at all.\"\n\nWe wondered about Martinez\u2019s statement that most Austin residents rent, rather than own, the places they live. We did not delve into his contention that renters wouldn\u2019t benefit from Adler\u2019s proposal.\n\nTo our inquiry, a Martinez campaign spokesman, Nick Hudson, pointed out a July 31, 2014, including an illustration stating that 183,000 of the city\u2019s 331,000 households in 2012 (55 percent) were renters--a proportion in keeping with trends in 2000 and 2008, the report says. By contrast, 148,000 households, 45 percent, were owners.\n\nHudson also forwarded a web link to drawing on the 2010 U.S. Census indicating 51 percent of Austin\u2019s residents were renters that year.\n\nTo get our own fix on this, we queried Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, who said by email Martinez\u2019s claim is supported by the best available resource, American Community Survey data annually gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAccording to the surveys taken from 2010 through 2012, Potter said, 418,138, or 52 percent, of an estimated 799,183 Austin residents lived in rental units compared with 381,045 residents, or 48 percent, who were owners. He said the 2012 survey alone suggests 432,400, 53 percent, of the city\u2019s 823,340 residents were renters compared with 390,940, nearly 48 percent, who were owners, Potter said.\n\nSeparately, a bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, responded to our inquiry by emailing a chart based on the bureau\u2019s 2012 survey suggesting there were more \"housing units\" rented in Austin than units that were occupied by owners. According to the survey, 183,080 of 330,838 housing units (55 percent) were renter-occupied with 147,758 (45 percent) being owner-occupied. (We suspect these figures were the basis of the information in the report noted by Martinez\u2019s camp.)\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 American Community Survey (chart received by email from Robert Bernstein of the bureau).\n\nMartinez said the majority of Austinites rent where they live.\n\nGovernment surveys show slightly more than half the city\u2019s residents rent. We rate this statement True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
