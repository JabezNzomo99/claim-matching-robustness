The spray is also known as MMS, or Miracle Mineral Solution, a bleaching agent that\u2019s been touted by anti-vaxxers and QAnon theorists as a \"miracle cure\" that can treat everything from autism to cancer.\n\nRELATED: QAnon and Donald Trump rallies: What's that about?\n\nThe same account tweeted about MMS in relation to the coronavirus multiple times, saying that drinking the solution will instantly \"kill the deadly virus.\"\n\nThe tweets also share a now-deleted YouTube video that told people to buy and drink the mixture. (YouTube banned videos promoting MMS in 2019.)\n\nThe tweet was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The FDA encourages consumers to talk to a health care professional about treating medical conditions or diseases.\"\n\nBackers of the QAnon conspiracy are recommending drinking a bleach solution to ward off the deadly 2019 Novel coronavirus.\n\nWhile the MMS solution has been touted by fringe groups as a \"miracle cure\" for a number of ailments, officials have repeatedly warned consumers against ingesting it, saying that doing so could cause severe vomiting, diarrhea and acute liver failure.\n\nThis alarming theory is full-on Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
