No, that's not true. West has made some remarkable statements over the past week but this one was invented by a faux satire (\"fauxtire\") website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 5, 2018 by Huzlers titled \"Kanye West Says Being Black Is A \"Choice\"; Plans To Bleach Skin\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nCALABASAS - \"Being black is a choice\". Yup, that is what rapper Kanye West said in a small street interview outside his Calabasas home Saturday afternoon. Only another absurd statement that can be added to Kanye's already large collection. In the midst of the controversy surrounding Kanye and his absurd racial statements and support for Trump, Kanye is definetly on a role. \"If y'all don't like being black because you're a victim of a racism, then you shouldn't have chose to be black, i made the wrong decision so I'm going to turn white\", said Yeezy, who then went on to explain he was going to bleach his skin. We're not sure if Kanye is only looking i impress Trump but it might certainly work.\n\nThe story was poking fun of Kanye's statement that slavery was a choice and Snoop Dogg's reply via Instagram:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Viral Sensation \"Lil Tay\" NOT Picked Up By Los Angeles Child Protection Services\n\u2022 Fake News: Research Did NOT Show Cardi B Fans Are More Likely To Catch STDs And Cheat\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Announce He Wants To Be A Slave; Will NOT Hold 'Slave Master' Auditions Soon\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man Did NOT Stab Friend For Saying PUBG Is Better Than Fortnite\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Say He's Not Black In Recently Deleted Tweet", "lang": "en"}
