Former MLB player Aubrey Huff, for instance, shared the following message on Twitter:\n\nPedophilia is not classified as a disability in Greece.\n\nThis rumor stems from a proposal by the Greek government in January 2012 to expand its disability list to include various behavioral disorders, such as gambling and pyromania. This proposal also would have also categorized pedophilia as a disability.\n\nAt the time, a number of news outlets published articles about the proposed changes and noted that disability groups were \u201coutraged\u201d about the idea. The BBC wrote:\n\nA Greek government plan to categorise paedophiles and pyromaniacs as \u201cdisabled\u201d has alarmed disability groups, who fear it could undermine their state benefits. Mr Vardakastanis, head of the National Confederation of Disabled People, said the new code would simplify the definition of disability, limiting it to medical conditions. \u201cDisability is if society doesn\u2019t give you what you need to be like others. We want the Greek government to really protect vulnerable groups from getting deeper into poverty, exclusion and discrimination.\u201d The new government \u201cdisability\u201d list also includes compulsive gamblers, fetishists, exhibitionists and sado-masochists, the Associated Press news agency reports.\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in Greece said that they were adding categories to their disabilities list for the purpose of medical assessment. The inclusion on this list, contrary to Huff\u2019s claim, did not entitle pedophiles to government benefits. This is a bit of a moot point, however, as this change never came to fruition.\n\nWhile we found dozens of news articles from January 2012 about this proposed change, as well as the outrage it generated, we found practically no coverage of the fact that pedophilia was removed from this disability list a few months later.\n\nIn October 2012, Greece\u2019s National Confederation of Persons with Disabilities published a press release stating that \u201csignificant positive changes\u201d had been made after a new assessment and that pedophilia had been removed from the Disability Identification Table.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the press release (translated via Google):\n\nWe reached out to the National Confederation of Persons with Disabilities for more information. A spokesperson told us that while pedophilia was included in a \u201cdraft list\u201d of disabilities, it was never officially added to the list.\n\nIt should also be noted that it is illegal in Greece, as well as much of the rest of the world, for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a minor. The age of consent in Greece is 15-years-old. This isn\u2019t particularly unusual. Countries such as France, Iceland, Sweden, and Poland have similar ages of consent. The United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, as well several states in the United States, have an age of consent of 16-years-old.\n\nSo why are we talking about pedophilia laws in Greece in July 2020? And why are we talking about a 2012 proposal that never actually came to fruition? As strange as it may sound, this false claim can be traced back to a bizarre and false conspiracy theory about actor Tom Hanks.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor, as long with several other Hollywood celebrities, have been baselessly accused of running a child sex-trafficking ring by followers of the \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory. When Hanks and wife Rita Wilson announced that they had officially become Greek citizens in July 2020 \u2014 they now hold dual citizenship in the United States and Greece \u2014 conspiracy theorists started to claim without evidence that Hanks made this decision to \u201cescape\u201d the law.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no truth to this claim. In addition, as we noted above, pedophilia is illegal in Greece. The rumor that pedophilia is merely a disability in the country stems from a controversial proposal in 2012 to add pedophilia to the country\u2019s list of disabilities. This proposal was short lived, however, as pedophilia was removed from this list a few months later.", "lang": "en"}
