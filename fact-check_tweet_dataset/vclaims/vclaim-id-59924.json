Disproving an earlier version of the FB post, the DOH said on March 17 \u201cthere is no medical evidence that rinsing the throat with warm water and salt or vinegar will eliminate the virus that causes COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVERA Files has also fact-checked similar untrue claims about salt water solutions supposedly being able to kill the virus. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Video claiming drinking water with salt kills novel coronavirus NOT TRUE and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Salt water steam DOES NOT kill coronavirus)\n\nThe circulating FB post, which currently has over 13,000 shares, is a black and white printout version of an advisory that reads, \u201cCORONA Virus\u2026 Bago ito umabot sa baga, nananatili ito sa lalamunan sa loob ng apat na araw at sa oras na ito, ang tao ay nagsisimulang umubo at sumasakit ang lalamunan. Kung umiinom siya ng maraming tubig at magmumog na maligamgam na tubig na may asin o suka ay nag-aalis ito ng virus.\u201d\n\nColored versions of the graphic also made the rounds from March to early July. It has also circulated in six continents.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that SARS-CoV-2 stays for \u201cfour days in the throat before it goes to the lungs\u201d is unsupported.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 enters the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes,\u201d a team of public health experts convened by international nonprofit organization Meedan told VERA Files Fact Check.\n\n\u201cThe virus lands at the back of the throat in roughly 80 percent of people who have mild cases of infection. For other more severe cases, the virus can then move down to the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, although most recover,\u201d the experts said.\n\nThere are no studies that back up the claim on the four-day retention period in the throat.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s false and misleading post continues to circulate as of publishing time. On July 29, a total of 85,486 COVID-19 cases was recorded by DOH in the country.", "lang": "en"}
