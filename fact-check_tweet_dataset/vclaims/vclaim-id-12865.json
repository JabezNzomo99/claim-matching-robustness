The measure is expected to cost nearly $40 billion, which will be cut from spending on social services that are far over-funded, such as food stamps and the CHIP program. It\u2019s time we started taking care of those who have contributed the longest and for the younger generation to learn to care for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
