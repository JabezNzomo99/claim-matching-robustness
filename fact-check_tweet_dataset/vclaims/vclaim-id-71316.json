Dillon Passage, Exotic\u2019s husband, told radio host Andy Cohen that Exotic had been put into isolation at the new facility after someone at the jail where he was previously held had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPassage said, \u201cWe speak like three to five times every day, but [not] since he\u2019s been moved to this new facility; they are putting him on a COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases.\u201d\n\nPassage did not say that Exotic himself had tested positive for the disease, only that he was put into quarantine after another prisoner had contracted the disease.\n\nYou can watch Passage\u2019s interview below:\n\nThe Facebook page for Exotic posted the following message:\n\nExotic was sentenced to 22 years in prison for animal abuse charges and for his involvement in a murder-for-hire scheme.\n\nAs of this writing, Exotic has not been officially diagnosed with COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
