It has been shared over 3,000 times.\n\nThe post is inaccurate in a number of ways.\n\nMost fundamentally, it\u2019s misleading to use 2018 data to show what budget contributions will be in 2022. The EU budget has not been finalised for the period 2021-2027 yet, and it is being planned on the assumption that the UK won\u2019t be part of it. So we can\u2019t know what the UK\u2019s contributions would look like in 2022 if it stayed in the EU.\n\nIn addition, many of the numbers contained in the post are incorrect.\n\nWhere are the figures from?\n\nThe post says that in 2018 the UK paid \u00a311.02 billion into the EU budget, and received \u00a36.09 billion back in EU spending. It includes a link to its source, which takes you to this page from the European Parliament\u2019s website.\n\nThe UK figures on that website aren\u2019t quite the same as what\u2019s in the graphic, although they\u2019re not very far out. However the EU\u2019s figures are in euros, not pounds, and for 2017, rather than 2018.\n\nIn 2017, the UK paid around \u20ac13.8 billion (\u00a312 billion based on the average exchange rate for 2017) into the EU budget including VAT contributions and received roughly \u20ac6.3 billion (\u00a35.5 billion) of EU spending.\n\nFor 2018, the UK was set to pay \u20ac18 billion (\u00a316 billion) into the EU budget, but we don\u2019t know yet how much it will get back in EU spending.\n\nThese figures differ slightly from those published by the UK government, which we have also used in the past. The differences are relatively slight, and come down to different methods of accounting.\n\nWe can\u2019t know what the UK would pay into the EU\u2019s budget in 2022\n\nUsing these figures, the post tries to work out what the UK\u2019s contribution will be in 2022, while making clear it is using 2018 figures. It does this by taking the UK\u2019s latest net contribution to the EU (what it pays in to the budget minus what it gets back in spending), and then adding in the cost of the UK\u2019s current rebate or \u2018discount\u2019 on budget payments, which it assumes the UK will no longer get by 2022.\n\nIts approach is flawed for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s no way to know how accurate predictions about future budget contributions will be, using current contributions as a starting point. The EU sets its budgets in multi-year cycles, with the next budget set to run from 2021-27. That budget hasn\u2019t been published yet, and the EU doesn\u2019t plan to include the UK in it\u2014so we can\u2019t know what the UK\u2019s contribution would be in 2022 if, hypothetically, the UK were still an EU member by then.\n\nYou probably could use existing contributions to make a rough guess as to what the budget might look like in 2022 (the UK would almost certainly still be one of the biggest contributors to the EU budget), but it\u2019s misleading to present these numbers so definitively.\n\nA second problem is that the post assumes that, if we stay in the EU, our contributions will go up because we will lose our \u201crebate\u201d after 2020 or 2022. This can\u2019t be known either.\n\nThe UK (along with some other EU countries) currently gets a rebate which reduces its annual contributions to the EU budget. This was worth \u20ac4.9 billion in 2017 (\u00a34.3 billion)\u2014reducing our contribution by 32%.\n\nIt is correct that the EU wants to get rid of all rebates over the course of the next EU budget (which runs from 2021 until 2027), but it\u2019s not clear that it would happen by 2022. The UK could potentially block the change if it was still in the EU.\n\nLuxembourg does not get back 3000% more than what it pays in\n\nThe post also attempts to calculate the \u201creturn on investment\u201d for each country paying into the EU budget.\n\nThis is trying to show the difference between what each country pays in to the EU budget, and what it gets back in EU spending. It claims that this ranges from Luxembourg getting back over 3000% more than it pays in, to the UK getting back 62% less.\n\nThere are a number of problems here. As explained above, this excludes the UK\u2019s rebate from the calculation, and figures for today can\u2019t be used as a prediction for payments in 2022. It also says the data is for 2018, whereas the EU has only published full figures up to 2017, and some of the figures in post are quite inaccurate (we\u2019ll get onto that).\n\nThat said, the overall trend is fairly accurate. Some countries do get back significantly more than others, and the UK is one of the biggest \u201cnet contributors\u201d meaning it pays in more than it gets back. Richer countries are typically contributors and poorer countries are typically beneficiaries. The UK has been the third or fourth largest contributing country to the EU budget in recent years, along with Germany, France, and Italy.\n\nHowever, some of the numbers in the table are wildly inaccurate. For example, it says that Luxembourg contributes \u00a345 million per year to the EU budget, whereas it contributed almost six times this much (around \u00a3287 million) in 2017. It\u2019s not clear how the post has calculated \u201creturns on investment\u201d, but Luxembourg doesn\u2019t get anything like 3,000% more back in spending than it pays in.\n\nSomething else to consider is that the biggest net contributors (Germany, France, and the UK) have much bigger economies than the biggest net beneficiaries. If we look at contributions as a percentage of countries\u2019 Gross National Income, the differences are far less stark.\n\nIt shows that the UK\u2019s net payments into the EU budget are worth around 0.3% of its gross national income, and Germany makes the biggest contributions\u2014worth 0.41% of their national income.\n\nLikewise, the biggest net receipt a country has received as a percentage of its national income is 4.2% (Bulgaria).", "lang": "en"}
