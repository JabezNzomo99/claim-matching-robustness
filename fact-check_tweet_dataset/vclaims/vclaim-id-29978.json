It appears it was created as part of a smear campaign against the environmentalist group.\n\nA spokesperson for the group told us:\n\nThis is not an official Extinction Rebellion sticker. Our graphics are available for everyone to use so this has clearly been used in a way to create controversy around XR. It\u2019s completely contrary to our principles and values: we don\u2019t blame and shame, we believe in system change not individual change, we don\u2019t take positions on specific issues (preferring to leave it to a Citizens Assembly to say what must be done to address the Emergency) and we welcome everybody, young and old, rich and poor, meat-eating and vegan, car-owners and cyclists alike \u2013 all are needed to stand together if we are to avert the calamity which faces us all.\n\nWe have been unable to determine who specifically created this photograph. However, on Jan. 21, 2020, a thread on the internet forum 4chan asked users to \u201chijack\u201d Extinction Rebellion by sharing a series of fake slogans:\n\nAnother thread that same day on the forum encouraged users to spread the viral \u201cNazi\u201d image:\n\nMore than a week prior, a 4chan user shared a link to an \u201cExtinction Rebellion Poster Generator\u201d allowing users to easily create Extinction Rebellion-branded messages without the consent, knowledge, or endorsement of the environmental organization.\n\nThe Argus reported that another batch of fake Extinction Rebellion posters were spread around Brighton, England, in January 2020. Those posters, which bore fraudulent slogans such as \u201cOnly White People Care About the Environment\u201d and \u201cSave the Environment End Mass Migration,\u201d also drew condemnation from the environmentalist group.\n\nExtinction Rebellion Brighton said in a statement, \u201cExtinction Rebellion, in Brighton and any other location, are not associated with these racist posters in any way and do not wish to give any more air time to their abhorrent messages.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cDrive a Car? You Are a Nazi\u201d sticker campaign is reminiscent of other stunts deployed on 4chan.\n\nWhen Nike endorsed politically outspoken former quarterback Colin Kaepernick in September 2018, for instance, online trolls on the 4chan forum started spreading a series of racist ads as if they were created by the apparel company. The 4chan forum was also responsible for spreading fake posters bearing the slogan \u201cPedophiles are People Too\u201d in order to smear the LGBTQ community, fake Starbucks coupons in an attempt to stir up racial controversy, and a fake flyer calling for the murder of children in order to paint the group Antifa as extremist.", "lang": "en"}
