However, this is not from Nigerian television; it was fabricated by using images from several sources, including an old photo of a damaged building in Syria.\n\nPopular Nigerian entertainer Tunde Ednut published the image to his 2.4 million followers on Instagram on August 24, 2020. Since then, nearly 20,000 people have liked the photo.\n\n\u201cHow can 40 dead bodies die again?\u201d reads Ednut\u2019s caption, which has attracted comments from notable Nigerian celebrities, including renowned broadcaster Ifedayo Olarinde, who affirmed in local parlance that the incident occurred in the country.\n\nBoth Ednut and Olarinde were recently subjects of debunks by AFP Fact Check on Nigeria\u2019s debt to China and supposed snowfall in the country\u2019s biggest city Lagos.\n\nThe viral image shows a photo of a collapsed building with a television news graphic supposedly reporting that \u201c40 dead bodies died as mortuary collapsed in Benin (sic)\u201d.\n\nBenin is a French-speaking west African nation, but it is also the name of the capital city of Nigeria\u2019s southern Edo state.\n\nThe image has circulated in several social media posts in Nigeria, including this one on Facebook that has been liked nearly 10,000 times, as well as on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nMistakes in television news graphics are not uncommon in Nigeria. But this purported blunder comes at a time when the state of Nigeria\u2019s media industry has become a major talking point, after the country recently sought parliament\u2019s approval for a $500 million loan aimed at revamping the sector, including rejigging state-owned television stations across the country.\n\nMost comments on Facebook suggest users of the social network actually believed that the viral image showed a television broadcast in Nigeria, while some were sceptical or dismissive, or found it funny.\n\nHowever, this image is not a screenshot from a Nigerian television station. It has been digitally fabricated using several unrelated images.\n\nA reverse image search using TinEye found a higher quality version of the image of the collapsed building in this article published by British national daily newspaper The Daily Mirror on June 11, 2013. The caption indicates that it was taken in Syria by the news agency Reuters.\n\nThe photo was also published two months earlier in The Daily Star, a newspaper that covers the Middle East, with a similar caption indicating it was taken by Reuters near Damascus, Syria on April 2, 2013.\n\nThe image contains what looks like a TV ticker at the bottom, with the text \u201c20 Year old Mark Lee found doing donuts in Target parking lot\u201d. A search for this text led AFP Fact Check to a Pinterest post featuring a photo of Canadian rapper Mark Lee and the same ticker but in higher quality.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran checks on Lee\u2019s social media accounts and found that the photo of him used in the Pinterest post was actually cropped from one of his Instagram posts from January 2020.\n\nBeyond sharing the same ticker and breaking news logo, a part of Lee\u2019s photo can also be seen in the viral image (see areas circled in yellow below).\n\nMeanwhile, no credible news outlet in Nigeria or the neighbouring Republic of Benin has reported on a mortuary building that purportedly collapsed.", "lang": "en"}
