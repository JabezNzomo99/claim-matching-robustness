As the photograph implied, doing so would be challenging due to the fellow\u2019s assumed impairment (which as shown is actually an example of a wall-eyed, not cross-eyed, condition):\n\nA 28-year-old Michigan man, Ralph Holden, was arrested and booked on charges of first-degree murder after his girlfriend was found dead in their 82nd St. home over the weekend \u2026 [police] found 26-year-old Wendy Miller unresponsive on the kitchen floor. Holden immediately confessed to police that he killed his girlfriend, but the reason stunned investigators \u2026 \u201cAccording to Holden\u2019s confession, he complained that Miller would not make eye contact with him when he was trying to have a conversation with her. I mean, have you seen this guy\u2019s eyes? I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but nobody would know which way he was looking or which eye to make contact with. It\u2019s just a real shame.\u201d According to the 911 transcripts, a neighbor reported the disturbance saying she heard shouting were Holden continued to demand from his girlfriend, \u201clook at me, look at me, look at me!\u201d The neighbor could hear Miller crying, \u201cI am but you never believe me!\u201d\n\nThe image was old, and first published to the internet as early as July 2009; whether the image was digitally altered was unclear. However, the photograph was definitively not a mugshot taken after a December 2015 crime.\n\nMoreover, the web site News10Live (created to look like a local television news web site) featured other fabricated news stories which originally appeared on similar fake news sites like Newswatch33 and Now8News. Among the articles on the News10Live page were claims the Earth would go dark for 15 days, that the forceful ejection of an Xbox game killed a player, that a homeless couple was discovered living in the attic of a Walmart, that a girl was electrocuted by earbuds on a charging iPhone, that Starbucks beverages contained semen, and that a rapist dressed as a clown doll to hide in a child\u2019s bedroom.", "lang": "en"}
