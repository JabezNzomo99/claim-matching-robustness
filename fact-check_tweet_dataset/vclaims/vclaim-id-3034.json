They claim the teens are really \u201ccrisis actors\u201d paid by liberal activists, that they are part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy involving CNN and the FBI, or that one of the most outspoken students is actually a 28-year-old man who was arrested in South Carolina.\n\nFacebook users have flagged as potentially false several variations of stories advancing those claims, and readers have asked us about them, as well. They are not true.\n\nConspiracy theories like these often fester in shadowy parts of the internet \u2014 on extremist blogs or websites \u2014 but these particular rumors got extra exposure when they were highlighted by public figures and amplified on social media with the help of Russian bots.\n\nAs for the public figures, Donald Trump Jr. \u201cliked\u201d a tweet promoting a story suggesting that one of the students was part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy. Benjamin Kelly, an aide to a Florida state representative, told a reporter that two of the most outspoken students were actors. (Kelly has since been fired.) And Daryl Metcalfe, a Pennsylvania state representative, suggested on Twitter and Facebook that the teens weren\u2019t actually students by repeatedly using quotation marks around the word \u201cstudents.\u201d\n\nOne of the primary targets has been 17-year-old David Hogg.\n\nHogg \u2014 along with fellow students Emma Gonzalez, Jaclyn Corin and Cameron Kasky \u2014 has started a movement with the hashtag #NeverAgain to stanch school shootings. He has been one of the most prominent faces in television interviews after the Florida shooting.\n\nHogg, who is a member of his school\u2019s television news show, recorded interviews with students during the shooting.\n\nHe also recorded a confrontation between a friend and a lifeguard on a beach in California last summer. Footage of the beach confrontation went viral and prompted coverage on a television news broadcast at the time.\n\nConspiracy theorists have used last year\u2019s California newscast to push the narrative that Hogg is a \u201ccrisis actor,\u201d or someone who travels from one location to another claiming to be a witness to a tragedy. The voice-over for one such video starts out by saying: \u201cYou know that crisis actor David Hogg? Well, apparently, he\u2019s put on some bullshit before out in California \u2014 what a surprise, that\u2019s where these actors like to hang out, you know \u2014 anyways, so, we get a serious crisis actor here. He\u2019s taking on multiple roles all over the place.\u201d The video then plays the news clip from August.\n\nThe fact is Hogg is a student at Stoneman Douglas High School who was in Los Angeles on summer break.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2016, Hogg tweeted a short video of his flight to California and wrote: \u201cI love going to LA for the summer.\u201d\n\nDuring the previous school year, he had tweeted about a Stoneman Douglas High School basketball game and making Parkland, Florida, more bike friendly. He also shared photos of his mornings at Stoneman Douglas High School, and posed in front of the school logo in a tiger costume.\n\nAnd, in 2015, he was pictured in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper running in a cross-country race for Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAlso, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, Robert Runcie, told the Tampa Bay Times about Hogg and other students: \u201cThese are absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas. They\u2019ve been there. I can verify that.\u201d\n\nAs for the claims that Hogg is actually a 28-year-old man who was arrested in South Carolina, the person pictured in the mugshot, David Guyton Hogg, is currently on probation after pleading guilty to possession of methamphetamine, or crack cocaine, in 2017, according to court records. His address is listed with the court in Anderson, South Carolina.\n\nAnd the claims that Hogg is part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d rely on the fact that his father, Kevin Hogg, is a retired FBI employee. But conspiracists offer no evidence of coordination between the bureau and David Hogg.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the internet has lit up with claims about \u201cactors\u201d participating in political rallies.\n\nFollowing a violent clash between demonstrators and counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, false stories circulated online that claimed a Craigslist ad was used to hire \u201cactors and photographers\u201d as counter-demonstrators.\n\nAnd the claim about \u201ccrisis actors\u201d was among the many conspiracy theories that circulated after 20 children were shot dead in their elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nSegarra, Lisa Marie, et. al. \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office Had Received About 20 Calls Regarding Suspect: The Latest on the Florida School Shooting.\u201d Time. 18 Feb 2018.\n\nWitt, Emily. \u201cHow the Survivors of Parkland Began the Never Again Movement.\u201d The New Yorker. 19 Feb 2018.\n\nWells, Rick. \u201cSame Crisis Actor Hogg In FL and CA, Coached By Media In Florida Aftermath.\u201d RickWells.us. 21 Feb 2018.\n\n\u201cBusted: Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor Visited CNN HQ Before the Shooting; Ranted Live on CNN After.\u201d True Pundit. 20 Feb 2018.\n\nMaiberg, Emanuel. \u201cThe #1 Trending Video on YouTube Right Now Suggests That a Student From the Parkland Shooting Is a Crisis Actor.\u201d Motherboard.Vice.com. 21 Feb 2018.\n\nSmith, Allan. \u201cRussian bots zeroed in on a survivor of the Florida school shooting who\u2019s been targeted by far-right conspiracy theorists.\u201d Business Insider. 21 Feb 2018.\n\nLeary, Alexa and Wilson, Kirby. \u201cFlorida lawmaker\u2019s aide fired after saying outspoken Parkland students are actors.\u201d 20 Feb 2018.\n\nCBS Los Angeles. \u201cConfrontation Between Lifeguard, Bodysurfer Caught On Camera In Redondo Beach Goes Viral.\u201d YouTube. 7 Aug 2017.\n\nCopeland, Hal. \u201cDavid Hogg, of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, finishes in 21:56.84.\u201d Sun Sentinel. 19 Sep 2015.", "lang": "en"}
