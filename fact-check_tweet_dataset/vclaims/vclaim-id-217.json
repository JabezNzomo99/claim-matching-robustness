Examples ( here ) and ( here ).\u200b\n\nThe article seems to originate from YourNewsWire (now called NewsPunch) in 2018, which has since been deleted. NewPunch.com\u2019s editor confirmed to Reuters that the article was removed when YourNewsWire moved to Newspunch in 2018. \u201cOur editorial standards have changed significantly from the time that article was published, and we no longer stand by the statements made in the article,\u201d the publication said.\n\nThe article was written by a Baxter Dmitry, a possible pseudonym for an author who has been criticized for writing fake news articles (called out by Poynter here ). The website YourNewsWire has also been criticized for producing inaccurate content ( here ). Dmitry is still a frequent contributor to NewsPunch ( newspunch.com/author/baxter/ )\u200b.\n\nThe article circulating online claims that Bill Gates\u2019 personal doctor told a medical symposium in Seattle that the Microsoft founder refused to vaccinate his children. It quotes the doctor as saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children. They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn\u2019t need any shots.\u201c\n\nThe article does not provide further information relating to sources, such as the name of the doctor or the event. It says: \u201cThe comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality.\u201d It is likely this would have been reported on by news outlets at the time, had it been true. Reuters could not find any other information or references relating to this claim from major news organizations.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates are known for their efforts in developing and distributing vaccination around the world through global health initiatives at their eponymous foundation ( here ).\u200b\n\nMelinda Gates confirmed in an April 2019 Facebook post that all three of her children have been fully vaccinated ( here ).\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to show Bill Gates refused to vaccinate his own children. The article was written by an author known for publishing fake news and the original story has been deleted.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
