No, that's not true: a story from a British news website about a CEO named Paul May who quit his job was initially published with a misleading headline. The headline was later changed but the original headline kept circulating on social media making the article go massively viral.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Metro on November 15, 2018 titled \"May quits with immediate effect after poor performance\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPaul May, the chief executive of Patisserie Valerie's parent company, has stepped down with immediate effect.
