The image, however, has been modified and the original is a photograph of an adorable western pygmy possum from Down Under.\n\nThe meme was posted here on Facebook where it has been shared more than 12,500 times. It shows a small furry creature with sharp teeth and cheetah spots, clinging to a human fingertip.\n\nThe text reads: \u201cNot all Australian animals will kill you. Don\u2019t get me wrong... he wants to. He just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe meme has also been shared more than 6,000 times in multiple Facebook posts here and here.\n\nWhile some immediately guessed the image was digitally altered, others believed it to be the real thing.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search on TinEye shows that a similar picture has been online since September 2014.\n\nThis version of the animal doesn\u2019t have the cat-like snout, sharp fangs and spots of the specimen in the meme. The picture is of a softer and more innocent-looking creature, taken by an Amanda McLean.\n\nIt appears in an Australian Geographic article titled: \u201cThe western pygmy possum is the cutest Australian animal\u201d, published on September 25, 2014.\n\nIt describes the western pygmy possum as native to Australia and grows to just 7.7cm long, with an 8cm-long tail.\n\nMcLean, who was a PhD student at the University of Adelaide at the time, took the picture while on a field trip to the Eyre Peninsula.", "lang": "en"}
