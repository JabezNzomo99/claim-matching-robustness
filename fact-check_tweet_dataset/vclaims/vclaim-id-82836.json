Just as the health-care law preserves the private health-care system, private accounts in Social Security would have been established as part of the current system.\n\nSocial Security has two trust funds \u2014 one for retirement benefits and one for disability benefits \u2014 that are are currently invested in Treasury securities, one of the safest investments possible. (Some argue that\u2019s an accounting fiction, but that\u2019s not right. For more information, see The Fact Checker\u2019s Guide to Social Security.)\n\nIn his 1999 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed transferring $2.7 trillion of the budget surpluses to the Social Security trust funds \u2014 and investing 20 percent of the funds in the stock market, most likely in index funds. Clinton\u2019s goal was to have about 14.5 percent of all trust fund assets in stocks. By 2014, it was estimated, the government would own nearly $1 trillion of the shares of U.S. corporations.\n\nAs a technical matter, Clinton proposed to invest general revenues in the stock market in order to bolster Social Security; he did not propose diverting payroll-tax revenue destined for the trust funds. Tapping general revenues, however, was also controversial because it would break the link between Social Security and workers\u2019 paychecks. In any case, one could certainly say that the first president who wanted to \u201cgive the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street\u201d was Bill Clinton.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposal was met with horror by Republicans, who feared government manipulation of the securities markets. (Then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was an especially strong foe.) Republicans countered with an alternative proposal \u2014 allowing individuals to direct a portion (about 15 percent) of their Social Security payroll taxes to individual retirement accounts. These were called \u201cpersonal accounts,\u201d in that Americans would have a choice of investment options modeled on the retirement program for federal workers.\n\nWhen Bush ran for president in 2000, advocating personal accounts, he specifically rejected the idea of government investing any funds earmarked for Social Security in the stock market. Instead, he laid out broad principles for a \u201ccarve-out\u201d plan, such as saying current retirees and anyone over 55 would stay in the current system, that participation for younger workers would be voluntary and that the investment choices would be limited to a few broad-based investment options, such as stock and bond index funds.\n\nUnder Bush\u2019s Personal Retirement Account (PRA) plan, the payroll-tax diversion was relatively small, starting out with a cap of $1,000 per year and eventually expanding to no more than one-third of payroll taxes. The investment options were modeled on the ones in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal employees, with a bias toward \u201clife cycle\u201d plans that shift investments from stocks to bonds as a worker nears retirement. A key feature was that participation was voluntary; even people who chose the PRA option would not have been compelled to invest any of it in the stock market.\n\n\u201cTSP was our model for account administration, and TSP has a quasi-government entity managing account administration,\u201d said Keith Hennessy, director of the White House National Economic Council under Bush. \u201cIt is true that our PRAs would have allowed you to take on (limited) investment risk, but that\u2019s a different meaning than \u2018giving the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street.\u2019 That\u2019s an absurd and patently false claim.\u201d\n\nGene Sperling, who was director of the National Economic Council under Bill Clinton, suggested The Fact Checker was being nitpicky about Hillary Clinton\u2019s language. \u201d \u2018Wall Street\u2019 was clearly her shorthand for the fundamental conflict between Republicans and Democrats over whether to carve out personal accounts from payroll taxes that now are dedicated to the Social Security trust funds,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone watching had any question what she was talking about.\u201d\n\nIn any case, for all the effort Bush put into crafting and promoting his concept, it went nowhere. Bush could not even get a committee vote on his idea, even though Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, as Republicans were wary of embracing a concept under furious assault by Democrats.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s \u201cwhole plan\u201d was not to put Social Security\u2019s trust funds into the stock market. It was designed as a voluntary program, in which individuals could choose to direct a relatively small portion of their payroll taxes to investment options besides Treasury securities. Ironically, it was Clinton\u2019s husband who actually had proposed to invest money earmarked for Social Security in the stock market.", "lang": "en"}
