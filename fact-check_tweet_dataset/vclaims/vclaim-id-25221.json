The Sri Lankan prime minister then greets the former Indian prime minister.\n\nThe clip also shows Sonia Gandhi seated next to Ranil Wickremmsinghe while two security guards help Manmohan Singh into a nearby chair.\n\nThe clip has gone viral along with text in Hindi which says, \"Those of you who had a misconception that Manmohan Singh was the prime minister, watch this video four or five times with eyes wide open. There doubts will be cleared.\"\n\nWhile the video is authentic, the message accompanying it is misleading since the video was shot when Manmohan Singh was no longer the prime minister.\n\nThe video was shot on April 25, 2017 during the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's five-day visit to India.\n\nIt is also worthy to note that this is not the first time Wickremsinghe met Sonia Gandhi while visiting India. Sample a tweet from his verified handle in 2016.\n\nWhile it was current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was also in power in 2017; the message accompanying the video claims Manmohan Singh was the prime minister when the video was shot.\n\nBut in a voice over heard in a longer version of the video, Manmohan Singh is referred to as former prime minister.\n\nBelow is the original video from which a portion has been clipped and has gone viral.\n\nDespite the fact that the video clearly mentions that Sonia Gandhi met Ranil Wickremesinghe in the capacity of president of the opposition party while Manmohan Singh as the former PM, the video has been shared for over 1.6 lakh times in an earlier post on Facebook.\n\nPosted on the Facebook page 'Modinama' on June 18, 2018 and has been shared over 1.6 lakh times.\n\nThe same clip was again shared from the Facebook account of one Malkit Singh on January 1 this year.\n\nA screenshot from the same viral video was also posted as a query by Quora readers - Is the picture? of Manmohan Singh with the Sri Lankan president authentic?\n\nThe Asian Age had also mentioned the meeting between the three, in its story on the Sri Lanka PM's visit in 2017.\n\nThe news of Wickremesinghe's India visit was also carried by Sri Lankan news portal Newsfirst.lk on April 26, 2017 with a similar video of Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the story referred to Sonia Gandhi as Leader of the Opposition. The error is regretted.", "lang": "en"}
