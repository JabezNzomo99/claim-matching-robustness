{"title": "FALSE: John Regala dies in August 2020", "subtitle": "The actor is still alive. He guested on a radio show on August 25", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Aug 28, 2020 2:02 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-67024", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/john-regala-dies-august-2020", "vclaim": "Websites manila.gmplustv.com, jeepnytv.xyz, gman3wsupdate.xyz, and gl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz posted this claim as early as August 22. The web pages contained a video clip of what looked like a news report from 24 Oras, GMA Network\u2019s evening news program. When clicked, the video shows newscaster Mel Tiangco for a few seconds then stops to ask the reader to \u201cuncover\u201d the rest of the clip.\n\nThe video embedded in the websites was uploaded by YouTube channel Aksyon Balita PH on July 29, which got 75,146 views as of writing. Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool Claim Check flagged at least 24 posts that contained this claim.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 25, Regala went on a radio interview with Radyo Singko 92.5 News FM\u2019s Wanted Sa Radyo to say that he did not receive donations raised for him by his fellow celebrities, Chuckie Dreyfus and Nadia Montenegro, following his hospitalization in early August. Regala suffered from severe gout and cirrhosis. He was discharged after 8 days on August 12 and was said to be on his way to recovery.\n\nThe Inquirer reported on August 26 that the reason why Regala\u2019s colleagues ended their support was that they could no longer tolerate the actor\u2019s behavior.\n\nThe video uploaded by Aksyon Balita PH also did not contain any supporting evidence about the actor\u2019s supposed death. The video was only 3 seconds long, with Tiangco making no mention of Regala\u2019s name.\n\nRappler previously debunked a claim that also came from Akson Balita PH in June. Similarly, the YouTube channel posted an altered video of a newscast that made it appear like it was about an OFW beheaded in Saudi Arabia after testing positive for the coronavirus, when in fact the clip originally was of a 2015 report about the beheading of an OFW convicted for murder. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
