The claim is false; the photo in the misleading posts shows a storm in Sydney, Australia in 2015; no official tsunami warnings have been issued in the Philippines so far in 2019.\n\nThe photo and purported tsunami warning were shared in this Facebook post on April 27, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Tagalog language caption translates to English as: \u201cLord God! Please don\u2019t let this happen\u201d.\n\nThe text above the photo translates to English as: \u201cTsunami warning issued for the Philippines and Indonesia following a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in the sea of Davao Oriental\u201d.\n\n*BREAKING NEWS - Areas which can be possibly hit by the tsunami following a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in the sea of GovGen, Davao Oriental. People living in coastal areas are advised to evacuate*\n\n\u201cPlease Share this immediately so everyone will be on alert and let's include prayers to this.\u201d\n\nThe places listed in the misleading post are located in the southern Philippines.\n\nThe same photo was shared on Facebook here on April 27, 2019, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; no official tsunami warnings have been issued in the Philippines so far in 2019.\n\nThe last time actual alerts were issued over a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami that could affect the Philippines and Indonesia was in December 2018.\n\nHere is the December 29, 2018 earthquake alert issued by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, and here is an alert for a tsunami issued by the Global Disaster Alerting Coordination System in connection with the same quake. \n\n\n\nFor 2019, this is a log of official tsunami warnings published by the government seismologists at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Phivolcs report:\n\nThe misleading Facebook posts also claim there was a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in the sea of Davao Oriental immediately before the purported tsunami warning was issued.\n\nThis Phivolcs log of earthquakes in the Philippines does not show any record of a 7.2- magnitude earthquake on April 27, 2019.\n\nThe photo in the misleading posts actually shows a weather event in Australia in November 2015.\n\nBy conducting keyword searches and a reverse image search on Google for the photo in the misleading posts, AFP found this Facebook post.\n\nIt was published on the Facebook page for Sydney based photographer Richard Hirst on November 6, 2015.\n\nBelow is the post:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cPRINT OFFER - thank you for the amazing response from all over the world to this photograph of an epic display of mother nature. Due to the overwhelming number of requests for prints I am doing a limited run of large prints (60x40cm) on premium metallic paper at A$145, with free delivery anywhere in the world.

Cheers Hirsty.\u201d\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook on the same day that severe storms hit Sydney.
