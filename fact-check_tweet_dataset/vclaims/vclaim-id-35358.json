In particular, some social media users shared the following quotation, attributed to Limbaugh:\n\n\u201cThere is no conclusive proof that nicotine\u2019s addictive\u2026 And the same thing with cigarettes causing emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease.\u201d\n\nSocial media users posted several memes containing the same quotation, including the following AZ Quotes graphic:\n\nThe statement first emerged in 1994, when the left-leaning non-profit organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) published an in-depth examination of several dozen false and misleading claims made by Limbaugh on his radio and television shows, in his books, and elsewhere. The July/August edition of FAIR\u2019s newsletter Extra! contained a report with the headline \u201cThe Way Things Aren\u2019t \u2014 Rush Limbaugh Debates Reality.\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cWeird Science\u201d section of the eight-page article, FAIR highlighted the following claim, made by Limbaugh during the April 29, 1994, episode of his radio program \u201cThe Rush Limbaugh Show\u201d:\n\n\u201cThere is no conclusive proof that nicotine\u2019s addictive\u2026[or with] cigarettes causing emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease.\u201d\n\nFAIR refuted those assertions as follows:\n\nBy that time, Limbaugh was already a leading conservative voice in American media, and his radio show was syndicated to hundreds of stations across the country. FAIR\u2019s expos\u00e9 made a splash and garnered news coverage by major outlets including The Associated Press.\n\nThe lengthy magazine article later formed the basis for a book entitled \u201cThe Way Things Aren\u2019t: Rush Limbaugh\u2019s Reign of Error,\u201d which was published in 1995 and debunked more than 100 of Limbaugh\u2019s falsehoods.\n\nOne of the book\u2019s authors, Steve Rendall, told Snopes the tape recordings he had made of Limbaugh\u2019s radio broadcasts during that era had not survived the intervening 26 years, and therefore could not be consulted. Similarly, we did not find any official transcript of the April 29, 1994, episode. (Limbaugh\u2019s website features an archive of thousands of recordings and transcripts of his shows, but it only stretches back to the year 2000).\n\nHowever, Limbaugh effectively confirmed the authenticity of the quotation and reiterated the same point in a lengthy rebuttal of FAIR\u2019s article, which the organization itself printed. Limbaugh wrote (emphasis added):\n\nMy point, made over and over again in recent months, is that if nicotine is really a terrible drug then Congress should just call it a terrible drug and ban it outright. The fact is that nicotine\u2019s addictiveness and whether or not it is a drug is, contrary to FAIR\u2019s assertion, a source of tremendous controversy \u2014 so controversial that The Washington Post\u2018s lead editorial on July 2, 1994 dealt entirely with this issue. \u201c[F]ood and drug commissioner David Kesslerhas begun an effort to determine whether nicotine-containing cigarettes meet the law\u2019s definition of a drug. If they do, the Food and Drug Administration has the duty to regulate them if cigarettes are a drug, and if they can\u2019t be shown in their present form to be safe and effective \u2014 which a drug would have to be in order to be sold, and which is not very likely \u2014 then what does the government do?\u201d\n\nIn saying that \u201cnicotine\u2019s addictiveness \u2026 is \u2026 a source of tremendous controversy,\u201d Limbaugh was effectively reiterating the claim that \u201cthere is no conclusive proof that nicotine\u2019s addictive.\u201d In his rebuttal, he also did not dispute in any way that FAIR\u2019s quoting of him was accurate.\n\nSo while we cannot consult the original audio recording or an official transcript to verify whether Limbaugh\u2019s exact wording was as FAIR presented it, we can confirm that FAIR gave a proper presentation of Limbaugh\u2019s views on that specific issue, because the radio host effectively restated them shortly afterwards, and never disputed the wording presented by FAIR.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s views on the addictiveness of nicotine have since changed. In a July 2004 episode of his radio show, he said nicotine was \u201cthe most addictive drug, substance, whatever, on the planet,\u201d but argued that it might have other health benefits. In September 2019, he again described nicotine as \u201cthe most addictive drug on earth,\u201d but argued in favor of electronic cigarettes on the basis that the liquids they use do not produce the carcinogens produced by traditional, combustible tobacco cigarettes.\n\nLimbaugh himself was often photographed smoking cigars and earlier in life smoked cigarettes, though he said he quit the cigarette habit in the 1980s.", "lang": "en"}
