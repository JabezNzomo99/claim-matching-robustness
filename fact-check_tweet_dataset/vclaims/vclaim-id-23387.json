The claim is false; the clip has been doctored from an original video that shows UK football fans watching a match during the Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nThe video shows a crowd of people in a bar erupting into celebration while what appears to be Indian TV news plays on a large screen.\n\nIt is contained in multiple Facebook posts, for example this one published on May 20, 2019, and shared more than 600 times since.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption says, translated to English: \u201cModi is not a storm but a tsunami. Enjoying watching exit poll in the UK. Modi devotee.\u201d\n\n\u201cModi\u201d refers to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Here is his official Twitter page.\n\nExit polls were released by several Indian broadcasters after the seventh and last phase of the general election ended on May 19, 2019. Here is a AFP report about these post-poll predictions.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading Facebook posts:\n\nThe same video was also viewed around 11,000 times in this Facebook post published May 20, 2019, alongside the caption \u201cModi supporters watching #ExitPoll2019\u201d.\n\nIt was also viewed thousands of times elsewhere on Facebook with the same claim, for example here and here, and tens of thousands of times on Twitter for example here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video does not show Modi supporters, but UK football fans celebrating a goal.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the video obtained through digital verification tool InVid found this 40-second YouTube video published by a British radio station on June 16, 2016.\n\nThe Heart News West Country video has a caption that says: \u201cFans watching Euro 2016 on the big screen at Ashton Gate stadium celebrate Daniel Sturridge's late winner for England against Wales.\u201d\n\nIt is embedded below:\n\nA 15-second section of the Heart News video matches the clip in the misleading post, but a football match appears on the screen instead of Indian TV news.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the doctored Facebook video (L) with the corresponding moment in the original video on YouTube (R):\n\nThe original video also appeared in this CBS Sports online report dated June 16, 2016, and headlined: \u201cWatch as a bar in England goes nuts after late winner vs. Wales in Euro 2016\u201d.\n\nSimilar clips were published here on the website of Bristol City Football Club and on the BBC West Facebook page here on June 17, 2016.\n\nThe BBC Facebook post is embedded below:\n\nAn extract from Indian news channel India Today, which is superimposed on the giant screen in the doctored clip, matches a section of this video published on the channel\u2019s YouTube page on May 19, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that moment at the timestamp 7:50:", "lang": "en"}
