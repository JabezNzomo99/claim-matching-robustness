We have traveled in the same business circles. He is known among other millionaires as a con-artist and among business owners as a cheat out to stiff everyone,\u201d Bloomberg is quoted as saying.\n\nWhile Bloomberg did call Trump\u2019s candidacy a \u201ccon\u201d in 2016, there is no evidence he said this remark.\n\nBloomberg has been an outspoken critic of Trump since the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe president is just flunking every single test,\u201d he told Democratic business leaders in January. However, there is no evidence that Bloomberg ever said the quote in question.\n\nThe image claims that Bloomberg was the governor of New York, which is also false.\n\nThe quote may be patterned after remarks Bloomberg made at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where he took the stage to campaign for candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking of Trump\u2019s campaign, Bloomberg said, \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!\u201d (Some news outlets reporting on the speech paraphrased Bloomberg, saying he called Trump a \u201ccon artist.\u201d)\n\nDespite Bloomberg announcing in March that he wouldn\u2019t run for president in 2020, Axios recently reported that the former mayor might reconsider, especially if former Vice President Joe Biden doesn\u2019t enter the race.", "lang": "en"}
