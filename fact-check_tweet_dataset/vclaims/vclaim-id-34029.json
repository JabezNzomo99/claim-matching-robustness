Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Muslim youth beating an old man in Delhi for shouting \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. Fact: The old man in the video was beaten over some issue related to money and for abusing people, not for shouting \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. The Police have told that the man has been arrested before for killing his wife and frequently get into fights with others. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe same video went viral previously in October-2019 with a similar claim. On one of the videos, a user has commented that the video is related to Bhilwara (Rajasthan) and also, vehicles with Rajasthan registration numbers can be seen in the video.\n\nSo, when FACTLY has contacted Rajesh Meena (Bhilwara District Additional Superintendent of Police) in October-2019, he said, \u2018The old man in the video is Hothchand Sindhi. He is mentally unstable. He has been previously arrested for killing his wife and frequently gets into fights with others. In the video, he was beaten (at Azad Chowk, Bhilwara) over money and for abusing others, not for chanting \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. Manjinder S Sira (Delhi- Rajouri Garden MLA) has also tweeted clarifying about the incident.\n\nAlso, FACTLY was able to find the FIR copy of the complaint filed by the old man\u2019s son about the incident. It can be seen that there is no mention of \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 in the complaint and also, there are non-Muslims in the accused list. The complainant himself mentions that there were Muslims, Sindhis and other religious members in the accused members. The FIR copy can be accessed here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u201cold man beaten by Muslim youth for shouting Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019\u201d\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
