No, that's not true, despite what a recent meme claims. The meme was produced by a satirical liberal Facebook page that tries to trick conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing absurdly fake news so fans of the pages can then mock them for it. The story and the Trump quote are not real.\n\nIt originated from a meme that appeared on August 28, 2018 in a post on a Facebook page named \"America Loves Donald Trump\" (archived here) with following caption:\n\nThe text on the meme read:\n\nPresident Trump says he will override the Supreme Court and make desecration of the flag illegal! His order will cover the Confederate flag as well! Share if you support this incredible decision!\n\nHowever the Facebook page that posted the meme comes with following disclaimer on its about page:\n\nConstitutionally speaking the President is also not able to override Supreme Court decisions with a simple executive action, he would need the support of Congress so he can have legislation passed for that (and he possibly might need to get an amendment to the Constitution ratified first). So this news is definitely fake, this is not something the President can just decide to do.", "lang": "en"}
