Singapore on Monday, 25 November, invoked its anti-fake news law for the first time, against Progress Singapore Party (PSP) member Brad Bowyer, who was then asked to issue a clarification on a Facebook post shared on 13 November, The Straits Times reported. The post originally claimed that investments in Amaravati city project in Andhra Pradesh have been doing poorly: \u201c... we also saw the recent canning of the Amaravati city project, part of the $4 billion already dumped into Andhra Pradesh by GLCs (government linked companies) and related parties so India has not been so good an investment choice after all (sic).\u201d\n\nIn the post, Bowyer also mentioned Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel)\u2018s investment in Bharti Airtel. The post read: \u201cIn my accountability speech at Hong Lim earlier in the year, I mentioned Indian Telco Bharti Airtel and questioned GIC investing in it at a time when Singtel was upping its stake as the company hit cash flow issues and rating agencies had reclassified it as junk. And of course, it recently got hit with a court ruling that it owes the Indian government over $17 billion in licence fees... Which financial media speculates could have a knock on effect of wiping four or five percent off Singtels share value (sic).\u201d In the Facebook post, Bowyer had also implied that the Singapore government is involved in investment decisions made by GIC and Temasek. On being asked to issue a correction, Bowyer edited the post saying, \u201cThis post contains false statements of fact.\u201d Further, he linked a fact-checked article published by Factually, Singapore\u2019s state-run website, which mentioned, \u201cThe Facebook post by Mr Brad Bowyer contains false statements of fact and misleading statements.\u201d CORRECTION NOTICE: This post contains false statements of fact. For the correct facts, click here.... Posted by Brad Bowyer on Tuesday, November 12, 2019 According to The Straits Times, responding to the Facebook post, the Ministry of Finance\u2019s statement on Monday said that it \u201ccontains clearly false statements of fact, and undermines public trust in the Government.\u201d\n\nRegarding Bowyer\u2019s assertions about the Amaravati project and that $4 billion have been poorly invested or \u201cdumped in Andhra Pradesh\u201d by government-linked companies, the Factually article said this is false. On the claims made about Singtel and Bharti Airtel, the Factually article mentioned that the matter is for the two companies to address. \u201cMr Bowyer refers to Singtel\u2019s investment in Bharti Airtel. Singtel\u2019s shareholding today is valued at $13 billion, which is more than double its investment to date of $5.1 billion,\u201d the article further read. Terming the allegations made by Bowyer on government influencing investment decision as \u201cfalse\u201d, the Factually article read: \u201cThe Government does not influence, let alone direct, the individual investment decisions made by Temasek and GIC. Which companies they invest in, or divest from, is entirely the responsibility of their respective management teams. The Government likewise does not interfere in the commercial decisions of Temasek\u2019s and GIC\u2019s portfolio companies.\u201d It further mentioned that the government ensures that Temasek and GIC have \u201ccompetent boards,\u201d which it holds responsible for their respective performances.\n\nIn another post, after issuing a correction, he said, \u201cI have no problem in following that request as I feel it is fair to have both points of view and clarifications and corrections of fact when necessary.\u201d Today in response to a POFMA request I amended a post of mine from 13th November regarding Bharti Airtel, Salt Bae and... Posted by Brad Bowyer on Sunday, November 24, 2019 In May, Singapore had passed a law criminalising publication of fake news and allowing the government to block and order the removal of such content. The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) bans falsehoods that are prejudicial to Singapore or likely to influence elections and requires service providers to remove such content or allows the government to block it. Offenders could face a jail term of up to 10 years and hefty fines.\n\nPhil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director, Human Rights Watch, called the move \u201cludicrous.\u201d He tool to Twitter and said, \u201cPOFMA already off to a bad start.\u201d While others claimed that it is a \u201creminder of how the most powerful players can dominate the flow of information.\u201d Ludicrous. State investment funds are influence by governments all the time, that's why they are..wait for it...state controlled. Yet #Singapore uses its rights abusing, so-called anti-fake news law to contest this. #POFMA already off to a bad start! @hrw https://t.co/GjyP3ROBA9 \u2014 Phil Robertson (@Reaproy) November 25, 2019 The first use of Singapore's fake news law is... against an opposition politician.\n\n\n\nAfter the Tories use of 'factcheckUK', it's a useful reminder of how the most powerful players can dominate the flow of information. https://t.co/s2KEiEpFTY \u2014 \u00e0\u00ae\u009c\u00e0\u00af\u0080\u00e0\u00ae\u00b5\u00e0\u00ae\u00a9\u00e0\u00af\u008d (@jeevanvasagar) November 25, 2019 What's the difference between non-partisan fact-checking by @factchecknet signatories & censorship of views officials don't like? It's all in this chilling phrase: \"official government fact-checking website\". Singapore's first action under 'fake news' law.https://t.co/63SmQAhxUb \u2014 Peter Cunliffe-Jones (@PCunliffeJones) November 25, 2019", "lang": "en"}
