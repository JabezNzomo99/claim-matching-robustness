In her clarification, she said that her comment was taken out of context and she categorically mentioned her observation was based on a limited number of studies. \u201cModelling studies estimate that up to 40% of coronavirus infections could be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms,\u201d the report quoted her as saying.\n\nThe full version of Dr Kerkhove's clarification can be accessed here.\n\nEvidently, an unrelated video is being used to falsely claim that the UN body in a u-turn is now advising people against practising social distancing and following quarantine and isolation rules.", "lang": "en"}
