Here's what happened.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-21632", "url": "https://fullfact.org/law/domestic-violence-vulnerable-mustafa-bashir/", "vclaim": "When are domestic violence victims not \u201cvulnerable\u201d?\n\nMustafa Bashir, a cricketer, recently pleaded guilty to \u201cassault occasioning actual bodily harm\u201d. This is Victorian language for a crime that the Crown Prosecution Service will bring to trial in cases of \u201cserious injury\u201d.\n\nMr Bashir had, reportedly, struck his wife, hit her with a cricket bat, and attempted to force her to drink bleach.\n\nThe maximum sentence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years in prison. The average jail sentence actually given to people found guilty of this crime in 2015 was just over a year.\n\nMr Bashir, though, was originally given a suspended sentence of 18 months. A suspended sentence means no immediate jail time, but Mr Bashir could later have been sent to jail to serve the 18 months if he didn\u2019t comply with behaviour requirements set by the judge.\n\nThat changed on 7 April, when the case came back before Judge Richard Mansell QC. He found that Mr Bashir\u2019s previous claim to have a professional cricket contract lined up was false.\n\nAs future employment was no longer a consideration in favour of suspending the sentence, Mr Bashir was re-sentenced to serve the 18 months immediately.\n\nThe judge looked at whether the victim was \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d in setting the length of the sentence\n\nMedia reports had attributed the suspension of the sentence to the judge deciding that Mr Bashir\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t \u201cvulnerable\u201d.\n\nAs we suggested in an earlier version of this article, that\u2019s not how it went.\n\nOn his own account, Judge Mansell said that \u201cI am not convinced that [the victim] was due to her personal circumstances\u201d.\n\nOfficial guidelines require sentencing judges to look at whether the victim \u201cis particularly vulnerable because of personal circumstances\u201d.\n\nNewspaper reports of how this was expressed in the courtroom are different:\n\n\u201cI am not convinced she was a vulnerable person.\u201d\n\nSo whether through misreporting or the judge departing from his notes on the day, the impression arose that he didn\u2019t consider the victim vulnerable at all. Judge Mansell was at pains to correct that impression at the sentencing review:\n\n\u201cI was doing no more and no less than making a finding, in accordance with the sentencing guidelines, that she was not particularly vulnerable as compared with other victims whose personal circumstances are different.\n\nShe was, however, plainly vulnerable, as my sentencing remarks made perfectly clear.\u201d\n\nBut the victim\u2019s vulnerability compared to other victims wasn\u2019t relevant to the decision to then suspend that sentence\n\nThe victim being particularly vulnerable is one of several factors that judges have to consider in arriving at the right length of sentence.\n\nIf Judge Mansell had considered the victim \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d, he might have calculated a longer sentence than the 18 months he eventually arrived at.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a consideration when it came to deciding whether or not that 18-month sentence should be served immediately or suspended.\n\nIn taking the original decision to suspend the 18 months, Judge Mansell looked at the defendant\u2019s previous good character, the delay since the assaults took place, his new relationship, employment\u2014and the offer of future employment with Leicestershire County Cricket Club. The victim\u2019s vulnerability didn\u2019t come into that part of the decision.\n\nRightly or wrongly, \u201cit is not uncommon for judges to attach significant weight to the impact of a sentence upon a defendant\u2019s employment\u201d, according to a criminal barrister writing about the case.\n\nBut when Leicestershire heard about the case, the club denied that any offer was on the table.\n\nCrown Court judges have the power to change a sentence within 56 days, including where \u201cfurther information relevant to the sentence has become available to the court\u201d.\n\nJudge Mansell used that power here, and sentenced Mr Bashir to go to jail immediately, having found \u201cthere is not a shred of evidence that you were ever chosen to play for Leicestershire\u201d.\n\nWe know this because the Judicial Office circulated these latest sentencing remarks to its press list. They haven\u2019t been published on its website, but you can download and read the remarks in full from ours.", "lang": "en"}
