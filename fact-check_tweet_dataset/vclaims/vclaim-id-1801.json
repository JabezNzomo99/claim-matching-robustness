Recovering all these costs will make only a small dent in the overall funding gap the NHS faces.\n\n\u2018Health tourism\u2019 usually refers to people who deliberately come to the UK to use NHS services they\u2019re not entitled to for free, and people who take advantage of the system by frequently visiting the UK to use GP services and get prescriptions. The exact definitions can vary.\n\nDavid Dimbleby is talking about estimates from a few years ago that suggested a range of \u00a3100-\u00a3300 million as the cost of deliberate health tourism, although the estimates are uncertain.\n\nAs Maajid Nawaz says, recovering all of these costs isn\u2019t going to plug the funding gap the NHS is facing.\n\nIn 2013, NHS England said it faced a funding gap of \u00a330 billion a year by the end of the decade. The government is putting in extra funds to cover some of that gap, although experts doubt there is enough money being committed to deal with it adequately.\n\nThe estimated costs of health tourism are about 0.3% of health spending on specific services, so savings in this area alone will make a relatively small difference.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a simple matter to recover all the money. David Dimbleby also referred to a report out this week from the Public Accounts Committee which expressed concern over the systems the government had in place..\n\nPart of the problem is identifying who isn\u2019t entitled to free care and needs to be charged. The committee reported that in 2012/13, the NHS charged 65% of the amounts it could have charged to people from outside Europe and 16% of what it could have charged from those within.", "lang": "en"}
