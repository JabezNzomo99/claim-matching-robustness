The single market is based on the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d of goods, services, people and capital: and members must respect all of these principles.\n\nFree movement of services means that services can establish themselves in any single market country and operate freely across all other member countries of the single market, without barriers. They also have to have unified rules overseeing them.", "lang": "en"}
