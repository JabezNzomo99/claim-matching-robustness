But because it does not recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the EU will not give visas to Crimeans who received Russian passports after annexation.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 09, 2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16778", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/eu-discriminate-crimean-visa-application/28164260.html", "vclaim": "Aleksey Meshkov, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, said in a press briefing on November 29, 2016 that the European Union (EU) is committing \u201cvisa genocide.\u201d He inferred that Crimeans with Russian passports must change their nationality to Ukrainian to get an EU visa.\n\nAfter annexation in 2014, Russian law allowed Crimeans to become Russian citizens. Though the law did not require Crimeans to give up their Ukrainian passports or citizenship, Crimeans faced economic and social hardship if they did not take Russian citizenship.\n\nCrimeans rejecting Russian citizenship also faced being deemed foreigners in their own land by Russian authorities. In Russia, passports too serve as a crucial identity document.\n\nThe annexation of Crimea came following Russian military intervention and a referendum that the U.N General Assembly, the United States, Ukraine, the European Parliament, numerous other governments, and many in the international press called illegal.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Meshkov's claim of \"visa genocide\" by the EU. And there is no EU demand that Crimeans \"change the citizenship that they had once accepted\" to get an EU visa.\n\nEU officials say there is no blanket ban on Crimeans coming into the EU. However, they say Crimeans who attempt to use post-annexation Russian passports issued in Crimea will not be granted an EU visa.\n\nIn a December 8, 2016 e-mail to Polygraph.info, European Union Ukrainian delegation spokesman David Stulik wrote, \u201cThe EU does not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol and thus does not recognize the Russian authorities illegally established in the annexed territory. Therefore, Russian passports issued by these authorities should not be used to apply for Schengen visas.\n\n\u201cRussian citizens who held this citizenship prior to the illegal annexation, and who resided in Crimea/Sevastopol, can continue to use their Russian passports when applying for Schengen visa. However, their Russian travel documents may not be recognized if issued after the annexation by the Russian Federal Migration Service offices in Crimea or in Sevastopol.\u201d\n\nThe EU will also not grant visas to people and businesses on a Crimea-related sanctions list.\n\nVirginie Battu-Henriksson, EU press officer for foreign affairs, wrote in a December 6, 2016 e-mail to Polygraph.info: \u201cA list of currently 152 persons are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze in respect of actions undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.\u201d\n\nThe EU says Crimeans can apply for an EU visa in Ukraine. As the EU will not accept a post-annexation Russian passport, Crimeans could present unexpired Ukrainian passports or one from other nationalities.\n\nExperts say Russia has made travel to the EU difficult for Crimeans by issuing them travel documents which the EU cannot recognize.\n\nSijbren de Jong, an analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, wrote in a December 5, 2016 e-mail to Polygraph.info: \u201cIf the Russians in their desire to make their illegal annexation look as legal as possible have somehow made it obvious that the passports were stamped in Crimea, this obviously renders the legality of the document problematic.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
