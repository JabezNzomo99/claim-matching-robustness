Proponents of this claim, however, offered little in terms of proof. In fact, the biggest piece of supporting \u201cevidence\u201d is a photograph of the 9-year-old boy standing next to the number 18. Other photographs supposedly showing the 9-year-old boy in more \u201cadult\u201d poses were also spread online:\n\nIt might come as a surprise to some, but standing next to a number does not automatically change your age to that number. In that same vein, wearing a shirt reading \u201cGucci\u201d or standing next to an adult woman are not activities exclusively reserved for 18-year-olds.\n\nThe above-displayed pictures all come from Quaden\u2019s previously public Instagram account. The photograph of the number 18 was one of several he posted after his friend Garlen\u2019s 18th birthday party. In one photograph, a birthday message for \u201cGarlen,\u201d not \u201cQuaden,\u201d is clearly visible.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is not the first time that Quaden Bayles has made the news. In 2015, he was in the media spotlight due to a previous bullying incident. Here\u2019s a video report from the Australian news station Studio 10 featuring then 4-year-old Quaden:\n\nWhile one may be able to argue that 9-year-old Quaden looks like he\u2019s 18, it\u2019s a bit more difficult to buy the argument that the 4-year-old in the above-displayed video is actually 13.\n\nYarraka Bayles, Quaden\u2019s mother, has posted dozens of pictures of him over the years to her social media accounts. In 2012, she shared a series of photographs that showed her infant son on the beach. Bayles commented on those photographs that her son was going on 15 months old.\n\nIf Quaden Bayles was truly 18 years old in February 2020, that would make him about 11 in the 2012 photographs. But that certainly isn\u2019t the case.", "lang": "en"}
