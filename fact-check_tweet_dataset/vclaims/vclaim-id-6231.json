But is Schneiderman right that some of those states have more opioid prescriptions than residents?\n\nEight states reported more opioid prescriptions than residents in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe states are Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Louisiana.\n\nAlabama recorded the highest rate, with 125 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people in the state. Even so, Alabama had a lower rate of opioid-related deaths than most other states, according to Centers for Disease Control data analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization.\n\nTwo other top prescribing states \u2014 West Virginia and Kentucky \u2014 had some of the highest rates of opioid related deaths.\n\nWest Virginia had the highest rate in the country, with 36 opioid deaths for every 100,000 residents. The state reported 111 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents.\n\nKentucky, ranking sixth with 21 deaths for every 100,000 residents, had 102 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2015.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s rate decreased in 2016 to 96 prescriptions for every 100 people. Kentucky\u2019s went down to 97 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people. Alabama remained highest with 121 prescriptions for every 100 people.\n\nNew York state had 42 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2016.\n\nThere were no counties in New York with more opioid prescriptions than residents, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nMontgomery County had the highest rate in the state with 82 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents in the county. The county had two opioid deaths for one of the lowest opioid-related death rates in the state.\n\nSchneiderman said some states hit hardest by the opioid crisis \"have more opioid prescriptions than residents.\"\n\nWest Virginia and Kentucky \u2014 two states with the highest rates of opioid deaths in the country \u2014 reported more opioid prescriptions than their respective population, according to CDC data. Six other states had more prescriptions than residents, too.", "lang": "en"}
