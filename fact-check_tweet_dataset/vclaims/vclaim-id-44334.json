But on Friday, the US government banned Nigerians from obtaining certain visas based on a similar allegation: not complying \u201cwith the established identity-management and information-sharing criteria\u201d.\n\nIn this fact-check, The ICIR takes a look at four claims made by Mohammed, which we have found to be false and misleading.\n\nDW\u2019s Tim Sebastian asked Mohammed about a 13-page report released last September by Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Callamard had talked about \u201ccountry-wide patterns of abuses, including the police and military\u2019s excessive use of lethal force and violation of international standards\u201d.\n\nReacting to findings of the report, the information minister, who confirmed reading it, said he \u201cwould have been much more impressed if examples are giving\u201d.\n\nBut, contrary to his suggestion, examples were in fact given by Callamard\u2014at least 12 of them. On page 7, the UN highlights allegations of human rights violations in the Middle Belt, including that:\n\u2022 On 4 December 2017, Nigeria\u2019s air force fired rockets at villages of Lawaru, Dong, Kodomti, Shafaron and Nzuruwei as a \u201cwarning\u201d to deter spiraling communal violence, causing dozens of deaths.\n\u2022 In 2018, 86 persons were killed in the villages of Palang, Tisan, Nghar, Ruku, Exlan in the State of Plateau, while Military officers were present and refused to engage with the attackers.\n\u2022 In October 2017, regarding an attack of Mkievowro in Plateau State, witnesses reported that \u201csoldiers present were bribed by Fulanis Herdsmen\u201d, and that attack resulted in the killing of some 29 people who sought safety in a school.\n\nThe report also mentioned instances of government crackdown against the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) as well as arbitrary killings of the members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nNo social media bill before the National Assembly\n\nSebastian asked the information about the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill, which he said carries draconian provisions and through which journalists could be imprisoned.\n\n\u201cAnd who is the author of that bill?\u201d Mohammed interjected. \u201cI am not even aware of that bill,\u201d he said when DW asked for his position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing an outcry internationally and you are the minister of information and you know nothing about it?\u201d Sebastian asked.\n\nMohammed then replied emphatically, \u201cThere is no such bill before the House. I can say that authoritatively. There is no such bill before the House.\u201d\n\nBut the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation and Other Related Matters Bill is the short title given to a bill introduced in November by Mohammed Sani Musa, the lawmaker representing the Niger East senatorial district.\n\nAlso known as the social media bill, it has already passed first and second reading and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters\u2014despite widespread condemnation.\n\nNo other govt. has convicted high-profile politicians\n\nAccording to Mohammed, \u201cNo government has ever succeeded in securing the conviction of high-profile politicians like this administration, especially those of them who belonged to the ruling party. We continue to fight corruption.\u201d\n\nBut the records show otherwise.\n\nIn 2009, the Lagos State High Court convicted Olabode George, former chairman of the Nigerian Ports Authority, of contract splitting and inflation, and sentenced him and four others to a 28-year jail term. The Court of Appeal upheld this verdict. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had indicted George when Nuhu Ribadu was chairman, but the prosecution started in 2008 with Farida Waziri heading the commission.\n\nGeorge was a chieftain of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which only ceased being in power at the federal level in 2015. At various times between 2001 and 2008, he was national vice-chairman in the southwest zone, deputy national chairman (South) and head of the national disciplinary committee.\n\nThough later pardoned by former President Goodluck Jonathan, late Diepreye Alamieyeseigha was convicted in 2007 for money laundering and not declaring his assets and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Until his impeachment in 2005, he was a two-time governor of Bayelsa State and member of the PDP.\n\nAnother member of the (then ruling) PDP, former Edo governor Lucky Igbinedion was fined in December by a Federal High Court in a N25 billion financial fraud case.\n\nOther high-profile corruption cases concluded in Nigeria, as compiled by TheCable, involved former IGP Mustapha Balogun and former assistant director in the federal civil service John Yusuf. The criminal prosecution of former Plateau governor Joshua Dariye and former Abia governor Orji Uzor Kalu, who were respectively convicted in 2018 and 2019, was also set in motion during the rule of PDP.\n\nThe information minister was asked about a report from Global Witness that said most Nigerians live in poverty despite a 50-year oil boom and an estimated $400 billion has gone missing from state coffers. He replied that, under the watch of the current administration, allegations of embezzlement cannot be substantiated.\n\n\u201cI can say categorically that between 2015 and today, nobody can talk about oil money missing,\u201d Mohammed said right before the DW interview ended.\n\nThere have, however, been such allegations under the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\nA 2016 report published by the Natural Resource Governance Institute stated that, within the first six months of Buhari\u2019s presidency, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) withheld over N824.7 billion from a total revenue of N1.24 trillion got from crude oil sales \u2014 \u201cabout 14 per cent more than the amount withheld by the corporation under the Goodluck Jonathan administration in the first half of 2015\u201d.\n\nIn 2018, Dino Melaye, then the lawmaker representing Kogi West senatorial district, alleged \u201cmonumental corruption\u201d at the NNPC involving an account unlawfully operated under a commercial bank and used to siphon millions of dollars.\n\nThe following year, the NNPC itself admitted there is still corruption in its operations and disclosed that it recovered $1.6 billion from companies \u201cwho were fleecing the NNPC subsidiary, the NPDC\u201d.\n\nIt is not only the information minister who made misleading statements during the interview, DW\u2019s Sebastian also blundered.\n\nBesides wrongly claiming Nigeria\u2019s hate speech bill was sponsored by the executive arm, he cited a report from the National Resources Institute which, \u201cbased on data from 2017, you have failed to regularly to disclose publicly the financial interests of government officials in the extractive sector, all the identities of beneficial owners in extractive companies despite making public commitments to do so\u201d.\n\nMohammed appeared to have misinterpreted the question as he instead talked about assets declaration by public officials as regulated by the Code of Conduct Bureau.\n\nBut then, the latest development is that this trend in the extractive sector has been reversed. Two weeks after promising publicly to do so last November, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) released a register of beneficial owners of oil assets and companies.\n\nData from its web portal, accessed on Friday by The ICIR, has names of 181 and 92 beneficial owners in the oil & gas and solid mineral industries respectively.", "lang": "en"}
