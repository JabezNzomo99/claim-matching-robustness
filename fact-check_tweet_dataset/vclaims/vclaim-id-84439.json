Former India pacer and skipper of Delhi Daredevils, Zaheer Khan, broke the news of his engagement with actress Sagarika Ghatge on his Twitter account yesterday. Many media houses covered this celebrity engagement. When Zee News posted a report of the engagement on their Facebook page, a barrage of angry comments followed.\n\nFollowers of Zee News\u2019s Facebook page branded the engagement as an act of \u2018Love Jihad\u2019. Love Jihad is the propaganda that BJP/RSS/VHP/Bajrang Dal have taken up in an aggressive manner, especially in the last 4-5 years, where in they repeatedly cast doubts whenever there\u2019s an inter-religious marriage, especially if the woman is Hindu and the man is Muslim. This has even led to inter-religious couples beings harassed by goons of various right-wing groups. The present Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister from BJP, Yogi Adityanath, is one of the loudest proponents of the Love Jihad propaganda.\n\nThe comments that followed and gained the most amount of likes are shameful and truly shows the regressive mentality of people who follow Zee News on Facebook.\n\nWhile a majority of the comments were of people from the Hindu community, there were a couple of prick comments from members of Muslim community as well. Here\u2019s one of them.\n\nAnd then there was this guy from Pakistan who was rejoicing.\n\nEven though just a handful, thankfully, there were some sane voices as well.\n\nAn act of love was branded as Love Jihad by many. With the sort of journalism Zee News continues to do, the mental make up of followers of Zee News is not likely to change anytime soon.", "lang": "en"}
