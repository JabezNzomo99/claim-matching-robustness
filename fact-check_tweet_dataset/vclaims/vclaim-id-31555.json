Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading in the polls heading into the Nevada Democratic caucuses, faced more than a few attacks from his rivals on the debate stage in Nevada. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg aimed one at the fiscal realities of Sanders\u2019 many plans.\n\n\"If you add up all his policies all together, they come to $50 trillion,\" Buttigieg said. \"He's only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States.\"\n\nEstimating the future costs of huge plans \u2014 such as Medicare for All \u2014 and the future revenues from new taxes \u2014 such as a wealth tax \u2014 is fraught with problems. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign sent us the basis for their numbers, and they are reasonable, if still subject to uncertainty and debate.\n\nMedicare for All is a good example of how estimates can vary. The Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, calculated that under Sanders\u2019 plan, overall health spending would rise by 13%. But a new study from policy researchers at Yale, University of Maryland and University of Florida estimated overall spending would fall by 13%. So, treat all projections with caution.\n\nBut there\u2019s an issue with Buttigieg\u2019s basic comparison of Sanders\u2019 proposals to the U.S. economy. He might have been using a rhetorical flourish to give a sense of scale, but his words muddled the math.\n\nThe flaw is that he used 10-year cost and revenue estimates for the Sanders plans and stacked them against one year of the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put the size of the U.S. economy at $21.4 trillion in 2019. Using Buttigieg\u2019s estimate of the revenue gap, his statement is mathematically correct, but it ignores the different time frames.\n\nFor a more apples-to-apples comparison (which would come with a host of other analytic issues), you would look at the cumulative value of the economy as projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next decade. The CBO\u2019s latest estimate amounts to nearly $300 trillion worth of GDP by 2030.\n\nIn that context, a budget hole of $25 trillion adds up to about 8% of the total.\n\nButtigieg said the budget hole in Sanders\u2019 plans \"is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States.\"\n\nButtigieg has compared proposed spending and revenues over a decade to one year\u2019s worth of GDP. By that measure, the math works.\n\nIf we use a 10-year window across the board, the revenue gap is about 8% of cumulative U.S. GDP.\n\nButtigieg may have taken rhetorical license, but that doesn\u2019t change that the statement is partially accurate and leaves out important details.
