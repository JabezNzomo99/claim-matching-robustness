The picture was obtained from the ohio sex offender website. The picture looks too gruesome to be real.\n\nThis photograph, which accompanied an entry in Ohio\u2019s Electronic Sex Offender Registration and Notification (eSORN) system, was real. The picture depicted a then 34-year-old man named Brian Peppers, who was listed in that registry due to a conviction for Gross Sexual Imposition in Lucas County, Ohio, in 1998.\n\nAlthough many viewers were of the opinion that the image was fake (possibly a picture of some type of mannequin or a digitally manipulated photograph), and that the entry in eSORN was an erroneous one (possible a mistake, an inside joke, or a hacking prank), we verified both the photo and the entry in several ways:\n\u2022 We contacted the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office, who told us: \u201cThis is an accurate photo of this offender.\u201d\n\u2022 The same Brian Peppers appeared on a list of registered sex offenders in Lucas County.\n\u2022 A record existed for <!\u2013court proceedings\u2013>court proceedings related to cases involving a person named Brian J. Peppers, charged with two counts of Gross Sexual Imposition.\n\u2022 We heard from several people who lived in or near Lucas County and said they\u2019d encountered Brian Peppers. One of them told us he had a relative who attended school with Brian Peppers and forwarded us some high school yearbook photos to document it: \n\n\n\nBrian Peppers\u2019 unusual physical appearance might have been due to a condition such as Apert Syndrome or Crouzon Syndrome, and he appeared unusually short in the eSORN mug shot because he was wheelchair-bound. The address in his eSORN entry indicated he was a resident of a nursing home, and his court docket reported that he was sentenced in 1998 to 30 days in jail with another 5 years probation for Gross Sexual Imposition, which is defined in Ohio as \u201cunwilling sexual contact with one who is not one\u2019s spouse.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also heard from several people who live in or near Lucas County and claim they\u2019ve encountered Brian Peppers in the past. One of them told us he had a relative who attended school with Peppers and forwarded us some high school yearbook photos to document it:\n\nBrian Peppers passed away in February 2012 at the age of 43.", "lang": "en"}
