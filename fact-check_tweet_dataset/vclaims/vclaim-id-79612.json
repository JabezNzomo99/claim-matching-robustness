One of the most high-profile countries in her portfolio was Afghanistan, a country that the United States had invaded in 2001 in order to oust the Taliban.\n\nIn the book, Clinton took some pride in Afghanistan\u2019s accomplishments on her watch.\n\n\"By the time I left State, the Afghans had made progress,\" Clinton wrote. \"Economic growth was up and opium production was down. Infant mortality declined by 22 percent. Under the Taliban only 900,000 boys and no girls had been enrolled in schools. By 2010, 7.1 million students were enrolled, and nearly 40 percent of them were girls.\"\n\nWe decided to check the accuracy of her statistics. We used several sources, including the Brookings Institution\u2019s periodic , which collects a wide range of data on the country, as well as information from the World Bank and the World Health Organization. (We won't be addressing whether she or the administration deserves credit for these improvements. The United States, as the major western military and diplomatic force in the country, clearly had an impact, but figuring out exactly how much is more art than science.)\n\nGiven the multitude of challenges it faced, ranging from war to poverty, Afghanistan certainly could have done worse in economic growth than it did between 2009 and 2013. Here\u2019s Afghanistan\u2019s annual percentage increase in gross domestic product since 2000, according to the .\n\nAccording to this data, the country\u2019s economic growth pattern has ranged widely, but it\u2019s certainly been growing rather than shrinking.\n\nStill, lest anyone assume that the 14-percent-plus growth in 2012 -- Clinton\u2019s last year as secretary of state -- is the new normal, the projected that Afghanistan would grow by a far slower 3.1 percent in 2013 (lower than any year since 2004) and 4.8 percent in 2014.\n\nThe found that metric tons of opium production has also undergone a zigzagging course in recent years. Whether it declined depends on what time frame you\u2019re looking at.\n\nThe data show that opium production surged in 2006, peaked in 2007, and began falling in 2008 -- before Clinton became secretary of state. During her tenure, it went down, then up, then down again. Its 2012 level was roughly on par with the amount in 2002 and 2003.\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s four years, opium production averaged 5,000 metric tons per year. That\u2019s slightly less than the average of the four years preceding her time as secretary of state.\n\nMortality rates for children under 5 has indeed declined, at least according to the . Here\u2019s the WHO\u2019s data on infant mortality rate -- deaths from birth to age 1 per 1000 live births:\n\nThe decline between 2005 and 2012 -- the closest we could get to a \"before and after\" for Clinton -- is a 14 percent decrease, a bit smaller than the 22 percent.\n\nThis is the statistic for which Clinton seems most on-target -- and the one about which Afghan officials can feel most proud, assuming the data are accurate. Here are the enrollment figures in millions, according to the :\n\nSo, for total enrollment, Clinton is exactly right. As for girls, the Brookings report says that \"virtually none\" of the students enrolled in 2001 were girls, a number that increased to roughly 40 percent by 2010. So she\u2019s right about girls\u2019 enrollment as well.\n\nClinton is probably three-quarters accurate, said Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings scholar who helped create the Afghanistan Index. \"The opium issue hasn\u2019t been encouraging, but the other trend lines are all essentially what she writes,\" he said.\n\nClinton said that over the course of her tenure as secretary of state, economic growth and school enrollment in Afghanistan was up, while opium production and infant mortality were down.\n\nHer claims about school enrollment, infant mortality, and economic growth are basically accurate, but the data on opium production suggests that her claim is somewhat exaggerated. We rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
