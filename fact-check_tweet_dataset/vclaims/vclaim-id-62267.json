In the video, the narrator can be heard bidding \u2018Goodbye\u2019 and saying \u2018Thank You\u2019 to all the customers of British Airways across the world. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen we searched for the video in the post, it wasn\u2019t found on any of the official social media accounts of \u2018British Airways\u2019. When we visited the website of \u2018British Airways\u2019 to check if it has issued any notice or press release regarding the shutting down of operations, we found nothing on the website.\n\nThe video in the post was uploaded by a YouTube channel \u2018Unite the Union Yout\u2019 on \u201813 June 2020\u2019 and it had the title \u2018Thank You and Goodbye from the staff of British Airways\u2019. The video had the description \u2018British Airways\u2019 has applied to dismiss all of its staff from 15 June 2020. As per a report of \u2018BBC\u2019 published on \u201813 June 2020\u2019, British Airways planned a major restructuring of the company and it meant up to 12,000 redundancies and changes to the terms and conditions of the remaining staff. As per the news report of \u2018The Sun\u2019 published on \u201827 June 2020\u2019, the Airlines had sacked 350 pilots and put 300 in \u2018pool\u2019 for rehire when needed. Not just British Airways, Dubai-based airlines \u2018Emirates\u2019 had also fired its 600 pilots and Germany\u2019s Lufthansa Group has announced up to 22,000 job cuts. So, the job cuts is not confined to British Airways, but a global phenomenon across Airlines around the world.\n\nIn fact, British Airways has recently uploaded a video on \u201820 June 2020\u2019 saying that the Airways is looking forward to welcoming customers back on board after the COVID-19 induced lockdowns.\n\nOn the British Airways website, the option to make bookings of flights is still available. Recently, the airlines even took delivery of two \u2018Boeing 787-10\u2019 aircrafts in a week. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that \u2018British Airlines\u2019 is not shutting down its operations.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018British Airways\u2019 hasn\u2019t said that it is shutting down its flight operations.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
