Therefore, the post advised women to be \u201ccareful in showing attitudes to any man\u2026\u201d.\n\nTo further frighten women, the post says that out of the 2.2 billion male population, one billion are married already; 130,000 are in prison; 70,000 are mentally ill. That means that the total number of men available for marriage or relationship is just one billion.\n\nThe author of the claim wasn\u2019t done yet. Out of this remaining one billion males, he/she says that \u201c50% are jobless; 3% are gay; 5% are catholic priests; 10% are your relatives and 35% are above 66 years old. So ladies, both the married and single, you have to rethink before treating any man like trash. For details visit UN Demography Report.\u201d\n\nThe report can also be found on some websites like mtkenyajournal.co.ke and on www.independent.ng.\n\nAccording to the annual population growth estimate from the United Nations (UN), in 2018, the world\u2019s population grew at a rate of 1.12%. Every five years since the 1970s, the growth rate has continued to fall. The world\u2019s population is expected to continue to grow but at a much slower pace. By 2030, the population is expected to exceed eight billion, which will be impacted significantly by nine specific countries: The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and the United States of America.\n\nIS THE RATIO OF WOMEN TO MEN TRULY HIGHER?\n\nAccording to the same 1st quarter Demography Report 2019 referred to by the writer, as of February 2019, the total population of the world exceeds 7.71 billion people.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation Sex ratio, in the human species, the ratio between males and females at birth is slightly biased towards the male sex. The natural \u201csex ratio\u201d at birth is often considered to be around 105. This means that at birth on average, there are 105 males for every 100 females.\n\nNature provides that the number of newborn males slightly outnumber newborn females because as they grow up, men are at a higher risk of dying than women, not only due to sex differentials in natural death rates, but also due to higher risk from external causes (accidents, injuries, violence, war causalities).\n\nAs for Nigeria, the UN population\u2019s latest available census and estimates (2016-2017), last updated on 7th February 2019 states that as of 21st March 2006, Nigeria\u2019s total population in millions was 140,431,790.\n\nThe population of male was about seventy-one million (71,345,488) and female was about sixty-nine million (69,086,302); the same trend can be seen in other countries like the USA for instance. As at 1st April 2010, male population was over one hundred and fifty-one million (151,781,326) while the female population was over one hundred and fifty-six million (156,964,212) and in China as of 1st November 2010, the population of male was six hundred and eighty-six million plus (686,852,572) while that of the female was six hundred and fifty-two million plus (652,872,280).\n\nThe Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, in its November 2016 Statistical Report on Women and Men in Nigeria, projected Nigeria\u2019s population at 183 million. Interestingly, it put women\u2019s population at 49.5% and men at 50.5%. Sex ratio dropped from 103 men in 2006 t0 102 men per 100 women in 2015.\n\nAll these reports and statistics lead to one conclusion: there are more men than women in the world.\n\nIn countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and Estonia, there are more women than men.\n\nIn trying to justify the claim, the post says that a huge number of men are married, in prison, mentally ill, jobless, gay, catholic priests etc.\n\nBut the same argument can equally be made for women. A large number of women are married, some are equally in prison, mentally ill and a growing number are lesbians.\n\nThe myth that there are more women than men cannot be supported by data. Our research shows that men are more in number!", "lang": "en"}
