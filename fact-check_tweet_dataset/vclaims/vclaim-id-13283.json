SWS will not make the list for you (the survey sponsor).\n\nBusiness World is an example of an SWS survey sponsor in the 2016 presidential election, Laroza said. The daily chose to publish some survey results, but other sponsors may opt to keep private results of commissioned surveys, he said.\n\nCosts vary because surveys are customized, Laroza said:\n\nGadon had earlier lambasted SWS and Pulse Asia, calling them \u201cdilawan\u201d -- a euphemism for Liberal Party allies -- and claiming they release \u201cflawed and fake\u201d results.\n\nABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group.
