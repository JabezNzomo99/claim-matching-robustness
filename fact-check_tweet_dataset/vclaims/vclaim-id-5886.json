This claim is false: the photos have been associated with other Black men shot by the police in posts on social media since 2016.\n\nThe posts show the words \u201cI\u2019m not judging\u2026 I\u2019m just showing you pictures of Jacob Blake\u201d posted on top of the collage of four pictures ( here , here ).\n\nBlake, 29, was shot several times in the back at point-blank range on Sunday, while three of his young sons \u2013 aged 3, 5 and 8 - were in the car watching it happen (here). The incident has sparked multiple nights of civil unrest and is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice and Wisconsin Justice Department (here).\n\nIt comes after a wave of anti-racism protests in the U.S. and all over the world, after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis ( here , here ).\n\nThe same collage of photos was shared widely on Facebook in 2016, long before the shooting of Jacob Blake (here).\n\nThe man in the photos is noticeably different to Blake, who is shown on the left here , in a picture posted on Twitter by Ben Crump, the lawyer representing Blake\u2019s family in the case.\n\nThe photos have been linked by some sources ( here , here ) to Pierre Loury, a 16 year-old Black boy who was shot in April 2016 in Chicago during a foot chase with police (here).\n\nThe Chicago Tribune\u2019s report of Loury\u2019s death shows photos of him posing with guns, taken from his Facebook page (here). This Facebook page has since been deleted and replaced with an account made in his memory, which does not show these photos (here). Loury\u2019s death sparked an anti-racism Black Lives Matter protest at the time (here).\n\nReuters recently fact-checked posts claiming Loury\u2019s shooting took place in 2020, here .\n\nFalse. This collage of photos does not show Jacob Blake.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
