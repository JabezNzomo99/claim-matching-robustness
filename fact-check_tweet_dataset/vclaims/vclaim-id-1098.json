His first orders were to defund and eliminate the police departments.\u201d It asks \u201cIs history repeating itself?\u201d amid calls from what it calls American socialist leaders to defund and abolish the current American policing system following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThis claim, of which examples can be found here and here , is false.\n\nHermann Goering was a key leader in the Nazi party and one of the primary architects of the Nazi police state in Germany (here) . He did become Minister of the Interior in Prussia, the country\u2019s largest and most influential state, in 1933 ( here ). It is false, however, that Goering\u2019s \u201cfirst orders were to defund and eliminate the police departments.\u201d\n\nTimothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University specializing in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and the Holocaust ( here ), told Reuters via email that the claims made in the posts are \u201cabsolutely baseless.\u201d\n\nAfter the Enabling Act of 1933 ( here ) ceded almost all political authority to Hitler, Snyder laid out four key actions that took place with regards to German policing. Firstly, the highly decentralized police departments were brought under a unified central command. Secondly, \u201cthe unified police forces were then placed under the same ultimate command as the SS\u201d (the acronym for the infamous \u201cSchutzstaffel\u201d paramilitary group, here ). Thirdly, led by Heinrich Himmler, the SS officers were brought into the police (comprised of the Ordnungspolizei (orpo) \"regular police\", the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo) \"security police\u201d which initially included the Gestapo, and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) \"security service\u201d). Finally, \u201cpolice were trained to understand crime as a matter of race,\u201d the result of which, Snyder explained, \u201cwas the creation of a police force that took active part in the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nCorresponding with Reuters via email, Peter Fritzsche, a professor of history at the University of Illinois ( here ) and author of \u201cHitler\u2019s First Hundred Days\u201d (here ), likewise debunked the claim.\n\nAccording to Fritzsche, when Goering became Interior Minister for Prussia, he gained executive power over the largest police force in the country. Very quickly, Goering demanded that the police act to protect the Nazi state, making it clear that the police would serve the nationalist forces over the opposing socialists or communists.\n\nThree weeks into his new role, he officially designated the paramilitary brownshirts (also known as the SA, an abbreviation for Sturmabteilung) in Prussia as auxiliaries of the Prussian police with the power to arrest. Fritzsche explained that the regular police and the SA initially worked together until late February 1933, when emergency legislation suspended the Constitution following the Reichstag Fire ( here ) and the SA began to act more independently.\n\nDuring this time, \u201cthe police were mobilized by the Nazis, not sidelined,\u201d Fritzsche said, and there was \u201cno defunding of police at all.\u201d\n\nFalse. Hermann Goring did not defund and eliminate police departments.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
