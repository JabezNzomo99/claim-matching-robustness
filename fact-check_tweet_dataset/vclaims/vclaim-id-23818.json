The photo was accompanied with text:\n\n\u0906\u0924\u0902\u0915\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0905\u092c\u0942 \u0938\u0932\u0947\u092e \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 \u0932\u0916\u0928\u090a \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0909\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0926\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094b\u0926 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u0902\u091a \u0938\u093e\u091d\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 (English: Wife of terrorist Abu Salem sharing stage with Congress candidate from Lucknow Pramod Krishnan).\n\nOn investigating the post it was found that the claim is misleading.\n\n1. As mentioned in the text, the lady shown in the image is the wife of Abu Salem. Many news reports claimed that she isn\u2019t Salem\u2019s wife. In her interviews and statements to media, Monica had said that although she had known Salem for several years, they had never got married.\n\n2. The name of Pramod Krishnam is mis-spelt as Pramod Krishnan.\n\n3. The image that is recently posted on the Facebook page of the user \u2018Sandeep Pandit\u2019 is an old picture and not takenduring the2019 Lok Sabhaelections. Whileapplying Google Reverse Image Search on the picture posted by the user, we found that the photo was used in an article published in Dailyhunt on Aug 29, 2017.\n\nIn the same Dailyhunt article, it is written that Pramod Krishnam had invited Monica Bedi for his campaigning during 2014 Lok Sabha elections when he was the Congress candidate from Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nVishvas News team verified whether Pramod Krishnam was one of the INC candidates for Uttar Pradesh General Elections 2014 and we got the following list:\n\nThis proves that the viral image is not that of the recent elections but that of 2014 elections.\n\nIn another report in Outlook website, we found a similar photo in which Monica Bedi is seen in the same dress sitting with a person on dais. The caption of the photo, which was a PTI image, says \u2013\u201dMonica Bedi campaigning for Congress candidate Acharya Pramod Krishnam.\u201d\n\nA video of 2014 Lok Sabha Elections was also found in Google search in which Monica Bedi can be seen campaigning for Pramod Krishnam at Sambhal (UP).\n\nWe also contacted Prabodh Krishnan over phone and he denied that Monica Bedia did not campaign with him in the recent Lok Sabha elections.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
