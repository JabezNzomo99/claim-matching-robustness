But that doesn\u2019t mean medical professionals are offering curbside service, nor should you believe this rumor about robbers pretending to in Colorado Springs.\n\n\"WARNING,\" reads a March 17 Facebook post. \"People are going door to door in Colorado Springs stating they are COVID testing so they can rob people!!!!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe called Lt. Jim Sokolik, a public information officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department, who told us they\u2019re not aware of any such scam.\n\nAs of about 6 p.m. on March 18, he said, neither the robbery nor property crime units had investigated any such incident or received any reports about people pretending to offer COVID-19 tests. The department\u2019s dispatch had not fielded any calls along those lines.\n\nOften, residents will call police if people come to their doors selling, say, magazines, Sokolik said \u2014 they want to make sure they\u2019re legitimate. But the department hasn\u2019t received even those kinds of reports lately.\n\nWhile online coronavirus scams abound, we found no news coverage of robbers like the Facebook post describes in Colorado.", "lang": "en"}
