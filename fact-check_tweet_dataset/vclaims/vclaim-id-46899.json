The original list consists of the following principles:\n\nAlthough the board on exhibit itself did not contain sources, the New Room provided on its website a separate document that did provide specific citations from various of Wesley\u2019s writings, corresponding with each of the 12 items on the list of principles.", "lang": "en"}
