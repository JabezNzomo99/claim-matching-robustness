Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be tapped by a major party in the United States to run for vice president.\n\nBut since Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named her as his running mate, questions \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 about her heritage have populated social media platforms.\n\nOne Facebook post that\u2019s gained traction is what\u2019s described as an image of Harris\u2019 birth certificate and the claim that her parents listed her as \"Caucasian\" on it.\n\n\"Sen K Harris listed as Caucasian on her birth certificate \u2026 by her parents \u2026\" the post says.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign about the Facebook post but did not immediately hear back. We don\u2019t know if the image of the birth certificate is authentic.\n\nBut either way, the document in the image doesn\u2019t list a race for Harris and it doesn\u2019t describe her as Caucasian.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a birth certificate not to list a child\u2019s race, though the race of the child\u2019s parents has been used to determine the race of the child \"for statistical purposes,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe document identifies Harris\u2019 mother as Shyamala Gopalan. In the field that says \"Color or Race of Mother,\" Caucasian is typed below. Gopalan was born in what is now called Chennai, India, and moved to California after college to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nUnder \"Color or Race of Father,\" it says \"Jamaican.\" Harris\u2019 father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica and also migrated to the United States to attend Berkeley.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously debunked a photo that questioned Harris\u2019 race and wrongly claimed the people in the image were her parents.", "lang": "en"}
