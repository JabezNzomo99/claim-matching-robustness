Why do you want to visit Kashmir and trouble us. Please go back.!\"\n\nHowever, if one hears the video, it becomes clear that the woman is recounting the incidents related to the clampdown in effect in Kashmir post abrogation of Article 370.\n\nWhile the woman is clearly audible in the Facebook posts, her voice has been muffled in several clips on Twitter. You can view the video below and access its archived version here.\n\nThe video was also tweeted by National Media Coordinator of the Congress party, Radhika Khera, on August 24, 2019.\n\nThe woman can be heard saying the following.\n\n\"We want to see them, they are small kids. Children studying in class tenth cannot step out of their homes. If they go out to look for each other, they are apprehended. My brother, a heart patient, stepped out to look for his kids. His family member had no idea of his whereabouts for ten days. We are troubled in every way.\"\n\nBOOM also came across several news reports which have covered the incident. Read about it here and here.\n\nRahul Gandhi, along with a delegate of opposition ministers, had reached Kashmir on August 24. The delegation was supposed to take stock of ground reality in the valley which has been cut-off from the rest of country since August 5, i.e. abrogation of Article 370.\n\nThe J&K administration, however, did not allow the delegates to enter the city and they were sent back to Delhi by an evening flight.\n\nThe viral video was shot on the same flight when a visibly upset woman walked up to Gandhi and narrated how lives have been affected in Kashmir after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35 A.\n\nHowever, the video of the woman is now being circulated on social media with a completely different narrative.", "lang": "en"}
