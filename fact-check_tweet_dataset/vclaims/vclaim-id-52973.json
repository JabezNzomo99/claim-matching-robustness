Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo is no stranger to fake statements and inanities attributed to her. The latest has continuously gone viral for almost a month.\n\nOn June 6, Facebook (FB) page Key Tv\u2019 posted a fake quote purportedly from Robredo saying, \u201cKaramihan sa nakaexperience ng teen pregnancy ay kabataan (Most of those who experience teen pregnancies are the youth).\u201d\n\nThe image used to create the fake graphic was from a March 2017 article by Rappler that used Robredo\u2019s photo speaking at a forum at San Beda College. A caption in Cebuano was added, saying sarcastically Mao pod baya ako nabantayan maam, ngano kahan na no (That is what I observed, Ma\u2019am, why is that so)?\n\nUsing a keyword search on the web yielded no record from official sources of Robredo ever making that comment. It was in September 2017 that Robredo made a statement on women and reproductive health, including teenage pregnancy for her office\u2019s program with the United Nations Population Fund called Babaenihan campaign.\n\nThe vice president took to her personal FB account to ask the public to report the fake quote card. \u201cPls help us report. Including those who shared,\u201d her post from June 8 read.\n\nA search through FB shows the fabricated statement has been circulating on the social media platform since October 2019.\n\nThe fake quote card was revived after several news reports in early June said the Commission on Population and Development (POPCOM) brought its family planning programs to households during community quarantine. On June 25, POPCOM released a statement saying the stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 crisis may contribute to about two million births in 2021 in the country.\n\nThe fake quote card now has over 1,800 shares. Key Tv\u2019 was created on April 28 and has 3,573 followers.", "lang": "en"}
