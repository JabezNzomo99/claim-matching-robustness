In 2015, Trump, then a presidential candidate, merely said that he had never gotten a flu shot.\n\nAll of the websites carry the item under the same inaccurate headline, \u201cTrump Warns Flu Shots Are The Greatest \u2018Scam\u2019 In Medical History.\u201d Facebook users recently flagged the inaccurate story on wisemindhealthybody.com, a website that posts items about health and beauty. But it dates to at least late January 2017, when Trump became president, and has appeared on Health Freedom Alliance, State of the Nation, a self-described alternative news website, and News Punch, which used to be called YourNewsWire, a website known for spreading misinformation.\n\nThe article starts by saying, \u201cThe flu shot is the greatest scam in medical history, created by Big Pharma to make money off vulnerable people and make them sick, warns President Donald Trump.\u201d It then points to an interview with Jim Norton and Gregg Hughes, who also goes by the nickname \u201cOpie,\u201d in which Trump admitted to never having gotten the vaccine and never getting sick with the flu.\n\nTrump, October 2015: No, I\u2019ve never had one, and thus far I\u2019ve never had the flu. I don\u2019t like the idea of injecting bad stuff into your body, which is basically what they do. And I guess this one has not been very effective to start off with, the last one. But I\u2019ve never had a flu shot and I\u2019ve never had the flu. \u2026 I have friends that religiously get the flu shot and then they get the flu, you know that helps my thinking because, I say \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d And then I\u2019ve seen a lot of reports that the last flu shot is virtually, totally ineffective.\n\nThe article is right that Trump called the 2014-2015 flu vaccine \u201c virtually, totally ineffective,\u201d and said that he doesn\u2019t like the idea of injecting what he called \u201cbad stuff\u201d into his body.\n\nHe never says, however, that it is a \u201cscam,\u201d a word that appears in quotation marks in the headline. Nor does Trump refer at all to \u201cBig Pharma,\u201d let alone blame pharmaceutical companies for intentionally making people sick in order to get money.\n\nThe CDC publishes information about the flu vaccine on its website, detailing how it works, the side effects and risks, as well as the ingredients of the vaccine. Two of the ingredients, according to the CDC, are thimerosal and formaldehyde, which were mentioned in the article posted on wisemindhealthybody.com.\n\nThimerosal is used in multidose vials as a preservative. It is not used in single-dose vials, where the vaccine contained in a single vial is only administered to one person. \u201cThere is no evidence that the small amounts of thimerosal in flu vaccines cause any harm, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site,\u201d the CDC says.\n\nFormaldehyde is used to \u201cinactivate viruses so that they don\u2019t cause disease,\u201d and is present in too small a concentration in vaccines to pose a safety concern, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u201cFormaldehyde has a long history of safe use in the manufacture of certain viral and bacterial vaccines,\u201d the FDA says.\n\nThe CDC has also published and referenced studies that say the vaccine reduces the risk of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among certain demographics. The CDC also notes that the risk of the more serious side effects from the vaccine is lower than the risk of developing severe consequences from contracting the virus.\n\nSo, despite Trump\u2019s choice to not get vaccinated, there is notable evidence that doing so is safe and can, in some cases, avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nCDC early estimates indicate that more than 900,000 people were hospitalized and over 80,000 died as a result of flu-related causes last season.\n\nUpdate, May 23: The website wisemindhealthybody.com has retracted the story \u201cTrump Warns Flu Shots Are The Greatest \u2018Scam\u2019 In Medical History,\u201d and posted an update that says the story was \u201cfound to be at odds with numerous scientific studies.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cTrump Warns Flu Shots Are The Greatest \u2018Scam\u2019 In Medical History.\u201d wisemindhealthybody.com.
