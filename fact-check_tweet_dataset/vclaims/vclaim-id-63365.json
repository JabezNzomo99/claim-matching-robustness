But, from the above information, we can gather that the picture has existed on the internet way before cyclone Amphan came into being and created havoc. The fact that the correct information isn\u2019t mentioned with the claim, means it was meant to mislead people.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
