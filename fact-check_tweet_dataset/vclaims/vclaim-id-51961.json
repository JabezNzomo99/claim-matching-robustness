Shortly after Kushner made this remark, the text on this government website was changed.\n\nWashington Post reporter Laura Bassett was one of the first to point out this discrepancy. On April 2, Bassett shared a video of Kushner\u2019s press conference along with a screenshot from the Strategic National Stockpile website:\n\nKushner said on April 2: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states stockpiles that they then use.\u201d\n\nBut the website read on April 2: \u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.\u201d\n\nShortly after Kushner\u2019s remarks, however, the text of this website was changed.\n\nOn April 3, the website read instead: \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.\u201d\n\nBassett, as well as several other journalists, posted screenshots showing how the website appeared before and after Kushner\u2019s remarks.\n\nThese screenshots genuinely show how this website appeared on April 2, before Kushner\u2019s remarks, and on April 3, after his remarks. These changes can also be seen on the Internet Archive. Here\u2019s a link to the Strategic National Stockpile page archived before Kushner\u2019s comments, and a link to the page that was archived after his comments.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which manages the stockpile, told CNN that these changes were in the works before Kushner\u2019s comments. The spokesperson would not comment on the record and gave this statement to CNN on condition of anonymity:", "lang": "en"}
