Advani has become the target for generating content against the BJP on social media. Now, a post is being shared on Facebook by many users claiming that Advani has said that he voted for Congress in the current elections. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: L.K. Advani after casting his vote: \u201cFor the first time in my 70+ years of voting life, I have voted for the Indian National Congress party.\u201d Fact: After casting his vote, L.K. Advani just left the booth without talking to the media. He just said \u201cJheet Hamari Hogi\u201d (victory will be ours) while leaving. Also, the picture in the post was taken during the 2009 elections. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the Advani\u2019s statements on Google, it is found that Advani did not speak with the media after casting his vote. According to the Indian Express article, L.K. Advani just said \u201cJheet Hamari Hogi\u201d (victory will be ours) before leaving the booth but did not make any additional comments.\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through Yandex Reverse Image search, a New18 article with a similar photo was found in the search results. According to that article, the photo was taken when Advani, along with his wife, voted in the 2009 elections at Shahpur in the Ahmedabad (West) Lok Sabha constituency. L.K. Advani wore a red jacket when he came to vote in 2019 elections but in the post, it can be seen that he is wearing a black jacket.\n\nFinally, L.K. Advani did not say that he voted for Congress after coming out of the polling booth.", "lang": "en"}
