The team went on to win the national championship and has been favored by the oddsmakers to win every game since then --- until now.\n\nIt is the longest such streak in modern college history, according to ESPN college football insider Phil Steele.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a claim -- one that caused PolitiFact Georgia to decide to temporarily step out of its comfort zone, truth-squading politicians and newsmakers, and check.\n\nSo when Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide roll into Sanford Stadium in Athens on Saturday, will they really be the underdog pick for the first time in 72 games? Or is that just more hype about the Bama-Bulldog rivalry?\n\nThese two teams first met back in 1895 and have battled it out 66 times over the years, with Alabama coming out on top times. Saturday\u2019s game marks the first time the Crimson Tide has visited Athens since 2008, when Georgia trailed 31-0 at halftime before losing 41-30.\n\nUnderdog status isn\u2019t a subject to be broached with university officials in Alabama, Georgia, or any state for that matter. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on whether a team is or isn\u2019t a betting favorite with Vegas oddsmakers, and betting in any form is against NCAA regulations. On Thursday, UGA was a 2.5-point at Hill\u2019s Nevada sportsbook.\n\nDavid Purdum, who covers the gambling industry as a staff writer for ESPN Chalk, told PolitiFact how he did his calculations.\n\nUsing one of several online college football preview magazines, Purdum looked at Alabama\u2019s record against the spread since 2010 (36-34-1).\n\nThe Tide\u2019s streak as predicted game winner started with the national championship game against Texas in 2009, so adding that to the 71 games since 2010 is how Purdum, who also freelances as a high school sports reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, came up with the count of a record 72 games in a row. He also cross-checked the info with ESPN\u2019s Stats & Information Department, he said.\n\nFor this Saturday\u2019s sellout game Between the Hedges in Athens, OddsShark.com had No. 8 ranked Georgia (4-0, 2-0 SEC) favored by a 2.5-point spread. And underdog status could still turn by kickoff on Saturday, depending on how the final betting goes.\n\nA win Saturday against No. 13 rated Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) would be a huge boost for the Bulldogs. A loss could mean another second-tier bowl season for University of Coach Mark Richt\u2019s program.\n\nBut atAt a press conference Tuesday, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt wasn\u2019t talking like Alabama is the game\u2019s underdog.\n\n\"They're as good or better than they've ever been, in my opinion,\" he said of Alabama.\n\nThe Crimson Tide rarely finds itself in a must-win situation this early in the season. But a second straight conference loss would be devastating for the team's playoff chances, while a win would put Alabama right back on track with home dates in three of the team's next four games.\n\nESPN and others are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide will likely have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. That\u2019s based on the fact that for 72 games in a row Alabama was favored in betting to win. And that wasn\u2019t the case this week as bets started being placed for the game Saturday at Sanford Stadium.\n\nBut since betting goes on down to the wire, there\u2019s at least a possibility that the underdog status could change up to game time. That\u2019s why they call it gambling.\n\nAnd given the unknown, we have to hedge a bit ourselves at this stage of the game.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
