It originated on a satire website.\n\nThe screen grab of another Facebook post shows a link to an article from the website Underground Science. That article, posted Dec. 20, 2016, alleges that researchers at North Carolina State University produced the \u201cfirst fully living dinosaur embryo in millions of years\u201d using the DNA of chickens, which are modern relatives of the T. rex.\n\n\u201cThe living embryo is not a 100 percent dinosaur, but instead a genetically modified hybrid between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a chicken,\u201d it claims, citing a supposed molecular biologist employed at the university.\n\nBut the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences denied the article\u2019s claim in an April 2016 press release. (RELATED: Did Egyptian Scientists Find That Vaccines Cause Autism?)\n\n\u201cA recent \u2018news story\u2019 falsely reports an account of the recreation of a Tyrannosaurus rex embryo in the Paleontology Research Lab of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThis story is a complete fabrication and the personnel cited in the report are, as far as we can tell, made up.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the museum\u2019s statement is a NC State University News article discussing the limitations of recovering dinosaur DNA from fossils:\n\nScientists have proposed that DNA has a pretty short shelf-life, most saying that it is unlikely to persist as long as a million years, and surely not more than five or six million years at most. That sort of leaves out the possibility that we will ever obtain it from dinosaurs that last walked the earth over 65 million years ago!\n\nThe article appears to have originated on World News Daily Report, a parody news website that describes its content as \u201csatirical\u201d and \u201cfictional.\u201d While World News Daily Report clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, Underground Science and other websites have portrayed it as real news.", "lang": "en"}
