No, that's not true: the article comes from a liberal satire website, and Clinton has neither publicly stated those exact words nor given any recent interview with the CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Bustatroll on December 4, 2019, titled \"Hillary:'If Trump Is Removed, I Deserve To Be Given The Presidency'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nIn the satirical story, Clinton is quoted this way:\n\nWell let's look at this situation. The man who did not get the popular vote of the American public, who stole a victory through the electoral college, who tried to convince the country to throw me in jail without charges, and who is clearly unqualified for the job is accused of criminal offenses in violation of his oath of office. What are my thoughts? My thoughts are that I warned everyone this would happen and that my last three years have been hell because of his accusations. A bomb was mailed to me, for god's sake. He turned my life upside down. So my main thought is that, if Trump is removed, I deserve to be given his seat. I've earned it and the people wanted me.\n\nAlthough the particular quotes from Clinton are invented by the site, they are not far off from what Clinton has actually said. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning in late September 2019, the former Secretary of State and First Lady said about Trump:\n\nLater in the interview she called for Trump's impeachment.\n\nBustatroll is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
