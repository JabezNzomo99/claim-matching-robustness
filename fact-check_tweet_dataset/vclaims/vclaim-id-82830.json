It found that the collapse of the housing market and the Great Recession resulted in \u201cextremely high levels of unemployment, a dramatic reduction in the homeownership rate and a massive loss of wealth for African American families.\u201d\n\nThe loss of jobs and homes resulted in the African American community losing more than half of its net worth, according to the report. The report uses Pew Research Center\u2019s findings from 2011 of the Great Recession\u2019s impact by race and ethnicity.\n\nThe loss of wealth other than home equity was modest, regardless of the race or ethnicity \u2014 meaning almost all the decline in wealth experienced during the Great Recession came out of housing, said Rakesh Kochhar, associate research director at Pew Research Center. White and Asian households were much more likely than Hispanic and black households to own financial assets.\n\nIn 2014, Pew researchers analyzed 2007-2013 data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, which has a smaller sample size than the Census data. The trend was consistent with the Census data: From 2007 to 2013, Americans\u2019 median net worth decreased by 40 percent and African Americans\u2019 median net worth decreased by 43 percent, using 2013 dollars.\n\nNormally, we would advise politicians against relying on economics data from three to five years ago. But after extensive digging we found that 2013 is as recent as it gets for national wealth breakdowns by race. Updated Federal Reserve figures are expected by the end of 2016, so we will look out for the new figures and update accordingly.\n\n\u201cYou would have to have a situation where people were able to somehow pay off prior home-related debts, home mortgage debts and get back into a home for you to have some sort of dramatic effect associated with homeownership,\u201d said William \u201cSandy\u201d Darity, Jr., director of Duke University\u2019s Samuel Dubois Cook Center on Social Equity, currently doing its own research into wealth in communities of color. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe that blacks or Latinos have become heavy buyers of stocks and bonds. I\u2019m not sure where this growth in wealth would come from [after 2013].\u201d\n\nThere may be modest increases in wealth due to the appreciation of home values since 2013, said James Carr, housing finance expert who did the research for National Association of Real Estate Brokers. But black homeownership rate and labor participation rate haven\u2019t stabilized or recovered enough to indicate a significant improvement, Carr said.\n\nThe homeownership rate in fourth quarter of 2015 (41.9 percent) for African Americans was lower than it was in fourth quarter of 2007 (47.7 percent). And markets that have seen the most recovery \u2014 in states like Arizona, California and Florida \u2014 don\u2019t have high concentrations of black homeowners.\n\nCensus data from 2005-2011 and Federal Reserve data from 2007-2013 support Sanders\u2019s assertion about such staggering loss in wealth (43 to 53 percent loss, depending on the time frame and data used) among African Americans. Most of the loss in wealth was due to people losing owned homes \u2014 the major source of wealth in the black and Hispanic communities.\n\nThese data are more outdated than we generally require at The Fact Checker, especially since many communities have started seeing wealth recover since the crash. But there were no comparable, post-2013 national data to update the figure. Moreover, housing finance experts we consulted said they don\u2019t anticipate black wealth to have increased significantly since 2013. We will look for the updated Federal Reserve data, anticipated by the end of this year, to see if politicians should update their talking points on this matter. Until then, Sanders earns the coveted Geppetto Checkmark.", "lang": "en"}
