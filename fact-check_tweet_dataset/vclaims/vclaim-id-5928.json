Goldfinger\u2019s secretary, Jill Masterson, tries to foil the plot by betraying her criminal boss, but he kills her in thematic style by painting her entire body gold:\n\nAs James Bond explains after he find Masterson\u2019s body, covering a person with paint will cause death because the body \u201cbreathes\u201d through the skin. He then goes on to state that professional dancers know to leave a small patch of unpainted skin at the base of the spine to prevent their falling victim to asphyxiation.\n\nAlthough it was still widely believed at the time Goldfinger was made that we \u201cbreathe\u201d through our skin and that closing off all the pores in one\u2019s body would result in a quick death, we now know this to be false. (Another commonly accepted part of this concept was the notion that leaving a small portion of the body unpainted was sufficient to ward off disaster.)\n\nAs long as a person can breathe through his mouth and/or nose, he will not die of asphyxiation, no matter how much of his body is covered with paint (or any other substance). This isn\u2019t to say that painting yourself isn\u2019t unsafe, all your pores prevents you from perspiring and could eventually cause you to die from overheating, and toxic substances found in paint could contribute to your demise if you stay in a painted state too long.\n\nWhen Shirley Eaton, the actress who portrayed Auric Goldfinger\u2019s doomed secretary, was covered with paint for the \u201cgold corpse\u201d scene, the studio had a few doctors standing by to ensure that she was not overcome by the effects of the paint. She wasn\u2019t completely naked in this scene (she wore a and, bowing to the beliefs of the day, a square of skin on her abdomen was left unpainted as a precaution (to allow her skin to \u201cbreathe\u201d).\n\nEaton did not die or even become ill as a result of her Goldfinger experience: she made a few more films before retiring from acting to spend more time with her family.\n\nOn the surface this sounds like a pretty silly story if the producers of a movie decided to film a murder scene by shooting one of the actors. The sight of the dead, gold-painted girl in Goldfinger is one of filmdom\u2019s most memorable images, however, and in 1964 Shirley Eaton\u2019s prone, golden body was displayed (including the cover of Life magazine). People believed that being covered in paint would cause death, this woman had obviously been painted, and she seemingly disappeared from the public eye afterwards,\n\nIncidentally, Goldfinger was not the first film to feature a character\u2019s being killed through being covered with gold paint. That honor belongs to the 1946 Boris Karloff movie Bedlam.", "lang": "en"}
