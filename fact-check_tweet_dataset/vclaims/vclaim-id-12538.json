The coin is dedicated to last June\u2019s meeting in Helsinki between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"On one side of the coin are the leaders of the countries against the backdrop of flags, on the other - the Helsinki Cathedral, next to which the meeting was held,\" the article stated, describing the coin. It correctly noted that the Russian text contained several errors.\n\nThere are three errors in the Russian text on the reverse side of the coin. First, the phrase Helsinki Summit, which would be transliterated \u201cKhelsinkskii Sammit,\u201d is rendered in Russian as \u201cKhelpinnskii Sammit.\u201c In addition, the Russian phrase meaning \u201ca new era\u201d uses incorrect Russian grammar: the correct phrase would be transliterated as \u201cnovaya era,\u201d using the feminine adjective, but it was written as \u201cnovoye era,\u201d using the neuter gender. Finally, the phrase \u201cdiplomatic history\u201d is written \u201cddiplomaticheskaya istoriya\u201d -- with a double D.\n\nRussian speakers on social media quickly spotted the errors when the coin first went on sale the day before.\n\nOn November 6, the executive director of the White House Gift Shop, Anthony Giannini, issued a communique about the mistaken translation on the product\u2019s web page.\n\n\u201cSales of this 5,000 issue Helsinki commemorative are nearly crashing our servers at the gift shop because of high global perceived collection value consequent of the translations,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cMy Russian language ability harkens to the Reagan and Gorbachev era, and I am solely responsible for the translation. I apologize for the awkwardness of the translation.\u201d\n\nThe statement also says that the coin will have historical value because no more of this type will be made after the initial 5,000 run with the translation mistakes, indicating the gift shop has no intention of withdrawing the coin because of the errors.\n\nThe gift shop appears online with a \u201c.com\u201d address, but the \u201cabout\u201d section states it was established by President Harry S. Truman more than 70-years-ago. We asked what relationship it now has with the White House, whether is a government-financed entity. For several days, the gift shop did not answer our inquiry.\n\nWhen Executive Director and CEO Giannini provided his own e-mail address online, he quickly responded to another Polygraph.info query with a brief statement explaining the ownership of the White House Gift Shop.\n\n\"The White House Gift Shop\u00ae is now a private entity and recognized by over 5 million people worldwide as the 'only original official' White House Gift Shop in history consequent of its seamless rights of succession and now its exclusive trademarks,\" wrote Giannini. \"In fact, my entities own exclusive rights to the names the White House Gift Shop\u00ae and the White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946\u00ae.\"\n\nPolygraph.info is not the first news organization to face what Talking Points Memo called a \u201cfascinating mystery,\u201d in regards to the gift shop's official status. The TPM reporter wrote in May the he called the number on the Web site and asked similar questions.\n\n\u201cThe answer I got wasn\u2019t totally clear. I was told that it used to be housed within the actual White House but that now it was only a website,\u201d wrote Josh Marshall.", "lang": "en"}
