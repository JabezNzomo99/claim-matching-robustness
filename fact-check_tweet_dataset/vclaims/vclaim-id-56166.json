In the video, we can see several policemen wearing a mask and a few fruit vendors.\n\nThe video has been shared with the following text in Hindi: \u201cCheck all fruit and vegetable vendors properly. Since 2-3 days around 6-7 am, two vendors were seen in Mahalaxmi Nagar. Since they were coming early in the morning, people had their doubt. When some people asked their names, they went mum. In a matter of a few minutes, they said their name is Shiva, Mukesh, Dinesh and said they didn\u2019t have identity cards on them. The vendors were stopped. When the police came to enquire they found out the boys were Muslim. That means, there is something really wrong. Please be alert.\u201d\n\nA Twitter user posted the video with a different Hindi text but the same anti-Muslim narrative. He claimed that the viral video is from Indore (archive link).\n\nAlt News watched the video carefully and did a keyframe analysis. We found:\n\n1. At the 11-second mark, a man can be heard giving directions to their current location. The instruction mentioned Mahalaxmi Nagar and Partabh Medical as landmarks. We performed a keyword search on Google and found that a medical store with the same name is located in Mahalaxmi Nagar, Indore. Just Dial lists the full address as G-1 577 /78 Sai Shraddha Apartment, Balaji Height Road, Mahalaxmi Nagar, Indore \u2013 452010, Near Water Tank.\n\n2. At the 27-second mark, we can see a yellow jeep with the words \u2018Nagar Nigam Indore (translated from \u0928\u0917\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0917\u092e \u0907\u0902\u0926\u094c\u0930)\u2019\n\nAlt News spoke with Vivek Sharma, inspector general (IG), Indore Police. He stated that the video is at least a week old and the claims made on social media are false. IG Sharma connected Alt News with the concerned officer Yusuf Qureshi, superintendent of police (SP), East Indore.\n\nSP Qureshi and his team traced the two fruit vendors in the viral video (highlighted above). According to the police investigation, vendors Rohit and Ravi are employed by Girraj Gupta, who owns a fruit shop. SP Qureshi informed, \u201cGirraj Gupta is 40 years old and stays at Tapeshwari Bagh, MR Ten Road.\u201d\n\nThe distance between Tapeshwari Bagh and Partabh Medical, Mahalaxmi Nagar is less than two kilometres away according to Google Maps.\n\nSP Qureshi added, \u201cDue to the lockdown, Gupta wasn\u2019t able to sell the remaining stock of fruits. Rohit and Ravi stepped out to sell the remaining fruits in the colony. That\u2019s when the police and the municipal authorities seized the handcart.\u201d\n\nThe officer shared a video with us which was taken on April 13 by Indore police. It captures their conversation with Gupta. At 1:14 mark, Gupta confirms both Rohit and Ravi hail from the Hindu community.\n\nAlt News also spoke with Gupta, who said, \u201cMy carts, fruits and weighing scale were ceased. That\u2019s a loss of up to 1.5 lakhs rupees.\u201d He also confirmed that the men standing behind the cart are Rohit and Ravi.\n\nTherefore, the claim associated with the viral video is false. Indore police have not arrested the fruit vendors. However, their cart has been seized by the municipal authorities. Alt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the religious affiliation of the vendors seen in the video.\n\nSince the last few weeks, several misleading social media posts have been circulated to target Muslim vendors with the claim that they are intentionally spreading coronavirus. Such misinformation causes panic that ultimately manifests in communal violence. On April 13, Alt News verified a video where a man can be seen assaulting a vegetable vendor after he revealed that his name is Mohammad Saleem.", "lang": "en"}
