Her feast day is May 14.\n\nThe Gloria TV article provided no sources to support the claim, but the rumor was picked up by several popular Catholic websites and even the Diocese of Lansing, Michigan. When we searched for more information about St. Corona, however, we found the claim of a \u201cpatron saint of plagues\u201d is a modern invention that only started to circulate in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCatherine M. Mooney, president of the Hagiography Society, and associate professor of Church History, Boston College, School of Theology and Ministry, confirmed to us via email that St. Corona was not known as the patron saint of pandemics.\n\nThere are literally many thousands of saints. Along with those who actually existed, there are many more that have simply appeared in legends over the centuries, often made up out of whole cloth. Online web sites on saints are notorious for repeating legendary information. The short answer to your question: Saint Corona has not been known as the patron saint of pandemics, at least not until someone (but who?) recently named her thus. That moniker must have been given her because her name \u201cCorona,\u201d which means crown, could connect her to the coronavirus.\n\nWe found several mentions of St. Corona in articles published over the years, but it wasn\u2019t until March 2020 that she became connected to pandemics, plagues, or contagious disease.\n\nIn 2008, for instance, St. Patrick Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., mentioned St. Corona in its \u201cSaint of the Day\u201d column. This article did not identify St. Corona as the \u201cpatron saint of plagues.\u201d Rather, it noted St. Corona was a martyr who was killed along with her husband, St. Victor, circa A.D. 176.\n\nSt. Patrick Catholic Church also noted that accounts of Corona\u2019s death may not be reliable: \u201cDied c. 176. Saint Victor and his wife Corona were martyred, probably in Syria. The details of their martyrdom as compiled in their Acta are untrustworthy (Benedictines). In art, Victor and Corona are portrayed as they are ripped asunder between trees (Roeder).\u201d\n\nThe website Catholic.org provides a similar account of St. Corona\u2019s death, writing that she and her husband were put to death during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but that accounts of their deaths are considered unreliable. This website also noted that Corona was often invoked \u201cin connection with superstitions involving money, such as gambling or treasure hunting,\u201d not pandemics or plagues.\n\nA 1929 edition of the Battle Creek Enquirer, a newspaper from Battle Creek, Michigan, identified St. Corona as the \u201cwife of an Syrian Christian\u201d who was put to death because of her faith. This clipping made no mention of her being the patron saint of plagues:\n\nAntonio Borrelli, former director of Catholic Action in the Diocese of Naples, wrote a fuller account of St. Corona in 2006. According to Borrelli, she was actually the wife of one of Victor\u2019s comrades. When Victor was being tortured for his faith, Corona declared that she, too, was a Christian, and was martyred beside him:\n\nAccording to the \u201cIllustrious Certamen\u201d, a text written by a deacon of the Church of Antioch in the 4th century, Vittore was a Christian soldier from Cilicia. During the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, he was reported to the prefect Sebastiano and subjected to torture. While he was suffering, while remaining serene in faith, the wife of one of his comrade in arms, whose name was Corona (Latin equivalent of the name Stefania), who was not yet sixteen years old, declared that she too was Christian and encouraged her . She was arrested and subjected to a brief interrogation, after which she was tied by the feet to the tops, folded on the ground, of two palm trees, and quartered alive. Vittore, however, was beheaded.\n\nBorrelli notes that accounts of Corona\u2019s death aren\u2019t entirely reliable because details (such as the date and location) vary depending on the source. But nowhere in Borrelli\u2019s article is Corona identified as the patron saint of plagues or pandemics.\n\nIn one depiction of Corona\u2019s death, she is seen tied between two trees while Victor is beheaded in front of her:\n\nWe found several articles about St. Corona prior to March 2020, but none of these articles identified her as the patron saint of plagues. It appears that is a modern title that was unofficially bestowed upon St. Corona after the coronavirus spread around the globe.\n\nCandida Moss, Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology at the University of Birmingham, also disputed this rumor on Twitter. Moss wrote that while St. Corona really existed, she is not the patron saint of infectious disease.\n\nWhile St. Corona was not known as a patron saint of pandemics, Mooney noted that there have been other saints associated with plagues and infectious diseases, including St. Sebastian, St. Roch, St. Nicholas of Tolentino, and St. Rosalia.\n\nMooney also informed us that there isn\u2019t really an official process for a saint to become a \u201cpatron\u201d of one particular subject:\n\nIn short: A saint named Corona, who was martyred sometime in the 170s, truly existed, but accounts about her death aren\u2019t entirely reliable. While Corona has been invoked in connection to \u201csuperstitions involving money, such as gambling or treasure hunting,\u201d her connection to infectious disease did not start until March 2020 when a virus that shared her name started spreading around the globe.\n\nIn other words, St. Corona is not the officially designated patron saint of plagues.", "lang": "en"}
