The seats, the width of the aisle, the curtains on the windows and the overhead cabins looked much more like that of a bus than any plane. On splitting the video and running a reverse search on its keyframes, we came across several of the same videos which all claimed to be from a bus accident involving a company called Faisal Movers, according to the captions of the YouTube videos. All the videos seemed to have been uploaded between 2 and 3 October 2019 and said that the accident had occurred on the motorway between Lahore and Islamabad. On watching one of these videos, we found that the footage originally carried the date and time of the recording, which was actually whitened out in the viral version of the video. According to the timestamp, the video had been recorded on 28 September 2019 and the time of the accident was approximately 10:24 am. Home Min Amit Shah Hid Handcuffs Under Handkerchief?
