The number of law enforcement officers killed on the job had increased 8 percent in July 2016 compared with July 2015. The total number of officers killed in shootings, however, had increased 78 percent. After our fact-check, his campaign reached out to clarify how they measured the data \u2014 and we pointed out the weaknesses in their calculation.\n\nStatistically, it\u2019s safer to be a police officer today than it was in the 1970s. The number of police fatalities peaked in 1974 with 280 deaths, following nationwide riots in the late 1960s and at the beginning of the crack epidemic. It spiked to 241 officer deaths in 2001, because of the 71 officers who died on 9/11. Experts who track law enforcement fatalities say improvements in training and lifesaving equipment and technology have lowered the overall number of police officers dying in a given year.\n\nThe number of officer deaths ebbs and flows by year, but 2016 was notable. The number of officers shot and killed in 2016 was 64, out of 135 total fatalities. That\u2019s an increase of 56 percent from 2015, largely spurred by deadly ambush attacks by gunfire. (We previously explored the facts underlying ambush-style killings and traffic-related deaths of police officers.) [Note: In an earlier version, we incorrectly identified the number of officers shot and killed.]\n\nTwo high-profile ambushes unfolded in Dallas and Baton Rouge, both in July 2016. A sniper, specifically looking to kill white officers, killed five in Dallas. That was the deadliest day for police officers since 9/11. Ten days later, a gunman opened fire on police officers in Baton Rouge and killed three.\n\nThe surge in gunfire deaths in 2016 was the largest on record, and the percentage of officers killed by gunfire in 2016 was the highest in more than two decades, The Post found.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t plan for, \u2018When is someone going to surprisingly attack me?\u2019 but you can train for, \u2018How can I position and conduct myself in a way that, if someone were to attack me, I can survive it?\u2019\u201d Groeninger said.\n\nTrump\u2019s grim statistic seemed too remarkable to be correct: The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty in 2016 increased by 56 percent from the year before.\n\nBut the figure is solid. Last year was a notable year in police deaths, largely because of the number of police officers who were fatally shot in ambush attacks across the country. In 2016, 21 officers were killed in ambush attacks \u2014 more than double the average from the previous decade. The number of officer deaths by gunfire in 2016 was the largest on record.\n\nTrump previously used officer fatality statistics incorrectly, and we wrote about it. Now, he\u2019s corrected the statistic, using the most recent facts available to describe increases in officer deaths in 2016. We notice when politicians correct their talking point and make an effort to get it right. We commend Trump\u2019s staff for describing this figure accurately in the president\u2019s prepared remarks, and award Trump the rare Geppetto Checkmark.", "lang": "en"}
