The following tweet by a Twitter account called \u2018Straight Talk India\u2019 has been retweeted over 1300 times.\n\nAmong those who have shared it is Madhu Kishwar with a bitter, inciteful tone \u2013 \u201cIf your blood doesn\u2019t boil, you are no Indian. Majority paying price for pampering minorities,\u201d . Her post has been retweeted more than 900 times in the last four hours.\n\nKishwar was recently pulled up by the Jammu and Kashmir police for circulating the fake news that the DG of J&K suspended the SP who killed Burhan Wani in an encounter.\n\nMultiple pages and individual users have shared the video on Facebook in the last 24 hours.\n\nMembers of a newly emerging sect of Christianity in the north-eastern state of Mizoram had, in fact, burned a Hindu idol and set ablaze the tricolour, but the incident took place in 2017.\n\nFirstpost had reported the incident last year on September 30. \u201cThis incident comes to light at a time when the rise of Hindu nationalism has caused a number of incidents of communal violence across India,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe incident occurred on September 21, 2017, at Lunglei district in Mizoram. A man in a white robe, apparently a self-styled preacher of Christianity, can be seen in the video amidst men in traditional Mizo attire. The group can be heard chanting slogans against Hinduism and India. All the seven men were identified by the state police.\n\nAs reported by Firstpost, this sect of Christianity which has no name attributed to itself wants independence from the country.\n\nAlthough Mizoram is a Christian majority state, this new sect is seen as extremist and a threat to peace by the community which accounts for 87% of the population.\n\nThe Catholic Church had strongly condemned the act, terming it \u201cfundamentalism\u201d. In a press release dated October 6, 2017, the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of India (CBCI) said, \u201cThose who have committed these acts cannot and should not profess to be Christians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are shocked that anyone could show disrespect to members of another religion in the name of Christ\u201d.\n\nThis condemnable act was rightly denounced by Christian leaders and the ones involved were identified, yet the incident is being propagated as a recent affair. Old videos and images of this nature are often recirculated with the objective of keeping the communal pot simmering and citizens distracted from core issues.", "lang": "en"}
