While most of those rumors proved to be false, that wasn\u2019t the case in December 2019, when the 46-minute satirical comedy \u201cThe First Temptation of Christ\u201d aired on Netflix.\n\n\u201cThe First Temptation of Christ\u201d was created by the Brazilian comedy group Porta dos Fundos. The movie stirred up considerable controversy because it heavily implied that Jesus was homosexual or had had a homosexual relationship.\n\nFor instance, at one point Jesus walks into his surprise 30th birthday party and has to explain why he has been wandering the desert with a male companion named Orlando. The tagline for the movie is: \u201cJesus, who\u2019s hitting the big 3-0, brings a surprise guest to meet the family.\u201d In another part, Orlando sings a song that is ripe with sexual innuendo.\n\nThe movie suggests that Jesus has a gay relationship with Orlando. But Jesus tries to deny it by saying that he and Orlando are just friends. Orlando later sings a song to the tune of Jingle Bell on an electronic keyboard God gave to Jesus. He ends the song saying that he saw the \u201csize\u201d of Jesus\u2019 \u201chuge power\u201d in the \u201cheat of the desert,\u201d implying that they were engaging in gay sex in the desert.\n\nThe movie also depicts the virgin Mary as a marijuana smoker.\n\n\u201cThe First Temptation of Christ\u201d generated plenty of online anger. A petition on Change.org asking Netflix to remove the movie from its catalog has already garnered more than 1.5 million signatures. Netflix has not responded to the controversy, but Porta dos Fundos did release a statement:\n\nA trailer for \u201cThe First Temptation of Christ\u201d can be seen below:", "lang": "en"}
