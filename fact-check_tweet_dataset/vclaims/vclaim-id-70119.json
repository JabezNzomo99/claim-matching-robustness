Instead of articles about the couple\u2019s relationship, the posts actually link to US voter registration information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s official...Kim Kardashian finally decided to divorce Kanye West,\u201d read the social media posts featuring photos of the celebrity couple.\n\nThe posts originated with a tweet by Ashlee Marie Preston, who is the first transgender candidate for California state legislature. Preston hyped the possible \u201cKimye\u201d divorce, but the link in the tweet takes people to vote.gov, an official website of the US government, rather than a story on the reality television star and her rapper husband.\n\nA day later, hundreds of Facebook posts and tweets with the same link were shared.\n\nThe trend also spawned a viral post with promised news about the breakup of singer Ariana Grande and comedian Pete Davidson and one claiming boy band One Direction was getting back together. Both link to vote.org.\n\nOn October 18, the hoax-like set-up reached new levels of exposure when Elle Magazine, whose official Twitter account has 6.8 million followers, joined in on the trend.\n\nThe US magazine used a similar Kardashian divorce clickbait headline to lead to a website offering advice on how to register to vote from the non-profit, nonpartisan organizations When We All Vote and Rock The Vote. When We All Vote has the backing of former first lady Michelle Obama and celebrities including Tom Hanks and Tim McGraw. Neither of the non-profits responded to AFP when asked about the Elle Magazine tweet.\n\nWhile the comments on Preston\u2019s tweet were surprised, but largely positive, Elle Magazine faced more negative feedback, including people who found the tweet patronizing and others who raised concerns about the possible impact on media trust.\n\nFour hours after the tweet first appeared, Elle Magazine responded to the criticism by removing a related Instagram post and writing on Twitter, \u201cWe made a bad joke. Our passion for voter registration clouded our judgement and we are sincerely sorry.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Kardashian West and West plan to divorce. They have been visiting Uganda ahead of the release of West\u2019s new album.\n\nRepresentatives for Kardashian West did not respond when AFP asked for comment on this get-out-the-vote effort, but on October 9, the social media influencer did encourage her 59.4 million Twitter followers to \u201cuse your voice, register now.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
