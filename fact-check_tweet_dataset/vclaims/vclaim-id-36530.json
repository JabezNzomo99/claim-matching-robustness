It says that sufferers can cure themselves in the early days of an infection by drinking lots of water, and gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar. This is not true.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cCorona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus. Spread this information because you can save someone with this information.\u201d\n\nThe incubation period for Covid-19 (the time it takes for symptoms to develop), which is caused by the new coronavirus, is thought to be between one and 14 days, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). It says that most commonly symptoms seem to emerge after around five days.\n\nBut it\u2019s incorrect to suggest that people who have Covid-19 could cure themselves (either during this initial period or at any other time) by drinking water or gargling. The NHS says that adults can soothe an ordinary sore throat by gargling with warm, salty water. This is not advice for people who are infected with the new coronavirus. The NHS says, \u201cThere is currently no specific treatment for coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe WHO has also said that there is no evidence that regularly rinsing your nose with saline is likely to prevent infection with the new coronavirus.\n\nFalse rumours that salt water might kill the virus have been common since the early days of the outbreak in China. We have written about it before, as have other factcheckers.\n\nGargling salt water may soothe a sore throat, and people are advised to drink water in order to stay hydrated when they are ill with either flu or the new coronavirus.\n\nCurrent advice from the UK government, at the time of writing, is that people who experience a new, continuous cough or a fever should isolate themselves at home for seven days.", "lang": "en"}
