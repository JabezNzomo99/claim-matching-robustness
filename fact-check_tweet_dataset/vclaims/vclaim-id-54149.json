No, that's not true: Jan Reed, who was not affiliated with the election office, was charged for sending hundreds of absentee ballot applications to voters with the Democrat box already checked. When election officials caught the problem, the applications were rejected and the voters were sent new applications. Actual ballots were never sent by Reed, who was charged with a felony.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published in a Facebook post on July 11, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nShe also included instructions that stated that the section she pre-checked needed \"no input.\" Election officials told The Evansville Courier & Press that Reed didn't stop sending the faulty applications even after being warned by the officials and the local Democratic Party to stop.\n\nAnother local news outlet reported that Reed sent \"more than 300 absentee applications,\" not the 400 the Facebook post claims.\n\nThe applications she sent were rejected and the election office eventually mailed replacement applications.", "lang": "en"}
