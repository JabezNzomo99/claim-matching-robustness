This claim and its variations have been roundly debunked. We gave them Four Pinocchios in June. But they\u2019re back now, and so are we.\n\nTrump also claimed without evidence again that \u201ccriminals\u201d are part of the migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration over the past month has tried to cobble together proof of Trump\u2019s claim. It has almost nothing but supposition to show the public. Many of the caravan members are women and children fleeing violence in their home countries or seeking economic opportunity in the United States. They hardly fit Trump\u2019s description of \u201cvery tough people\u201d rushing the border.\n\nBut the key difference here is that in April, the Justice Department rolled out a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally. As a result of this and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision in May to refer all illegal-crossing cases to federal prosecutors, families apprehended at the border were systematically separated. The reason is simple: Children can\u2019t be prosecuted with their parents.\n\n\u201cThe biggest difference really is the difference between a policy that is targeted and tailored to protect a child and a policy which essentially uses children as a way to punish the parents or to deter them from doing the thing that we don\u2019t want them to do,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who oversaw immigration as director of Obama\u2019s domestic policy council. \u201cThe scale as a result is very different and the impact is very different.\u201d\n\nWhen DHS presented family separations as one of several options to the Obama administration, it was immediately rejected as \u201cimmoral,\u201d she added. Morality questions aside, the proposal would have been a costly \u201clogistical nightmare\u201d for DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with resettling separated or unaccompanied children at the border, Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nResponding to questions for a previous fact check, a DHS spokeswoman sent figures from fiscal 2010 through 2016 showing that, of 2,362,966 adults apprehended at the southern border, 492,970, or 21 percent, were referred for prosecution. These figures include all adults, not just those who crossed with minor children, so they\u2019re not a measure of how many families were separated under Obama.\n\n\u201cDuring the Obama administration, there was no policy in place that resulted in the systematic separation of families at the border, like we are now seeing under the Trump administration,\u201d Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in June. \u201cOur understanding is that generally parents were not prosecuted for illegal entry under President Obama. There may have been some separation if there was suspicion that the children were being trafficked or a claimed parent-child relationship did not actually exist. But nothing like the levels we are seeing today.\u201d\n\nThe news program also reported on an uncensored DHS document it obtained: The \u201cdocument reveals that child separation began nine months earlier than the administration acknowledged. There was a pilot program in the busy \u2018El Paso sector\u2019 from \u2018July to November 2017.\u2019 We don\u2019t know how many children were taken in those five months.\u201d But this is unrelated to Trump\u2019s assertion that the Obama and Bush administrations separated families.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim about \u201cthe flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals,\u201d we\u2019ve looked into it repeatedly (see here, here and here). The Trump administration has offered no proof of criminals traveling with the caravan. The most that can be said is that any crowd of 7,000 people is going to have some bad apples and that the Trump administration\u2019s estimates of 270 to 470 criminals in the caravan comport with the ratio seen during a 2014 immigration surge.\n\nAsked about U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents lobbing tear gas at children near the San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana over the weekend, Trump said it was necessary because they were being rushed by \u201cvery tough people.\u201d He dismissed reports that children were among those subjected to tear gas. Photos and video taken on site show that these children were with their mothers, not hardened criminals. Men were also part of the group.\n\nTime keeps passing by and the president is still shifting blame, refusing to acknowledge the scope of his family separations, defending them with falsehoods and peddling unsubstantiated claims about criminals in the migrant caravan. The administration has had ample time to find something, anything, to support these claims. But the tank remains empty, and Trump earns another Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
