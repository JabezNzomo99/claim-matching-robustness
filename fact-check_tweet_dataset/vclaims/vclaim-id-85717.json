He claimed that \u201cmany mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data\u201d requested from the voting commission.\n\nOn June 28, 2017, Commission Vice Chair Kris Kobach sent a letter to election officials for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, requesting the states \u201cprovide to the Commission the publicly-available voter roll data\u201d including 11 types of information \u201cif publicly available under the laws of your state.\u201d The information included such items as first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party registration, last four digits of Social Security number, voter history from 2006, felony convictions, military status and the like.\n\nAs one might expect, the request was controversial. According to our White House source, 29 states and the District did not send information, while 20 have done so; one state, New Hampshire, has said it would send information but has not yet done so. In a number of cases, the commission did not get as much information as it had hoped for, but it got something after politicians (such as in New York) had initially refused to comply.\n\nMeanwhile, six states, such as Georgia, had indicated they would release some information upon payment of a fee that has not yet been made by the commission. There are three states \u2014 Indiana, Texas and Utah \u2014 where litigation has prevented the sharing of any data. Arkansas was the first state to submit data \u2014 on July 27 \u2014 and the commission last received data from states on Oct. 11 (West Virginia and Oregon). So no data has been submitted for nearly three months.\n\nPartisan distinctions can be quantified in a number of ways. There are seven \u201cno\u201d states in which there is a Republican governor \u2014 but a Democratic secretary of state. That suggests the secretary of state, who often oversees election matters, might have thwarted the wishes of the GOP governor. Meanwhile, there are four \u201cyes\u201d states with a Democratic governor and a Republican secretary of state, where the same dynamic may have been in play.\n\nWhen one party controlled both offices, the split was fairly equal. There are only four \u201cyes\u201d states with both a Democratic governor and secretary of state, compared to six \u201cno\u201d states. Meanwhile, there were 11 \u201cyes\u2019 states with a Republican governor and secretary of state \u2014 but 15 \u201cno\u201d states.\n\nWe cross-referenced that information on data submissions with the political leanings of each state, according to whether the state was blue or red in the 2016 election and the political party affiliation of the governor or secretary of state. Here are the results.\n\nAmong 2016 presidential election states, 57 percent of the Republican states did not provide data, compared to 60 percent of the Democratic states. If you are generous and include states \u201cpending payment,\u201d then 40 percent of the states that supported Trump have refused to provide data. (Note: an earlier version of the map below had incorrect color markings for Minnesota, Nebraska and Alaska)\n\nLooking at governors, 64 percent of the states headed by a Republican governor did not provide data, compared to 53 percent of the Democratic states. For reference, here\u2019s a political breakdown of the states by the governor\u2019s political affiliation. (Note: an earlier version of this map incorrectly listed New Mexico as Democrat.)\n\nTrump, as usual, goes too far to pin the resistance to providing the data on \u201cmostly Democrat States.\u201d There is a Democratic tilt to the opposition, especially if one assumes the states requesting payment might have eventually provided data. But a relatively large percentage of Republican-leaning states also did not provide data. The president earns Two Pinocchios on this particular point \u2014 although his claims of voter fraud remain in Four-Pinocchio territory.", "lang": "en"}
