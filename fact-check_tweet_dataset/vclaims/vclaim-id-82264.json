But it certainly suggests, contrary to Trump\u2019s statement, that administration negotiators frequently discussed the fate of the detainees. Indeed, this has been a consistent theme whenever Kerry has been asked about it. In a hearing before the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 25, Kerry mentioned each American by name:\n\n\u201cWe have raised those cases. We raise them in every conversation that we have. In fact, we raise all of our missing citizens \u2014 we have a number of them in various parts of the world. And we raise them on a consistent basis, not only through our embassies, but any time that I visit either here or go somewhere and we meet at high levels, we raise these issues by name. We have raised the names of the \u2014 of the folks \u2014 Mr. Abedini, Mr. Hekmati, Mr. Levinson, Mr. Rezaian most recently, when I was in Geneva just a couple days ago. And we consistently \u2014 and we\u2019re working. We actually have a process now in place where we\u2019re working them quietly, trying to see what could be arranged.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met with the families of some of those folks. Nobody is content. And our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out. \u201cNow, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates. Suddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals. It makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on [their release]. And, by the way, if we had walked away from the nuclear deal, we\u2019d still be pushing them just as hard to get these folks out. That\u2019s why those issues are not connected. But we are working every single day to try to get them out, and won\u2019t stop until they\u2019re out and rejoined with their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, can I just say, you\u2019re absolutely right. Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian must be released regardless of anything else we\u2019re doing with Iran. It\u2019s an entirely distinct issue. They are wrongly imprisoned. And we need to find Robert Levinson and, hopefully, bring him home. We fully agree. But we think that tying that to any agreement, the success or failure, for that matter, of an agreement, is not the best way to get them out. I can assure you, and I think you know this, the only issue that we raise with them on the margins of the nuclear talks every single time, other than the nuclear talks, are those who are unjustly imprisoned in Iran. And we are working every day to get them home. And we will not stop until we do.\u201d\n\nSarah Shourd, an American who was held in an Iranian prison for more than a year, recently wrote in the Daily Beast that the Iran deal and the fate of the Americans are already informally linked because easing tensions between the two countries will make it easier for Iran to release the Americans. As evidence, she noted that the negotiations, led by Oman, over her and two colleagues seized by Iran actually paved the way for the start of the nuclear talks. (Our former colleague Robin Wright, in an article for The New Yorker, interviewed other former hostages about Trump\u2019s claim that they would be released before he took the oath of office.)\n\n\u201c\u200eSecretary Kerry never asserted that he refused to raise the issue of the detained and missing Americans in Iran because it would complicate negotiations. In fact, he has consistently made clear that he used every opportunity to raise the cases of Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian, and Robert Levinson and to call for their return home. This includes raising these cases on the sidelines of the nuclear talks. And we continue to pursue every avenue to bring them home. \u200e\u201dWe have also been clear that we have never and would never link these cases to the nuclear talks, not because these cases would complicate the negotiations, but because the fate of our detained and missing citizens should not depend on unrelated negotiations that may or may not have led to a successful conclusion. \u201cWe continue to call on the Iranian government to release Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, and to work cooperatively with us to locate Robert Levinson, so that all can be returned to their families.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
