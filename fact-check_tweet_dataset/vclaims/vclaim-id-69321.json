USDA told PolitiFact it has no plans to require microchipping to receive program benefits.\n\nFacebook users flagged Anti News Network\u2019s post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat misinformation.\n\nAnti News Network\u2019s story includes accurate information about a software and breakroom kiosks company in Wisconsin, Three Square Market, which offered its employees the ability to get a microchip under their skin. By waving their microchipped hand on sensors, employees can get access into the company\u2019s building, sign on to their computers and pay for snacks.\n\nAnti News Network also includes a legitimate quote from a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who said the concept of microchips will likely become more common in the future.\n\nThe post also said that \"the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland.\" (The Independent reported about that in 2015.)\n\nBut there\u2019s no mention in the story about this being a settled matter of policy across the United States. Instead, the story raises concerns about microchipping and calls on Americans to be vigilant.\n\n\"But regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips. \u2026 If Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made,\" the post said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve fact-checked claims about governments microchipping their citizenry. We\u2019ve rated as Pants on Fire another claim giving the false impression that the Australian government is implanting microchips in its citizens.\n\nAnti News Network published a headline that\u2019s inconsistent with its own story and not supported by facts.", "lang": "en"}
