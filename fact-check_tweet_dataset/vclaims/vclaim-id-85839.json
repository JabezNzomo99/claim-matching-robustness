We ran a reverse search on the photograph and found the original image, which was first uploaded in an Egyptian research journal on forensics. We reached out to one of the authors of the case report, Dr Navneet Ateriya, who confirmed that the photograph was taken at the crime scene, in Jodhpur's Bhakri village in the presence of a police team. The family had been driven to commit suicide on account of extreme poverty.", "lang": "en"}
