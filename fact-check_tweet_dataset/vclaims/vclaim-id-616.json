So too was pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.\n\nIn his view, it was contrary to article 8 to deny a mother an abortion at any time in the event of a fatal foetal abnormality. In the case of a woman who became pregnant as a result of sexual crime, it was a breach of article 8 to deny an abortion up to the date when the foetus could survive outside the womb.\n\nHowever, judges in the United Kingdom have no power to overturn primary legislation that they regard as contrary to the human rights convention. Instead, they have two options under the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nSection 3 of the act requires judges to read legislation in a way that is compatible with convention rights \"so far as it is possible to do so\". This is known as \"reading down\" legislation.\n\nSection 4 says that if it's not possible to read down legislation then the court may make a declaration of incompatibility. That doesn't change the law\u2014though it allows for fast-track reform if ministers agree.\n\nMr Justice Horner adjourned the case for further submissions on these two options from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland government. He suggested it might be possible to read down the existing legislation by finding that any decision to prosecute a woman in the circumstances he outlined would be an abuse of the law.\n\nBut the judge also recognised that the case was bound to go to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. So the parties may decide to appeal against the judgment rather than argue about how it should be given effect.\n\nIn the meantime, obtaining an abortion outside Northern Ireland remains the only legally safe option for women in these circumstances.", "lang": "en"}
