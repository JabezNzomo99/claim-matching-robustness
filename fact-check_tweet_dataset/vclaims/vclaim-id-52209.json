The whereabouts of the earlier letter remain a mystery.developing,\u201d Josh Cornett, a pro-Trump Twitter user, posted Sept. 18.\n\nNearly 9,000 people retweeted the post. Cornett said in a subsequent tweet that he had \u201cno idea\u201d if it was true.\n\nThe baseless assertion made its way onto conservative websites, gaining traction online alongside other falsehoods about Ford. In some cases, the supposed Gorsuch accusation was dropped in the form of a question or with a caveat, but nevertheless spread as if credible.\n\n\u201cRape Accuser Allegedly Sent Feinstein SAME Letter Last Year \u2014 About Someone Else,\u201d declares the Sept. 19 headline on madworldnews.com.\n\nThe article goes on to name Gorsuch and cites a story from theblacksphere.net, the website of political commentator and Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson.\n\nFeinstein, a Democratic senator from California, received a July letter from Ford about her allegations against Kavanaugh, which the senator later provided to the FBI. Kavanaugh has said the allegations are \u201ccompletely false.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s office disputed the idea that she received a previous allegation by Ford against Gorsuch. A spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told us in an email: \u201cThat is false.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s article on theblacksphere.net advanced the rumor with a story headlined (with a noticeably absent question mark): \u201cDid Kavanaugh Accuser Send SAME Letter About Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nBut the post \u2014 which describes Ford as a \u201cposter child\u201d who is \u201cpart of the plot to bring down men\u201d \u2014 suggests the possibility carries weight.\n\nAfter citing Cornett\u2019s tweet, Jackson writes: \u201cAs Josh Cornett suggests, the mystery is developing. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d\n\nOther websites carried the claim with caveats. \u201cThere are rumblings that Ford also accused Gorsuch of abuse,\u201d a Gateway Pundit article said. \u201cBut there is no evidence to support this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to share some things with you that may be fake news, but if they\u2019re not fake, I want to be on record as having had them for you. There\u2019s a Twitter thread out there. I have no idea the veracity because, as you know, I do not \u2018twit,'\u201d a Sept. 18 post on his website reads. \u201cBut this particular thread claims that the reason that Dianne Feinstein was reluctant to go public with Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s letter is because she received a similar letter from the woman about Judge Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cNo idea whether this is fake news or true.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBrown, Emma. \u201cCalifornia professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault.\u201d Washington Post. 16 Sep 2018.\n\nDiserio, Rebecca. \u201cRape Accuser Allegedly Sent Feinstein SAME Letter Last Year \u2014 About Someone Else.\u201d Madworldnews.com. 19 Sep 2018.\n\nHoft, Jim. \u201cChristine Blasey Ford Has Record of Questionable Integrity \u2013 Kavanaugh and Gorsuch Went to Same School.\u201d The Gateway Pundit. 18 Sep 2018.\n\nMentzer, Tom.
