There are no \"documents,\" or any other sort of evidence, that support the theory that Trump is behind the creation of the coronavirus, which had killed six people in the U.S. as of March 3, 2020.\n\nThe video, narrated in a male voice, says \"top secret documents\" predict that a flu-like pandemic would strike America and kill millions of people. While the narrator claims the documents are apparently going around \"U.S. establishments,\" there are no credible reports that reflect this information, and the video provides no links or evidence that it exists.\n\nThis conspiracy theory is based on speculation and contains zero evidence that Trump has anything to do with the the creation of the coronavirus.
