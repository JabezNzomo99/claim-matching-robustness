What can they crow about?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:31:39Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85989", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/14/the-white-houses-happy-tweet-about-obamacare-enrollment/", "vclaim": "The number \u201c500,000\u201d may ring a bell because the Associated Press last month broke the news that an internal memo had predicted that about 500,000 people would sign up for health insurance by Oct. 31. As the article noted, \u201cthat was portrayed as a slow start.\u201d\n\nBut on Wednesday, the actual numbers were released. It turned out that only 106,185 had selected a plan by clicking a button on the Web site page, but an undisclosed percentage have not actually paid their first-month premiums. Moreover, three-quarters of that total applied through state-run Web sites; fewer than 27,000 selected a plan in the federal marketplace.\n\nAs the tweet graphic indicated, the bulk of that 500,000 figure represented people who have been \u201cdetermined eligible\u201d for coverage through Medicaid or the child\u2019s health program (CHIP). But as a footnote reveals, in some cases state eligibility may not have been determined yet, making the figure also a bit squishy.\n\nAccording to the most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate, about 8 million people were expected to sign up for Medicaid in the first year of the new law \u2014 and 7 million people were expected to receive insurance through the exchanges.\n\nSo, another way to look at it, after one month, is that the administration is 5 percent of the way toward the Medicaid projection \u2014 and less than 1.5 percent of the way toward the exchange projection.\n\nBefore the troubled launch of HealthCare.gov, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told NBC News on Sept. 30 that \u201cI think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a goal that CBO said is what they thought would happen,\u201d White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Nov. 3. (CBO does not set \u201cgoals,\u201d but it produces estimates that are sometimes embraced by officials as goals.)\n\nIndeed, when the AP story was published, administration officials suggested it was just one way to measure the rate of enrollment. More recently, they have pointed to the experience in Massachusetts, which created the first health-insurance law with an individual mandate. But as we have noted, there are some significant differences between the start-up of the two plans.\n\nIn particular, the Massachusetts plan had three distinct phases \u2014 automatically enrolling people in a type of Medicaid program, then accepting people with subsidized coverage and finally permitting people with unsubsidized coverage. The entire process took more than a year.\n\nLooking just at the non-Medicaid part of the program, in the first sixth of the enrollment period, the equivalent of one month of the federal enrollment period, Massachusetts had enrolled about 6 percent of total enrollees.\n\nThe final part of the tweet notes that nearly 1 million people have \u201ccompleted application but haven\u2019t selected a plan yet.\u201d Nearly 700,000 of those people are in the federal exchange, suggesting that the balky Web site has been a serious issue. More than 95 percent of the people in the federal exchange who completed an application have not signed up for a plan, the report says.\n\nAs tweets go, the administration earns some credit for breaking out the raw enrollment numbers \u2014 even if the actual accounting appears a bit generous. And perhaps it is just sheer coincidence that the tweet highlights the very figure \u2014 500,000 \u2014 that had been widely reported as the administration\u2019s one-month goal.", "lang": "en"}
