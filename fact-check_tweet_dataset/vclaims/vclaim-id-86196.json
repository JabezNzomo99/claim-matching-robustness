Here's a guide.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-01-17T08:00:43.108Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86196", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/17/steve-king-donald-trump-mutual-fans-echos/", "vclaim": "After all, King was advocating for a border wall \u2014 a \u201cKing wall\u201d as he called it \u2014 as early as 2006, almost 10 years before the concept of a wall along the southern border turned up in Trump\u2019s announcement that he was running for president.\n\nBut the symbiotic relationship has come under strain after King was quoted in the New York Times article as saying: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d\n\nAfter that quote was publicized, House Republicans stripped King of his committee memberships and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders labeled his comments as \u201cabhorrent.\u201d Trump himself has not commented on the controversy. But attention anew has been focused on how Trump and King have often echoed each other in their public statements.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put that stuff behind us in history. The Civil War was history, the Confederacy was history. There\u2019s a symbol there that means slavery to some, but it means a historical pride in the South to others, and we should be able to look at it as history. It hasn\u2019t been a problem for 150 years. Why it emerges now? It looks like it\u2019s politically driven.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week, it\u2019s Robert E. Lee, I noticed that Stonewall Jackson\u2019s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d\n\nGeorge Soros is a Jewish Hungarian American who supports a range of liberal groups and causes \u2014 and has been cast as the antagonist of conspiracy theories large and small circulating on the right for more than a decade. Both King and Trump have suggested Soros is a source of mysterious money.\n\n\u201cWhen you see their signs, you notice yesterday \u2014 I talked about the signs all week, today they\u2019re all different because they said oh, we can\u2019t do the same sign made by a manufacturer, paid for by Soros or whoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job for the people of Arizona. He\u2019s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona. I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis old white people business, though, does get a little tired. \u2026 I\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you\u2019re talking about. Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.\u201d\n\nTrump terminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and King has long been opposed to it. Trump has shown more sympathy for people who qualify for DACA \u2014 people who came to the United States illegally as children \u2014 but both men have noted that DACA might give citizenship to drug dealers or other nefarious elements.\n\n\u201cSome of these kids are good kids. It\u2019s not their fault. Yes, there\u2019s some really good kids that are part of this, and it\u2019s too bad they are caught in this flux that we are in. But by the same token you will also be legalizing those people who are breaking our laws in a very bad way \u2014 smuggling drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they\u2019re gang members and they\u2019re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way \u2014 it\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s a very, very tough subject.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
