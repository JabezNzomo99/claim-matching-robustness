In the article, he warned that too often social media users are targeting other accounts as Russian trolls, and that this is a problem.\n\n\u201cSuch accusations do more harm than good, obscuring the ways in which trolls can really be identified and increasing online polarization still further,\u201d Nimmo wrote.\n\nNimmo went on to explain the difficulty of determining whether an account is a paid troll or someone just repeating Russian government messaging:\n\n\u201cHowever, these factors do allow for the reliable indication of pro-Kremlin accounts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf an account shares most of the factors, but claims to be a patriotic citizen of another country (especially the United States and United Kingdom), it may well be a covert influence account, like the hundreds which Russian journalists exposed working out of the St. Petersburg \u2018troll factory\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs with any open source investigation,\u201d Nimmo continued, \u201cthe combination of factors is key. A single indicator is seldom enough to confirm identification. What is important is the approach: assessing a suspect account from all angles and across as long a timespan as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Russian state-funded media outlet RT responded to Nimmo\u2019s article with a misleading headline that read: \u201cGrammar mistakes mean you're a paid Kremlin troll, says Atlantic Council fellow.\u201d The RT conclusion, however, overlooks Nimmo\u2019s main point that a \u201ccombination\u201d of factors help identify government-sponsored influence accounts. \n\n\n\nThe RT article began: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Russian immigrant in the United States \u2014 or anywhere else \u2014 don\u2019t bother tweeting your opinions unless your English is flawless. Otherwise you\u2019ll be branded a Kremlin-paid troll by influential American think tanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n \u201cWhat gives the Russian trolls away, Nimmo advises, is their tendency to use imperfect English,\u201d the RT piece continued. \u201cFor example, Nimmo highlights the \u2018inability\u2019 of so-called Russian trolls to use the words \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018the\u2019 because the Russian language itself does not use definite or indefinite articles.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Nimmo\u2019s piece included a short section about language usage that includes a number of alleged troll posts with the errors he described.\n\n\u201cThere is, of course, a difference between a Russian account and a pro-Kremlin one,\u201d Nimmo wrote. \u201cLinguistic telltales are, therefore, generally insufficient to expose the troll.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nimmo\u2019s article focused not on linguistic errors, but rather on the need to follow a particular Twitter account\u2019s activity over a long period to see if it consistently pushes a pro-Kremlin narrative during key events with special significance for Russia. Nimmo profiled a number of such accounts in an earlier Medium piece. He also spoke to Polygraph.info, which published a profile of one such account, known as \u201cIan56,\u201d which has alternately posed as both a citizen of the United States and Great Britain.\n\nThe RT article did mention this section of Nimmo\u2019s article, but devoted very little attention to its content and misrepresents its message.\n\n\u201cGraciously, Nimmo accepts that simply using imperfect English alone may not be enough evidence to outright brand someone as a paid Kremlin agitator, but if you\u2019ve also been tweeting certain anti-Western \u2018narratives\u2019 or indeed articles published by RT \u2014 then it\u2019s a sure thing,\u201d the RT piece read.\n\nWhat Nimmo actually wrote is that \u201clinguistic cues should be combined with narrative ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn account which repeatedly shares Russian government talking points on most or all of these events can justifiably be considered pro-Kremlin,\u201d Nimmo wrote.\n\nInterestingly, RT neglected to include a link to Nimmo\u2019s article for its readers.\n\nThe RT article then changed the subject completely by referencing journalist Yasha Levine, who called Nimmo\u2019s article \u201canti-immigrant crap.\u201d However, the first example that Nimmo gave of a troll account sharing pro-Kremlin narrative is known as TEN_GOP. This account claimed to be representing the Republican Party in Tennessee, hence the name TEN_GOP.\n\nNimmo showed how the account would publish certain Kremlin talking points on events such as the annexation of Russian Crimea in 2014. He listed other events to monitor, including the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July that same year, the downing of a Russian military aircraft by the Turkish air force in 2015, the fall of Aleppo in 2016, and the chemical attack at Khan Sheikhoun in Syria in 2017.\n\nNimmo provided examples of accounts the DFR Lab designated as pro-Kremlin trolls, none of which claim to be Russian immigrants. In fact, most of these accounts have Western-sounding first and last names, and they typically claim to be native-born citizens of the U.S. or Britain. It is also worth noting that many such accounts are known for tweeting extreme anti-immigrant messages.\n\nThe RT article ended by claiming that Nimmo smeared Ukrainian-American pianist Valentina Lisitsa as being tied to the Kremlin. Once again, the reality is very different. In another article on Kremlin trolls, Lisitsa was mentioned because she had retweeted material from other accounts identified as Kremlin trolls. One of those accounts goes by the name Rachael Swindon and identifies as a British citizen, not an immigrant or someone of Russian heritage.\n\nGiven the vast difference between what Nimmo\u2019s article contains and RT\u2019s interpretation, inquisitive RT readers are encouraged to read the article for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
