There is no evidence that such a law exists and a spokesman for the government denied the claim, adding that it was \u201clunacy\u201d. The Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act was passed into law in July 2018, providing minors legal protection against harm from sexual acts and acts of domestic violence. However, the king has complete control over parliament and government as well as the judiciary, civil service and security forces.\n\nA tweet from December 9, 2018 said that the parliament had passed a law allowing the king to marry 14-year-old virgins. Dewa Mavhinga, Southern Africa director of Human Rights Watch, re-tweeted a screenshot of the claim saying, \u201cIf true this is tragic. Will investigate further\u201d.\n\nA similar version of the narrative reads, \u201cRape legalized for King Mswati\u201d and was shared 1,587 times as of publication. It can also be seen in a tweet shared more than 600 times and under a Facebook search with a growing number of posts.\n\nAnother post on Facebook, shared on December 10, 2018, misspelled the king's name. It reads: \u201cIT SHOULD BE MSAWATI'S ROLE TO BREAK THE VIRGINITY OF THE GIRL; SWAZILAND PARLIAMENT\u201d.\n\nThe post falsely claimed that the age of the king's potential wives needed to be reduced from 17-year-old virgins to 14-year-olds, \u201cbecause as most girls start getting loose at the age of 15\u201d.\n\nThe claim cited an Elder Muyoti as saying: \u201cA King is not allowed to enter where other souls have entered according to our custom\u201d.\n\nSlindele Nxumalo, Communications & Advocacy Officer for the NGO, Swaziland Action Group Against Abuse told AFP that such a law does not exist in eSwatini.\n\n\u201cContrary to these fake news, there are actually two laws besides the Constitution of eSwatini that seek to protect and promote the health and safety of every child here, namely: the_child_protection_welfare_act_of_2012.pdf The Child Protection Welfare Act of 2012 and the sexual_offences_and_domestic_violence_act_of_2018.pdf Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act of 2018,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Sexual Offences & Domestic Violence Act indicates that any offender found guilty of having committed an offence against a child will not be offered an option of a fine nor bail,\u201d she said.\n\nNxumalo added that both laws define a child as anyone from 0-18 years of age and were passed and signed by King Mswati III.\n\neSwatini government spokesman Percy Simelane responded to AFP enquiries about the posts saying they \u201crefuse to entertain lunacy\u201d.\n\nHe added that the press office struggled to handle \u201cmadness of this calibre\u201d.\n\nSibonsile Mamba, a director of Swaziland Women in Action, an NGO supporting women\u2019s rights, said she was not aware of such law, \u201cbut given the status in our constitution where the king is elevated above the law, such marriage can happen and there can be no legal measures that can be taken against him. I think the sentiments emanates from that reality.\"\n\nThe king is one of the world's last absolute rulers, with complete control over parliament and government as well as the judiciary, civil service and security forces.\n\nMswati, 50, has 14 wives and more than 25 children -- and the right to choose a new wife at the annual Reed Dance, when thousands of bare-breasted virgins dance for him.\n\nThe country has the world\u2019s highest HIV prevalence rate, with a 27.4 percent of adults aged 15 - 49 living with HIV.", "lang": "en"}
