A law saying that the NHS should charge fees, for example, could only be passed by MPs who we can vote out. It\u2019s also worth knowing that the European Parliament now has equal say in most major EU laws, and the UK provides around 10% of its members.\n\nEU judges have made rulings that overrode British laws on immigration and VAT.\n\nIt\u2019s not correct that they have done so when it comes to prisoner voting, though. The European Court of Human Rights has said that the British ban on prisoner votes should be changed, but it isn\u2019t part of the EU, and its 2005 decision hasn\u2019t led to a change in the law here.\n\nThe EU court did made a judgment about a French prisoner who wanted to vote for the European Parliament that might have implications for the ban as it applies to those elections, but the UK Supreme Court\u2019s decision that EU law doesn\u2019t help prisoners who want to vote for their MEP stands for now.\n\nThe court has some influence on counter-terrorism in terms of rules on collecting personal data, but it\u2019s safe to say that the situation isn\u2019t as simple as presented here. As the Court of Appeal has said, \u201cEU law has not harmonised the law on access to communications data by the police or intelligence services\u201d.\n\nAs for the several different parts of the government\u2019s EU deal, they\u2019ll all be legally binding in one way or another, assuming politicians pass some necessary laws. Those laws could be challenged in the EU court. Here\u2019s one view on how likely the different bits are to be overturned there.", "lang": "en"}
