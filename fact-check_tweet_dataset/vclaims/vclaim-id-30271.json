More precisely, there is no picture from the protests. As well as [no] mention of the protests themselves,\u201d she claimed.\n\nThat claim is false, and was immediately debunked in the replies to her tweet.\n\n\u201cQuestion: Why lie even in such trifles? To further discredit yourself?\u201d @Glnvz wrote posting links to the U.S. media reports on the protests in Iran.\n\n@Slavab16 followed with two screenshots showing NBC News and Bloomberg reports. \u201cEverything is in there,\u201d his tweet said.\n\nThe flow of debunking replies continued with screenshots and links to Fox News, Bloomberg, NBC and other western media reports.\n\nA Bloomberg.com website search found 99 Soleimani-related reports published on Jan. 3 alone, most of them with video footage of the protests.\n\nFor instance, a Bloomberg report titled \u201cIranians Take to the Streets After Soleimani\u2019s Death\u201d was published at 9:36 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n\nThe NBC News website has more than 100 reports on the situation in Iran since the announcement of Soleimani\u2019s death, including live footage of the protests and multiple live reports from Soleimani\u2019s funeral. Headlines include \u201cMourners flood the streets of Iran after death of Soleimani\u201d and \u201cHuge crowds in Iran for Soleimani\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\nFox News carried similar reports. Contrary to Simonyan, they included live footage of the protests in Iran.\n\nSimonyan\u2019s domain includes the news agencies RIA Novosti and Sputnik, and RT (Russia Today). She has regularly made unsubstantiated claims about U.S. media. In May 2019, Polygraph.info refuted her claim that RT had broadcast a May Day \u201crally in support of Maduro in Caracas,\u201d with video showing large crowds, while Reuters broadcast video showing a \u201cgreen boulevard,\u201d with relatively few people. Reuters\u2019 \u201cgreen boulevard\u201d footage was actually from Paris ahead of mass protests that took place in France's capital the same day, not Caracas.", "lang": "en"}
