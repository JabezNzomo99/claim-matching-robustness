Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the numbers given in the post.\n\nClaim: If EVMs were not hacked, how did BJP and Congress candidates get 211820 and 140295 votes respectively in many constituencies? Fact: The number of votes given in the post does not match with the official numbers on the ECI website. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the post, the names of seven BJP candidates were given along with the number of votes (211820) they secured on the EVMs in the General Elections- 2019. Also, it was given that respective Congress candidates got the same votes (140295) in all the constituencies against the above BJP candidates. The authenticity of the numbers given in the post can be ascertained from the official ECI Results website. The attached photos in the post have the name of the constituencies of the candidates. So, when one checks for the votes of the candidates according to constituencies, it can be found that the numbers given in the post were FALSE.\n\nTo sum it up, BJP and Congress Candidates didn\u2019t get 211820 and 140295 votes respectively in many constituencies.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
