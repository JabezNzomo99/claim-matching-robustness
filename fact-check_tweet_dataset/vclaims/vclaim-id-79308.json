Kamala Harris calling for people to report a specific Instagram account.\n\nThe tweet appears to have been fabricated. There is no record of Harris tweeting such a message.\n\nThe abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America gives Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, a 100 percent rating. Harris has co-sponsored abortion rights bills such as the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act and the EACH Woman Act and, in 2019, voted against consideration of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAn image circulating on Instagram shows a screen grab of a tweet from Harris that asks her followers to report an Instagram account that appears to share anti-abortion messages. \u201cEveryone go and report @official_fight_for_life on Instagram!\u201d reads the alleged tweet. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting against the women\u2019s right to abortion! We must keep abortion legal up to birth! Do not follow him!\u201d (RELATED: Did Elizabeth Warren Say, \u2018Having An Abortion Is No Different Than Someone Having Their Tonsils Removed\u2019?)\n\nThere is, however, no record of Harris tweeting about the Instagram account from either of her Twitter accounts \u2013 @KamalaHarris and @SenKamalaHarris. It doesn\u2019t appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets on Aug. 28 or any other date. Check Your Fact also didn\u2019t find any similar comment mentioning the Instagram account on her Senate website or on her other social media accounts.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared a fake tweet from Harris. In late August, Check Your Fact debunked a Facebook post claiming Harris sent a tweet \u201csetting the record straight\u201d about her name.", "lang": "en"}
