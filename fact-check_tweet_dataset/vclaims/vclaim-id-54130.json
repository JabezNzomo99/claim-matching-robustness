No, that's not true: There is no new health care act that mandates citizens be vaccinated. In fact, a new vaccine is not expected to be approved for mass production until at least 2021.\n\nThe claim comes up as part of a post (archived here) that was posted to Facebook on July 18, 2020. The post read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nWhile the post mostly consists of predictions, it also purports to make a factual statement with this:\n\nAnother post, which went up on Facebook August 12, 2020, makes similar claims that \"they are stripping your rights as a parent,\" under a fictitious \"covid act 2020\" by taking children who show any symptoms of having the virus that causes COVID-19 and isolating them in undisclosed locations without parental consent:\n\nThere is no \"new health care act,\" in the works that would force vaccines against the virus on anyone, nor provide for \"an isolation centre.\" Readers can check govtrack.us to see information for themselves.\n\nWhile President Trump has promised a new health care plan in a matter of weeks, that has not yet happened and the president has never suggested it would include a vaccine mandate.\n\nThere is a health care Act that deals with relief from coronavirus-related economic devastation that was enacted March 6, 2020, and named H.R. 6074 -- 116th Congress: Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020. It does call for money to help develop vaccines, but there are no provisions dealing with forcing vaccines on people -- particularly in a school. The word \"isolation\" never appears in the bill.\n\nThere is also H.R. 7152: Reopen Our Schools Act, which was introduced June 11, 2020, and still needs to be considered by a committee before it goes any further. The bill would ban federal funding for schools that refuse to reopen for in-person classes by September 8, 2020. Again, there is no mention of the word \"isolation,\" and \"vaccine\" does not appear in the bill.\n\nAnd there is S. 3370: Coronavirus Vaccine Act, a short bill introduced March 2, 2020, which reads in full:\n\nTo carry out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $250,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023. This post -- again, chiefly a prediction -- is false. If such a bill did get introduced, it would not only be major news, but would also likely face opposition in both chambers of Congress due to how controversial it would be to expose children to a vaccine (particularly a \"killer vaccine\") surreptitiously. It wouldn't be a secret if it was in a congressional bill that would have to make its way through both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republication-controlled Senate, with opponents on the other sides scrutinizing every move by the other party. And President Trump, who is a Republican, holds veto power.", "lang": "en"}
