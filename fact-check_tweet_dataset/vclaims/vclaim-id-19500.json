The law is clearly unconstitutional and disenfranchises millions of California voters. We need your support to overturn SB27.\"\n\nWe set out on a fact check.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom did sign Senate Bill 27 into law last week. But it doesn\u2019t prevent Trump or anyone else from appearing on the California ballot, nor does it mean he\u2019s \"kicked off.\"\n\nInstead, it requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state\u2019s primary. The requirement does not extend to the general election.\n\nHere\u2019s what the law says:\n\n\"This bill would enact the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, which would require a candidate for President, in order to have the candidate\u2019s name placed upon a primary election ballot, to file the candidate\u2019s income tax returns for the 5 most recent taxable years with the Secretary of State, as specified.\"\n\nTrump has refused to release his returns, saying since his campaign for president they are under audit.\n\nTrump, the Republican National Committee and California Republican Party have all filed lawsuits over SB 27, arguing it is unconstitutional and \"a naked political attack\" on Trump. The law passed on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\n\nSome legal analysts have questioned it, as did former Gov. Jerry Brown when he vetoed a similar law two years ago, saying it would create a slippery slope of trying to force candidates to release additional information to run for president.\n\nThe courts will eventually decide on its constitutionality. But as it stands, it does not prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot.\n\nAsked about the accuracy of the claim, a spokesperson for the California Republican Party pointed to a news release on the party\u2019s website about the lawsuits. The release criticizes the law and contends Democrats are using it \"to keep Republicans home\" during the next election.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t provide any information showing Trump was kicked off the ballot or prevented from being on it. California is still several months from finalizing its ballot for the March 2020 primary.\n\nAfter we asked about the claim, the headline on the party\u2019s website changed slightly from President Trump \"kicked off\" the ballot to President Trump \"off\" the ballot.\n\nAnother line changed from asking donors to contribute to get Trump \"back on the ballot\" to get him \"on the ballot.\"\n\nThe California Republican Party recently claimed President Trump was \"kicked off the California ballot\" as a result of Senate Bill 27.\n\nThe recently signed law requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state\u2019s primary. It does not apply to candidates in the general election.\n\nRepublicans are challenging the law in court, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional.\n\nThe law very well may be struck down by a court. But, as written, it does not kick Trump off the ballot or prevent him from being on it. That ballot is still several months from being finalized.\n\nIt might be a difficult decision for Trump to release his tax returns, which he has refused to do, but it still provides this avenue for him and all future candidates for president and governor to appear on the primary ballot.\n\nThe message on the state party\u2019s website is blatantly false, ignores any mention of what\u2019s actually in the law and how candidates can comply. What\u2019s more, the false message is being used as a fundraiser.\n\nFor these reasons, we rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
