As we explained, part of the reason for so many cancellations is because of an unusually early (March 23, 2010) cut-off date for grandfathering plans \u2014 and because of tight regulations written by the administration. This was our most popular fact check of the year \u2014 and Obama\u2019s pledge also was also named PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s kids are protected by armed guards at their school\u201d\n\nPresident Obama offered an evocative image at a news conference when the sequester struck \u2014 janitors sweeping the empty halls of the Capitol, laboring for less pay. But it turned out that he was completely wrong. Janitorial staff did not face a pay cut \u2014 and Capitol Hill administrative officials even issued a statement saying the president\u2019s remarks were \u201cnot true.\u201d Then the White House tried to argue that janitors at least faced a loss of overtime. That was not correct either. The episode was emblematic of the administration\u2019s sequester rhetoric.\n\n\u201cClinton denied security for Libya personnel with her signature on a cable\u201d\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) charged that then- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in April of 2012 \u201csigned\u201d a cable directing a drawdown for security assets for the U.S. Embassy in Libya. The issue became a political flash point after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed at two U.S. compounds in Benghazi. But the claim that Clinton signed the cable was absurd, as every cable, even the most mundane, bears the secretary\u2019s \u201csignature,\u201d because it is automatically added by the communications center. There is no evidence Clinton was even aware of the request.\n\n\u201cThe day after Benghazi happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama did refer to an \u201cact of terror\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack, but in vague terms, wrapped in a patriotic fervor. He never affirmatively stated that the American ambassador died because of an \u201cact of terror.\u201d Then, over a period of two weeks, given three opportunities in interviews to affirmatively agree that the Benghazi attack was a terrorist attack, the president obfuscated or ducked the question. So this is a case of taking revisionist history too far for political reasons.\n\n\u201c70 cents of every dollar spent on food stamps goes to bureaucrats\u201d\n\nThe retiring Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) has been a rich source of material, and it\u2019s hard to pick from her many 4-Pinocchio remarks. But this one takes the cake. She asserted that, for the food stamp program, the math was $3 in food stamps for the needy, $7 in wages for the bureaucrats who manage the program. But it turned out she misunderstood an analysis concerning anti-poverty programs, and then applied an incorrect ratio to the wrong type of program. Budget documents show that staff salaries amount to one-third of 1 percent of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s budget for food and nutrition programs.\n\nAt least twice in 2013, Secretary of State John F. Kerry claimed that he opposed the invasion of Iraq. But not only did he vote in favor of a congressional authorization for war, but there is a rich paper trail documenting his repeated support for the attack after President George W. Bush launched it in 2003. As Kerry put it on May 3, 2003: \u201cI think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.\u201d This is another example of after-the-fact historical revisionism.\n\n\u201cDemocrats took $50 billion from overcharging students on college loans and used it to pay for Obamacare\u201d\n\n\u201cA state investigation said Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli should have been prosecuted.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe may have won the Virginia governor\u2019s race, but he also takes the prize for the most outlandish claim made during the bitter fight. A state investigation found that Cuccinelli did not break the law by accepting Star Scientific stock. Nothing in the report said he should be prosecuted, but the Democratic nominee assumed that if the law had made Cuccinelli\u2019s actions a felony, he would have been prosecuted. That was Alice in Wonderland logic.\n\n\u201cObama is closing the U.S. Embassy in the Vatican\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee claimed that Obama decided to close the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican as part of some sort of attack on Catholics. But the embassy was simply being moved to the same diplomatic compound as the U.S. Embassy in Italy \u2014 with a different building and address \u2014 as part of security and cost savings recommendations made during the George W. Bush administration. Obama had nothing to do with it.", "lang": "en"}
