Biden raised the issue in the context of denouncing the president\u2019s budget for \u201ccutting a billion dollars out of the \u2014 all the social safety net, this outfit, whether it\u2019s Medicare, Medicaid, whether \u2014 across the board.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget would attempt to squeeze $920 billion from Medicaid, though the plan faces fierce opposition from Democrats. He also is seeking hundreds of billions of dollars in savings from Medicare, but as we have documented before, these ideas are mostly borrowed from Barack Obama proposals.\n\nStill, SNAP participation had fallen before Trump\u2019s election. SNAP participation generally tracks with the official poverty rate, which has been falling since 2010. And, generally speaking, lower unemployment means people are less reliant on SNAP benefits. But Trump has also sought to tighten eligibility rules, which could remove 700,000 people from food stamps over the next five years.\n\nIt turns out that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, not Trump, was a strong supporter of fingerprinting food stamp recipients. It was an idea implemented in 1996 under then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, but Bloomberg fought hard to keep the fingerprinting program in place even after states such as California and Texas \u2014 and the rest of New York state \u2014 abandoned the practice.\n\nBloomberg complained that ending the program would lead to greater fraud. As recently as 2018, he defended the fingerprinting requirement, even though Arizona, the last state that had continued the practice, had abandoned it a year earlier. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said it was a wasteful program that turned up only 10 duplicate applications out of more than 1 million.\n\n\u201cWe had something called food stamps \u2014 there\u2019s a long name for what the program is but it\u2019s a program where you have to work to get food stamps,\u201d Bloomberg said during an interview with International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde. \u201cWhat we found was that were a handful of people who signed up under different names, and they were getting four or five times the amount that they were supposed to get, which meant that we couldn\u2019t take care of some of the people who really deserved it. \u2026 So what we did is we fingerprinted people so you could only register once. Now, there was a lot of yelling and screaming and saying we\u2019re invading your personal space by looking at your fingerprints. Well that may be, but you can\u2019t come to work for New York City unless we fingerprint you first, so it is not unreasonable to think the beneficiaries of our program would get fingerprinted, too, and we\u2019re just stopping people from breaking the law, which is hurting other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMayor Bloomberg consistently said he thought fingerprinting made sense as a way to make sure people only signed up once, and he gave many examples of the different uses for fingerprinting, including that all city employees were fingerprinted,\u201d Wood said. \u201cMore importantly, though, he increased access to food stamps and the number of people who were able to receive them went up during his mayoralty, whereas President Trump is working to limit the program.\u201d She also noted that Bloomberg opposed congressional efforts to cut benefits.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden believes that the ultimate test of who we are is how we treat the least fortunate among us, and he thinks it\u2019s outrageous that the Trump administration has been attempting to make it harder for Americans who have fallen on hard times to ensure they can eat,\u201d spokesman Andrew Bates said. \u201cMayor Bloomberg\u2019s attempt to require families who needed that kind of assistance to submit to fingerprinting fell very much in the same vein as these Trump policies. Sometimes Republican billionaires make it easy to mix up their records.\u201d\n\nIn this campaign, we\u2019ve seen Biden often get stories mixed up, mislead about his record or tell tall tales. He was talking about Trump, but somehow slipped in an attack line against Bloomberg, even using the high-dudgeon word \u201cimmoral.\u201d\n\nTrump has sought to tighten eligibility, but he has not required fingerprinting. That was an idea briefly in vogue in the 1990s, but it\u2019s an idea whose time has passed. Meanwhile, Bloomberg still defends the practice, so it\u2019s not even as if he\u2019s flip-flopped on the issue.", "lang": "en"}
