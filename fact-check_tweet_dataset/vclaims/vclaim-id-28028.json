The attached black and white photo shows a massive crowd of people filling the bridge.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWhat\u2019s true: the photo does show thousands of people crammed on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWhat\u2019s not true: The photo isn\u2019t of the 1937 opening. It was taken in 1987 and shows masses of people walking the bridge to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 8,981-foot long suspension bridge.\n\nHere is a San Francisco Chronicle slideshow of pictures from the 1987 event (it includes the one in the Facebook post), and here\u2019s another slideshow from the 1937 opening, with significantly fewer people walking the bridge.\n\nThere is no evidence that the bridge \"almost collapsed\" at its 1937 opening. So what about in 1987 when this photo was actually taken? Did it almost collapse then?\n\nSome people on the bridge that day thought it might.\n\n\"Ten years ago, while trapped shoulder to shoulder in the mob, unable to move for more than two hours, I remember discussing with my wife the real possibility that we were about to participate in one of the 20th century's landmark disasters. A bridge collapse would have put to shame all those petty Third World bus and ferry tragedies you read about in the newspaper,\" Winston Montgomery, a painting and plastering contractor in San Francisco wrote in 1997.\n\nHigh winds swayed the bridge and an arch on the bridge deck flattened with the weight of the crowd.\n\nBut engineers told the Mercury News that a collapse wasn\u2019t likely because the bridge was over-engineered to withstand all that weight. No deaths were reported in connection to the 1987 event.\n\nA Facebook post claimed to show \"the Golden Gate Bridge opening to the public for the first time back in 1937, and yes, it almost collapsed.\"\n\nThe photo isn\u2019t from the bridge\u2019s 1937 opening, but from a 1987 celebration of the bridge\u2019s 50th anniversary. While some people in the 1987 crowd feared a collapse, engineers later said the bridge was built to sustain the crowd. There\u2019s no evidence a collapse was imminent at its opening in 1937.", "lang": "en"}
