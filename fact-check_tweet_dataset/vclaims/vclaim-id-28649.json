According to the controller of budget, the 47 counties spent 57.8% of their budgets on regular expenditure such as salaries in the last financial year, not 87.3% as Kenyatta said.\n\nFor development, the spending was 48.1%, not 12.7% as the president gave in his address.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown on how this is calculated, please see the box below.\n\n\n\n \n\n President\u2019s 87.3% figure is share of recurrent not \u2018entire budget\u2019 \n\n\n\n from the counties\u2019 reports and \n\n\n\n The office reported that it approved withdrawals of KSh324.12 billion by the counties for the financial year. Of this, KSh251.96 billion was for recurrent spending and KSh72.16 billion for development. \n\n\n\n Of this available KSh324.12 billion, the counties actually spent KSh303.83 billion. Some KSh236.94 billion was recurrent spending and KSh66.89 billion went to development. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n This means that out of the counties\u2019 KSh271.32 billion budget for recurrent expenditure, KSh236.94 billion (or 87%) was spent. This was the figure given by the president. \n\n\n\n But the KSh236.84 billion works out to 57.8% of the entire KSh410.5 billion budget as said by the president. His number is thus incorrect. \n\n\n\n County governments spent KSh66.89 billion on development projects. As a portion of the \u201centire budgets\u201d this works out to 16.3%, not the 12.7% Kenyatta claimed. And it makes up 48.1% of the total development budget. \n\n\n\nConclusion: Counties spent 57.8% of total budget on recurrent expenditure and 16.3% on development\n\nKenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta said county governments spent 87.3% of their budget on regular expenses such as salaries and only 12.7% on development projects in the 2017/18 financial year. He was arguing against nurses\u2019 demands for higher wages.\n\nThe 87.3% figure is accurate when only the counties recurrent budget is considered. But Kenyatta said this number represented the recurrent share of the counties \u201centire budgets\u201d. This is inaccurate - as a share of their total (or entire) budgets it is actually 57.8%.\n\nFurther, 16.3% of the entire budget was spent on development projects - not 12.7% as he said.", "lang": "en"}
