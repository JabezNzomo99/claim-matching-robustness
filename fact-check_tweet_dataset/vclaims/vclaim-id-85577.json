The embassy declared that there were \u201cconfirmed reports\u201d of cholera that have killed people, whereas USAID, citing the World Health Organization and the Sudanese government, said there were cases of \u201cacute watery diarrhea,\u201d known in medical circles as AWD.\n\nThe first indication of a problem in Sudan was in August 2016, when 100 deaths, mainly children, were reported in Sudan\u2019s Blue Nile state. \u201cA medical worker from Blue Nile state revealed an increase in incidences of diarrhea that he believes to be cholera,\u201d reported Radio Dabanga, an independent news source that operates out of the Netherlands with correspondents in the field. \u201cHe attributes the spread to polluted water and said that hospitals in the state have to isolate patients with diarrhea to avoid infecting others.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khartoum has actively sought to prevent hospitals, doctors and journalists from reporting that there is a cholera outbreak. As far back as January, doctors reported that laboratory tests on acute diarrhea samples proved that it was cholera. \u201cThe management problems at the Health Ministry have impeded containment of the disease. Instead of acknowledging the disease and taking measures to prevent the spread of cholera during the past six months, the authorities opted for not announcing the test results,\u201d said one doctor.\n\n\u201cWHO has not received any lab results to date that confirm cholera in Sudan,\u201d said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. \u201cHowever, the Government of Sudan has confirmed an outbreak of AWD. Preventing the spread of the AWD outbreak and saving lives are two of the highest priorities for WHO and Sudan\u2019s Federal Ministry of Health. WHO is coordinating efforts with all parties to ensure an effective and rapid response. Early detection is key to containing any outbreak, regardless of the cause.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cwhether an outbreak is called \u2018cholera\u2019 or \u2018acute watery diarrhea\u2019 does not alter WHO response, and in the case of Sudan, WHO and partners are free to act on the ground to support the government in providing people with the care they need.\u201d He did not respond to a query about whether a cholera declaration would allow the use of the cholera vaccine to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nIn an open letter to WHO, a group of U.S. physicians have decried \u201cWHO\u2019s failure to confirm or disconfirm the findings of Sudanese labs tests in Geneva, using stool samples appropriately transferred from Sudan.\u201d Addressing WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the letter said: \u201cYour failure to transport stool samples from victims in Sudan to Geneva for official confirmation of cholera makes you fully complicit in the terrible suffering and dying that continues to spread, out of control, with daily new reports confirming that this is indeed a cholera epidemic.\u201d\n\nA USAID spokesman noted that \u201ctypically, a cholera outbreak is declared by the Ministry of Health in the affected country, in coordination with the World Health Organization. In Sudan, there is no official cholera declaration.\u201d He said USAID was responding to the AWD outbreak and added: \u201cThe United States calls on the Government of Sudan to support timely testing and identification of the causes of acute watery diarrhea, in order to enable both government and international donor efforts to address the immediate outbreak, and provide longer-term solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time a specific disease appears in certain nations, political sensitivities unfortunately arise about announcing it,\u201d said Amesh A. Adalja, senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cCholera is a disease that does carry some stigma around it and that may be behind the \u2018acute watery diarrhea\u2019 label despite the diagnosis of cholera being confirmed. In early stages of an outbreak when precise causation hasn\u2019t been established, a clinical descriptor will temporarily suffice but once a definite disease agent has been confirmed it is important to name it exactly and respond accordingly.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, the death toll may be higher (800) in Sudan than South Sudan (250), but that\u2019s because WHO has been able to respond to the crisis in South Sudan with a program of vaccinations and education about the deadly disease. The Pinocchios here are mainly for the Sudanese government, which refuses to admit an apparent cholera outbreak, but WHO and USAID should not escape blame either. Words make a difference. The accusations that WHO\u2019s director-general tried to mask a cholera outbreak in Ethiopia by labeling it as AWD, when tests showed otherwise, make it even more imperative that the international agency should appear above politics.", "lang": "en"}
