A whistle blew, an impeachment inquiry swung into motion and the president at the center of it all rose defiantly to his own defense, not always in command of the facts. A CIA officer, in a complaint filed under federal whistleblower protections that preserve anonymity, alleged President Donald Trump abused his office in pressing for a Ukrainian investigation of a Democratic rival, Joe Biden. That revelation persuaded Democrats to move ahead with an inquiry that could produce articles of impeachment. Trump has reacted with anger, with weekend tweets that made the groundless accusation that Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman taking the lead in the impeachment review, criticised him \"illegally.\" A look at Trump's recent words on impeachment, Ukraine and other subjects: Why Democrats Have Pivoted Towards Donald Trump\u2019s Impeachment\n\nTRUMP: \"Liddle' Adam Schiff... fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up & twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming & libeling me.\" \u2014 tweets on Saturday, 28 September. THE FACTS: He is exaggerating Schiff's exaggerations. The California Democrat, in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing, mocked and overstated the president's pleas in his 25 July call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Trump does with his critics routinely. Schiff's remarks are not illegal nor would it be defamatory or libelous, because lawmakers are shielded from liability for comments made in the course of Congress under the \"speech or debate\" clause in the Constitution, which seeks to foster political debate. During Thursday\u2019s House intelligence committee hearing, Schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in \u201cessence\u201d what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy when \u201cshorn of its rambling character.\u201d No exact transcript of Trump's comments with Ukraine's president actually exists, just a rough transcript released by the White House. Democrats have enough votes to launch Trump impeachment\n\nTRUMP, describing the 25 July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart: \"Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday. TRUMP: \"My call was perfect.\" \u2014 remarks to reporters on Thursday. THE FACTS: It's a big stretch for Trump to say he placed no pressure on Zelenskiy in that phone call \u2014 a conversation marked by Trump's blunt remark: \"I would like for you to do us a favor,\" according to a White House account of the call. Trump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy to help investigate Biden and son Hunter, as well as to look into a cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and concluded it was carried out by Russia. The call followed a monthslong campaign by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, conducted on Trump's behalf to get Ukrainians to scrutinise Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine when Joe Biden was vice president. It also followed Trump's abrupt suspension of military aid for Ukraine that Congress had approved. The aid was recently released.\n\nWhen Zelenskiy thanked Trump for past US aid and suggested his country might need more, Trump switched the topic to the investigation he wanted Ukraine to do. He asked Zelenskiy to work with Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani on the matter. As for the call being \"perfect,\" it was actually worrisome enough so that White House attorneys moved a rough transcript of it to a highly secure system where fewer officials would have access to it than is normally the case for conversations between Trump and world leaders. The call and the broader effort to win a foreign government\u2019s help on a matter that could benefit Trump\u2019s reelection are what sparked the impeachment inquiry. TRUMP, denouncing information from the whistleblower: \"All second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate.\" \u2014 tweeted on Friday, 25 September. THE FACTS: The whistleblower's accusations have not been shown to be incorrect. Several key details have actually been corroborated. For example, the White House account of the 25 July phone call showed that the whistleblower had accurately summarised the conversation, as relayed by unidentified US officials, in the complaint sent to the acting director of national intelligence.\n\nTRUMP: \"I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they're not doing it; it's the United States. ... Why is it only the United States putting up the money?\" \u2014 remarks to reporters Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't only the US putting up money. It's false to say \"nobody else is there.\" European Union institutions have provided far more development assistance than the US \u2014 compared with $204 million from Washington. EU members, Japan and Canada also contribute significantly. Since 2014, the EU and European financial institutions have mobilised more than $16 billion to help Ukraine's economy, counter corruption, build institutions and strengthen its sovereignty against further incursions by Russia after its annexation of Crimea.\n\nThe US is a heavy source of military assistance. The aid package held back by Trump, and recently released, amounted to nearly $400 million in such aid. But NATO also contributes a variety of military-assistance programs and trust funds for Ukraine. In most such cases, the programs are modest and NATO countries other than the US take the lead. TRUMP, in the 25 July call with Ukraine's leader: \"Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk.\" \u2014 according to White House account of the conversation, released Wednesday. THE FACTS: Germany is the third largest bilateral donor to Ukraine, after the EU and the US. \"Anyone who views this soberly will conclude Germany is strongly involved,\" said German foreign ministry spokesman Rainer Breul. TRUMP: \"It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam), but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing... Gun Safety ... and much more!\" \u2014 tweet Saturday, 28 July. Analysis: Trump, Johnson and the Messiness of Democracy\n\nTRUMP, speaking of the Democratic senator from Connecticut: \"Chris Murphy \u2014 who I've been dealing with on guns \u2014 you know, so nice. He's always, 'Oh, no, we want to work it out. We want to work it out.' But they're too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt.\" \u2014 news conference Wednesday, 25 July. THE FACTS: Trump is the main holdup on gun control legislation as he mulls whether to endorse expanded background checks. The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill in February that would require background checks on all gun sales, including those between strangers who meet online or at gun shows. But Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said it's not clear the Senate would be able to pass the legislation or that Trump would sign it into law. Earlier this month, McConnell stressed that Congress would remain \"in a holding pattern \" on gun control as lawmakers await proposals from the White House. A proposal being floated by Barr on Capitol Hill would require background checks on all commercial gun sales, including at gun shows. But Trump told reporters this month the plan was one of many ideas under consideration and he would go \"very slowly.\"\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: \"We have before the Congress what will be the largest trade deal in American history. ... It's time for Congress to pass the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.\" \u2014 remarks on Thursday, 24 September in Indianapolis. THE FACTS: It's not the largest trade deal ever made. It covers the same three countries as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration is seeking to replace. In contrast, the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations concluded in 1994 created the World Trade Organisation and was signed by 123 countries. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found the following year that the WTO\u2019s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output. TRUMP on the effects of the impeachment inquiry: \"The stock market went up when they saw the nonsense. All of a sudden the stock market went down very substantially when they saw a charge. After they read the charge, the stock market went up very substantially.\" \u2014 remarks to reporters in New York on Wednesday, 25 September.\n\nTHE FACTS: First, he's not actually charged with anything. He's saying the market went down Tuesday when the impeachment drive was announced and up after the White House memo on his phone call with Ukraine's president came out. That\u2019s roughly right, but it\u2019s wrong to tie the market fluctuations solely \u2014 or even primarily \u2014 to the impeachment episode. The market cares even more about the economy, and currently the biggest wild card for the US economy is how much Trump's trade war with China could curtail growth. Since it began last year, the stock market has fallen with each escalation of tensions and risen when the two sides appeared close to resolving the dispute. The 142-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday was partly due to the impeachment developments but was also tied to Trump taking a hard line on China in a speech to the United Nations, which seemed to dim the prospects that coming talks would resolve the trade standoff. While the market did move higher Wednesday, 25 September after the release of the memo, the Commerce Department released some solid numbers on the housing market around the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS: A Ukrainian woman has never won the Miss Universe title. Several made the top 10 during Trump's tenure at the pageant, which he bought in 1996 and sold in 2015. But none took the prize in the pageant's history, which dates to 1952. Ukrainian Olesia Stefanko was first runner-up in 2011.", "lang": "en"}
