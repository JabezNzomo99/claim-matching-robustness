The names of those leaders were made available via an April 14, 2020 announcement from the White House.\n\nIncluded on that long list was Vince McMahon, CEO Of World Wrestling Entertainment, better known as WWE.\n\nA headline from the British tabloid Metro circulating on Facebook (\u201cDonald Trump names WWE\u2019s Vince McMahon as adviser to restart US economy\u201d) highlighted McMahon\u2019s involvement, prompting inquiries as to whether it was really true \u2014 and it was.\n\nMcMahon was among a total of 16 sports executives representing golf, football, basketball, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), and NASCAR racing, on the White House\u2019s list.\n\nMcMahon has a history with the president that includes being tackled and having his head shaved by Trump during WrestleMania\u2019s \u201cBattle of the Billionaires\u201d in 2011.\n\nAlthough McMahon was truly included in Trump\u2019s advisory group announcement, his was far from the only name mentioned and he did not appear to have been given any special role compared to the other business leaders listed. So it appears as though his name may have been singled out in headlines for sensational effect.", "lang": "en"}
