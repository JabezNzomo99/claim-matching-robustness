That rollout prompted renewed interest in a December 2013 article by Sam Fiorella (circulated widely in August 2014) warned potential Facebook Messenger users that the app\u2019s Terms of Service (TOS) \u201crequires the acceptance of an alarming amount of personal data and direct control over your mobile device\u201d:\n\nAs others such as the Washington Post noted, however, many of these permission requests are neither uncommon nor unreasonable and aren\u2019t really much different or more onerous than the permissions required by the main Facebook app itself:\n\nIn Facebook\u2019s defense, there are plenty of legitimate reasons for requesting these permissions. Messenger needs access to your camera, for instance, so that you can send pictures, and few people would want to confirm microphone access every time they use the app to place a call.These kinds of sweeping permissions are also extremely common \u2014 probably to a degree you don\u2019t realize. Even the most vanilla apps collect extraordinary amounts of personal data: WeatherBug requests permission to view your Wi-Fi network and other devices connected to it; RunKeeper wants permission to read your contacts and call log; even the Kim Kardashian game, which is all the rage these days, logs your location, your device ID, and your incoming calls. As with Messenger, the Kardashian game may have a valid reason to know when you get phone calls. (For instance, to save your spot before a call interrupts gameplay.) Yes, [the permission requests are potentially \u201cinsidious,\u201d but so are WhatsApp, Viber, MessageMe and virtually every other popular messaging app, all of which request comparably creepy permissions. On my insidiousness scale, at least, that ignorance of the devices and programs we use every day probably ranks higher than one overreaching app.\n\nAccording to Facebook themselves, \u201cthe concerns about its Messenger app are overblown and based on misinformation,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\nMuch of the problem, Facebook says, is due to Android\u2019s rigid policy on permissions. Facebook says it doesn\u2019t get to write its own, and instead must use generic language provided to them by Android. The language in the permissions \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the way the Messenger app and other apps use them,\u201d Facebook wrote in a Help Center article designed to address what it calls misinformation on the topic.Facebook also says the quotes in the [Sam Fiorella] article are outdated. Facebook says it has more control over the permissions language it uses in Apple iOS operating system, which handles the process differently. Android users must agree to all permissions at once, before using the app, for every feature an app might use. On iPhones, users agree to the permissions when they come up during the normal use of the app. For instance, if an iPhone user never makes a voice call with Facebook Messenger, the app might never ask for permission to use the phone\u2019s microphone. While Android app users must agree to all permissions before using the app, iPhone users can decline to give permission to the app for some features, like access to the address book and microphone, but still use the app to send messages. Due to this, the iPhone version of the app is superior for particularly privacy-conscious users. Regardless of the permissions, both the Android and the iOS Messenger apps are subject to the data use policies and terms that govern all Facebook users and every app within the Facebook family. The bottom line is that, while some users might think it\u2019s a drag to download a separate app for a feature that was once included in a single app, they\u2019re not actually giving up a significant amount of additional privacy in the process.\n\nThe brouhaha over Facebook Messenger\u2019s Terms of Service does highlight a couple of important issues with the apps many of us use these days. One is that \u201cfree\u201d products are not truly free \u2014 someone has to pay for their development, deployment, and maintenance, and that funding is commonly accomplished these days by serving up ads to users. But advertisers want to be able target and personalize their ads to specific groups of viewers, and that targeting requires knowledge of information about users such as their geographic locations, age, browsing habits, and the like. Providing this information is the trade-off we engage in as \u201cpayment\u201d for the acquisition and use of free apps.\n\nAnother issue is that nearly all of us blindly accept the Terms of Service presented to us when we buy or download software without reading them, and that the TOS are becoming so increasingly lengthy that most of us simply couldn\u2019t read, understand, and process them if we wanted to. A 2008 study found (as summarized by techdirt) that it would take the average person about a month of working time out of each year to just \u201cread all the privacy policies you encounter on a daily basis\u201d (exclusive of Terms of Service):\n\n[A] report notes that if you actually bothered to read all the privacy policies you encounter on a daily basis, it would take you 250 working hours per year \u2014 or about 30 workdays. The full study by Aleecia M. McDonald and Lorrie Faith Cranor is quite interesting. They measure the length of privacy policies, ranging from just 144 words up to 7,669 words (median is around 2,500 words) and recognize that at a standard reading pace of 250 words per minute, most privacy policies take about eight to ten minutes to read. They also ran some tests to figure out how long it actually takes people to read and/or skim privacy policies.They put all of this together and estimated that it would normally take a person about 244 hours per year to read every new privacy policy they encountered \u2026 and even 154 hours just to skim them. And, here\u2019s the thing: that\u2019s only for privacy policies. Imagine if you read terms of service and end user license agreements too \u2026\n\nWhether Facebook Messenger\u2019s TOS are truly \u201cinsidious\u201d or not, Sam Fiorella warned that if users are willing to accept TOS as lengthy and involved as Facebook Messenger\u2019s without reading them, app developers might be \u201cemboldened\u201d to include even more potentially invasive conditions in future TOS:\n\nIf this many people have not read the Messenger Terms of Service (or have read it and don\u2019t care), how emboldened will mobile developers be in the future? I understand the nature of \u201cfree\u201d mobile apps. I\u2019m prepared to give up some personal data for the right to access a game, content, or social network for free and to have an improved advertising experience while enjoying that free service. However, Facebook has pushed this too far. It\u2019s time we stood up and said \u201cno!\u201d\n\nAs exemplified by this comment and answer exchange between Sam Fiorella and a reader, all of this concern highlights a common modern dilemma: In order for apps to do what they need to do efficiently, they need to be granted a variety of accesses and permissions by users. Do we accept that such access will not be used for malicious purposes (by either the developers or unauthorized third parties), or do we give up ease of use in exchange for more cumbersome protections?\n\nOh for crying out loud\u2026[Facebook Messenger] needs permission to record audio & video so that you can send an audio or video message. It can\u2019t do it without you asking it to. It can make calls if you ask it to because it links your facebook and local contacts lists. It absolutely CANNOT do these things without YOU initiating them! It needs the permission in advance so that when you ask it to do these things, they WORK.\n\n Thanks for the comment. I would agree that it\u2019s not Facebook Messenger\u2019s intention to record audio or take a photo without being initiated (e.g., taking/adding a pic to a text msg) but once you give permission for the app to do so automatically, what\u2019s to stop a hacker or other app from doing so? We have too much blind faith \u2026 that\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make.", "lang": "en"}
