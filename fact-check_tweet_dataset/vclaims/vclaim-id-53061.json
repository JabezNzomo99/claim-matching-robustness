It is being claimed that the video of brutality is from the time when Jayaraj and his son Bennix were allegedly being subjected to custodial torture.\n\nThe caption translated from Tamil in English reads: \u201cA scene has surfaced where Edappadi\u2019s air force brutally murdered innocent businessman Jayaraj and his son Pennix in the devil\u2019s pond.\u201d\n\nThe video was widely shared by several users on social media. Such posts can be seen here, here, here, here.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Old picture shared as Indian soldiers marching towards China\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video to be FAKE.\n\nWe extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search. The search led us to a Times of India article dated July 29, 2019, which had featured the extended version of the video.\n\nOn closely analysing both videos and comparing various elements, we found that the video in question is from the same incident but with a different angle.\n\nAccording to several reports, the incident took place in Nagpur in July 2019 when a man working as a driver identified as Vicky Aaglawe, a resident of Kamleshwar, Nagpur, was hung with a rope tied to the office ceiling and beaten up with belt and sticks.\n\nIn conclusion, we can safely say that that the video in question is old and has no connection with the recent custodial deaths of Jayaraj and Bennix in Tamil Nadu which took place in June 2020.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
