The letter is being sent to Village Sarpanches asking them to select five qualified members from their village for employment under the \u2018Saur Urja Mission Training and Employment Scheme\u2019. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the letter. \n\n\n\nClaim: Employment for five qualified persons from every village under the \u2018Saur Urja Mission Training and Employment Scheme\u2019. Fact: There is no government scheme with the name, \u2018Saur Urja Mission Training and Employment Scheme\u2019. Also, the government does not ask demand drafts in the name of private enterprises (like \u2018Urja Enterprises, in this case) for official recruitments. In the letter, there are also many spelling and grammatical errors, which are very rare to find in an official letter. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the \u2018Saur Urja Mission Training and Employment Scheme\u2019 on Google, it can be found that there is no such government scheme. The results only show about the \u2018Suryamitra Scheme\u2019, under which training is provided to youth in the Solar Energy sector (More about \u2018Suryamitra Scheme\u2019 can be read here and here). Also, when searched on the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy website, no such scheme was found.\n\nIn the letter, it is mentioned that the interested candidates should fill the form and send a demand draft (DD) of Rs. 1000 in the name of \u2018Urja Enterprises\u2019, payable at Delhi. But no government agency asks for a DD in the name of a private enterprise for official recruitments. Also, a lot of spelling and grammatical errors can be found in the letter. No official notification or note contains such errors. It can also be observed that there is no Ministry name or Department name on the letter.\n\nA similar fake letter in the name of \u2018Gram Vikas Rozgar Yojana\u2019 is also being sent to Sarpanches across the country. FACTLY has already debunked it and wrote a fact-check article on it.\n\nTo sum it up, letters offering employment under the \u2018Saur Urja Mission Training and Employment Scheme\u2019 are fake. There is no such scheme.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
