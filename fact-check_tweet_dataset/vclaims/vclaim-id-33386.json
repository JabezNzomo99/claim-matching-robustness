No, that's not true: a death hoax about the singer was launched by a website that is linked to several other celebrity death hoaxes. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by \"chanteur-news-info.fr\" on October 14, 2018 titled \"Accident grave \u00e0 Paris - Le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre chanteur Stromae est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 aujourd'hui \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 33 ans, des suites d'un accident de la route.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe famous singer Stromae died today as a result of a road accident. The singer returned from the concert and was hit by another car. He was taken to the hospital where he died. Stromae by his real name Paul Van Haver, or Paul, born March 12, 1985 in Etterbeek, is a singer-songwriter and producer of hip-hop, electronic music and French French song from Laeken, Brussels4,5.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nNo mention of the singer's death was made on his official Facebook page or in any other mainstream news outlet. Most of the article was just copy pasted from his Wikipedia entry. More importantly the image used to illustrate the story is actually from a 2017 article about a Spanish truck that had an accident on a French highway:\n\nIn addition to that the website spreading the hoax is using Adsense ads to monetize its articles and it uses the Adsense ID \"ca-pub-7530693347425879\". This ID was also found earlier on a website on the domain \"pro-inside.website\" which was responsible for a death hoax about French actor Sami Naceri about a year ago:\n\nSo you probably shouldn't trust any news coming from this new website either...", "lang": "en"}
