New York State recently passed a law requiring citizens to obtain a permit if they wish to gaze at the stars in public parks. No, really. You read that right. In New York, you must pay for a license to look at the freaking stars. The Free Thought Project first reported on the story, explaining that \u201cIf citizens of the state wish to look up at the sky and view the stars at one of New York\u2019s public parks, they will first have to obtain a \u2018Stargazing permit.\u2019\u201d The site pointed out that pollution in the sky makes it more difficult for New Yorkers in \u201chighly populated areas\u201d to see the sky at night, so they travel to remote areas, many of which are located in state parks. The state is charging residents $35 to become a fully-licensed stargazer allowed to view the stars between January and December of the year. If you are not lucky enough to be a New York resident and you are just visiting, you will have to fork over $60 for the privilege of admiring your favorite constellation in the night sky.\n\nRed State\u2019s report followed a Jan. 24 post on the libertarian website Free Thought Project.\n\nThe core claim in those reports \u2014 that New York state required a specially designated stargazing permit for certain public parks \u2014 was accurate. In December 2019, the New York state agency for Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation published the details of the 2020 stargazing permit, which allowed \u201cafter sunset parking for stargazing only\u201d at six designated state parks on Long Island, New York:\n\nAlthough the stargazing permit came to prominence in January 2020, it was not new, contrary to Red State\u2019s claim that \u201cNew York State recently passed a law requiring citizens to obtain a permit if they wish to gaze at the stars in public parks.\u201d In fact, the stargazing permit has been in existence since December 2016.", "lang": "en"}
