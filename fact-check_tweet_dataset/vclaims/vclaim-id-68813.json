Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to curb the spread of fake news.\n\nThe post came the same day that news broke of a grand jury approving criminal charges in Mueller\u2019s probe. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office did not immediately announce who was being indicted.\n\nThe FreedomJunkshun.com post said conservative outlet Breitbart broke the news, posting a fake quote that read:\n\n\"While we won\u2019t go to press ourselves until Monday, we can say with some certainty that Senators Hal Lindsay and Mel Shearer along with Representatives Kurt Mishtain and Bob Newfork will face charges of collusionm with the Russian governement to change the outcome of the 2016 election.\" (sic)\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen, of course, and not just because the alleged Breitbart story to which FreedomJunkshun.com linked actually directed readers to a July performance of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at a theater in Berea, Ky.\n\nThere are no members of Congress in either the House or Senate by those names, either. (The fake Hal Lindsay was previously caught up in a fake news saga involving a drug bust, as chronicled by a site related to FreedomJunkshun.com.)\n\nOn Oct. 30, the real indictments came down, with President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates pleading not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, also was indicted for lying to the FBI and pleaded guilty.\n\nFreedomJunkshun.com is member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.\n\nThe website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.\"\n\nWe\u2019re indicting this story as another attempt by the troll network to capitalize on the news of the day.
