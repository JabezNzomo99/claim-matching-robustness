This can only be compared to lootings dating back to Napoleon\u2019s Italian campaigns, or to those during the times of Nazi aggression. I think that the Dutch court ruling was absolutely politicized. It destroys the very system of exhibition exchange,\u201d RT quoted Medinsky as saying.\n\nUkrainian authorities welcomed the December 2016 decision, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin saying: \u201cThe Scythian gold is coming back home - to Ukraine. I\u2019m sure, it will also return to Ukrainian Crimea.\u201d\n\nThe four Crimean museums \u2013 the Central Museum of Tavrida, Kerch Historical and Cultural Preserve, Bakhchysarai Historical and Cultural Preserve and Chersonesus Historical and Cultural Preserve \u2013 were given three months to appeal the decision, which they did on March 28, 2017.\n\nRussia\u2019s TASS state media outlet says a court spokesman told the agency the Amsterdam Court of Appeals would deliver a verdict in the Scythian gold case on June 11, 2019.\n\nThe international community, by and large, does not recognize Crimea as Russian territory, and a March 2014 United Nations General Assembly vote backed Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nElena Gagarina, director of the Kremlin Museum in Moscow, said in December 2016 that she understood the Dutch court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIn this case, when these objects were taken from the territory of Ukraine and belonged to Ukraine as a state, this decision seems perfectly reasonable to me,\u201d Reuters quoted her as telling Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Ministry of Culture first agreed to transfer the collection, at that time under the auspices of the State Museum Fund of Ukraine.\n\nThe Director of the Central Museum of Tavrida, Andrei Mal\u2019gin, has argued that the Scythian artifacts are fundamentally under Crimean, and not Ukrainian, dominion.\n\nThe items were excavated in Crimea, and funding for the excavation came from the local budget, not the central one, Mal\u2019gin told the Russian-language Ukrainian newspaper Segodnya. He added that he believed the outcome would depend on the \u201cpolitical situation.\u201d\n\nBut Lyudmila Strokovich, head of the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, told Segodnya the Crimean museums, which \u201cimmediately recognized themselves as Russian,\u201d did not coordinate with Kyiv when extending the contract governing the loan of the items to the Dutch museum. This, in her words, meant that after June 13, 2014, the exhibits had the status of having been \u201cillegally exported from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRalph Oman, a lecturer in intellectual property and patent law at the George Washington University Law School, told Polygraph.info that the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva is working on a new treaty that could protect folkloric treasures, including the Scythian gold.\n\nSuch a treaty would provide protection for \u201can undetermined number of years,\u201d but it \u201chas not yet been finalized or ratified,\u201d Oman said.\n\nOman said the Scythian gold case is analogous to \u201cformer colonies and materials being sent back to British museums,\u201d although that line of reasoning is likely a dead end for the Crimean museums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps a good moral argument [for returning the artifacts to Crimea], but not a strong legal one,\u201d he said.\n\nOman said the possibility the appellate court could uphold the lower court\u2019s decision was \u201cstrong,\u201d adding that \u201cto decide otherwise would be going out on a limb.\u201d\n\nGiven the highly complicated and precedential nature of the case, which remains under appeal, Polygraph.info finds that the museums\u2019 claim that there are \u201cno legal, cultural or historical reasons to hand these items over to Kyiv\u201d remains unclear.", "lang": "en"}
