Here is a quick round-up of the 10 biggest lies FactChecker busted this year: 35 Airports Built Over Last 4 Years, Said Modi, But Only 7 Operational \u201cSince Independence to 2014, over 67 years, there were 65 airports ie an average of one airport per year whereas for the past four years, on average, nine airports have been built per year,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on 24 September, 2018, at the inauguration of Sikkim\u2019s first airport in Pakyong. However, only seven airports were made operational over the last four years, between 2014 and 2018. That makes about two airports every year.\n\nJaitley\u2019s Claim on Aadhaar + Direct Benefit Transfer Gain of Rs 90,000 Cr Annually Is False \u201cThe saving due to Aadhaar and direct benefit transfer is Rs 90,000 crore per year. Rs 90,000 crore per year means four schemes like Ayushman Bharat (National Health Protection Scheme) can be implemented,\u201d Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on 2 November, 2018. His claim was false because government data shows Rs 90,000 crore was saved cumulatively till March 2018, and not every year. \u201cThe government\u2019s estimates of savings do not stand up to scrutiny, and whatever is termed as savings is often the result of a denial of legal entitlements,\u201d Reetika Khera, an economist at IIM-Ahmedabad, wrote in December 2017 in the Economic & Political Weekly.\n\nUP CM Claimed Govt Gave Farmers Rs 80,000 Cr, But It Actually Gave 1/6th The Amount Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in a televised interview on 19 February, 2018, talked about his government\u2019s performance over the preceding 10 months. \u201cIn the last 10 months, Uttar Pradesh government has disbursed over Rs 80,000 crore to farmers via direct benefit transfer,\u201d Adityanath said. The UP government gave Rs 14,540 crore in 2017-18 as direct benefit transfers (DBT) through 682.5 million transactions, according to the government\u2019s DBT dashboard as accessed on 21 February, 2018. \u201c100 smart cities are being developed at an expenditure of over Rs 2 lakh crore,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed as the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government completed four years in office at the Centre.\n\nIn fact, the union cabinet had approved less than a quarter of the funds (Rs 48,000 crore) at the launch of the mission in 2015, and till March 2018, only 21 percent had been disbursed and 1.8 percent utilised. This amounts to 0.09 percent of central funds used from the government\u2019s projected budget of Rs 2 lakh crore. Madhya Pradesh No 1 In Rape, No 1 In Farmer Suicide, No 1 In Unemployment, Said Kamal Nath. But He\u2019s Mostly Wrong \u201cNumber one in rape, number one in farmer suicide, number one in unemployment,\u201d the President of the Madhya Pradesh Congress, Kamal Nath, had said in a television interview in a comment on discontent among the state\u2019s electorate. Madhya Pradesh had India\u2019s highest number of rape cases, but in terms of crime rate\u2013cases of rape per 100,000 women \u2013 the state ranked the fifth highest. In 2015-16, Madhya Pradesh had an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, lower than the national average of 5 percent. In all, 23 states/union territories had higher unemployment rates than Madhya Pradesh, while only eight states and four union territories performed better.\n\nIn 2016, Madhya Pradesh had 1,321 farmer suicides, the third highest number in the country. The Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in the state in December 2003. After 2004, the state never reported the most farmer suicides in the country. No Riots in Gujarat, MP, UP & Chhattisgarh After Our Govts Came To Power: BJP Chief Amit Shah. All Claims False \u201cAfter our government was formed in Gujarat, not even a single riot took place. In Madhya Pradesh not a single riot occurred, in Chhattisgarh not a single riot occurred, and in Uttar Pradesh, after our government was formed, riots have stopped,\u201d claimed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Gujarat reported 35,568 riots between 1998 and 2016, including the 2002 riots, according to National Crime Records Bureau data. While Madhya Pradesh saw 32,050 riots between 2003 and 2016, when the party was in power, Chhattisgarh saw 12,265 during the same period and under BJP rule. Uttar Pradesh reported 195 communal riots in 2017, 10 months after the BJP formed the government, Lok Sabha data show.\n\nMinister To Parliament: No Data On Lynching. Here They Are (Including Government\u2019s Own) \u201cThe National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country,\u201d the union minister of state for home affairs, Hansraj Ahir, told the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) on 18 July, 2018. Between 2014 and 3 March, 2018, 45 persons were killed in 40 cases of mob lynching across nine states, and at least 217 persons had been arrested, data compiled by the home ministry show. In contrast, during the same period, FactChecker\u2019s two databases on mob violence\u2013due to child-lifting rumours and bovine-related religious intolerance \u2013 recorded 80 cases where attackers outnumbered the victims. Forty-one deaths were reported in such lynchings. This is without counting other instances of mob violence related to issues such as caste and moral policing.\n\nNo Bombings In Modi Era: Sadhguru. Fact: 400 Plus In 2016 Alone, Shows Official Data \u201cWe must know and acknowledge and appreciate and enjoy one thing\u2026that in the last four years there have been no bomb blasts in the country\u2026 Whatever is happening is only in the border area and unfortunately in Kashmir,\u201d Jaggi Vasudev, founder of Isha Foundation, was reported as saying in DNA on 16 September, 2018. His claim is false. Hundreds of bombings \u2013 more than 400 in 2016 alone, according to government data \u2013 were reported nationwide over the four years to 2018. As two elected representatives of the BJP, including a union minister, cited increasing Muslim population as a threat, the facts are: Muslim mothers have three children on average, while Hindus have two, but fertility rates are falling and Muslim population growth is at a 20-year low.\n\nNo more than 18.4 percent of Indians will be Muslim by 2050, from 14.4 percent in 2011, and after 32 years, three in four Indians (25 percent) will be Hindu, according to a FactChecker analysis of various sources. Fertility rates among Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains are lower than those among Hindus and Muslims. Over two years to 2017, India\u2019s forest cover increased by 6,778 sq km or 1 percent \u2013about the size of Sikkim \u2013 according to a government report. India is among the top 10 countries in terms of forest area, the government has claimed. Forest experts said the official definition of \u2018forest cover\u2019 is flawed: it includes forests converted to commercial plantations, as well as degraded and fragmented forests, and that the health of these forests is gauged by satellite imagery of inadequate resolution. The chief of the Forest Survey of India agreed, but said improving this resolution would take five to eight years.", "lang": "en"}
