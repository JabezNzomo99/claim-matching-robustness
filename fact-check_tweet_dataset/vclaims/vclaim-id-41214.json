Shortly after the fiery media event, a video began circulating on social media which supposedly showed the Finnish president relaying a few of his thoughts about his White House visit:\n\nThis video does not feature Finnish president Sauli Niinist\u00f6, but rather actor Rob Paulsen, best known for voicing the character of Pinky on show \u201cPinky and the Brain.\u201d\n\nPaulsen first shared this video to his social media pages, and while his fans almost certainly knew that this clip featured Paulsen doing a Finnish accent, it was later shared on Twitter and Facebook with no mention of the actor\u2019s name \u2014 leading some people to believe that the Finnish president actually said \u201cas much as I love your country I prefer the company of reindeer and snow\u201d:\n\nPaulsen wasn\u2019t the only one who tried to imagine what was going on in the Finnish president\u2019s head during his joint press conference at the White House. A number of internet users posted jokes and memes about the perceived political awkwardness at the media event, and CBS News reported of the event that:\n\nPresident Trump dominated the headlines with a heated press conference, during which he called Congressman Adam Schiff a \u201clowlife,\u201d doubled down on his attacks against the whistleblower, and threatened to sue several people. Caught in the crossfire between Mr. Trump and the reporters at the White House was the visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, who spent much of the event sidelined beside Mr. Trump. Niinist\u00f6, however, emerged from the crucible to win praise for the way he handled it. And because Americans can\u2019t resist using social media to express their feelings, Niinist\u00f6 also got the meme treatment. \u201cFinnish President doing a Jim from The Office,\u201d one person wrote, referring to the mockumentary character\u2019s signature stare into the camera \u2014 often used to say, without words, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m witnessing right now,\u201d or \u201cget me out of here.\u201d Finnish President doing a Jim from The Office", "lang": "en"}
