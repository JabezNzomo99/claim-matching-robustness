The mobile-phone software is being introduced to help work out who an infected person might have spread the virus to, but it's run into technical problems and the launch has been delayed.\n\nOne message we've seen being copied and pasted on Facebook asks the poster's friends to delete them as contacts from their phone and unfriend them on Facebook as the app will \"ask permission to access all of your contacts\".\n\nThis post misrepresents how the app works. It does not access a user's phone contacts but instead records when two people who both have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time.\n\nAnother variation that has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims that app users who walk past someone who later gets \"flu\" symptoms will automatically have to be quarantined, along with all their family.\n\nBut users who receive a notification from the app that they have been near someone who has developed symptoms do not automatically have to go into quarantine. If they live in a household where no-one is showing symptoms, they will be asked to follow social-distancing advice and look out for symptoms.\n\nThis story, which has been marked as containing \"false information\" by third-party fact checkers on Facebook, also claims you could be forced to have a vaccine under the new coronavirus law. There is no current legislation in the UK that can force you to take a vaccine.\n\nThe development of the NHS contact-tracing app has been accompanied by all manner of misinformation and conspiracy theories - but there are some genuine issues about privacy. The UK has chosen to go down a centralised route, but many other countries are developing decentralised apps. The team behind the UK app has insisted that this route will give the NHS more valuable information about how the virus is spreading.\n\nThis seems to misconstrue the aims of social distancing and contact tracing - and the use of any app to support it - which is to prevent the spread of the virus alongside the easing of social-distancing rules.\n\nDr Kaufman suggests the signal for the \"tracking software\" is clearer if people are separated from each other. But this isn't how the apps will work because they use your device's unique digital signature irrespective of how close it is to another phone.", "lang": "en"}
