The clip, actually from a Biden rally in Kansas City, Missouri, shows Biden saying, \u201cwe can only re-elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe tweet went viral and was shared by Trump campaign accounts.\n\nEven President Trump jumped into the fray to share and comment on it.\n\nThe moment also reached an audience outside the Twitterverse thanks to articles from popular Trump-friendly websites likeRedState, Townhall, and Gateway Pundit.\n\nThe Biden campaign has complained that Facebook allowed the video to circulate.\n\nAnd indeed, reviewing the video of Biden\u2019s speech at the rally shows that the clip was deceptively edited. Biden plainly stumbles over his words, as he has repeatedly throughout the campaign. But the video shared by Trump and his advocates is cut off before he finishes his sentence, leaving out important context. After criticizing negative attacks in the Democratic primary as being antithetical to unity, Biden said:\n\nAnd it fact, the full clip shows Biden making precisely the opposite point of the one attributed to him by Trump, his advocates and Trump-amplifying press. (Townhall later added an update to its original post that includes the full context of Biden\u2019s remarks.)\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
