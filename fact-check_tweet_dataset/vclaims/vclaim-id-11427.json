She has not voiced out plans for running for president in 2022, though there are rumors that she plans to do so. Her father, current President Rodrigo Duterte, has also said that he wants her to follow in his footsteps.\n\nDuterte has also been accused of corruption in the past, though she has never been arrested for the allegations. In February, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV filed for a Senate investigation into President Duterte and Sara Duterte\u2019s supposed violations of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.\n\nIn May, the Commission on Audit (COA) questioned the Davao City local government\u2019s irregular expenses. But Duterte said that those irregularities have already been addressed and resolved. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
