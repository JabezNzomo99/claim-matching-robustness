The latter report found that the American Health Care Act would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 23 million in 2026, compared to the ACA.\n\nThe center calculated that approximately 116,700 Mainers would see a net loss in insurance coverage under the plan by 2026.\n\nHere\u2019s how that breaks down: 57,300 fewer Medicaid recipients, 11,900 fewer people with employer-based coverage, and 47,500 fewer people with insurance obtained through the individual marketplace.\n\nThe combined total of 116,700 represents about 9 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nBut the number is a bit inflated\n\nThe ad is based on findings of a liberal-leaning group, so we contacted other research organizations considered more moderate, such as the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center.\n\nThe institute produced its own study of the state-by-state implications of the AHCA. Its prediction of uninsured Mainers was half as much as the Center for American Progress.\n\nIn the report, the Urban Institute estimated that by 2022, Maine would experience an increase in the uninsured by 56,000 people.\n\nUrban Institute fellow Linda Blumberg couldn\u2019t say exactly how the center divided up the CBO data, but explained that her organization got its estimation from a simulation that showed 23 million more people uninsured under the AHCA by 2022.\n\nThe estimated effects by state varied significantly in terms of numbers and percentages, Blumberg told PolitiFact.\n\nThis is a function of the distribution of health insurance coverage in each state, distribution of income, and a variety of other factors related to the population and how it varies by geographic location. In general, she said, states that had gained the most coverage under the ACA were estimated to lose the most under the AHCA.\n\nBlumberg pointed out that while CAP\u2019s estimation is higher, both organizations find that large percentage increases in the uninsured would have occurred under the AHCA in the state of Maine, had it passed.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, also estimated that premiums would have likely gone up in large swaths of Maine (particularly in Poliquin\u2019s district, which encompasses the entire portion of the state north of Portland and Augusta) under the AHCA, thus pricing many Mainers out of insurance.\n\nThe way the figure is presented\n\nThe mailer makes a blanket statement saying that Poliquin\u2019s vote was to \"strip\" 117,000 Mainers of health coverage.\n\nIt would be more accurate to say that, according to the Center for American Progress, 117,000 people could either lose their coverage, see a rise in premiums and be priced out, or be forced into an exclusion \u2014 which would limit coverage for a particular condition, but not coverage for those people entirely.\n\nAnother critical part of the coverage losses in Maine would likely lie in the Medicaid cutbacks of the AHCA, which was estimated to be cut by $880 million over a 10-year span.\n\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald, about 75 percent of Medicaid recipients under the state\u2019s \"MaineCare\" program are children, low-income senior citizens who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, and the disabled.\n\nThe Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance.\n\nThe group refers to his votes to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act.\n\nThe 117,000 figure comes from an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It is the highest of estimates we\u2019ve found.\n\nThe ad\u2019s language would lead the reader to believe that Poliquin literally voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of coverage, and that all would lose their coverage automatically. This is misleading.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate and needs additional context, so we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
