But the purchase targets were aggressive under normal circumstances \u2014 and now, with a global pandemic bearing down on the economy, the official U.S. data show Chinese imports lagging badly. Leading analysts said it\u2019s unrealistic to expect China will make up the difference in what remains of 2020.\n\nWell, U.S. exports to China have been declining this year. The trade agreement uses official customs data for its targets. The most recent U.S. data show Chinese purchases down 5 percent in June compared with the previous month. Exports to China are down 4.6 percent when comparing the first half of 2020 with the first half of last year, and down 16.5 percent compared with the corresponding period in 2017.\n\nIn the first half of the year, China imported $40.2 billion in products covered by the trade deal, less than one-quarter of its total 2020 purchase commitment, according to a tracker from the Peterson Institute. \u201cThrough the first six months of 2020, China\u2019s purchases of all covered products were thus only at 46 percent (US exports) or 47 percent (Chinese imports) of their year-to-date targets,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cEconomists in general were negative about the purchase commitments right from the start as government-to-government agreements are not how most trade is organized,\u201d Dollar wrote. \u201cFor example, the two sides agreed that the U.S. would sell more oil and gas to China. \u2026 U.S. firms are not particularly interested in selling to China at current market prices.\u201d\n\nDollar: \u201cSince August 1, there have reportedly been some orders for agricultural products such as soybeans and corn. Those orders could still be canceled so they may not materialize. If they do materialize, it is not plausible that they would be so large as to change the conclusion that China is not meeting the commitment.\u201d\n\nJeffrey J. Schott, a Peterson Institute senior fellow and trade expert: \u201cThe ability to fulfill the orders may have been impacted by the derecho that wiped out much of the corn and soybean crop in Iowa a few days ago. Even then, given current prices and reduced plantings of soybeans, it\u2019s hard to see how China could meet the dollar targets set for farm purchases. And China is nowhere close to the targets for purchases of energy products and manufactures.\u201d\n\n\u201cStronger export control\u201d and \u201crestrictive measures\u201d refer to the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on supplying Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and ZTE. For China, those trade actions create a more difficult political environment in which to ramp up U.S. imports, according to the analysts we surveyed, but the impact within the trade deal itself would be limited to manufactured semiconductors (while energy is the sector lagging the most).\n\n\u201cUnder perfect health, economic, and political conditions, China might have reached its 2020 purchase commitments,\u201d Scissors wrote. \u201cBut even without the pandemic, ideal economic and political conditions were unrealistic from the start. The Trump administration knew when signing the deal that it was going to act against Chinese technology firms and should have expected China to game the purchases \u2014 for example what country\u2019s oil and gas to buy \u2014 because that\u2019s what always happens.\u201d\n\nIn the first half of the year, China completed purchases for less than one-quarter of its annual target, and only 5 percent of the energy it committed to buy. Trump earns Three Pinocchios, as the Chinese are making some purchases. As for Trump\u2019s claim \u201cthey made the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans in history,\u201d there\u2019s no evidence yet to support that, and the White House declined to provide any. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the trade data to see if this fact check needs an increase in the Pinocchio rating.", "lang": "en"}
