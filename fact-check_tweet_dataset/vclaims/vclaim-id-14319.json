No, that's not true: Melissa Schiff is not related to Adam Schiff and the marriage ended in a divorce several years ago.\n\nThe claim keeps popping up in a viral meme, for example in this facebook post (archived here), where it was posted with following comment:\n\nHere is an example of the image in question:\n\nIt turns out you can make this up because somebody did.\n\nAdam Schiff is the son of Edward and Sherrill Schiff, as has been reported in multiple places, for example here:\n\nMelissa Schiff is the daughter of Marlene S. Schiff and Dr. Haskel Schiff as you can see in the actual announcement of her wedding with Robert Soros, son of George Soros:\n\nHowever the couple filed for divorce in 2014:\n\nBillionaire George Soros' eldest son, Robert, not only followed in his father's financier footsteps, holding a top post at the family investment fund, he also inherited his dad's famous problems with women. The 50-year-old scion quietly filed for divorce from his wife of 22 years in Manhattan Supreme Court last week, The Post can exclusively report.\n\nThat means the marriage was already over before Adam Schiff even became a member of the House Intelligence Committee in 2015 where he later was involved in investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.", "lang": "en"}
