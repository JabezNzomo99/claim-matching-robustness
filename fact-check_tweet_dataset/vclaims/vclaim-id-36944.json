That\u2019s a simplification\u2014anyone who is \u201cordinarily resident\u201d in the UK can get free treatment, regardless of what nationality they are, but there are limits on what people can claim as visitors.\n\nThere are 512 million people living across the EU, 446 million of whom are outside the UK, so they (and citizens of Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Norway) could get free NHS care if they were ordinarily resident in the UK. This is easier for them under EU free movement rules than it is for citizens of non-EU countries.\n\nVisitors who travel to England specifically for planned treatment do not receive free care, without prior special arrangement.\n\nVisitors whose treatment was unplanned receive it for free provided they hold a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). The framework in other parts of the UK is broadly similar.\n\nThe NHS is then allowed to recover these costs from the countries where these visitors have health insurance.\n\nIn practice the NHS doesn\u2019t recover much of this money. In 2013/14 it was estimated it recovered less than 20% of what could be recovered from other countries.\n\nThe UK isn\u2019t alone in having this sort of system. UK visitors to these European countries are similarly entitled to free (or discounted) state-provided healthcare for unplanned treatment under the EHIC scheme.", "lang": "en"}
