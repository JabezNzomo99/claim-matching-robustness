Following the road show, a Yuva Sammelan was also organized. The Yuva Sammelan was attended by Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and other ministers. At this event, Gujarat CM handed out job appointment letters to the youth. In his speech, Mr Rupani stated that Gujarat Government will forward all the support and create the infrastructure needed by youth in Gujarat for better career prospects.\n\nHowever, controversy arose when few men dressed in black clothes were disallowed entry into event. Besides these men, even women who were wearing black dupattas were made to take them off before allowing entry into the venue. When CM Vijay Rupani was questioned about this, he chose to skip the questions posed by journalists.

Youth from Patidar community have especially tried to raise slogans at multiple BJP events. The one that got most media attention was when BJP President Amit Shah had to finish his speech in a hurry and leave the venue when Patidar youth raised slogans and threw chairs at a event he attended in Surat.", "lang": "en"}
