Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming,\" Kasky said.\n\nThousands of Americans gathered in streets around the United States on March 24 to honor victims of gun violence and, generally speaking, to advocate for stricter gun laws.\n\nAccording to a North Carolina legislator, some March For Our Lives speakers also called for a far more nefarious approach. State Rep. Beverly Boswell, a Republican from the coast, suggested on her Facebook page that speakers at the marches expressed violent intentions.\n\n\"Many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration, confiscation, Second Amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government,\" Boswell wrote on her campaign Facebook page.\n\nBoswell, who\u2019s in her first term representing House DIstrict 6, has been an open critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. She recently referred to students who participated in the national school walkout as \"Tide pod\" eaters and boasted on Facebook about confronting a school leader who held an assembly on that day \u2014 which he says was simply to honor the victims of Parkland shooting.\n\nShe was also recently scolded by the North Carolina Board of Nursing for misrepresenting herself as a nurse.\n\nBoswell\u2019s comments about March For Our Lives were part of a side conversation on her Facebook page after she posted a photo of some students with the caption, \"They\u2019re out to take your guns, and our freedoms,\" at 8:10 p.m. on March 26. On March 27, she posted the comments about the march speakers after someone suggested Boswell\u2019s original post was a \"scare tactic\" meant to distract people from the message of the march.\n\nWhat the \u2018march\u2019 wants\n\nThe March For Our Lives website doesn\u2019t say anything about forcefully taking guns from gun owners, much less harming them.\n\nThe organization says it wants universal, comprehensive background checks and a digitized, searchable database of guns at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as ATF). It also wants bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence.\n\nMarch For Our Lives has the support of several large, liberal organizing groups that support gun control. And a survey of the Washington marchers found that protesters there were largely liberal, with 79 percent of those who were randomly surveyed identifying as \"left-leaning.\"\n\nBut the group doesn\u2019t appear to have ties to groups with a history of advocating violence. PolitiFact recently debunked a claim by the National Rifle Association that the March For Our Lives is \"backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.\"\n\nA story by Variety.com captured some of the marchers\u2019 public disdain for the NRA, but none of the views expressed included calls for violence.\n\n\"A video during the [Washington] event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as [the late actor] Charlton Heston, then the president of the organization, saying, \u2018From my cold dead hands.\u2019 In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird,\" Variety reported.\n\nIn New York City, \"Marchers chanted \u2018NRA sashay away,\u2019 at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government,\" Variety reported.\n\nPolitiFact emailed Boswell and asked if she could provide videos or news clips showing march speakers advocating violence. Luke Stancil, her campaign spokesman, responded by referencing a candidate for sheriff in North Carolina who joked about taking people's guns.\n\nDaryl Fisher, a candidate running for sheriff of Buncombe County in western NC, explained his views of people who invite him to pry their gun from their cold, bare hands. Stancil pointed out that Fisher shrugged said, \"OK ... Whenever you pass away, we'll come get it.\"\n\nFisher indeed said those things. But he didn't say them at a March For Our Lives rally. He later apologized. And Boswell said \"many\" speakers called for the murder of gun owners \u2013 and didn't cite any others.\n\nSo we searched for evidence of violent rhetoric ourselves.\n\nAlex Jones, a conservative conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com, said on his show that marchers declared they would \"kill anyone\" who doesn\u2019t turn in their guns.\n\nBut PolitiFact found no credible evidence of rally speakers calling for violence against gun owners who might refuse to relinquish their guns. Most speakers at the Washington march and other marches across the country spoke about stricter gun laws and warned politicians of forthcoming punishment at the ballot box.\n\nSome of those comments, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as threats. Delaney Tarr, a frequently-interviewed Stoneman Douglas student, said the Washington marchers are \"are here to call out every single politician. We will take action where it counts.\"\n\nThose comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the \"prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes.\"\n\nIn that vein, she said: \"When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.\"\n\nAlex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words \"life\" and \"death\" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions.\n\n\"To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the NRA, you have chosen death,\" Wind said. \"If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life.\"\n\nD\u2019Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action.\n\n\"When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?\" McDade said. \"Dr. King once said, \u2018Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\u2019 Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that.\"\n\nSpeakers at marches in Boswell\u2019s home state of North Carolina were similar. Speakers in Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville reportedly focused on gun laws and the NRA.\n\nBoswell said \"many speakers\" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for \"the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government.\" She didn\u2019t provide any evidence to back up her claim, and PolitiFact found no evidence.
