But it does not require either side to destroy nuclear weapons or reduce their nuclear stockpile, and it doesn\u2019t place limits on shorter-range nuclear weapons.\n\nAlso, Russia was below the limit for deployed strategic nuclear warheads when the treaty took effect in 2011, and it has increased them since then. So there hasn\u2019t even been a reduction in Russia\u2019s deployed strategic nuclear warheads under the agreement.\n\nThe ad focuses on Clinton\u2019s record on Social Security, health care and other issues. It has aired thousands of times in at least eight states, most recently during the April 26 Pennsylvania primary, according to Political TV Ad Archive.\n\nThe ad starts by showing images of world events as the narrator says, \u201cThe world a president has to grapple with. Sometimes you can\u2019t even imagine. That\u2019s the job and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s proving she can get it done.\u201d The narrator then credits Clinton with \u201csecuring a massive reduction in nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us that the ad refers to her work as secretary of state on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 each for Russia and the United States. It also limits \u201cdeployed and non-deployed strategic launchers and heavy bombers\u201d to 800, including no more than 700 \u201cdeployed strategic launchers and heavy bombers,\u201d according to a State Department fact sheet. (Long-range nuclear weapons are considered \u201cstrategic,\u201d while shorter-range weapons are considered \u201cnonstrategic,\u201d as explained in a March report by the Congressional Research Service.)\n\nThe arms control treaty was approved by the Senate 71-26 on Dec. 22, 2010, and took effect Feb. 5, 2011.\n\nIn addition to placing limits on deployed strategic nuclear warheads, New START requires \u201ctransparency and verification measures \u2014 including semi-annual data exchanges, notifications, and inspections\u201d that provide \u201cfar more information about the other\u2019s strategic forces than it would otherwise have,\u201d as explained in a recent blog post by Steve Pifer, director of the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative at the Brookings Institution.\n\nBut has New START resulted in \u201ca massive reduction in nuclear weapons\u201d? Not according to the data we reviewed and the experts we interviewed.\n\nThe information gathered as part of the treaty\u2019s data exchanges shows Russia\u2019s deployed strategic nuclear warheads were already below the treaty limits in February 2011, and Russia actually has increased those weapons, according to a report issued this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nDuring that same time, the U.S. went from 1,800 warheads in 882 deployed delivery vehicles to 1,481 warheads on 741 deployed launchers.\n\nShortly before the agreement was signed, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d that the agreement did not call for the destruction of those weapons \u201cwithdrawn from operational deployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne disappointing feature of the new treaty is that it will not require the parties to verifiably eliminate the nuclear warheads withdrawn from operational deployment,\u201d Shannon N. Kile, head of the institute\u2019s nuclear project, wrote. \u201cSuch a provision would have contributed to \u2018locking in\u2019, or making irreversible, future force reductions. In doing so, it would have helped to address concerns about asymmetries in the two sides\u2019 so-called upload potential (that is, the ability to rapidly redeploy nuclear warheads held in storage onto missiles and bombers).\u201d\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told us in an email: \u201cThe treaty itself does not require destruction of a single nuclear warhead. Nor does it have any direct impact on how many nuclear warheads Russia and the United States may have in their total stockpiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the treaty has not secured a \u2018massive reduction in nuclear weapons\u2019 but reduced (compared to the previous START treaty) how many launchers may exist and be deployed and reduced how many warheads may be deployed on those launchers,\u201d Kristensen said.\n\nHis email explained the impact of the treaty in some depth:\n\nKristensen, April 26: When the treaty entered into force in 2011, Russia was already below the limit in deployed launchers, so they have not been required to reduce that category. Instead they have reduced non-deployed launchers. In contrast, the United States was above the treaty limit for both deployed and non-deployed launchers, so it has been busy dismantling and denuclearizing so-called phantom launchers \u2014 that is, missile silos and bombers that were not actually used in nuclear planning but had not yet been destroyed or carried equipment that made them accountable under the treaty. \u2026 Overall, in the case of the United States, the reduction in launchers will have been most significant for phantom launchers versus actual nuclear committed launchers. As for deployed warheads, the two countries have made slight adjustments to their deployed warheads. The United States has reduced and Russia has increased slightly. The Russian increase is a temporary anomaly caused by their transition from Soviet-era weapons to modern weapons. They are expected to meet the limit in 2018.\n\nAs Kristensen indicated, Russia still has two years to bring its number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads within the treaty\u2019s limits, and he believes it will. Others are skeptical of Russia, which has become more aggressive militarily under President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cSome analysts have questioned whether the increase in Russian warheads reported in March 2016 indicates that Russia may eventually withdraw from New START without reducing to its limit of 1,550 deployed warheads,\u201d CRS says in its report. \u201cOthers, however, note that Russia does not need to meet the limits until February 2018, so the warhead level in March 2016 should not be of concern.\u201d\n\nBut even if the U.S. and Russia abide by the treaty limits, the reduction in nuclear weapons would be historically modest, experts say.\n\nOn its website, the Clinton campaign says the New START treaty \u201cwill make the world safer by reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to their smallest size in 50 years.\u201d But this is misleading.\n\nThe bulk of that reduction occurred before New START took effect in 2011, as shown in Figure 1 of a June 2015 report by the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201c[T]he agreements that have followed the unprecedented reductions of START I called for increasingly marginal reductions in [strategic nuclear forces] levels,\u201d the Carnegie report said. START I, which was originally known simply as START, took effect in 1994 and ended in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt is an overstatement \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 to say that the treaty has reduced US and Russian nuclear arsenals to their smallest size in 50 years,\u201d Kristensen told us. \u201cThe overwhelming part of that reduction occurred in the 1990s long before the New START treaty was signed at a time when the two countries retired and dismantled nuclear weapons at an impressive rate.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times in a news story this month described the New START agreement as producing \u201cmodest reductions in strategic nuclear forces\u201d that could be undermined by the pursuit of \u201ca new generation of smaller, less destructive nuclear weapons\u201d by Russia, the United States and China.\n\nKile, of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, also called the agreement \u201cdecidedly modest in the scope and scale of its ambitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think modest is a good general description of New START,\u201d Tom Z. Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which seeks to reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons, told us in an email. \u201cIf you look at other presidents \u2014 Republican presidents \u2014 they have done much more.\u201d\n\nIn October 2014, Kristensen did an analysis of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile in the post-Cold War era and concluded that \u201cthe Obama administration so far has had the least effect on the size of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile of any of the post-Cold War presidencies.\u201d Obama reduced the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile by 10 percent in six years. By comparison, George W. Bush reduced the stockpile by 50 percent followed by his father, President George H.W. Bush, who reduced it by 41 percent in four years.\n\n\u201cCombined, the Bush presidents cut a staggering 14,801 warheads from the stockpile during their 12 years in office \u2013 1,233 warheads per year,\u201d Kristensen wrote. \u201cPresident Clinton reduced the stockpile by 23 percent during his eight years in office.\u201d\n\nAt a recent press conference, President Obama said that he had hoped to negotiate another agreement with Russia shortly after New START that would have lowered the limit yet again on deployed nuclear warheads, but he acknowledged that that will not happen before he leaves office in January.\n\n\u201cBecause Mr. Putin came into power, or returned to his office as President, and because of the vision that he\u2019s been pursuing of emphasizing military might over development inside of Russia and diversifying the economy, we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have hoped for with Russia,\u201d Obama said.\n\nAll this is not to say that the New START agreement isn\u2019t valuable. Collina credited Obama and Clinton for lowering the ceiling, even if modestly, and providing \u201ctransparency and predictability\u201d by requiring the semi-annual data collection that allows the two nuclear powers to know how many nuclear weapons the other side has.\n\nBut the record doesn\u2019t show that Clinton was responsible for \u201csecuring a massive reduction in nuclear weapons.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
