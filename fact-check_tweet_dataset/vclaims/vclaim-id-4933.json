In December 2017, for instance, internet trolls spread a false rumor that the letter \u201cP,\u201d representing \u201cpedosexual,\u201d was being added to the initialism LGBT (for \u201clesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender\u201d).\n\nAn eerily similar rumor was spread via social media in June 2018 in the form of an image purportedly showing a \u201cMAPs (Minor-Attracted Persons) Pride Flag\u201d supposedly created for Gay Pride Month:\n\nThis picture does not represent a \u201cMAPs Pride Flag.\u201d Rather, the image was created as part of a troll experiment on Tumblr.\n\nWhen pictures of this \u201cMAP flag\u201d began circulating on Facebook, the posts typically included messages warning other social media users to be wary of anyone displaying this flag:\n\nWebsites such as the Daily Caller and \u201cAttitude\u201d picked up on this alleged \u201cMAPs Pride Flag\u201d and reported that pedophiles were \u201crebranding\u201d themselves as \u201cMinor Attracted Persons\u201d in an attempt to be accepted by the LGBT community:\n\nPaedophiles are trying to gain acceptance to the LGBT community by rebranding themselves. In a bid to gain acceptance, they have rebranded themselves as MAPs or \u201cMinor Attracted Persons\u201d and have gone so far to even create a rainbow \u201cPride\u201d flag for Gay Pride, but Twitter user, Communist Fish, posted a picture back in June to warn children to stay away. The group attempt to claim that paedophiles are misunderstood people and if they do not act upon their attraction to children, they shouldn\u2019t be marginalised. Sites like The Prevention Project have started to post testimonials from paedophiles who are seeking help with their attraction, claiming everyone \u201cneeds support\u201d.\n\nPedophiles did not coin the term \u201cminor attracted persons\u201d (or MAPS) to rebrand themselves in 2018 in order to gain entry to the LGBT community. Organizations such as B4UAct have been using the term \u201cminor attracted persons\u201d for years to refer to \u201cadults who experience feelings of preferential sexual attraction to children or adolescents under the age of consent.\u201d\n\nThe Prevention Project, an organization that helps minor-attracted persons find professional treatment, explicitly denied that the term \u201cMAPs\u201d was an attempt to \u201crebrand\u201d pedophiles. Rather, they explained that this term was preferred as a broader reference that could accurately encompass hebephiles, pedophiles, and ephebephiles:\n\nThe term minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18. Therefore, someone attracted to a 14 year old is actually called an ephebephile not a pedophile. Someone attracted to a 13 year old is called a hebephile. Pedophiles are attracted to 6-12 year old children; not teens. Hence why we accurately use the term \u201cMinor Attracted Person\u201d when we discuss providing treatment to men and women with attractions to various ages of minors. We are not trying to \u201csoften the term\u201d or \u201crebrand\u201d pedophilia to fit in with certain groups. We treat individuals who are attracted to various ages of minors, thus it is accurate to use the term \u201cminor attracted person.\u201d\n\nWe also found no evidence that this flag originated in earnest as a MAPs Pride Flag. We reached out to the \u201cPrevention Project, who told us they had never heard of this pride flag: \u201cWe\u2019re experts in treating MAPs who have zero desire to harm anyone but want support to deal with the stigma of being a pedophile, hebophile or ephebephile. MAPs encompass these 3 terms. None of the MAPs we know (we know a lot) have talked about this [flag].\u201d\n\nThis alleged \u201cMAPs Pride Flag\u201d appears to have originated on the Tumblr page \u201cDon\u2019t Mistake Our Geography\u201d on 13 June 2018, where it was posted with a brief explanation about what the colors in the flag supposedly symbolized to NOMAPS (Non-Offending Minor Attracted Persons) and an acknowledgement that the \u201cpride flag\u201d had just been created out of whole cloth:\n\nThe NOMAP community doesn\u2019t really have a pride flag, so in honor of pride month I designed a NOMAP pride flag. The top two stripes are blue to represent NOMAPs attracted to young boys. The bottom two stripes are pink to represent NOMAPs attracted to young girls. The inner stripes are yellow to represent childhood and general attraction to minors, regardless of their gender. The middle stripe is white to represent our innocence and unwillingness to offend. Please feel free to use this flag and make icons out of it etc! Hope you enjoy\n\nAt the time this Pride flag image was originally posted, the Tumblr page operated under a banner in support of MAPs and included a tagline claiming that the author was \u201cpossibly a MAP\u201d and \u201cdefinitely a supporter.\u201d However, the title of this page was later changed to \u201cY\u2019all need a therapist, not a community,\u201d and the tagline was altered to read \u201cNot an anti, not an ally, just a training psychologist with some fucking sense.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the page was changed. The top image shows the Tumblr page as it was in mid-June, while it was claiming to be a MAP ally; the bottom image shows the page at the time of this writing, after it was revealed that the flag was bogus:\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t know the motivations of this Tumblr user, it should be noted that the person claimed to be a CSA (child sexual assault) victim.\n\nPedophiles are not rebranding themselves as MAPs to gain entry to the LGBT community, nor did they release an official \u201cMAPs Pride Flag.\u201d As we noted in our article about the homophobic and false rumor that a \u201cP\u201d for pedosexual was being added to the initialism LGBT, no link has been established between pedophilia and homosexuality:\n\nAn especially pernicious myth is that most adults who sexually abuse children are gay. A number of researchers have looked at this question to determine if homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals, and the data indicate that\u2019s not the case. For example, in a 1989 study led by Kurt Freund of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Canada, scientists showed pictures of children to adult gay and straight males, and measured sexual arousal. Homosexual men reacted no more strongly to pictures of male children than heterosexual men reacted to pictures of female children. A 1994 study, led by Carole Jenny of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, surveyed 269 cases of children who were sexually molested by adults. In 82 percent of cases, the alleged offender was a heterosexual partner of a close relative of the child, the researchers reported in the journal Pediatrics. In only two out of 269 cases, the offender was identified as being gay or lesbian.", "lang": "en"}
