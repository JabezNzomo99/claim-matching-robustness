If convicted, Prokopyeva could serve seven years in prison.\n\nA transcript of Prokopyeva\u2019s commentary shows that her remarks were explanatory and not meant to endorse violence.\n\nProkopyeva is a prominent journalist in Pskov, where she freelances for Radio Free Europe. (Disclosure: Voice of America and RFE are both independent news organizations funded by the U.S. government under the United States Agency for Global Media.) She has hosted a political talk show for a local affiliate of Ekho Moskvy radio and worked as an investigative reporter for the Pskovskaya Lenta Novostei news agency.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2018, Mikhail Zhlobitsky, a 17-year-old student, walked into the office of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in the city of Archangelsk in northern Russia, took a IED (improvised explosive devise) out of his backpack and detonated it. Zhlobitsky died on the spot, and the blast wounded three FSB officers. The Russian National Anti-terrorism Committee called it a terrorist attack.\n\nZhlobitsky, later identified as a member of an anarcho-communist national-radical group, reportedly left a manifesto saying he had decided to launch a suicide bombing \u201cbecause the FSB fabricates cases and tortures people.\u201d\n\nWhat did Prokopyeva say?\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2018, Prokopyeva commented on the Arkhangelsk attack on her Ekho Moskvy Pskov program. Those comments became the basis of the criminal prosecution charge. A transcript of the program has been classified as \u201cextremist material\u201d and banned from distribution in Russia under the threat of prosecution.\n\nA full transcript of Prokopyeva\u2019s original broadcast is available in Russian on Medium.com.\n\nAccording to Prokopyeva, parts of her radio commentary that upset the Russian authorities the most and figured in her prosecution include the following:\n\n\u201cA strong state. A strong president, a strong governor. A country wherepower belongs to the security forces. The generation to which the Arkhangelsk bomber belonged grew up in this atmosphere. They know that you can 't go to demonstrations \u2014 they will disperse you, or even beat you, and then they will convict you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe many years of restricted political and civil liberties have created in Russia not just an unfree, but a repressive state. A state that is unsafe and scary to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u201cA state that is repressive towards its own citizens is now being met with a response. A young citizen who saw only prohibitions and punishments from the authorities could think of no other means of communication. Cruelty begets cruelty. A ruthless government has produced a citizen who has made death his argument. Let\u2019s hope he is an exception.\u201d\n\nIn her broadcast, Prokopyeva made clear that she does not condone terrorism and violence, saying such acts are \u201cmonstrous.\u201d Her employer at the time, Pskovskaya Lenta Novostei, published a full transcript of the broadcast.\n\nTwo months later, in December 2018, the Russian state watchdog Roscomnadzor ordered Ekho Moskvy and Pskovskaya Lenta Novostei to take down Prokopyeva\u2019s program and fined them for distributing extremist material.\n\nThree months after her broadcast, in February 2019, the Pskov regional prosecutor\u2019s office launched a criminal investigation, and the Investigative Committee indicted Prokopyeva in September 2019. She has said the case is motivated by her critical coverage of the government. In an open letter published in October 2019, she called it \u201cbanal revenge\" by \"offended siloviki\" whom she blamed for the Arkhangelsk bombing.\n\n\"I did not justify the terror attack, I analyzed its causes,\" she wrote, while the case against her is \"the assassination of press freedom.\"\n\nThe charges were based on Article 205.2 of the Russian Criminal Code, concerning public calls to commit terrorist activity or public justify terrorism.\n\nInternational human rights and media organizations have called the accusations against Prokopyeva \u201cbogus\u201d and demanded that Russian authorities drop the charges against her.", "lang": "en"}
