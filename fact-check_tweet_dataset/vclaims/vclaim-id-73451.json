No, that's not true: While some of the photographs are, in fact, from the time when what was known as the Spanish flu ravaged the globe, infecting about 500 million people and killing at least 50 million, to say they all are is misleading. A good number were taken before or after that pandemic -- including one that showed women in 1913 wearing veils over their mouths as nothing more than a fashion statement and another featuring two women wearing war surplus gas capes to protect their eyes from smog in 1953. Several advertisements or marketing materials being erroneously tied to 1918 are even more off base, with one dating back to 1910 and another, a call-to-action poster, being created in March 2020.\n\nThe claim linking a series of images to the 1918 pandemic have appeared in posts like this one on Facebook (archived here), which was published on August 5, 2020. The post, which included 11 images, opened this way:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nBut while five of the shared photos in this post are, in fact, representative of the 1918 pandemic, the other six are not -- which misleads social media followers.\n\nOne image shows two women chatting on a street while wearing what appears to be plastic over their heads. This is how it appears in the post billed as a photo from the 1918 flu pandemic:\n\nThe reality is revealed here, where the caption for the 1953 image reads:\n\nA second image shows two fashion-forward women walking with linked arms down a sidewalk while wearing what might be mistaken as face masks. This is how that image shows up in the pool of supposed 1918 images:\n\nThe truth about this image is that the two women are wearing a 1913 fashion statement, \"A new veil fashion,\" as indicated here, in German. The English translation of the photo's description reads as follows:\n\nA third photo falsely credited to 1918 shows two women wearing gas masks while walking with a baby buggy. Here is what that image looks like in the misleading post:\n\nAccording to Getty Images, this photograph was from July 9, 1941, more than 23 years after the Spanish flu outbreak began. The caption with the photograph reads:\n\nA fourth photograph erroneously linked to 1918 shows two women wearing masks while speaking through a car window. This is how that image appears on social media:\n\nThe reality is that these women are wearing flu masks in 1929, not 1918, according to Getty Images. The image description reads:\n\nMixed in with the photographs in this post allegedly about life in 1918 are two pieces of marketing materials -- neither of which are from 1918.\n\nThe first and oldest image included in the mix of supposed 1918 images is an advertisement from New York Telephone Co., which reads:\n\nHere is how that image appears on social media:\n\nBut this advertisement actually appeared in a St. Louis, Missouri, newspaper on November 17, 1910 -- years before the Spanish flu took hold. Specifically, the telephone ad ran on page 16 of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nAnd then the final image included in the batch of \"1918\" photos is a simple, though colorized, poster that reads:\n\nSTAY AT HOME\n\nIT HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER TO SAVE LIVES\n\nHere's how that image appears in this social media post:\n\nThe reality is that this poster became available only months ago. It was created by a French graphic designer Mathieu Persan. Persan created the website, www.restezalamaison.org, to make his shareable posters -- reading \"stay at home\" in a multitude of languages -- available for free. He launched this site on March 21, 2020, sharing news about it in a Facebook post which read:\n\nThis is how Persan's announcement appeared on social media:\n\nWhile the aforementioned images cannot be credited to the 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted a couple years, five of the photos posted in this batch do provide a factual window into that period of time.\n\nHere's how that image appears on social media:\n\nA sign on a streetcar warning about the dangers of spitting did, in fact, appear in Philadelphia in October 2018. A caption for the image, provided by the Historical Medical Library of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, appeared in the New York Times and reads: \"An anti-spitting sign posted on streetcar in Philadelphia, October 1918.\" This is what the image looks like on social media:\n\nOne image depicts rows of patients in a converted warehouse established to quarantine people, according to Getty Images. The image is described this way:\n\nHere's how this image appears on social media:\n\nAnother image, showing a masked boy outside a closed-down theater, was among images colorized and rereleased by Royston Leonard to help mark 100 years since the Spanish flu pandemic.\n\nThis is how that image looks on social media:\n\nAnd the last image to round out the five that, in fact, do reflect the period of the 1918 flu pandemic is one featuring a photograph of a Red Cross nurse wearing a mask, featured beside a list of tips \"To Prevent Influenza!\" This full-page image published on October 18, 1918, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine in a blog post. Here's how the image is described:\n\nHere's how the image appears in recent social media posts:", "lang": "en"}
