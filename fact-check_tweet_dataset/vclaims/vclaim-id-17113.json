The first game in the series was created in 1987 by video game designer Hideo Kojima, published by the Japanese company Konami, and intended for use with the Japanese MSX2 brand personal computer.\n\nMetal Gear first garnered popularity in the U.S. via a port of the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. In 1998, the release of Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation game console made Metal Gear a household name worldwide. All told, Metal Gear is one of the top selling video games of all time.\n\nMetal Gear was originally designed as a \u201ctactical espionage game,\u201d in which the player takes control of a single special operations operative who must infiltrate a heavily guarded military facility. Two unique features contributed to the game\u2019s success. The first was its action movie-style plot: in the 1980\u2019s, developed stories in video games were a novelty. The second was its gameplay, which focused on stealth and remaining undetected rather than taking down hordes of enemies. Throughout the series, the player must avoid alerting enemies or triggering alarms. It\u2019s hardly what any reasonable person would call \u201cencouraging active protest activity.\u201d\n\nAs for dissatisfaction with authorities, the series\u2019 plots do contain themes critical of governments, but that criticism is often aimed at all governments, including that of the U.S. One of the earliest examples comes in the second game, published in 1990, in which a defeated boss character tells the player he joined a terrorist group because a NATO air strike in the first game killed a number of innocent children. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2000) involves a plot that reveals the U.S. government is secretly controlled by a group of individuals known as \u201cThe Patriots,\u201d who intend to use artificial intelligence to manipulate public perceptions.", "lang": "en"}
