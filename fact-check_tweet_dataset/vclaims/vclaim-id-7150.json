No, that's not true. Any news reports you may have seen about that originated from a story on a Christian-themed satire website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 21, 2018 by the Babylon Bee titled \"Obamas Promise To Donate All Proceeds From Multimillion-Dollar Book, Netflix Deals To Combat Wealth Inequality\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.--Barack and Michelle Obama have committed to donate all of the money they are slated to receive as part of their recent multimillion-dollar book and Netflix deals to combat wealth inequality in the nation, the celebrity politician couple announced Monday. Obama told the press he wanted to make sure people didn't think he was using his experiences in public service for his own personal gain, but rather for the good of all, in order to remain consistent with his party's platform. \"We talk a big talk when it comes to wealth inequality in our nation, and it's time for us to start walking the walk,\" Obama said, speaking to reporters in front of his newly purchased $8.1-million home in an exclusive neighborhood in D.C. \"That's why we'll be giving every dollar of our ridiculously profitable book and film deals to charities that help the less fortunate.\"\n\nThe summary of the story looked like a news article enough to fool some people:\n\nThe existence of the Obama foundation proves the Obamas are definitely not shy about enganging in charity. You can read more about the activities of the foundation on its website:\n\nBut giving away everything earned with their books and Netflix show? We found no official announcement about this anywhere and \"The Babylon Bee\" comes with following dislaimer on every page:\n\nSome of their greatest past hits include:\n\u2022 Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of 'Your Best Life Now'\n\u2022 Another Actress Accuses Kirk Cameron Of Treating Her With Respect\n\u2022 ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'\n\nWith a track record like that it is clear that you shouldn't take anything posted on the site seriously and you definitely shouldn't confuse it with real news.\n\nWe wrote about babylonbee.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: YouTube Did NOT Flag All 'Mister Rogers' Videos As Hate Speech\n\u2022 Fake News: Taco Bell Will NOT Only Serve Customers Of Mexican Descent To Fight Cultural Appropriation\n\u2022 Fake News: Planned Parenthood Did NOT Defend Bill Cosby, Did NOT Say: 'Sexual Assault Is Only 3% Of What He Does'\n\u2022 Fake News: Prime Minister Did NOT Issue Reminder To UK Parents That The State Owns Their Children\n\u2022 Fake News: Zuckerberg Did NOT Lose Contact Lens During Senate Hearing, Revealing NO Horrifying Lizard Eye", "lang": "en"}
