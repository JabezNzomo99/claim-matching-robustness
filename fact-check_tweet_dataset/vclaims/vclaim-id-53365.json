Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: Abhijit\u2019s article on rapes were published in October-2012 whereas Nirbhaya rape incident took place in December-2012. In his article, Abhijit has explicitly said that \u2018none of this should be read as a defence of rape\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the photo posted, it can be seen that the article was published by \u2018TFIPOST\u2019. So, when searched for that article, it was found that \u2018TFIPOST\u2019 has now deleted the article from its website. The archived version of that article can be read here.\n\nIn the \u2018TFIPOST\u2019 article, a link to Abhijit Banerjee\u2019s 2012 \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 article can be found. Abhijit\u2019s article on rapes was published by the \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 on 30 October 2012, whereas the Nirbhaya rape incident took place in December-2012. So, Abhijit\u2019s comment on rapes before the Nirbhaya rape incident is being twisted to portray that he justified the Nirbhaya rape.\n\nIn his article, he commented on the inequality of access to sex but he also explicitly stated that \u2018none of this should be read as a defence of rape\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, Abhijit Banerjee has not defended the Nirbhaya rapists.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
