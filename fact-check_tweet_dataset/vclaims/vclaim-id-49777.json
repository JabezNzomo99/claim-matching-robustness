This is the maximum support available, and many of these estimates rely on full take-up of the various schemes and bonuses. This is unlikely, however, and the UK Government admits that \u201cfinal costs are likely to be lower than the maximum set out\u201d.\n\nThe Office For Budget Responsibility estimated these costs would actually be just under \u00a320bn.\n\nForbes\u2019 claim is that only 0.1 per cent, or \u00a321m, of the \u00a330bn, would go to the Scottish Government. According to analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), the amount of money to be added to the Scottish Government\u2019s block grant from the \u2018Plan for Jobs\u2019 announcement will be \u00a320.6million in 2020-21. This is achieved through the Barnett formula, which calculates the yearly change in everyday funding for the devolved nations, based on the amount of UK Government spending per department.\n\nThe Fraser of Allander Institute also came to similar conclusions, reporting that \u201conly around \u00a320m\u201d will come into the Scottish budget from the \u2018Plan for Jobs\u2019, largely through money allocated to apprenticeship funds.\n\nHowever, Sunak\u2019s announcement will provide money for Scotland in several other ways.\n\nMuch of the funding announced in the plan is for UK-wide schemes, which will benefit those in Scotland. Chief among this is the job retention bonus, a \u201cone-off payment of \u00a31,000 to UK employers for every furloughed employee who remains continuously employed through to the end of January 2021.\u201d This will be paid in relation to take-up and will include Scottish employers. It will cost up to \u00a39.4bn, according to Treasury figures, while the OBR estimated it would cost \u00a36.1bn.\n\nThe Kickstart scheme is also UK-wide, and will provide work placements of six months for young people currently on benefits who are \u201cdeemed to be at risk of long-term unemployment\u201d. This has been allocated \u00a32.1bn in the \u2018Plan for Jobs\u2019.\n\nThere are several other UK-wide schemes including decarbonisation, the \u2018Eat Out to Help Out\u2019 scheme, and various projects to help people looking for work.\n\nThe amount of money which will be available to those in Scotland from these schemes has not been revealed, but it will be substantially higher than \u00a321m. The IFS suggested it \u201ccould amount to around \u00a31 billion\u201d.\n\nIt will not come to the Scottish Government through adjustments to the block grant, which means Ministers in Scotland will not be able to allocate it in ways they see fit.\n\nSome of the announcements which would be expected to have Barnett consequentials, such as the \u00a32bn Green Homes Grant scheme for England, are being funded from reallocations of existing budgets \u2013 as are around half of the apprenticeship, traineeships, school leavers and careers help schemes, according to Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) analysis.\n\nThe reduction in Stamp Duty is also an important factor as this is devolved to Scotland where it is called the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT). The UK Government increased the threshold for having to pay the tax from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3500,000 until March 2021. The Scottish Government has announced an increase to the LBTT threshold from \u00a3145,000 to \u00a3250,000.\n\nThe IFS reports that the money heading to the Scottish Government from the cut \u201ccould amount to around \u00a3120 million spread over this year and next\u201d.\n\nSunak\u2019s announcement also included \u00a349bn in funding for public services, \u00a333bn of which is new, according to the IFS. Much of this money will be for the NHS, including the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other frontline support.\n\nThis will result in significant Barnett consequential money for the devolved administrations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). The IFS found that of the \u00a349bn, around \u00a34.1bn would come to the devolved governments.\n\nAccording to the UK Government and SPICe, overall coronavirus-related contributions to Scotland via the Barnett formula are more than \u00a34.6bn.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak suggested that the plan included \u00a3800 million for Scotland \u201cthrough the Barnett formula\u201d. Much of the money will be from extra NHS spending, plus a package announced for the arts, according to the Fraser Allander Institute.\n\nThe IFS calculated the Scottish Government will get \u201cover \u00a3700 million as a result of other funding confirmed\u201d in the summer economic update, as well as the \u00a321 million previously mentioned.\n\nIncluding the additional funding from the Stamp Duty holiday, the final total will likely be \u201c\u00a3900 million\u201d.\n\nKate Forbes is using a very narrow definition of the money announced in Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech. The Barnett consequentials from the specific new business policies announced in the \u2018Plan for Jobs\u2019 will be relatively small, but they are part of a much larger package of support. This comes through direct funding from the UK Government for job retention and work placement schemes, VAT cuts and the cut to Stamp Duty. There will also be money to the Scottish Government from the announced funding increases to public services.\n\nIn response to an evidence request, The Scottish Government provided links to SPICe and Fraser of Allander analyses of the budget.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
