They've always been so. Now they control the government in India'. \n\nAccess the archived version of the viral tweet here.\n\nThe same screengrab has been shared from another verified Twitter handle, that of Abdul Rahmaan Al-Nassar, along with other pictures.

The article has wrongly mentioned Gulbarg society as Gulbarga society.\n\nBOOM also found a New York Times article titled Using Bollywood Ideas to Portray Today's India which uses the same image albeit from another angle. The caption with the picture says 'A scene from \"Parzania,\" one of the films playing in the \"India Now\" festival at the Museum of Modern Art'. The article was published in 2007.\n\nTaking cue from here, we watched Parzania - a film based on the 2002 Gujarat riots - and compared a screenshot from the movie with the image shared in the tweet.\n\n\n\nWhile we did not the exact frame, we found the same actor seen in the viral photo.
