It also tries to redirect readers to links for anti-virus software.\n\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article appears to have been copied from another website with a similar satire label, Conservative Tears, which is part of Christopher Blair\u2019s network of satirical sites.\n\nThere are several cues that the story is false. One sign is the misspelled surname. The story also says she was born in 1934 and was 89 in December, which is mathematically impossible.\n\nWe found no evidence that Burnett was a \"huge Trump supporter.\"\n\nBurnett told Larry King in February 2016 that she doesn\u2019t endorse candidates. When he asked her, \"if I say \u2018Donald Trump\u2019 do you comment?\" she laughed in response and said \"that\u2019s my comment.\"\n\nShe told Conan O\u2019Brien in 2018 that political comedy wasn\u2019t her thing.\n\n\"It never occurred to me to be political, I really wasn\u2019t thinking about it \u2014 it just wasn\u2019t my bag,\" she said, speaking about the Carol Burnett show.\n\nSo what is Burnett actually up to? USA Today interviewed her in late December and reported that she will appear in the reboot of \"Mad About You\" and has an upcoming Netflix film, \"Sorta Like a Rock Star.\"\n\nA story said that Carol Burnett is dead and was a Trump supporter, but we found no evidence to back up either statement. Burnett lives. We rate this story Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
