No, that's not true: Schumer never said that. Several sites are wrongly attributing this quote to him, but he did not say it. Lead Stories has traced the claim back to its original source, and the quote was entirely made up.\n\nThe story recently appeared again in an article published by GNF News on February 16, 2020, titled \"Chuck Schumer SLAMS President Trump: 'It's Racist To Only Allow Citizens To Vote'\" (archived here).

This is the first iteration of the made-up quote that has been wrongly attributed to Schumer. That article cites as its source an opinion piece by Rick Wells from two days prior, which includes the quote in the headline, but with one crucial difference: there are no quote marks.\n\nWhat does this mean?

The words are just the opinion of Rick Wells.\n\nInterestingly, Wells' opinion piece refers to an article Schumer wrote for Medium.com opining that voting rights, particularly for African Americans, are under assault in the United States. This article is the basis for several of the quotes that appear in these cloned articles, but the quote being attributed to Schumer never appears.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes gnfnews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
