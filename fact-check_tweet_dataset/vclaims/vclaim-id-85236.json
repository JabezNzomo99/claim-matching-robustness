The controversial ban is now on hold because of court challenges, but the \u201cseven countries\u201d issue remains important because the Justice Department, in its filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals, asserted that these are \u201ccountries that have a previously identified link to an increased risk of terrorist activity.\u201d\n\nThe only country actually named in the order is Syria, which was also subject to an undefined ban on refugee admissions. The other six countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia \u2014 are not specifically named. Instead, the order refers to sections of the U.S. code:\n\nIn 2014, then-Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) proposed a law to pressure participants in the program to share intelligence data. But, after the 2015 Paris attacks, her proposal was adjusted to tighten the rules for people from those countries if they had visited Syria or Iraq or were dual citizens of those countries. Specifically, the change would have required an in-person interview for a visa if a person had traveled to Iraq or Syria after March 2011. As Miller noted, \u201cAbdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind of the horrific attacks in Paris, was a citizen of Belgium \u2014 a participant of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program.\u201d\n\nA somewhat similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), although it would not have applied to dual nationals, just people who had traveled to countries that were of concern. But when the final version emerged from Congress \u2014 as part of an omnibus budget agreement \u2014 the dual-national provision remained. The law was titled the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\n\nFeinstein at the time noted her objection to the change: \u201cRestricting the use of the program based on nationality in addition to where an individual has traveled is not the correct path. I was disappointed the provision was included over the strong objection of many members, and will work with my colleagues to quickly repeal it.\u201d\n\nThe administration also assured Democratic lawmakers that it would formalize guidance to allow for case-by-case waivers of dual nationals from the four countries named in the 2015 law, especially in situations where travel was connected to international organizations, journalism or legitimate business reasons. Some Republicans were upset at the Obama interpretation, with one accusing the president of \u201cblatantly breaking the law.\u201d\n\nThe website of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection bureau still says the main purpose of the 2015 law was to identify people who may have been radicalized: \u201cDHS remains concerned about the risks posed by the situation in Syria and Iraq, where instability has attracted thousands of foreign fighters, including many from VWP countries.\u201d The CBP also noted: \u201cThese new eligibility requirements do not bar travel to the United States.\u201d\n\nCharles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who tracks Muslim American violent extremism, says that since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, only 23 percent of Muslim Americans involved in extremist plots had family backgrounds in the seven countries identified by Trump \u2014 and that \u201cthere have been no fatalities in the United States caused by extremists with family backgrounds in those countries.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Feb. 9: The appeals court ruling upholding the freeze on Trump\u2019s executive order noted: \u201cAlthough the Government points to the fact that Congress and the Executive identified the seven countries named in the Executive Order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the Government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the Executive Order to be immediately reinstated.\u201d\n\nThe issue is much more complex than suggested by the Trump White House. The original intent of the law was to insist on greater scrutiny of people who had traveled to Syria and Iraq, even if they were citizens of countries that qualified for a visa waiver. In other words, lawmakers were seeking to identify possible radicalization, not single out citizens.\n\nFour countries were identified by Congress, in a bill signed by Obama, and then the Obama administration added three more. But Obama \u2014 and Democrats in Congress \u2014 wanted to require greater visa scrutiny of people who had traveled to those countries. When given a chance, the Obama administration specifically rejected the citizenship-based restrictions that Trump has now ordered. So while the names are the same, the approach is the polar opposite.", "lang": "en"}
