Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and some of his colleagues sent a letter to President Donald Trump. More federal funding for states forces citizens of one state \"to pay for the poor decisions made in another state,\" Biggs wrote, according to a story about the letter in The Hill.\n\n\"States like New York, Illinois and California have been vocal in their demands for funding to bail out their pension systems, which were failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren\u2019t related to this crisis. While these states in particular prove the negative impacts of poor budgeting, bloated spending, and high taxes, the federal government should not be further backfilling the budget of any state or local government,\" Biggs wrote, according to The Hill. Biggs shared the story on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\nLike Biggs, other Republican politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, criticized requests for help from states with high rates of infection. We wondered if Biggs was correct in saying that New York has been demanding federal funding to \"bail out\" its pension system, which was \"failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren\u2019t related to this crisis.\"\n\nThe National Governors Association, a bipartisan organization, is calling for $500 billion in federal funding for states, and New York supports that request, said Freeman Klopott, press officer for the state Division of the Budget.\n\nBiggs said New York\u2019s pension system was \"failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak.\"\n\nAn analysis of the pension systems in all 50 states in 2017 by the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts, released in June, found that New York was one of only eight states that had at least 90% of its pension obligations funded. New York had assets to cover 94.5% of its pension obligations.\n\nE.J. McMahon, who analyzes state finances at the conservative Empire Center for Public Policy, said no bailout is needed for New York\u2019s pension system, \"which by public-sector standards is among the best-funded in the nation.\"\n\nNew York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the pension fund, has called the fund \"well-funded and strong,\" despite the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.\n\nDiNapoli said in a statement that a bailout is not needed and has not been requested.\n\nThe pension systems in other states Biggs mentioned, Illinois and California, have different situations. Illinois has one of the three worst-funded systems, at 38.4% funded, and officials there have asked for a bailout of the pension fund.\n\nCalifornia's is close to being funded at the average ratio of all the states, at 68.9%, according to Pew, but it has since suffered. Biggs' home state of Arizona trails New York and California, at 62.2%, according to Pew.\n\nWe were also interested in the second part of Biggs\u2019 claim, regarding \"other programs not related to this crisis,\" because of reports that New York\u2019s finances were precarious before the pandemic. According to the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, before the coronavirus, New York faced a $7 billion budget gap. The subsequent economic downturn has worsened the state\u2019s finances.\n\n\"The shortfalls the state is experiencing in the current year are caused by tax revenue shortfalls attributable to the current crisis,\" said Dave Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission. Friedfel, however, criticized some of the state\u2019s budget priorities, which pre-date the pandemic, including state aid to wealthy school districts, \"ineffective economic development programs,\" and spending more on Medicaid than the budget authorized.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue, said Klopott of the state Division of Budget.\n\nA state estimate on April 25 puts the loss of revenues at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years.\n\n\"In the absence of federal funding to offset that loss, we\u2019re preparing a plan to reduce state spending by $10.1 billion, which will reduce support for hospitals, police, firefighters, teachers, and the not-for-profits that provide services to the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including the elderly, children, and the homeless,\" Klopott said.\n\nIn an op-ed for the New York Daily News, DiNapoli pleaded for billions in unrestricted aid for New York, writing that lost state revenue as a result of the state\u2019s weakened economy \"stands to trigger significant reductions to schools, hospitals and a broad range of other vital services \u2014 cuts that would add to the human and economic damage brought on by COVID-19.\"\n\nOther experts we consulted said that states' financial struggles are attributable to the current crisis.\n\nLucy Dadayan, who leads the nonpartisan State Tax and Economic Review Project at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said that all states, regardless of the affiliations of their political leadership, will need federal funds, because all states are affected by lost tax revenue due to closed businesses.\n\nRichard Auxier, also with the Urban Institute-Tax Policy Center, said state and federal governments turned off the economy, cutting revenues to pay for everything that states pay for, such as public health, education, police protection, and roads and bridges.\n\nWe reached out to Biggs\u2019 spokesperson to ask for evidence to support this claim three times through email and left a telephone message with his office. We did not receive a response.\n\nBiggs said that New York was one of several states demanding federal funds to bail out pension funds. He also claimed that New York and other states want federal funds to pay for programs not related to the pandemic.\n\nNew York\u2019s pension fund was one of the strongest in the country, according to a nonpartisan, nationwide analysis published in 2019, before the crisis hit state budgets. The New York state comptroller said that the pension system has not requested federal funds.\n\nThe other part of Biggs\u2019 statement \u2013 that the funding will pay for programs not related to the pandemic \u2013 is correct but misleading. The tax receipts that fund the full range of state governments have been sharply reduced by the pandemic. The federal funding sought by states would partly offset those pandemic losses.", "lang": "en"}
