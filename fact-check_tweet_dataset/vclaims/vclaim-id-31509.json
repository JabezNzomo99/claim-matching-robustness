Cases of the novel respiratory virus have now been confirmed in at least 25 countries as of Feb. 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports.\n\nA viral post alleges its video footage, which features live and dead animals being sold in close proximity to each other, depicts that Wuhan market. It has been viewed more than 15,100 times since being posted on Jan. 28.\n\nHowever, the market captured in the video is not located in Wuhan or any other Chinese city, contrary to the post\u2019s claim. It actually shows the Langowan market located in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, a title card that roughly translates to \u201cLangowan EXTREME Market\u201d reveals the true location of the market. A sign visible in the video also reads \u201cLangowan Market Office\u201d when translated to English, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe footage dates back to at least July 2019, when it was posted on YouTube with the description saying, \u201cThe most extreme food in the world is only in Langowan Market.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Chinese Coronavirus Hospital In Wuhan)\n\nChina has reported 72,528 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,870 deaths to the WHO at the time of publication.", "lang": "en"}
