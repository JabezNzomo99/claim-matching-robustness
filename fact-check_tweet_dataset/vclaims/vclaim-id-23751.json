The claim is false; the images actually show a 2018 incident in Malaysia when a wild boar got into a mosque and injured worshipers.\n\nThe misleading claims have been shared hundreds of times of Facebook, for example here and here on April 28, 2019.\n\nThe posts have a Bengali language caption which says: \"Behold Muslim brothers the Hindu community in India left a boar in a mosque in India. Allah save your holy house! It doesn\u2019t matter how amicable a country India is, they cannot be friends to Muslims.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading claim:\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the photos in the misleading posts actually show a wild boar in Sungai Buloh in Malaysia in March, 2018.\n\nOne of the images can be seen in this report by Malaysian newspaper The Star headlined: \u201cWild boar sneaks into mosque, injures man\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nA keyword search for \"mosque boar Sungai Buloh\" led to further news reports of the same incident, for example this one in Singaporean newspaper The Independent which contains the other image used in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nMultiple Malay-language Facebook posts from the same date as the news reports, for example this one, also includes both the photos.\n\nThe lengthy caption describes a March 6, 2018 incident when a wild boar entered the mosque.\n\nThe March 7, 2018 post is embedded below:\n\nA translation of the first paragraphs of the Malay-language caption reads:\n\n\"I would like to represent Mr Nazir and all the officials of the Jamek Sungai Plong Mosque to say thank you to all the parties involved either directly or indirectly in helping the mosque during the disaster at the mosque.\n\n\"Today, on the 6th of March 2018, Tuesday, when the mosque pilgrims were completing their prayers, our mosque was 'visited' by a lost male wild boar that came that into the gated area of the mosque, chasing after the pilgrims and children outside and subsequently into the prayer hall with an injury in its neck.\n\n\"There was a pilgrim who was injured as a result of being headbutted by the animal. Many pilgrims tried to save themselves and some of them tried to shoo the animal out of the prayer hall.\"\n\nThis false claim that the 2018 images of the boar at the Malaysian mosque show an incident in India has been previously debunked by Boom Live.", "lang": "en"}
