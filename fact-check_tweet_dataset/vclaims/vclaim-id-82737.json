According to a 2004 Associated Press article, Bush\u2019s approval rating soared amid the hurricanes in 2004, and nearly 90 percent of those polled said they approved of his emergency response to the hurricanes. The AP cited a poll in late September that found his approval rating at 62 percent \u2014 a 17-point improvement over the previous month. Nearly 90 percent said they approved of his response to the hurricanes.\n\nClearly, this is quite a specific claim to Bush\u2019s experience and not directly comparable to the other governors. One could imagine a similar talking point for Christie, and the national recognition he gained for his role after Hurricane Sandy. Christie\u2019s ratings also soared then, and he also pushed for his state to receive federal aid. And it\u2019s not exactly fair to compare Bush\u2019s record to Kasich\u2019s in Ohio, a much less hurricane-prone state.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve noted before, the best way to measure job creation is to look at the rate of job growth. Florida is a larger state, certainly much larger than Ohio or New Jersey. When looking at the rate of growth, Florida placed fifth overall during those years at 19.8 percent gain. Nevada (34.4 percent), Arizona (25.9 percent), Wyoming (23.3 percent) and Idaho (22.1 percent) ranked higher than Florida in terms of job growth rate.\n\n\u201cFlorida led the nation in net job creation under Jeb for several years, a claim neither Christie nor Kasich can make with their states,\u201d Wall said. \u201cNet job creation is one way to measure job growth. And just as you note Florida is a larger state than Ohio and New Jersey, there are states much larger than Florida (e.g. California\u2019s population has millions more people than Florida) yet under Jeb, Florida still led the nation in job creation.\u201d\n\nBut the National Review also reported that Bush wasn\u2019t expected to rally against Scott, \u201csince he usually avoids becoming involved in partisan debates and intra-party battles. But within the upper echelons of Florida Republican politics, his opposition to Medicaid expansion is well known, and has been privately cited by Scott\u2019s critics, who hope to kill the governor\u2019s proposal in the legislature.\u201d Bush also said publicly that he had doubts about the expansion.\n\nLooking through the news coverage, Bush appears to have taken more of an advisory role than an active role to \u201clead the fight to stop\u201d Medicaid expansion. We asked Wall about this, who responded: \u201cJeb took an active role by meeting with legislators and encouraging them to reject Obamacare expansion, which they ultimately did, so by definition he led on the issue.\u201d\n\nKasich wrote an Aug. 17 op-ed on CNN.com outlining foreign policy and counterterrorism stances, but the plan was not specifically limited to ISIS. Kasich made one reference to ISIS in the op-ed: \u201cAny action that America takes, or suggests, is more effective if it is reinforced by a stronger military and renewed alliances. With these shored-up alliances, a stronger presence in the Western Pacific, a more aggressive allied stance toward Russia, and decisive allied action to eradicate ISIS would all produce better outcomes, as well as give potential future disruptive actors more pause for thought.\u201d\n\nThe ad made four claims about Bush\u2019s record. One claim stretched the facts into an apples-to-oranges-to-lemons comparison of jobs numbers; one oddly claimed Bush \u201cled the fight to stop\u201d Medicaid expansion when he appeared to have played more of an advisory role; one made an accurate but very specific claim about Bush\u2019s record handling nine hurricanes in Florida that just isn\u2019t comparable to the other two governors (in contrast, there were eight recorded hurricanes in the eastern Ohio/Ohio Valley region since 1915); and one was accurate that Bush had delivered an ISIS-specific speech months before the Paris attacks (though his specific proposal about committing military troops was not made clear until November).", "lang": "en"}
