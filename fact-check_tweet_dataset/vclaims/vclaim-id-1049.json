Examples of posts that have shared the image can be seen here, here and here .\n\nThe photos were taken several years before the protests. The first photograph is of Philadelphia\u2019s Vietnam Veterans Memorial and can be seen in an article published on March 9, 2016 after several star medallions were stolen from the site (here) .\n\nThe second photo was published on April 21, 2014 in a news report about the vandalism of military memorials in Milton and Pensacola. The photo is credited as \u201cNews Journal file photos\u201d, indicating that the image may also predate the article. More recently, a monochrome version of the image appears on January 27, 2020 in an article about a bill to increase penalties for veterans\u2019 monument desecration(here) (here) .\n\nFalse.
