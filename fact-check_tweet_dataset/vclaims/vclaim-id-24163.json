No doubt Time magzine has lost their credibilty and has become mouthpiece of Leftist.\n\nThe above message was tweeted by a pro-BJP social media user, Chowkidar Shashank Singh (@pokershash), alluding to the author of the recent article in TIME magazine critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chowkidar Shashank Singh is followed on Twitter by union minister Chowkidar Smriti Irani.\n\nThe cover story of TIME featuring PM Modi with the words \u2018India\u2019s divider-in-chief\u2019 has been a major talking point, with extensive coverage by mainstream media and animated discussions among social media users.\n\nThis tweet has been retweeted over 500 times. The user has attached a screenshot of the Wikipedia write-up on Aatish Taseer. Taseer is a British-born journalist and writer. The screenshot shows that according to the description on Wikipedia, Taseer \u201cis working as PR manger for Indian National Congress.\u201d\n\nThe implication here is that Taseer\u2019s article is motivated and not sincere because he works with the Congress party as its PR manager. Interestingly, the word manager has been spelt as \u2018manger\u2019, in the above screenshot.\n\nThe text seen in the screenshot shared on Twitter has been edited. This is because Wikipedia allows users to edit pages and articles. The page on editing states, \u201cWikipedia is a wiki, meaning that anyone can edit any unprotected page and improve articles immediately for all readers. You do not need to register to do this. Anyone who has edited is known as a \u201cWikipedian\u201d (commonly referred to as, simply, editors) and, no matter how trivial the edit may seem, can be proud that they have helped make Wikipedia what it is.\u201d\n\nAlt News found that the Wikipedia page of Aatish Taseer was edited repeatedly on May 10. The first edit was at 7:59 am, when the bit about Taseer being \u201cthe PR manger for the Congress\u201d was added to the \u2018Career\u2019 section of the page.\n\nMoreover, Taseer\u2019s page is now \u2018protected\u2019, due to \u2018persistent disruptive editing\u2019, which means that the contents of the page have now been protected from further malicious alteration due to excessive activity on the page, since the TIME magazine article came out.\n\nThe video posted below illustrates the changes which have been effected on the page. These alterations can be viewed in the \u2018View History\u2019 tab of the page.\n\nAatish Taseer\u2019s Wikipedia page was vandalised- the contents of the page were mischievously edited, and a screenshot of the same was shared on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
