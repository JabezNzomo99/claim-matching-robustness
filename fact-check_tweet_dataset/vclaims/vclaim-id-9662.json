Some of the construction workers were even female.\u201d\n\nThe stories \u2014 without evidence \u2014 leave the false impression that female employees were responsible for the bridge collapse, even though the National Transportation Safety Board has not yet determined an official cause.\n\nIn a statement emailed to FactCheck.org by a company spokesman, MCM President Jorge Munilla said the stories circulating \u201cspewed hate against women and minorities while promoting white supremacy, which we will not tolerate as a company.\u201d\n\nMCM\u2019s website shows that Munilla and his five brothers run the company, and two other men are on the executive management team.\n\n\n\nMCM does have women in construction management jobs, project executive positions and as department heads, company spokesman Donald Silver said in an email. In all, 11 of the 92 employees in management positions are women, Silver said.\n\nSilver confirmed that photos published in some of the stories were of actual MCM employees but included captions that \u201care not accurate.\u201d The photos were taken from the company\u2019s social media pages, which it has since suspended.\n\n\u201cThis was done out of an abundance of caution for the safety of our staff due to a fabricated article making the rounds on junk news sites featuring the photos and names of MCM female employees,\u201d the company told us.\n\nAnd no one holds the title of CEO, Silver said. (MCM\u2019s partner in the project \u2014 FIGG Bridge Engineers, which specializes in bridge design \u2014 is run by President and CEO Linda Figg.)\n\nIn an apparent attempt to connect women executives to the accident, the stories use a legitimate quote from Leonor Flores, a female project executive for MCM, that was published in a story on Florida International University\u2019s website before the collapse.\n\nFlores, who is a university alumna, spoke of sharing her line of work with her 12-year-old daughter as they watched the installation of the 950-ton pedestrian bridge, which was intended to connect the university\u2019s campus and the city of Sweetwater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter because I think women have a different perspective,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to put in an artistic touch and we\u2019re able to build too.\u201d\n\nThe Minuteman Militia story mocked Flores\u2019 quote, saying it shows she wants only to make bridges \u201clook pretty. Nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Flores was involved in the university\u2019s project. FIU updated its story after the bridge collapse, and it now says, \u201cTo clarify, Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity.\u201d\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nViglucci, Andres. \u201c\u2018Instant\u2019 bridge aims to make a dangerous crossing safer for thousands of students.\u201d The Miami Herald. 10 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
