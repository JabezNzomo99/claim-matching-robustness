Pointing to the COVID-19 entry of \u201c56\u201d are the words: \u201cTHIS is what collapsed the world economy\u201d.\n\nThe first issue with this statement is that the COVID-19 statistic was calculated before deaths caused by the disease started growing exponentially.\n\n\u201cThis graph is very out of date\u201d, Royal Statistical Society statistical ambassador Anthony Masters told Reuters. \u201cBy 9th March, COVID-19 was an emerging disease with under 4,000 reported deaths.\u201d (here) He noted that according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, reported COVID-19 deaths worldwide increased to over 400,000 by mid-June.\n\nThe same chart (here) shows cumulative worldwide deaths at 511,037 as of July 1. By Reuters calculations, that would equate to a daily rate of 2,792 daily deaths per day if measured since the start of 2020 \u2013 nearly 50 times higher than the rate shown in the bar chart for the arbitrary date of March 9.\n\nAccording to Masters, another potentially misleading feature of the graph is the comparison of \u201cthis earlier COVID-19 figure to established diseases\u201d. Unlike the coronavirus, diseases like tuberculosis have now established a more stable death rate (here).\n\nThe bar chart does not make clear how the figures were calculated and, if they are averages, what time period they refer to.\n\n\u201cThe crucial thing in comparing any impacts is to be clear about the area and time period over which they are experienced,\u201d said David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University. \u201cEven if COVID deaths do not rank highly when averaged over the whole year, it is important to remember that the COVID deaths came in a spike that threatened to overwhelm health services\u201d.\n\nMisleading. The graph lacks the parameters needed to the compare death rates, as well as information about how the numbers were calculated. The COVID-19 death rate does not reflect the current impact of the disease.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
