(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLet\u2019s look at it.\n\nFirst, the judge reference. In March, Fox News suspended host Jeanine Pirro from her show \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" after she read a scripted commentary about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that was \"widely criticized as Islamophobic,\" according to CNN. Fox revealed that same month that Brazile was joining the network.\n\nBrazile is a former interim chair of the DNC, and a former CNN commentator.\n\nCNN forced Brazile to resign in October 2016 after emails released by WikiLeaks revealed that she shared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides some of the questions that CNN moderators would likely ask the then-presidential candidate during network-sponsored debates and town hall meetings.\n\n\"We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,\" network spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said at the time. \"CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate.\"\n\nBrazile was a Clinton supporter and, The New York Times reported, the fact that she shared questions with a candidate \"would seem to undercut the impartiality of the event and, as a CNN contributor, potentially reflect poorly on the network.\"\n\nIn a March 2017 essay for Time magazine, Brazile called emailing the Clinton campaign \"a mistake I will forever regret.\"\n\nBrazile did not immediately respond to PolitiFact\u2019s email asking about the post\u2019s accuracy. A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee also did not respond to an email from PolitiFact.\n\nBut we found no evidence that Brazile faced criminal charges in connection with the leak, though some people wished otherwise. Searching for news coverage of any arrests or crimes in connection with Brazile, we found this Change.org petition called: \"Arrest donna brazile.\"\n\nIn November 2017, Politico published an excerpt from Brazile\u2019s then-forthcoming book, \"Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House.\" In it, she describes trying to find evidence of internal corruption that would show the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary. She discovered a \"victory fund agreement\" between the campaign and the DNC signed before Clinton secured the Democratic nomination.\n\n\"If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead,\" she wrote. \"This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party\u2019s integrity.\"\n\nThe conservative-leaning Weekly Standard did its own fact-check of a claim that the DNC illegally stole the 2016 primary from Bernie Sanders. In it, the publication pointed to a class-action lawsuit against the DNC that alleged the organization violated its own charter \"by working with a single campaign to effectively choose who would win the Democratic ballot.\"\n\nThe DNC responded that it had no legal obligations \"to remain impartial throughout the process.\" The lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nAs for the post that calls Brazile a criminal, we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
