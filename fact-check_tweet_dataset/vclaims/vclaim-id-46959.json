No sources from the philosopher\u2019s era attribute these words to him.\n\nSocrates, born in Athens, Greece, around 470 B.C., is widely considered one of history\u2019s most influential philosophers. He was a pioneer of the \u201cSocratic method\u201d of question-and-answer-based dialogue, still practiced to this day. Socrates\u2019 students included Plato and Xenophon, who became historically significant figures in their own right. (RELATED: Did Aristotle Say, \u2018We Are What We Repeatedly Do\u2019?)\n\nControversial during his lifetime, Socrates was famously executed by the Athenian authorities for \u201cimpiety\u201d and \u201ccorrupting the young.\u201d This incident is discussed by Plato in his well-known dialogic work \u201cPhaedo.\u201d\n\nWhile Socrates often engaged in philosophical debates, he did not author the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. \u201cI can affirm that no reliable source ever attributed this statement to Socrates,\u201d University of Michigan historian and Socrates expert Sara Ahbel-Rappe told The Daily Caller in an email. \u201cSocrates wrote nothing, so we rely entirely on reports about Socrates from contemporary witnesses, mostly Plato but also Xenophon.\u201d\n\nThe quote in question does not appear in the collected works of either Xenophon or Plato.\n\nEven if one of these philosophers had attributed the statement to Socrates, the accuracy of such an attribution would be far from certain. Scholars have long debated which ideas ascribed to Socrates by Plato, Xenophon and other contemporaries were truly expressed by him, an issue known as the \u201cSocratic problem.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
