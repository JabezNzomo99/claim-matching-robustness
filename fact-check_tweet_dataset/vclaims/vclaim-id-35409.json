In reality, the pictures show Halloween props.\n\nThe photographs have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook since February 4. We\u2019ve archived some of the posts (graphic) here and here.\n\nHundreds of Facebook users commented on the posts. Some paid their respects to the NBA icon while others condemned the publication of the graphic images. Others again said the posts were \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nThe retired basketball player and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were killed alongside seven others after their helicopter crashed into a rugged hillside in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas on January 26.\n\nAFP ran a reverse image search on Yandex and found one of the two pictures featured in the Facebook posts on the websites of companies specialising in Halloween props for TV and film.\n\nA Google search for the phrase \u201cburn luttra cadaver body\u201d revealed the fake body advertised on other sites, including here and here.\n\nAFP tried to track down a second photograph circulating on social media. Although the cadavre in the picture resembles the \u201cburn body\u201d on the Halloween prop sites, we were not able to confirm this.\n\nIf you have more information about the body, you can get in touch here.\n\nAFP reported on several cases of misinformation surrounding Kobe Bryant\u2019s death, including videos falsely purporting to show the helicopter crash that killed him here and here.", "lang": "en"}
