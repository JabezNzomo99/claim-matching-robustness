The post claims that Tej Pratap Singh, who did not even clear his tenth standard exams, received a Doctorate degree from Takshashila University, Bihar.\n\nThe Facebook page \"Narendra Modi - True Indian\" has 1,086,394 followers and 899,671 likes. At the time of writing the story, the post shared by the page about Tej Pratap Yadav had around 2k shares. The post carries a screenshot of a post which dates back to July 5th, 2017.\n\nYou can check the archived version of the post here.\n\nThe image with the same context went viral earlier last year and was shared by many people on Facebook and Twitter. It was also debunked by fake news busting websites Check4Spam and Lallantop.\n\nWe also found Yadav's tweet from February, 2017 where he has shared the images from the same event. The event was held at the IGIMS and not Takshashila University. Tej Pratap in his tweet also mentioned that he gave the degree certificates and gold medals at the event in IGIMS.\n\nWe also found a video of the event at the IGIMS convocation in 2017 and it is quite clear from the video that he was distributing the certificates to the students.\n\n78 MBBS, 20 postgraduates, three superspecialty courses students and 20 paramedics were awarded degrees by the then State Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav, reported The Times Of India.", "lang": "en"}
