The report was published on December 21, 2017, three days after the result of the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly election was declared. Apparently, the article was also reproduced verbatim in a Hindi newspaper. Alt News could not verify in which newspaper and on which date this report was published.\n\nFormer CEC T S Krishnamurthy in a conversation with Alt News rubbished this report, saying he had not made any such remark. \u201cThis information is totally wrong, I have never ever expressed any opinion about the working of the EVM in Gujarat elections. I have only defended the credibility of the Electronic Voting Machines. I have no doubts about its integrity\u201d, he clarified. In fact, the report by The Daily Graph is all the more mischievous as on December 18, 2017, the day the assembly election results for Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh were announced, Krishnamurthy had issued a statement saying that EVM bashing must stop as they had \u2018done their job well\u2019.\n\nThe controversy over the susceptibility of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) to hacking has been doing the rounds ever since their introduction in the Indian electoral system in 1998. Almost always, it is the losing side which alleges that the machines have been tampered by the ruling party in collusion with the Election Commission. Alt News believes that in order to restore faith in the electoral process which has come under a cloud due to suspicion with regard to EVMs, the Election Commission could ensure greater transparency by putting out relevant educational material, especially in the form of videos that detail how the electoral process is secure and free of tampering, and also debunk the claims which circulate on social media that the electoral exercise has been compromised.", "lang": "en"}
