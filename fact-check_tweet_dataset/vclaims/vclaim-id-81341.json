The chamber\u2019s tweet caught our attention. It\u2019s a quiz for the Twitterverse: How much does it cost taxpayers to run the bank? If you guessed $97,000, $6 million or $2 billion, you\u2019re wrong, it says. In fact, it costs $0, and \u201cover the past two decades, Ex-Im has actually generated a surplus of nearly $7 billion for American taxpayers,\u201d according to the tweet.\n\nIn other calculations of this claim (which the Chamber also has used), the bank has generated $7 billion for taxpayers since 1992. Proponents of the bank use these figures to show the program actually makes a profit for taxpayers. But there are a lot of technical elements of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s reserves and fee structure going on here. That means for every $1 that taxpayers spent for the program, they received $1.71 over 23 years.\n\nPart of it comes from \u201cnegative subsidy\u201d receipts, which is not exactly a \u201cprofit\u201d as the public commonly understands it. It refers to a budgetary method to track savings that occurred because the government had estimated a higher cost for the loan. The Export-Import Bank sets aside reserves to cover expected losses. If the loan does not default and is repaid, the agency sends all excess money to the Treasury, as required. (The technical details of negative subsidies are available here.)\n\nThere is a lot of complex information over how costs and revenues are calculated with the Export-Import Bank. The most important thing that explains the dramatically different calculations is that there are two types of accounting measures being used: one that the federal government currently uses, and one that congressional budget analysts prefer. The Congressional Budget Office believes the latter method, called fair value accounting, is a more accurate way to estimate the cost of the loans to American taxpayers.\n\nThe first calculation follows the rules established by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, which required the government to record the present value of the projected lifetime cost of the loan. So the cost of the loan needs to be recorded in the federal budget using the interest rates on Treasury securities of the year that the loan was made. (The Fact Checker has explored this in depth.) This is how agency officials have calculated the $7 billion \u201csurplus\u201d figure.\n\nBoth calculations use the same projected cash flows that the bank reported for the administration\u2019s 2015 budget. The difference is that fair-value accounting accounts for \u201cmarket risk.\u201d That refers to the risks that the government is exposed to because of other things happening in the economy, such as productivity and employment. When the economy is weak, borrowers default on their debt obligations more frequently, and the government is exposed to more risk, according to the CBO. So the market risks associated with loans are effectively passed on to taxpayers. Taxpayers \u2014 as in, the investors \u2014 would view that risk as having a cost, the CBO says.\n\nThose who want the bank to be reauthorized say it is an unfair accounting method to use for Export-Import loans, because it tries to compare the program to the risks that private investors would face. Yet there is no comparable loan program in the private market \u2014 which is why the Export-Import Bank exists in the first place, they say. Critics also say that it overestimates default rates, which leads to unrealistically high projections. And they say it captures \u201ccosts,\u201d not \u201closses,\u201d and gives a misleading impression to the public.\n\n\u201cWhen the government finances a risky loan by selling a Treasury security, it is effectively imposing risk on some members of the public: If such a loan is repaid as expected, the interest and principal payments cover the government\u2019s obligation to the holder of the Treasury security, but if the borrower defaults, the obligation to the security holder must be paid for either by raising taxes or by cutting other spending,\u201d according to the testimony.\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously takes no position on which accounting method the government should use. The CBO \u2014 considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in Washington \u2014 appears to have taken a strong stance for using fair-value accounting, especially when it comes to Export-Import Bank loans. The government is not a private financial institution, and therefore operates on different budgeting standards. It would be unfair to penalize the Export-Import Bank for following the current accounting measures required by law. However, the CBO makes a valid argument that when it comes to loans that use taxpayer money, policymakers can never be too cautious by factoring in market risks or hidden costs to the taxpayer.\n\nThat the Export-Import Bank costs $0 to the taxpayer is an oversimplification. There is so much happening in that figure, including the calculation of \u201cnegative subsidies,\u201d which is not the same as the type of profits that taxpayers commonly would think of when they see such a tweet. Plus, the \u201ccost\u201d to the taxpayers varies by billions of dollars depending on the accounting method used.\n\nThe more complex the topic, the more susceptible it is to spin the issue and mislead the average reader or Twitter user without any context. This is a highly complicated topic, with both sides jumping to flash warnings about exactly how much this agency is costing or not costing taxpayers. But for those not in the fact-checking business, it\u2019s easy to click through a user-friendly and digestible tweet like this and move on. We will be looking at other claims made on this topic, from both critics and supporters of Export-Import Bank.", "lang": "en"}
