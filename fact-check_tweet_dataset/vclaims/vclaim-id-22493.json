Takuwani Riime is a Tshivenda expression meaning \u201cLet us stand up together\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have to talk as men about the pain we\u2019ve inflicted on women and children,\u201d Mabuza said.\n\nHere we weigh up five claims Mabuza made about violence against South Africa\u2019s women and children. (\n\nrecords the number of women murdered in the country. When this data is compared with population estimates, a murder rate can be calculated.\n\nshows that in the 2017/18 financial year, 15.2 out of every 100,000 women were victims of murder.\n\nThis is the highest the rate has been in the past five years and represents a 16% increase over the period.\n\nThe most recent research on violence against women in South Africa is the country\u2019s 2016\n\naround the world. It provides\n\non a wide range of topics \u2013 population, health and nutrition.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s 2016 survey included questions on whether women aged 18 and older had ever experienced physical violence by any partner.\n\nthat \u201cone in five partnered women has ever experienced physical violence by a partner\u201d. But this statistic cannot be applied to the whole female population, as Mabuza did in his speech.\n\nThe question relates to \u201cwomen that were currently and/or previously in a relationship with a man in their lifetime\u201d, Statistics South Africa told Africa Check.\n\nThey include \u201cwomen who are married, divorced, separated, widowed, living or lived with a man as if married, had or have boyfriends or [a] fianc\u00e9\u201d.\n\nWhen considering South Africa\u2019s total adult female population, Statistics South Africa said 7.7% of women 18 years and older experienced violence by a current or previous partner in the 12 months before the survey.\n\nThis means that one in 13 women in South Africa \u2013 not one in five \u2013 have experienced physical violence from an intimate partner.\n\n124,526 cases of rape in the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17.\n\n, the victim was recorded as aged 18 or younger. This is 41% of all the rapes recorded in South Africa over the three years.\n\nMore recent crime statistics, for 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, were released after Mabuza\u2019s speech. These reveal an even higher share:\n\nof the 40,035 rapes recorded, or 45.8%, were of children.\n\nThe police\u2019s crime statistics for 2017/18 show that\n\nwere murdered in South Africa from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018.\n\nThis was an 8.6% increase in the femicide rate - from 14 murders for every 100,000 women in 2016/17 to 15.2 murders per 100,000 women a year later.\n\nBut do we know how many of these women were murdered by men?\n\nof murders of women in the 2016/17 reporting year. This indicated that a suspect was identified and arrested in 1,834 of 2,639 recorded murders, or 69.5% of cases. Out of the identified suspects, 93.2% were male.\n\n, Anine Kriegler, told Africa Check she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if perpetrators of murders of women were more likely to be identified because it will more often be their current or former partner\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally not premeditated and it\u2019s less likely to happen in the course of robbery, so it\u2019s usually not a stranger. It\u2019s probably often quite obvious who did it.\u201d\n\nBut Kriegler pointed out that the police only analysed arrests, and not the number of\n\n\u201cThe police may well have identified the wrong suspect, and therefore gender. Guilt is ultimately decided by the court, not the cop.\u201d\n\nKriegler said all that could be shown in the analysis was that \u201cin 93% of female murder cases where the police identified a suspected perpetrator, the perpetrator was a man\u201d.\n\nhow many investigations of the crimes reported to them are seen as \u201csuccessful\u201d - including those carried over from previous years.\n\nis defined as successful when a perpetrator is identified, arrested and charged, when a case is withdrawn before a perpetrator is charged, and when a case is closed as \u201cunfounded\u201d.\n\nThe police\u2019s latest annual report puts the detection rate for the murder of women older than 18 at\n\nin 2017/18. This is higher than the overall murder detection rate, recorded at 23.2% in 2016/17 and 22.5% in 2017/18.\n\nIn 2017/18, there were 2,783 new female murder cases recorded. A suspect was identified and arrested in 2,018 of these cases, giving a \"success\" rate of 72.5%. But the backlog of cases brought the overall detection rate down, Kriegler told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cBased on the number of new charges, detections, and incomplete cases, it seems that a larger proportion of femicides than murders overall are solved, and solved pretty quickly. This is unsurprising, given that these murders are so often at the hands of intimate partners.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
