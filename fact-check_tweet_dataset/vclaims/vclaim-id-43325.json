He appears to a fictional character invented to sell an essential oil product.\n\nThe video tells the story of an alleged Oxford University student who overcame panic attacks and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to become one of the world\u2019s youngest PhD holders. (RELATED: Did An 11-Year-Old \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 Contestant Invent A Device To Give The World Free Wi-Fi?)\n\n\u201cBoston went on to Oxford at 15 majoring in biomolecular biology eventually earning his PhD at the young age of 22,\u201d states text in the video. \u201cHe was quickly accepted under renowned Professor Eren Burton\u2019s research team.\u201d\n\nRegan, who is said to be 22 or 23 at different points in the video, does not appear to exist, however. A spokesman for Oxford University told the Daily Caller in an email that they did not find anyone in their records matching his description. Burton also appears to be fictional, as the professor\u2019s name isn\u2019t listed in the university\u2019s online directory.\n\nThe video, which attributes Regan\u2019s success to using an essential oil, seems to be an advertisement for the vetiver oil brand VertiBoost, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Vetiver oil is made from a type of grass native to India and touted online as a naturopathic treatment for ADHD, though little research has been done on its effectiveness for such a purpose.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no controlled rigorous research on the value of that treatment for ADHD and no rational reason to even do such an experiment at this time,\u201d Dr. Russell Barkley, an ADHD expert, told the Caller via email.", "lang": "en"}
