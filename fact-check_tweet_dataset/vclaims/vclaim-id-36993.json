Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the U.S. doesn\u2019t have to worry about Chinese missile attacks because of the difference in time zones between the two countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have to worry about China attacking us! They are 12 hours ahead, so we\u2019ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!\u201d reads the alleged quote.\n\nThere is no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made this statement.\n\nOcasio-Cortez came to national prominence after defeating 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley to represent New York\u2019s 14th congressional district. She is a self-described democratic socialist and, at 29, is the youngest woman to ever be elected to Congress.\n\nShe has also drawn the ire of her critics, with this particular meme created to question her intelligence. \u201cDid she REALLY say that? Yep, you\u2019re looking at the future of the Democrat party\u2026\u201d the image reads.\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that she ever said the alleged quote. The meme does not cite any source and has been circulating the internet since at least September. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Really Say This About Ben Shapiro?)\n\nCorbin Trent, a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, told FactCheck.org last year that the quote was fabricated. \u201cShe\u2019s never even discussed Chinese missiles. Period,\u201d he said. \u201cHer foreign policy topics have been about peace not war.\u201d\n\nA section of her campaign website titled \u201cA Peace Economy\u201d lays out her general foreign policy stances. \u201cAlexandria believes that we must end the \u2018forever war\u2019 by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,\u201d it reads.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Missile Defense Project, China is \u201cin the process of building and deploying a sophisticated and modern missile arsenal\u201d and has a \u201crelatively small but developing contingent of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S. homeland.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
