On April 16, three sadhus affiliated with Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara were mistaken for thieves and lynched in Maharashtra\u2019s Palghar. The perpetrators and the victims hailed from the same community and more than 100 people have been arrested for the crime. Juna Akhada sadhus have also informed that they would gather at Trayamkeshwar in Nashik to demand a high-level probe into the murder, per a report by Hindustan Times.\n\nBelow is a tweet by one Gunjan Kashyap who identifies as a BJP and RSS supporter. Her tweet has garnered over 300 retweets. It reads, \u201c\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0964 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092f\u0939 \u0924\u0942\u092b\u093e\u0928 \u0930\u094b\u0915 \u092a\u093e\u090f\u0917\u0940? \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0942\u0902 \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926 \u092a\u093e\u0932\u0918\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0921 \u092a\u0930 \u0907\u0902\u0938\u093e\u092b \u0939\u094b\u0964 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u091c\u0942\u0928\u093e \u0905\u0916\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u0928\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0915 \u0921\u093e\u0909\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0928\u0940 \u0926\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d\n\nThe video is massively viral on social media.\n\nAlt News had fact-check this video earlier in January when it was shared with the false claim that it shows sadhus and agoras coming out in large numbers in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). However, we had found that the same video was earlier shared by a Twitter user Aviator Anil Chopra with the message, \u201cThe greatest temporary spectacle on earth, peaceful and orderly for such a great mass of humanity. Incredible Indian civilisation. #Kumbh2019\u201c. It was posted on March 7, 2019.\n\nThe reverse image search also led us to a March 11, 2019 Facebook post by one Suresh Kumar, where the video is accompanied with the caption, \u201cKumbh Mela Naga sadhu\u201d.\n\nKumbh Mela was celebrated from January 15 to March 4 last year and saw a footfall of over a million pilgrims.\n\nThe video, however, was also uploaded with different description on YouTube. A channel uploaded the clip on March 3, 2019, with the caption, \u201cJunaghad Naga bava\u201d suggesting that the video pertains to Mahashivratri. This festival fell on March 4 in 2019.\n\nWhile the origin of the video could not be established, it certainly is unrelated to the Palghar lynching incident.", "lang": "en"}
