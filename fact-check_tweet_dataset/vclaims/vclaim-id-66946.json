Here a worship for Mahatma Gandhi and Godse who shot and killed them..!!!? The country will shine\u2026!!\u201d the post claimed in Tamil. ( Translated using Google)\n\nHere\u2019s the link to the above post.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be misleading.\n\n\u201cAmong those imprisoned at Cellular Jail was the great Veer Savarkar. I visited the cell where the indomitable Veer Savarkar was lodged. Rigorous imprisonment did not dampen Veer Savarkar\u2019s spirits and he continued to speak and write about a free India from jail too,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nFrom the above fact check, it is clear that the man in the picture is not Nathuram Godse but Veer Savarkar.\n\nHence, the post is misleading and false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
