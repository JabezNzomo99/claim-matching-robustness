Most recipients receive their benefits electronically.\n\nThe Treasury Department announced in April 2010 that it was phasing out paper checks in an effort to save money and cut back on paper waste.\n\n\"Treasury will require individuals receiving Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Veterans, Railroad Retirement and Office of Personnel Management benefits to receive payments electronically,\" the agency said in a news release. \"Individuals will be able to receive benefits either through direct deposit into a bank account or Treasury's Direct Express debit card.\"\n\nThe department said that the move was expected to save more than $400 million and 12 million pounds of paper in the first five years.\n\nIn a subsequent release, the Social Security Administration announced that anyone applying for benefits on or after May 1, 2011, would receive their payments electronically. Those who were already getting paper checks had until March 1, 2013, to switch to direct deposit. If they didn\u2019t, they would receive their benefits through the Direct Express card program, a debit card where they could access payments without a bank account.\n\nBut some people still receive their benefits the old fashioned way, thanks to mail delivery.\n\nNearly 550,000 people are receiving paper Social Security checks in August, according to Social Security Administration data. That number goes up to about 848,000 if you include Supplemental Security Income.\n\nBut the vast majority \u2014 over 63 million \u2014 access their benefits via direct deposit.\n\nLongoria Bast\u00f3n said, \"Social Security beneficiaries count on the post office to get their checks.\"\n\nThat\u2019s true for some beneficiaries, but not for most.\n\nAround half a million people still receive paper checks in the mail. The vast majority \u2014 more than 63 million \u2014 get their payments electronically. The transition to electronic deposits started more than 10 years ago during the Obama administration to cut back on paper waste.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but omits important context.
