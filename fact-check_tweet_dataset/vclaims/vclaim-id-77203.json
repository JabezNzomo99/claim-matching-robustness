And by 2026, the premiums, on average, would be 10 percent lower than they would have been under Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s expected for several reasons: The GOP legislation would provide grants to states that could be used to reduce premiums; the bill would eliminate a requirement for insurers to offer plans covering certain percentages of health care expenses; and a younger mix of enrollees.\n\nWhile on average premiums are expected to eventually be 10 percent lower, the impact on different groups of people would be wide ranging.\n\nUnder Obamacare, a 64-year-old can generally be charged premiums that cost up to three times as much as those offered to a 21-year-old. But under the GOP bill, it would be five times as much, unless a state chose otherwise.\n\nSo, by 2026, premiums are projected to be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old \u2014 but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old.\n\nSome examples, for a people who earn $26,500 per year in 2026:\n\nThe annual premium for a 21-year-old would be $5,100 under Obamacare, but only $3,900 under the GOP plan. For a 64-year-old, the premiums would be $15,300 under Obamacare vs $19,500 under the GOP plan.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to look beyond what premiums will do.\n\nThe report points out that compared to Obamacare, the GOP plan would require insurance plans to cover a lower percentage of total costs -- the insurance plans would have a lower \"actuarial value,\" so lower premiums would be buying less coverage. For example, a person\u2019s deductible is expected to be higher than under Obamacare.\n\nRyan says a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \"confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums.\"\n\nHis reference is to people who buy health insurance on their own, rather than getting it from an employer or a government program such as Medicaid -- and how the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act compares to the existing Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor those people, the report expects average premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019, but by 2026 would be 10 percent lower. And the report also says that out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles, would tend to be higher than under Obamacare.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
