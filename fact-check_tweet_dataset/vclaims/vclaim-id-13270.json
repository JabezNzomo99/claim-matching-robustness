Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: DMK Manifesto: \u2018People occupying encroached Temple lands will be regularized and ownership transferred\u2019, \u2018Encroached Wakf properties will be reclaimed and handed over to wakf\u2019 Fact: The claims made in the post are from DMK\u2019s 2016 Assembly Elections manifesto. Also, the election promises made by DMK are misinterpreted to justify their claim. DMK just promised setting up a high-level committee to consider the demands of people to own the temple land under a legal framework. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen looked for the tweet on Twitter, it is found that Madhu Purnima Kishwar has actually posted the tweet mentioned in the Facebook post. But when looked in the comments below the tweet, it is found that the claims made by her are from DMK\u2019s 2016 Assembly Elections manifesto, not 2019 Parliamentary Elections manifesto\n\nWhen looked for the claims in 2016 and 2019 manifesto, it is found that the election promise in 2016 manifesto is misinterpreted to serve their agenda. In the manifesto, DMK promised to set up a high-level committee to consider the demand of people to buy temple lands within the legal framework. They did not promise regularization and transfer of ownership of temple lands. In the 2019 manifesto, there was no mention of wakf or temple lands. So, just before the parliamentary elections previous election promises of DMK from 2016 are misinterpreted and shared to mislead the people.\n\nFinally, the promises regarding wakf and temple lands are from the 2016 manifesto and also, misinterpreted in the post.", "lang": "en"}
