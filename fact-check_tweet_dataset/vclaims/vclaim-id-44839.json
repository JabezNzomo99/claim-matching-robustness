This claim is false; local police said this did not happen.\n\nThe rumor, posted by a user in Revere, Massachusetts and shared more than 8,000 times, says the apparent gift is a new tactic deployed by traffickers. According to the false post, the $100 bill is typically attached to the handle of a parked car door using a red ribbon. Anyone who touches the currency would be incapacitated, leaving them vulnerable to abduction.\n\nThe Facebook posts mention that the information \u201cis shared from a friend,\u201d or a relative of a friend, but AFP found no instances of anyone telling the story from a personal point of view.\n\nThe text specifies that the money trap is used at the Northgate Mall, a common name for shopping centers in North America, and the name of the apparent crime scene in Revere.\n\nThe post has been shared by users in East Lynn and Rehoboth, both in Massachusetts, and in Cincinnati, Ohio, as well as Burnaby, Edmonton and Winnipeg, in Canada.\n\nBut there is no evidence that such abduction tactics are being used in any of those areas.\n\n\u201cThis is not true,\u201d Captain Amy O\u2019Hara, a spokeswoman for the Revere Police Department, told AFP of the rumor.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that it provided assistance in the cases of 29,000 children reported missing in the US in 2019. Less than one percent were abducted by non-family members, while four percent were taken by relatives. The vast majority -- 91 percent -- were classed as endangered runaways.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked similar claims in Canada, as well as false reports of thwarted abductions at the country's Wonderland theme park, and of a child\u2019s abduction at an Ontario mall.\n\nThe US National Human Trafficking Hotline outlines possible indicators of a true trafficking victim here.", "lang": "en"}
