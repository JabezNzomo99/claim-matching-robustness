We fact-checked his speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nshowed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further\n\n. Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released.\n\nZuma\u2019s claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016.\n\nhad access to electricity for lighting. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science.\n\nGrade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested.\n\nThe 2015 study found that South Africa\u2019s Grade 9 pupils recorded the \u201c\n\n\u201d. There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics.\n\nThe report goes on to note that \u201cSouth Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015\u201d.\n\nWhile South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa\u2019s Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nThe media unit of the\n\n(NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check to\n\nhe historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved\u201d.\n\nHowever, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university.\n\nFirst, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students.\n\n\u201cStudents who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years\u201d can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said.\n\nSecond, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students\u2019 previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n\nThird, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students\u2019 academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meet\n\ngraduation requirements during their final year of study\n\nFinally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or \u201ccapital\u201d amount owed by the student to the university.\n\nKagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students\u2019 historic debt.\n\nNSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand\u2019s NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that \u201csome outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS\u201d.\n\nAs such, the \u201chistorical debt\u201d has not been \u201csettled\u201d but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading.\n\nThe department of basic education replaces unsafe and \u201cinappropriate\u201d school structures under the\n\nAs of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced,\n\nshowed. At the time of Zuma\u2019s speech, the department\u2019s figures showed that\n\ndisplayed on the department\u2019s website puts the number of schools at 174.\n\nThe programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially,\n\nwere identified as \u201cinappropriate structures\u201d. Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14.\n\nThe commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour.\n\nThe data in the report is submitted once a year by designated employers, which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, as well as municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions.\n\nshowed that 68.9% of top management workforce was white, 14.3% was black, 8.6% was Indian, 4.7% was coloured and 3.5% was foreign.\n\nThe breakdown of management levels by population group:\n\nsupports Zuma\u2019s claim. Nearly 2.5 million job opportunities were created between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016.\n\nWork opportunities are not permanent jobs, however, and in most cases only last a few months.\n\nThe department of public works notes that \u201cthe same individual can be employed on different projects and\n\n\u201d. So while nearly 2.5 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that the same number of people benefited from the programme. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nThis claim followed on from Zuma\u2019s previous statement, in which he said that \u201cthe expanded public works programme has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities\u201d.\n\nAfrica Check was unable to find fourth quarter figures for 2013/14. However, even without them, the\n\nreports show that 1,129,516 job opportunities were filled by young people. This was 45% of all work opportunities over the period. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nreported that black African households had an average income of R92,983 per year. In comparison, white households had an average income R444,446 per year.\n\nBased on these figures, white households\u2019 income is on average 4.8 times more than black households. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nin South Africa. It downloads the data covering a specific calendar month from the department of home affairs.\n\nThe total number of tourist arrivals between January and November 2016 adds up to 9 million, as Zuma stated.\n\nDuring the same period in\n\nHowever, arrivals in 2015 were much lower than the corresponding periods in 2014 and 2013, when more than 8.5 million tourists arrived between January and November in each year.\n\nSecurity Agency (SASSA), shows that the agency paid out more than 17 million grants at the end of January.\n\nOf those, 3,283,286 were recipients of the grant for older persons. By far the largest number of grants were for child support, with more than 12 million people receiving this type. - Julie Bourdin\n\nConsolidated figures for rhino poaching in 2016 have not yet been released. The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016\n\n. This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise.\n\nBetween January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by the\n\nWhile this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhino\n\ns (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008.\n\nAfrica Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released.\n\nfrom freezing orders is referred to as the value of \u201ccompleted forfeitures\u201d.\n\nshows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said.\n\nThese completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and \u201cthe increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture\u201d for the better-than-projected performance.\n\nThe table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years:\n\nZuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels \u201csqueeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists\u201d.\n\nIt is likely that the president was referring to the proclamation\n\nThe actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically,\n\ndirector in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr,\n\nThis amendment act introduced provisions to deal with \u201cother practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services\u201d, Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who \u201ccause firms to engage in cartel conduct\u201d.\n\nare a fine \u201cnot exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment\u201d.\n\nHowever, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. \u201cWhile criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government\u2019s strategies \u201cis to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again\u201d.\n\nshows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at the\n\n\u201cThe \u2018compliance\u2019 that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,\u201d Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained.\n\nThe number doesn\u2019t capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice.\n\nFurthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained.\n\nin 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are \u201csubstantial and compelling circumstances\u201d that justify a lesser sentence.\n\n\u201cThe department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,\u201d Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,\u201d she added.\n\nis South Africa\u2019s plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by the\n\n, the body responsible for its\n\nAccording to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together to\n\n, the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning).\n\nNational spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction.\n\nA year ago, the department said in a\n\nthat the Limpopo facility had already been completed.

In fact, his statement contained two errors.Africa Check asked the National Empowerment Fund (NEF), a government mandated fund tasked with facilitating economic equality and transformation in South Africa, for the research Zuma\u2019s claim was based on. They provided the organisation\u2019s 2017 submission to parliament\u2019s standing committee on finance.The research contained in the submission only looked at a \u201csample analysis of the top 17 financial services companies by market capitalisation as listed on the JSE\u201d - not the top 100 companies, as Zuma held.The research refers to 31 December 2016 and was conducted by Intellidex , a South African capital markets and financial services research house.The submission made no reference to black-ownership of the JSE equalling 10%.\u201cThe study shows that the financial service sector companies have achieved an average of 6% against the direct equity target of 10%,\u201d the NEF told Africa Check. - Kate WilkinsonREAD: Black ownership on SA\u2019s stock exchange - what we know", "lang": "en"}
