The article only quotes Sibal as saying that \u201cRam Mandir will be constructed when Lord Ram wishes so, not as per the wish of Modi.\u201d There is no explanation as to where the headline of the article came from.\n\nThe same quote attributed to Kapil Sibal went viral in 2019 ahead of the Supreme Court verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid land dispute case and was debunked by fact-checking website Alt News.\n\nFor further verification, The Quint reached out to a Congress functionary, who said that the claim is completely false.\n\nEvidently, a fake quote is being shared on social media in the name of senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal in the wake of Ram Mandir Bhoomi Poojan scheduled on 5 August.\n\nBefore Sibal, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav became a target of fake news when a false quote claiming that \u201cSP would never have let the construction of Ram Mandir begin if the party was in power\u201d was attributed to him.
