The intercepts, provided by Ukraine\u2019s main security agency, the SBU, suggest significant involvement of Russian military and security officials on the separatists\u2019 self-declared \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d (DPR) at the time. The JIT released the audio recordings in an appeal for new witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe indications of close ties between Russian government officials and leaders of the DPR raise questions about their possible involvement in the deployment of the BUK-TELAR [missile], which brought down flight MH17 on 17 July 2014,\u201d the JIT said. \u201cThe JIT already concluded this BUK TELAR originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The JIT is looking for witnesses who can share information about those who commanded the deployment of this BUK-TELAR.\u201d\n\nThe JIT said it wanted to determine whether four top Russian officials had \u201ca role in the planning and execution of military operations in the summer of 2014\u201d in eastern Ukraine and were \u201cinvolved in the deployment of the BUK TELAR on 17 July 2014.\u201d Those officials are Vladislav Surkov, a longtime aide to President Vladimir Putin, Sergey Aksyonov, the prime minister of Russian-occupied Crimea, Sergey Shoigu, Russia\u2019s defense minister, and Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\n\u201cRussia categorically rejects all allegations of involvement in the crash and has repeatedly stated that the investigation is biased,\u201d Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency wrote in response to the JIT\u2019s release of the recordings.\n\nLikewise, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow that the new recordings were \"fake\" and \"unconfirmed,\" and alleged that prosecutors had fabricated evidence.\n\nIn one of the intercepted phone calls, which took place on July 3, 2014, DPR leader Alexander Borodai purportedly said: \u201cI\u2019m carrying out orders and protecting the interests of one and only state, the Russian Federation. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nIn a July 18, 2014 call, a DPR field commander with the nom de guerre \u201cMongol\u201d and another separatist commander calling himself \u201cSherif\u201d indicated that they took orders from Moscow \u2013 Mongol from the FSB, and Sherif from the GRU:\n\nMongol: We get the orders from Moscow as well. It\u2019s the same with us.\n\nSherif: But it\u2019s FSB in your case? Right?\n\nSherif: And it\u2019s GRU in our case. That\u2019s the only difference.\n\nThe nom de guerre \u201cMongol\u201d has been identified as used by Slepnev, Stanislav Aleksandrovich -- the then-commander of so-called Donetsk Spetsnaz (special troops) wanted by the Ukraine security on war crime accusations.\n\nIn a July 1, 2014, conversation between Mongol and a person who identified himself as the commandant of the eastern Ukrainian city of Makeyevka, Shoigu is cited as the person who determines the separatists\u2019 chain of command:\n\n \u201cWhat happens next is a bunch of men with a mandate from Shoygu (Shoigu) will arrive and kick the local warlords the (expletive) out of the units.\u201d\n\nAlexander Bortnikov\u2019s name came up in intercepted calls as the person who approved the delivery of intelligence equipment to DPR forces. The requested gear included night vision equipment, camouflage uniforms, infrared viewers, gas masks, ammunition and armored vehicles.\n\nVladimir Putin\u2019s aide since 2013, also known as the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cgray cardinal,\u201d served as Russian special envoy to eastern Ukraine. Surkov is mentioned or heard on multiple intercepted calls. He is heard either giving orders to the DPR leaders or receiving requests for military and logistic aid and discussing the delivery of such aid.\n\nIn a July 11, 2014 phone call with Surkov, the DRP\u2019s Borodai said he urgently needed military support from Moscow. Surkov asked him to hold on for a week, saying: \u201cI will solve this by Monday-Tuesday.\u201d Surkov also urged Borodai to hold a government meeting to publicly discuss DPR preparations for the winter season in order \u201c[t]o let them all know that we are there for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe audio recordings released by the JIT are by no means the first evidence put forward of close coordination between Russian officials and the separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Immediately following the MH17 shootdown, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service released what it said was intercepted phone calls between separatist commanders discussing the incident. One of those conversations purportedly included a Russian military intelligence officer.", "lang": "en"}
