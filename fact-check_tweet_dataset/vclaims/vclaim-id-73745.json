H. Randle\" listed in the 1850 U.S. Census is the same \"Thomas H. Randle\" listed on the 1850 slave schedule.\n\nBiden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas H. Randle who was listed in the U.S. Census as living in Baltimore County's 1st district in 1850. This is the same name and district listed in an 1850 slave schedule of a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave.\n\nIn June 2020, a specious rumor started circulating on social media about how Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s great-grandfather was a slave owner who fought in the Confederate Army. There was no truth to this claim. This rumor was circulated in the form of a meme that included a photograph of a Confederate soldier named Richard Young Bennett (no relation to Biden), misidentified the former vice president\u2019s great grandfather as \u201cJoseph J. Biden\u201d (Biden\u2019s actual paternal great grandfather was George T. Biden), and baselessly claimed that this fictional person was a Confederate soldier and slave owner.\n\nWhile that rumor was, and still is, false, it did cause some social media users to dig through Biden\u2019s family history to see if there were any familial links to slavery. In August 2020, we received a tip that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather, a man by the name of Thomas Herbert Randle, was a slave owner.\n\nThe claim that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave is based on genealogy records from websites such as Ancestry.com and a slave schedule \u2014 a form used in the years 1850 and 1860 to enumerate the number of African American slaves on the U.S. Census.\n\nWe do not doubt that Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle, and we see no reason to be suspicious of the 1850 slave schedule listing a Thomas H. Randle who recorded owning a 14-year-old Black slave. However, the question remains if these two listings refer to the same individual.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to gather so far.\n\nAccording to genealogy sites such as Wikitree, Geni.com, geneanet.org, and wargs.com, a website that traces the ancestry of United States presidents and political figures, Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle.\n\nRandle was born in Baltimore County, Maryland, circa 1803, and would go on to marry a woman named Mary Ann Shoemaker. Randle, a farmer, had two children (at least), named William Thomas and Lydia Ann, the latter of whom married Joseph H. Biden.\n\nLydia and Joseph H. Biden had a child named George, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child that would become the vice president of the United States. In other words, Thomas Herbert Randle is former VP Biden\u2019s father\u2019s (Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr.) father\u2019s (Joseph H. Biden) father\u2019s (George T. Biden) father\u2019s (Joseph H. Biden) wife\u2019s (Lydia Ann Biden) father (Thomas Herbert Randle), making him Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather.\n\nAccording to the Maryland State Archives\u2019 \u201cLegacy of Slavery\u201d database, a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d from Baltimore County reported owning a 14-year-old Black male slave in the 1850 federal census:\n\nWe accessed this record via Ancestry.com, and can confirm that a Thomas H. Randle is truly listed on this 1850 slave schedule. Randle is not listed as a slave owner in 1860.\n\nThis document also provides no additional information about Randle other than his name, and no information about the 14-year-old slave other than their age and gender. The only additional information we could glean comes from the title of this document, which reads: \u201cSchedule 2 \u2013 Recorded slave inhabitants in 1st district in the county of Baltimore state of Maryland, enumerated by me, on the 16th day of August 1850.\u201d The document was signed by a \u201cSamuel Storm.\u201d\n\nIs Biden\u2019s Great-Great-Great Grandfather the Same Thomas Randle Listed on This 1850 Slave Schedule?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that these two Randles are indeed one and the same. For instance, both men share the same first and last name, as well as the middle initial. Census information for Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather also lists him as a farmer, an occupation that was known to use slavery for tasks such as tending crops, doing household chores, and gardening.\n\nIn the 1850 census, a Thos. H. Randle is listed as living in Baltimore\u2019s 1st district. This is the same year and district listed in the aforementioned slave schedule. The Thos. listed here appears to be Biden\u2019 great great great grandfather. In addition to having the same name (Thos. is an abbreviation for Thomas), this person was also born circa 1803 and is listed alongside a \u201cMary A\u201d (presumably Randle\u2019s wife) and a \u201cLydia\u201d (presumably Randle\u2019s daughter).\n\nIn other words, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather was named Thomas H. Randle, and in 1850, he lived in Baltimore\u2019s 1st district. This is the same name and the same district listed in the 1850 slave schedule of a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave.\n\nHere are the relevant documents: 1850 Slave Schedule / 1850 U.S. Census.\n\nWhile this evidence may seem convincing, we can\u2019t say with certainty that these two Randles were indeed one and the same.\n\nFor starters, we simply don\u2019t have any information about the Randle listed on the 1850 slave schedule (such as his age or family members) that would help us definitively connect him to Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. We also found a few examples of other Thomas Randles (or Randols, or Randalls, or Randells \u2014 misspelled names were common on the census) living in Maryland around this period. While these Randles were not listed for Baltimore County\u2019s 1st district in 1850, the fact that there were other Randle families living in this area opens up the possibility that the Randle on the slave schedule was a different person than Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that some of the census information contained errors, or that the census records we examined were not complete. For instance, a 1958 news article from The Baltimore Sun mentioned a \u201cJustice Thomas H. Randle,\u201d but we have been unable to connect this Randle to any census records.\n\nWhat About the 1860 Slave Schedule?\n\nThe U.S. Census enumerated African American slaves on \u201cslave schedules\u201d in both 1850 and 1860. While the 1850 slave schedule listed a \u201cThomas H. Randle,\u201d this name is not found in 1860. We did find a record for a \u201cThomas Randal\u201d and, as we noted earlier, spelling mistakes were common in the U.S. Census so it\u2019s possible that these two listings refer to the same individual.\n\nHowever, the location of these listings changes between 1850 and 1860. In 1850, the slave schedule noted that a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d owned a 14-year-old Black slave in the 1st district of Baltimore County. This is the same district that Thomas Herbert Randle, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather, lived in according to the 1850 U.S. Census. In 1860, however, the slave schedule notes that \u201cThomas Randall\u201d owned a 5-year-old Black female slave in the 8th district of Anne Arundel County. According to the U.S. Census, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather was not living in this location in 1860. On the census, Thomas Herbert Randle\u2019s location is listed as the 13th district of Baltimore County.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t definitively say that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, we can say with relative certainty that this person had servants. U.S. Census records from 1860 show that Thomas H. Randle had two \u201cservants\u201d named Peggy and Delia Malters, both Black women in their 40s. A 19-year-old Black \u201cfarm laborer\u201d named Richard Savoy was also listed under Randle\u2019s name. It should be noted that this document lists \u201cfree inhabitants\u201d in the 13th district in Baltimore County, Maryland:\n\nWe don\u2019t know the specific conditions about the relationships that these individuals had with Randle. While the people listed on this document were identified as \u201cfree inhabitants,\u201d and while they may not have legally been considered slaves, people considered servants in the 1860s did not have the same freedoms as regular laborers.\n\nPBS described the difference between an indentured servant and a slave as follows:\n\nRandle\u2019s daughter Lydia is not listed in the above-displayed image from the 1860 Census because by this time she had already married Joseph Biden (who spelled his name Byden). Lydia can be seen listed here alongside Joseph in the 1860 census.\n\n2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather Thomas Herbert Randle was a farmer who was born circa 1803 in Maryland. Randle, whose daughter Lydia would marry Biden\u2019s great-great grandfather, Joseph H. Biden, lived in Baltimore County\u2019s 1st District in 1850, according to U.S. Census Records. A slave schedule from this same year and district lists a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d as owning a 14-year-old Black slave.\n\nHowever, this slave schedule provides no additional information about the listed Randle (such as age or familial relations) that would allow us to definitively say that they are the same person, and we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d listed on the 1850 slave schedule is a different person than the \u201cThos. H. Randle\u201d listed on the 1850 U.S. Census.\n\nIt should also be noted that there wasn\u2019t a Thomas H. Randle listed on the slave schedule in 1860. There was a \u201cThomas Randal,\u201d but the location listed on this slave schedule does not match the location listed for Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather in the U.S. Census in 1860. This may indicate that the slave-owning Randle was indeed a different person than Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. Or, it could be entirely unrelated to the 1850 listing.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t say for sure if Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, he did list having two Black servants and a Black farm laborer on the 1860 U.S. Census. According to the census, however, these three individuals were considered \u201cfree inhabitants.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Biden\u2019s campaign for comment, but have yet to hear a response. We also reached out to Maryland state archivists, and we will update this article if more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
