U.S. Customs and Border Protection has used 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile, or CS, since 2010, and deployed it 26 times in fiscal 2012 and 27 times in 2013. The use dropped after that, but was still deployed three times in 2016, Mr. Obama\u2019s final full year in office.\n\nOn 27 November, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeated this talking point in responding to a question about the use of tear gas:\n\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, provided us with data that corroborated the figures presented in the Washington Times article and by Sanders.\n\nCBP measures the use of force by their agents in two ways: an \u201cincident\u201d describes a case in which an agent deploys force (whether a firearm or a \u201cless-lethal device\u201d such as tear spray or pepper spray), and a \u201csingular use of force\u201d takes into account the number of individuals affected by that incident. So, for example, if a Border Patrol agent used tear gas against a group of 10 people, that would count as one incident but 10 \u201csingular uses of force.\u201d\n\nCBP sent us the following breakdown of incidents involving tear gas and pepper spray by their agents since 2012. Since these numbers represent incidents, it should be noted that the number of individuals affected is greater than the number of incidents:\n\nThese figures show that from 2012 to 2016, the final five years of Obama\u2019s tenure as president, CBP agents used CS gas (tear spray) in 79 incidents, which is the equivalent of 15.8 incidents per year, or 1.3 per month.\n\nThese figures support the claim made in the Washington Times article, although it should be noted that figures are not available for the first few years of Obama\u2019s tenure, from 2009 to 2011.\n\nDuring the 2017 fiscal year (for most of which Donald Trump was President) and the 2018 fiscal year, 47 tear spray incidents took place, which works out as just shy of two per month. Although there are only two years\u2019 worth of data to go on, so far the use of tear gas by CBP agents has increased under the Trump administration.\n\nBy contrast, the use of pepper spray has declined in the first two years of Trump\u2019s tenure as president, from 87 incidents per year between 2012 and 2016 to 50 incidents per year in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAlso on 26 November, Fox News pointed to a specific incident in November 2013 in an article whose headline stated \u201cObama agents pepper-sprayed migrants: History challenges caravan response outrage\u201d:\n\nDemocrats are expressing outrage that U.S. border agents on Sunday shot rounds of tear gas at caravan migrants who threw rocks at law enforcement while trying to breach the U.S.-Mexico border. But critics hammering the Trump administration are glossing over a similar episode that occurred under then-President Barack Obama. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents reportedly used pepper spray to fend off a group of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the same San Ysidro port of entry. A San Diego Union-Tribune article at the time reported that agents fired \u201cpepper balls\u201d and used other \u201cintermediate use-of-force devices\u201d to repel the crowd. The migrants involved in that confrontation also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities.\n\nThe 2013 incident was also the focus of a widely shared 26 November article by the conservative Washington Examiner.\n\nThese reports are also accurate and describe a real incident from November 2013 which was not widely reported but was covered by the San Diego Union-Tribune:\n\nA group of about 100 people trying to illegally cross the border near the San Ysidro port of entry threw rocks and bottles at U.S. Border Patrol agents, who responded by using pepper spray and other means to force the crowd back into Mexico, federal officials said \u2026 The incident occurred about a quarter-mile west of the San Ysidro border crossing in the Tijuana River channel. No one was seriously injured, no shots were fired and no arrests were made, said Mary Beth Caston, a Border Patrol spokeswoman. The group first approached a lone agent stationed about 1/8 of a mile north of the border. They ignored his commands to stop, so he fired pepper balls to try to stop them and protect himself, Caston said. As the crowd kept advancing and throwing rocks and bottles, she said, more agents came to the scene and used other \u201cintermediate use-of-force devices\u201d to push back the group.\n\nThe Associated Press also reported on the 24 November 2013 incident:", "lang": "en"}
