Tina Smith, D-Minn., tweeted out her support for an end to differential pay for men and women.\n\nHer tweet said, \"It\u2019s completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay\"\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem: The statistics showing that women earn 80 percent of what men earn are overall comparisons and do not specifically compare men and women occupying the same jobs.\n\nAfter we reached out to Smith\u2019s office, she sent a new tweet to correct her earlier misstatement.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this commonly cited statistic.\n\nThe most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That\u2019s up by a couple percentage points in recent years.\n\nHowever, as we\u2019ve written previously, this figure actually refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, not comparing cases of apples to apples.\n\nThe 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they\u2019ve had.\n\nSo while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women\u2019s challenges in the workplace -- such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less -- the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work.\n\nOther studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs.\n\nFor instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college.\n\nThat\u2019s still a disparity, but it\u2019s only about one-third as big as the figure Smith cited in her tweet. (It\u2019s also worth noting that the apples-to-apples pay differential varies depending on the job.)\n\nSmith did have a point that women of color tend to fare more poorly on pay comparisons than do white women.\n\nA 2014 report from the National Women\u2019s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report.\n\nAsian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women, Pew Research has found. Still, Asian-American women lagged behind white males for annual earnings.\n\nA few hours after we contacted Smith\u2019s office, they informed us that Smith had sent a new tweet correcting her previous one. In the new tweet, she removed the reference to \"the same job\" and continued:\n\n\"When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part\u2014comparing particular job categories\u2014wasn\u2019t quite right. And I\u2019m glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification.\"\n\nIn Smith\u2019s initial tweet, she wrote, \"On average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job.\"\n\nThe official federal data shows that women earn 80 percent of what men earn, but that\u2019s a collective average for all jobs, not a comparison of men and women holding identical jobs. For men and women holding the same job, there\u2019s still a gap, but it\u2019s substantially smaller.\n\nOur policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So Smith\u2019s initial remark rates Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
