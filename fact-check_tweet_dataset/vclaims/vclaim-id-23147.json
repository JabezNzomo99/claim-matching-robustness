The video is being shared with a false narrative in light of the recent reported lynching of Tabrez Ansari, a 24-year-old man, in Jharkhand.\n\nViewed more than 71,000 times at the time of writing this article, the video has been captioned as, 'Is this not lynching? The dying is a Hindu and the killers are Muslims. That is why it isn't a case of lynching for analysts.'

A post, shared six months ago, falsely claimed that the incident was from West Bengal. It has been captioned as, \u2018Bengal: A Muslim mob quashes a Hindu with a stone\u2019\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the video key frames and found the video is originally from Bangladesh. We were directed to the same video on YouTube, which has been captioned as 'Chairman Monir's murder accused hacked to death.'\n\nThe video was uploaded on April, 2017.\n\nBOOM found corroborating news reports from mainstream Bangladeshi news portals, which reported the incident.\n\nAbu Sayyed (28), an accused in the murder of Monir Hossain, chairman, Union Parishad, was hacked to death by unidentified in Daudkandi Upazila, while another accused Mohammed Ali (35) was seriously injured.\n\nMonir Hossain, an Awami League leader, was shot dead by assailants in Comilla, in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
