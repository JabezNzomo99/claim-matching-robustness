No, that's not true: the tweet was sent by a parody account but was widely mistaken for a real tweet by people who don't understand Dutch. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe tweet was published by Twitter account @WillemAlexander on June 19, 2018 using the name\"ZM Willem-Alexander\u2654\" (archived here) which read:\n\nIt came in reply to this tweet by President Trump:\n\nBut the bio of the Willem-Alexander twitter account that sent the tweet indictates it is a parody:\n\nTranslation: \"Working father, husband, son and brother. Tweets under many headings including in a parodic and politically incorrect way. No ministerial responsability.\" (our highlight).\n\nThe account also didn't come with a verification check from Twitter.\n\nThe real king Willem-Alexander has no twitter account.", "lang": "en"}
