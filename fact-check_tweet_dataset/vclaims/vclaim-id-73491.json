Eighteen people, including the pilot Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe died in the accident. Soon after that, a video gone viral with a note saying \u201cBeautiful song by Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe who died yesterday in the plane crash, sparing his own life and tried his best to save as much life as possible. Hearty Condolence\u201d. However, Vishvas News in its investigation found that the viral video is fake.\n\nSoon after the death of Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe in the Kozhikode Airport plane crash a video gone viral with a note saying \u201cBeautiful song by Capt. Deepak Vasant Sathe who died yesterday in the plane crash, sparing his own life and tried his best to save as much life as possible. Hearty Condolence\u201d. One such post is by Facebook user Rekha Shivhare Ahluwalia.\n\nYou can see the post here.\n\nThe viral video claims that this song \u2018Ghar Se Nikalte Hi\u2019 from the Hindi film \u2018Papa Kahte Hain\u2019 was sung by Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe in a live show. Vishvas News in its investigation used the InVID knowledge verification platform to segregate the video in images. Then we used the Google Reverse Image search to find out the original video. This effort took us to Vice Admiral Girish Luthra of Indian Navy singing this song at Golden Jubilee celebrations. The YouTube link is here.\n\nThe Citizen 4 Forces, an NGO run by a group of extremely patriotic Indians, working towards the rights of soldiers, educating civilians about military history and operations. also have put in this video in which it is mentioned that \u201cVice Admiral Girish Luthra (Retd), Former CIC Western Command. Singing \u2018Ghar Se Nikalte Hi\u2019 at the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Western Naval Command of Indian Navy. Waooo it is. Astounding Admiral Sir\u201d.\n\nWe also found a news item appeared on Navbharat Times dated March 15, 2019 which reported on the retired navy chief Girish Luthra singing \u2018Ghar Se Nikalte Hi Kuch Door Chalte Hi\u2019 for his troops on the Golden Jubilee celebrations.\n\nIndian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said the information regarding the video is incorrect. The officer in the video is from the Indian Navy, Vice Admiral Girish Luthra (Retd), while Capt Sathe retired from the Indian Air Force. Moreover, the naval officer in the video is retired at the rank of vice admiral, whereas Sathe retired as a Wing Commander.\n\nConclusion: The viral video of the song \u2018Ghar Se Nikalte Hi\u2019 from the Hindi film \u2018Papa Kahte Hain\u2019 was sung by the retired navy chief Girish Luthra and not by Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe.", "lang": "en"}
