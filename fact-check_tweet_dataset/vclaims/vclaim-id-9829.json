Of course not, that story is fake and was made up by a website that loves to troll conservatives and Republicans with a less than average grasp on reality.\n\nThe story was published on the Potatriot Post on March 29, 2018 under the headline \"Stormy Daniels Pregnant With Bill Clinton's Baby\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe name \"Art Tubbols\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the online nickname of a man running several satirical fake news websites. The pregnancy hoax followed an earlier fake story about the Daniels/Clinton affair from the same network of sites:\n\nFake News: Stormy Daniels Did NOT Have An Affair With Bill Clinton | Lead Stories Did Stormy Daniels have an affair with former President Bill Clinton and does the Washington Sun-Tribune have proof of this? That can't be true because there is no newspaper by that name and the entire thing was made up by a satircal site set up to troll Republicans and conservatives.\n\nWe wrote about potatriotpost.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump Did NOT Reveal Plan To Fix DACA, Liberals NOT Losing Their Minds\n\u2022 Fake News: SCOTUS Did NOT Shoot Down Obama's $30 Million Taxpayer-Funded Funeral And Monument Plans\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Busload Of Blacks' From 3 States Did NOT Drive To Alabama To Vote Illegally\n\nThe site Potatriot Post comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
