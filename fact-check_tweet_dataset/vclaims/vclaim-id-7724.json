And was his fellow rapper Chief Keef arrested by the LAPD for firing the fatal shot? No, that's not true: the Buzzfeed reports that started the rumor were contributed via Buzzfeed's community feature that lets anyone write whatever they want, it isn't true.\n\nThe shooting story originated from an article published by Buzzfeed user \"jakesblog\" on June 3, 2018 titled \"Upcoming Rapper 6ix9ine In Critical Condition After Being Shot\" (archived here) which read:\n\nA t approximately 7 A.M. Pacific Standard Time, prominent rapper 6ix9ine was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting. Authorities have reported that he is alive, but in critical conditon. Recently 6ix9ine has been engaging in arguments via instagram with fellow rapper Chief Keef (who was recently shot at as well). Details are scarce at the moment but Buzzfeed will continue to follow the story as new updates are made.\n\nA short while later jakesblog made a second post, which was titled \"Rapper Chief Keef In Custody After Shooting That Left Rapper 6ix9ine Dead\" and which read:\n\nHowever, both posts carried Buzzfeed's community disclaimer, which read:\n\nBoth posts were made at least half a day ago, yet less than an hour ago 6ix9ine was still posting to his official Instagram account:\n\nRapper 6ix9ine (also known as Tekashi69, real name Daniel Hernandez) had been feuding with Keef earlier but denied being behind a shooting that targeted him recently:\n\nTekashi69 Says His Crew Did Not Fire a Shot at Chief Keef Tekashi69 We Didn't Shoot at Keef We're All About Rainbows and Peace Tekashi69 denies his crew took a shot at Chief Keef ... in fact, he says his MO is the opposite of violence. We got Keef at the Montage hotel in Bev Hills Saturday, hours after someone took a shot at Keef in NYC's Times Square.\n\nThe fact that the hoax articles were posted to the Buzzfeed domain name made at least one hip-hop news website believe the news was confirmed:\n\nRapper 6ix9ine In Critical Condition After Being Shot - 24/7 Hip-Hop News - FOR THE CULTURE According to Buzzfeed At approximately 7 A.M.
