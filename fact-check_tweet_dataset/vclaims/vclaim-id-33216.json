The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about.\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims.\n\nThe $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination.\n\nThe Senate approved its bill first on Feb. 12, 2013, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThere were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity.\n\nHouse Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The American Bar Association opposed the GOP version, saying \"the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements.\"\n\nDomestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governors\u2019 offices that they couldn\u2019t use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didn\u2019t explicitly say they were covered.\n\n\"You show up bleeding at the door and we\u2019re going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first,\" said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \"We didn\u2019t want programs to lose their funding because they didn\u2019t do triage on that basis.\"\n\nThe House Republican version failed by a vote of 166 to 257. The nay votes included 60 Republicans.\n\nBlackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure.\n\nThe Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed 286 to 138. The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no.\n\nWe reached out to Blackburn\u2019s office for comment and did not hear back.\n\nSwift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law.\n\nShe did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
