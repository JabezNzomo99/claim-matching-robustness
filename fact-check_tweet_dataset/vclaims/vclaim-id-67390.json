Patty Murray, D-Wash., became law in December 2013.\n\nTo help the deficit, pensions for those who retire from the military before age 62 won\u2019t be as large. Those younger retirees will receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to their pensions that are 1 percent lower than the rate of inflation (full COLAs will continue to be given to military retirees who are over 62).\n\nIn defending the move, Ryan made a claim about military pensions that we want to check.\n\n\"Civilian public employees have a 401(k) with the match, a defined-benefit pension and health care. They don't have (pension) COLAs at all if they retire before the age of 62. And they do contribute some to their pensions, and now we're having (newly hired employees) contribute more,\" the Janesville Republican told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board Dec. 19, 2013.\n\n\"The military doesn't contribute toward their pension. They don't have a paycheck \u2013 payroll deduction -- toward their pensions. And they do have a COLA before they're 62.\"\n\nWith more public employees -- notably state and local government workers -- contributing more toward the cost of their benefits, we wondered if Ryan was right.\n\nDo members of the military contribute nothing toward their pensions?\n\nMilitary pensions have expanded in scope since the was passed in 1776, in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. At that time, pensions were strictly for those in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a livelihood.\"\n\nOver the next several decades, pensions were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans and later they became , regardless of need.\n\nIn 1948, was established as the minimum requirement for voluntary retirement for the Army and Air Force, putting those services on par with the Navy. Since 1986, military pensions have been with annual cost-of-living adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index.\n\nThe now provides some per year in pension payments to more than military retirees and their survivors.\n\nAt the , members of the military are guaranteed a specific monthly pension payment after 20 or more years of service. However, it is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition: Those who serve at least 20 years are fully vested, but those who leave the military earlier usually receive no retirement benefits. Only of those who serve in the military end up getting a retirement benefit, to the Defense Business Board and the House Budget Committee.\n\nBut, as Ryan indicated in his comments, military retirees begin receiving their monthly pension payments immediately, regardless of age. So, many begin drawing military pensions in their early to mid-40s, often while working in another career. Other public-sector employees, and those in the private sector, typically do not begin receiving an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65.\n\nSo, what about contributions toward pensions? In other words, where does the money for the military retirement checks come from?\n\nA Congressional Budget Office and a Department of Defense cited by Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert say members of the military make no contribution toward their pensions.\n\nSo does a we found from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And, , a public employee retirement expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us the same.\n\nThat contrasts with all other federal employees (including civilian employees in the military). They contribute a portion of their pay toward pensions; the rates mainly depend on when they were hired.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of pension contributions, according to data we collected from the Congressional Research Service, the federal Office of Personnel Management and the , which advocates for pay and benefits for federal employees.\n\n*Generally do not pay into or receive Social Security; employees hired after 1984 pay 6.2% toward Social Security.\n\n**An aggregate figure. For most federal employees, the government contributes 12.7%; the employer and employee percentages are higher for law enforcement officers and certain other types of federal employees.\n\nRyan said members of the military don\u2019t \"contribute toward their pension.\"\n\nCivilian federal employees contribute a portion of their pay toward their pensions, but members of the military don\u2019t.", "lang": "en"}
