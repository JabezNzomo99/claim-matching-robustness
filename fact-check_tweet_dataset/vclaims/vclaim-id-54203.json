There are no official warnings regarding this apparent threat from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team or CERT-In. The CERT-In under the Information Technology Ministry is tasked with protecting Indians from cyber threats. Below is a screenshot of the website of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. One can clearly see the latest memorandums issued by the ministry. None of those matches the viral forward.\n\nPhishing is one of the oldest forms of cyberattack that uses disguised email as a weapon. The goal is to hoodwink the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need. It could be a request from their bank or a note from someone in their company What Are The Steps You Can Take For Protection? According to cybersecurity agency, people must not open attachments in unsolicited emails, even if they come from known contacts. One must not click on URLs in an unsolicited email, even if the link seems benign. Any unusual activity or attack should be reported immediately at incident@cert-in.org.in with logs and email headers for analysis of the attacks and for taking action. Further, the message, which has been circulating since the last couple of years is rife with grammatical errors that one would not find in an official communique. The warning also does not include relevant details such as which websites or mobile apps are affected, or how the attack works from a technical perspective. The message attributes the warning to 'Shanghai China International News'. However, no such media outlet was found. A Malaysia based news portal, The Star, reported on the same hoax message 2 years ago and called it fake. However, malware or phishing URLs can be attached to an image in a concealed manner, but such URLs may not necessarily just be restricted to good morning and good night messages. The process of sharing malware in the form of image video or other digital sources is called 'digital steganography'. Most conventional malware detecting tools overlook such malware. Through the method of Digital steganography, file, message, image or video can be concealed within another file, message, image or video.
