Imelda Marcos posted a P150,000-bail for her temporary liberty a week after the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan found her guilty on seven counts of graft, for creating and maintaining seven Siss foundations \"for the private benefit\" of their family during the term of her late husband.\n\nThe Marcoses allegedly earned about $200 million from these foundations, according to Assistant Special Prosecutor Ryan Quilala.\n\nMarcos currently faces a prison sentence of six years and one month up to 11 years for each count of graft.\n\nThe netizen's fake post has been shared by over 5,200 people, and has received over 700 reactions and more than 100 comments.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
