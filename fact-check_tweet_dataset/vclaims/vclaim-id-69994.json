The tests are rigged. The death count is false. Masks are useless. Hand sanitizer is toxic. Vaccines are poison. The government and media are lying.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve already looked into several claims in the post.\n\nCOVID-19 tests aren\u2019t rigged. A common cold won\u2019t cause a false positive, the tests are not scientifically meaningless (though there\u2019s new thinking about the most effective testing methods), and we\u2019ve found no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating test results.\n\nThe death count isn\u2019t false. It\u2019s at about 187,000 in the United States and rising. If anything, doctors say that there\u2019s an undercount of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.\n\nMasks aren\u2019t useless. A growing body of evidence shows that wearing one can reduce transmission of COVID-19.\n\nHealth officials recommend using hand sanitizer to kill the coronavirus.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve debunked plenty of false claims about coronavirus vaccines in development, including that the vaccine has killed Ukranirans and kids.\n\nSo what about the allegation that the COVID-19 isn\u2019t killing people \u2014 and that their weak immune systems are?\n\nAnyone \u2014 not just people who are immunocompromised \u2014 can catch COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSome people are more likely than others to become severely ill: older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. The CDC also urges people with weakened immune systems to protect themselves from the disease.\n\n\"Many conditions and treatments can weaken a person\u2019s immune system (making them \u2018immunocompromised\u2019),\" the CDC says, listing examples such as cancer, bone marrow transplant and HIV.\n\nThe CDC found that of the people who died from COVID-19, 6% had only the coronavirus, while the rest had other conditions as well. But that doesn\u2019t mean that only 6% of people actually died from COVID-19, as the president recently claimed.\n\nComorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recent interview with \"Good Morning America\" that it \"does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn\u2019t die of COVID-19 \u2014 they did.\"\n\nDr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the public health department in Chicago, explained during a news conference that coronavirus can exacerbate or cause health problems. \"If, unfortunately, this person dies while they\u2019re in the hospital, the doctor has to fill out the death certificate and you list things that this person had as well as what is the ultimate cause of death,\" she said.\n\nLike Fauci, she said that these people are dying from COVID-19 \u2014 not their other conditions.\n\nAnd young, healthy people do die from COVID-19, even if they represent a minority of the disease\u2019s victims, according to the Proto, a publication from Massachusetts General Hospital.", "lang": "en"}
