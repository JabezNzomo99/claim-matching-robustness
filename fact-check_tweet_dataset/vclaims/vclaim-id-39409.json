But we found several ads that ran afoul of the facts.\n\u2022 An ad in Iowa misleadingly says that \u201c50 percent\u201d of the nonelderly in the 3rd District \u201chave preexisting conditions,\u201d yet Rep. David Young \u201cvoted to deny protections for their health care coverage.\u201d His vote for the American Health Care Act would have lessened such protections for those on the individual market, where 6 percent of all Iowans get their coverage.\n\u2022 Two other DCCC ads say Republican candidates in Colorado and Pennsylvania cast votes against those with preexisting conditions, even though the lawmakers ultimately joined Democrats to vote against the AHCA.\n\u2022 In Pennsylvania, the DCCC claims that Rep. Mike Kelly\u2019s \u201cnet worth increased by millions\u201d while in Congress. But the source DCCC cites show that Kelly\u2019s net worth has gone down since he took office.\n\u2022 In Minnesota, an ad against Pete Stauber claims he\u2019s in an \u201cemail scandal,\u201d saying he \u201cwas caught using county tax dollars to help his congressional campaign.\u201d Stauber, a county commissioner, swapped 15 emails with the National Republican Congressional Committee that the county said didn\u2019t warrant any further action.\n\u2022 In Virginia\u2019s 10th District, the DCCC uses a familiar talking point to misleadingly claim Rep. Barbara Comstock voted for \u201cthe Trump tax plan that gives almost all the benefit to the richest 1 percent, while middle class families pay higher taxes.\u201d That\u2019s only the case after 2025, when most of the individual income tax changes are set to expire.\n\nThe DCCC, an official party committee, is the second biggest spender behind the Congressional Leadership Fund, which calls itself \u201cthe super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership.\u201d As of Oct. 19, CLF has spent more than $93 million, while the DCCC has spent nearly $66 million, on so-called \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Independent expenditures are TV ads and other forms of political communications that advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate.\n\nEarlier this week, we looked at some of the TV ads being run by CFL. Here we look at a sampling of DCCC ads that have aired this month.\n\nThe DCCC uses a misleading talking point in an ad in Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, saying that \u201c50 percent\u201d of \u201cIowans under 65 in David Young\u2019s district have preexisting conditions. But Young voted to deny protections for their health care coverage.\u201d\n\nYoung\u2019s vote was in 2017 for the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act, which would have lessened the protections under the Affordable Care Act for those with preexisting conditions \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t have eliminated all of them. And, more important, the changes would have applied to the individual market, where 7 percent of the U.S. population (and 6 percent of Iowans statewide) buys insurance.\n\nThe 50 percent figure comes from the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, which applied Census Bureau population data to an Obama-era Department of Health and Human Services report. That report estimated how many Americans could be denied coverage, charged more or faced coverage exclusions if they were seeking coverage on the individual market before the ACA\u2019s protections went into effect in 2014, because of their preexisting conditions. Those conditions ranged from high cholesterol and arthritis to cancer and heart disease.\n\nAs the CAP analysis notes, those not seeking insurance on the individual market \u2014 including those with employer-sponsored insurance, which is where about half of Americans get their coverage \u2014 wouldn\u2019t lose their insurance because of any preexisting conditions.\n\nThe American Health Care Act, as we\u2019ve explained before, would have prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage based on health status, like the ACA. However, unlike the ACA, it would have allowed insurance companies on the individual market to price premiums based on health status in some cases. Under the plan, which passed the House but not the Senate, a state could apply for a waiver to allow medical-based pricing for people who do not maintain continuous coverage, defined as a lapse of 63 days or more over the previous 12 months.\n\nThose policyholders could be charged higher premiums on the individual market for their preexisting conditions for one year. After that, as long as there wasn\u2019t another 63-day gap, the policyholder would get a new premium not based on health status.\n\nStates with those waivers would have to set up high-risk pools or risk-sharing programs, designed to assist those with high medical costs.\n\nThe GOP plan also wouldn\u2019t have allowed insurers to exclude coverage of someone\u2019s particular medical conditions. However, states also could get a waiver to set their own requirements on what essential benefits insurers had to include in their plans. Under the ACA, insurers must cover a list of 10 benefits.\n\nSo, Young did vote for a plan that would have lessened preexisting condition protections for those on the individual market \u2014 but the estimated 50 percent of people in his district with some kind of medical condition would have to be seeking insurance on that market before they potentially could have been charged higher premiums under that plan.\n\nThey Voted Against the GOP Plan\n\nTwo other DCCC ads say the Republican candidates cast votes against those with preexisting conditions, even though the lawmakers ultimately voted against the AHCA \u2014 and in doing so, cited their concerns that the Republican-sponsored bill didn\u2019t do enough on patient protections.\n\nIn Colorado\u2019s 6th District, the DCCC has aired an ad that says Rep. Mike Coffman \u201cvoted to end protections for preexisting conditions,\u201d and on-screen it says \u201c13 times.\u201d A DCCC press release links to four of those votes \u2014 to repeal the ACA, or state that it should be repealed \u2014 that were cast in 2011, 2012 and 2015. As we said, the ACA includes several provisions to protect those with preexisting conditions, and with these votes, Republicans didn\u2019t offer a substitute for the health care law.\n\nSo, it\u2019s true that the votes would have ended those protections. Then again, lawmakers knew the repeal measures were symbolic votes, taken while Barack Obama was still president and had veto power.\n\nBut Coffman\u2019s repeal votes don\u2019t tell the whole story. When it came time for the House to actually pass a repeal-and-replace bill, Coffman voted against the American Health Care Act. In all, 20 Republicans voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nHe also cited his concerns about provisions regarding preexisting conditions in doing so. In a press release on the day of the vote, Coffman cited Rep. Tom MacArthur\u2019s amendment \u2014 which added the provision about state waivers to charge some policyholders more on the individual market.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I cannot support the AHCA with the MacArthur amendment because I\u2019m concerned that a small percentage of those with preexisting conditions may still not be protected,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cThis does not take away from the fact that the Affordable Care Act is failing and American families are hurting. In my conversations with House leadership and the Administration over the last 72 hours, I made it clear that additional language was necessary to protect this vulnerable group.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a DCCC ad against Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania\u2019s 1st District cites three procedural votes in claiming the Republican lawmaker \u201cvoted against protecting people with preexisting conditions.\u201d (Coffman sided with Republicans, too, on those votes.)\n\nBut Fitzpatrick, like Coffman, voted against the GOP health care bill.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed the three votes in question in depth, finding they were \u201cminor procedural votes,\u201d not votes to actually pass legislation. \u201cAll of these votes have to do with parliamentary actions \u2014 a vote on the previous question (in plain language, ending debate) and a motion to send a bill back to committee,\u201d the Fact Checker wrote.\n\nTwo of the votes \u2014 on May 3 and 4, 2017 \u2014 were Democratic efforts to change House rules to block health care legislation that would end preexisting condition protections. And the other vote would have sent a bill back to committee with instructions to add language regarding such protections.\n\nBut the Republican votes wouldn\u2019t have ended the ACA\u2019s protections.\n\nIn ultimately voting against the GOP health care plan \u2014 a measure that would have ended some of those protections \u2014 Fitzpatrick said in a statement that \u201cany changes to our current system must ensure both the continuity of coverage and the continuity of patient protection provisions.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania\u2019s 16th Congressional District, the DCCC attacks Rep. Mike Kelly for his vote on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in December.\n\nThe ad says, \u201c2010. Car Dealer Mike Kelly is elected to Congress. And while there, his net worth increased by millions. So, it\u2019s no surprise he helped give special tax breaks to car dealers \u2014 like himself.\u201d\n\nThe first claim \u2014 about Kelly\u2019s net worth increasing while in Congress \u2014 is unsubstantiated. The second \u2014 about \u201ctax breaks\u201d \u2014 lacks context.\n\nThe DCCC\u2019s research report on Kelly says, \u201cWhen Kelly ran for office, his net worth was an estimated $8.05 million. In 2015, after four years in Congress, Kelly\u2019s net worth grew to an estimated $18.61 million \u2013 a $10.56 million increase.\u201d That\u2019s false.\n\nThe DCCC cites the Center for Responsive Politics as its source. But that group\u2019s website \u2013 opensecrets.org \u2013 says Kelly\u2019s average net worth was $34.6 million in 2010 when he ran for office, and it dropped to $19.3 million in 2011, his first year in Congress. Kelly took office on Jan. 3, 2011.\n\nAs of 2015, the most recent year available, Kelly had an average net worth of $18.6 million. So his net worth is still below the level it was at when he ran for office in 2010, despite the ad\u2019s claim.\n\nAmanda Sherman, a DCCC spokeswoman, made the point that Kelly filed a financial disclosure report in 2010, while a candidate for office, that showed he was worth $8.05 million in 2009. But when the reports were filed is irrelevant. The fact is Kelly\u2019s average net worth increased before he took office, not while in office, as the ad erroneously claims.\n\nAs for the ad\u2019s reference to \u201ctax breaks\u201d for car dealers, the DCCC is referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 a $1.5 trillion law that overhauled the nation\u2019s tax code. It cut corporate tax rates, changed the individual income tax brackets and reduced estate taxes, among other things.\n\nWhile the narrator says that Kelly \u201chelped give special tax breaks to car dealers like himself,\u201d the ad displays a Wall Street Journal headline that says, \u201cCar Dealers Win Carveout in Latest GOP Tax Proposal.\u201d The Journal story was about a provision added on Nov. 9, 2017, that addressed the treatment of interest on \u201cfloor plan financing indebtedness,\u201d which the global consulting firm KPMG explains is interest paid on loans that are \u201cused to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease.\u201d That includes cars, boats, farm machinery or other vehicles purchased by dealers for lease or sale.\n\nCar dealerships, for example, borrow money in order to maintain a stock of new and used cars on their lots. Under the old tax law, the interest on those loans was fully deductible. The House bill maintained 100 percent deductibility of interest.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, added the provision, according to the Wall Street Journal article cited by the DCCC. The story mentions that Kelly is one of three House members who \u201chave been in the auto-dealing business.\u201d He owns Mike Kelly Automotive Group in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nKelly is a member of the committee and voted for Brady\u2019s amendment, but the DCCC offered no evidence that Kelly was involved in the drafting of the provision that affects his business.\n\nDespite the House vote in November, the Senate version of the tax bill \u201cwould have reduced the current 100 percent deduction of floor plan interest to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income,\u201d according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. However, Sen. Rand Paul sponsored an amendment to preserve full deductibility of floor plan interest, which was included in the bill approved by the Senate on Dec. 2, 2017, according to the NADA.\n\nKelly voted for the final bill, which passed the House largely along party lines, 227 to 203, on Dec. 19, 2017. Trump signed it on Dec. 22, 2017.\n\nJohn S. Treu, an assistant professor of accounting at West Virginia University, said it \u201cwould be appropriate\u201d to characterize the treatment of floor plan financing as a \u201ccarveout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TCJA introduced a general limitation on interest deductibility based on adjusted taxable income and so maintaining the status quo for certain types of debt would also be a special carve out,\u201d Treu told us in an email. \u201cSo I guess it would be appropriate to characterize it as a carve-out that maintained the status quo because the deduction for other types of interest income was being limited.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t say what role, if any, Kelly had in the House provision, but we know that the carveout would not have become law without the help of Paul in the Senate. We also can say for sure that the passage of a bill in December 2017 had no impact on Kelly\u2019s net worth while in Congress from 2011 to 2015, contrary to the DCCC\u2019s implication.\n\nKelly faces Democrat Ron DiNicola in the Nov. 6 election. According to the Erie Times-News, this is the DCCC\u2019s first ad in the race since DiNicola was added to the committee\u2019s Red to Blue campaign to flip control of the House from Republican to Democratic.\n\nA DCCC ad in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District misleadingly says Rep. Barbara Comstock voted for \u201cthe Trump tax plan that gives almost all the benefits to the richest 1 percent, while middle-class families pay higher taxes.\u201d Actually, most middle-income families will see a tax cut in the first years of the plan. When and if many of the individual income tax changes expire after 2025, those middle-income tax cuts disappear.\n\nThe ad portrays Comstock as a rubber stamp for Trump\u2019s agenda, saying she has voted with Trump \u201c97.8 percent of the time.\u201d That\u2019s true, according to a FiveThirtyEight.com analysis last updated on Oct. 10. It\u2019s also true, as the ad says, that that is the highest among Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation (though tied with Republican Rep. Scott Taylor).\n\nBut the ad cherry-picks to make the point that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 which Comstock supported \u2014 \u201cgives almost all the benefits to the richest 1 percent, while middle-class families pay higher taxes.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, taxes will decline on average across all income groups in 2018. While \u201cmiddle-class families\u201d is a subjective classification, TPC noted that in 2018 \u201ctaxpayers in the middle income quintile (those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000) would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.6 percent of after-tax income.\u201d Upper-income taxpayers, especially those in the top 1 percent, would benefit even more as a share of after-tax income.\n\nThose middle-income taxpayers would continue to see tax cuts through 2025, TPC said, on average about $900 that year, or 1.3 percent of after-tax income. However, because most of the individual income tax provisions are scheduled to sunset after 2025, TPC found that by 2027, \u201ctaxpayers in the middle income quintile would see no material change on average.\u201d Those in the bottom two quintiles, after seeing a small tax cut through 2025 \u201cwould face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of after-tax income.\u201d Some of those could be considered \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\n\nRepublicans added sunset provisions to most of the individual tax cut provisions so that the bill could pass through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate. In order to do that, Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Nor could they have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window. However, Republicans say they expect a future Congress will extend those cuts.\n\nAn image in the ad says \u201c83 percent of benefits to the richest 1 percent.\u201d This is a frequent Democratic criticism of the tax plan, but, as we have written, it cherry-picks to a time after most of the individual income tax changes have expired (and assumes they are not extended). So it\u2019s true that an estimated 83 percent of the tax benefits are projected to go to the top 1 percent in 2027, but in 2025 \u2014 the last year before those tax changes expire \u2014 a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent.\n\nThe ad cites a Washington Post blog that says \u201csome\u201d middle-class taxpayers would see a tax increase and that the lion\u2019s share of the tax benefits would accrue to upper-income Americans. Still, until the individual tax changes expire, most in the middle-income range will get a tax cut.\n\nA DCCC ad in Minnesota\u2019s 8th Congressional District talks about an \u201cemail scandal\u201d involving Republican candidate Pete Stauber, a St. Louis County commissioner, saying he \u201cwas caught using county tax dollars to help his congressional campaign.\u201d The ad says voters ought to send a message that \u201cwe\u2019ve got enough corrupt politicians in Washington.\u201d But there\u2019s less to this \u201cscandal\u201d than the ad suggests.\n\nStauber is accused of swapping 15 emails with people from the National Republican Congressional Committee. That appears to run afoul of St. Louis County policy, which states, \u201cSt. Louis County elected officials will not use St. Louis County funds, equipment, supplies, employees, or facilities in support of their own campaigns for reelection, other candidates for public office, or political organizations.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s the backdrop for the DCCC ad, which states, \u201cEmails scandals. This time it\u2019s Pete Stauber in the hot seat. He was caught using county tax dollars to help his congressional campaign. Now he\u2019s refusing to answer questions and won\u2019t release his emails. Send Pete Stauber a message, we\u2019ve got enough corrupt politicians in Washington.\u201d\n\nIn response to inquiries from the Star Tribune, St. Louis County confirmed there were 15 emails between Stauber\u2019s county email address and the NRCC, which is backing Stauber as one of its \u201cYoung Guns\u201d in a seat critical to Republicans holding onto control of the House. Stauber faces Democrat Joe Radinovich and independence party candidate Ray Sandman in the general election.\n\nIt\u2019s true, as the ad says, that Stauber has refused to release those emails, and the county won\u2019t either. The county administrator and assistant county attorney both say the emails are, according to state statute, private data and cannot be released without the consent of one of the emailing parties. (The Minnesota Department of Administration disagrees, and asked the county to make the emails reviewable. We take no position on that.)\n\nBut the county says it looked at the emails and determined no further action was required.\n\n\u201cWe proactively reviewed the emails through the lens of our Code of Conduct for Elected Officials Policy and were satisfied that no investigation or further review was warranted,\u201d said St. Louis County spokeswoman Dana Kazel, according to the Duluth News Tribune. The county commission is a nonpartisan board, meaning commissioners don\u2019t run on any party ticket.\n\nThe ad cites a WDIO-TV news report on the story, which does state that Stauber is \u201cin the hot seat\u201d over the emails. In that report, Cynthia Rugeley, associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, says, \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question on why you did it, and why you did it 15 times.\u201d But, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a serious violation by any stretch. \u2026 I would think 9 times out of 10 a county would make the same decision [not to take any further action].\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Rugeley as well and she again noted, \u201cThere were 15 emails. He did use county email for the communication.\u201d As for the ad\u2019s claim that Stauber \u201cwas caught using county tax dollars to help his congressional campaign,\u201d that\u2019s a stretch.\n\n\u201cI guess you could make the argument about time he spent on a government computer,\u201d Rugeley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he read it and elected officials do not have 8-5 business hours, making that a dubious claim. So, I don\u2019t think the money argument works.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t either. It appears Stauber may have violated county policy with emails to the NRCC, but saying he \u201cwas caught using county tax dollars to help his congressional campaign\u201d and implying that the email flap makes Stauber another \u201ccorrupt politician\u201d goes too far.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 22: The ad also makes a reference, via one of the articles cited in the ad, to an ethics complaint filed against Stauber regarding an opioid crisis roundtable he hosted in August attended by U.S. Rep. Greg Walden and other county commissioners. The complaint alleges the event was a misuse of his position as a county commissioner to promote his campaign. The event was publicized by the county, and the county\u2019s communications manager tweeted about it. Stauber later released a statement saying the event was organized by his campaign, and \u201cI should have made a clear distinction for the county when it promoted the worthwhile event. I regret the confusion.\u201d Although the ad focuses on an \u201cemail scandal,\u201d the Radinovich campaign told us after we posted our article that the opioid roundtable was \u201can illegal misuse of official staff time.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
