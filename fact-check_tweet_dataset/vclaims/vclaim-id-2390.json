In 1998, under President Bill Clinton, Russia was accepted into the G7, transforming this informal bloc of the wealthiest democracies into the G8. The U.S. Department of the Treasury then coordinated with the economic and financial ministries of other member countries to integrate Russia, which at that time had a small economy and large foreign debt, into the global economic system.\n\nThe next U.S. administration began on similarly friendly terms with Russia, with President George W. Bush viewing his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, more favorably than he viewed many other world leaders.\n\n\u200bThat lasted until Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in August 2008.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration began with the announcement of a \u201creset\u201d with Russia -- an ambitious, 180-degree turn in relations between the two nations, potentially ending any remnants of the Cold War. In 2009, a Bilateral Presidential Commission was jointly founded by the United States and Russia to promote cooperation between the two countries.\n\nStill, under Putin\u2019s leadership, Russia was coming under increasing international criticism for its actions against Georgia and dismal human rights record. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s state-controlled media openly promoted anti-Americanism, as well as displays of overt racism against President Obama.\n\nU.S. diplomats suffered constant harassment, while U.S. organizations, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, were expelled from Russia.\n\nIn 2012, the United States adopted the Magnitsky Act, the first package of sanctions against Russian government officials, industries, companies and individuals directly involved in mass corruption and violations of human rights.\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and masterminded a devastating armed conflict in the country\u2019s eastern region.\n\nIn response, G7 leaders announced in a joint statement that they were suspending Russia\u2019s membership in the G8. For its part, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) stripped Russia of its voting rights in April 2014.\n\nThe U.S. also suspended the Bilateral Presidential Commission and expanded economic and travel sanctions. More than 30 other countries imposed sanctions against Russia.\n\nApart from its ongoing involvement in the conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine, in 2015, Russia launched a military operation in Syria to support the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn September 2016, the United Nations and international human rights groups accused Moscow of war crimes in Syria. The following month, Russia lost its seat on the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nThe U.S. imposed its latest package of restrictive measures against Russia in response to Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its role in helping North Korea develop nuclear weapons.\n\nWorld leaders have presented Russia with the terms and conditions for lifting the restrictions and returning to normal cooperation. Russia however, has not complied with them.", "lang": "en"}
