The claim originated on a parody news website.\n\nThe image being shared appears to be a screen grab of an article written by someone named Flagg Eagleton. Websites such as the Conservative Republic and Prep-101.com have also published stories making the same claim in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cJohn Elway Lays Down The Law: \u2018Kneel On My Field And You\u2019re Fired On The Spot,'\u201d the headlines in the image and the articles read. (RELATED: Did NASCAR Ban Make America Great Again Hats At Its Events?)\n\nThe claim started circulating on social media after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a video statement that the league believes \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d His announcement came amid protests against racial injustice and police brutality that were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis police custody in late May.\n\nBut there is no evidence Elway said the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Had Elway made such a statement, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have done so, except to debunk the claim.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated with an article published on Potatriots Unite, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Yet, while Potatriots Unite makes the satirical nature of its content clear, the Facebook post fails to do so, portraying the story as genuine.\n\nElway did say in 2017 that he believed in standing for the national anthem, according to Bleacher Report. However, he tweeted a statement on June 6 expressing support for players \u201cusing their platform and influence in a positive way to create change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to stay on the sidelines,\u201d Elway wrote in the statement. \u201cEveryone has a responsibility to help those who are hurting. I am joining with the players, coaches and our organization in speaking up against racism, police brutality and any injustice against the black community.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
