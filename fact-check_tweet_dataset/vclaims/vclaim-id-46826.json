No, that's not true: Any citizen registered as a Repubican can vote in the GOP primary. Voters who did not specify a party preference on their voter registration received a mailing in December of 2019, giving them the option of voting in the Democratic Party, American Independent Party, Libertarian Party, or non-partisan primaries. The Republican Party declined to be included in the choices, so that only citizens who were registered as Republicans could cast ballots in the GOP primary. The Democratic Party agreed to allow voters who listed no party preference to get Democratic ballots.\n\nThe absence of a choice to receive a Republican ballot triggered suspicisions on social media of voter suppression engineered by the Democrat-controlled state government. The claim spread across social media in December, including in a post (archived here) published on December 8, 2019, showing the election mailing with the added message:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe misunderstanding was even referenced by Anonymous in a Qanon drop suggesting a California Democrat conspiracy against President Trump.\n\nAnonymous also linked to this tweet:\n\nThe California Republican Party decided to have a closed primary, while the Democrats will hold an open primary. California election officials, on their website, explain the state's \"modified\" closed primary:\n\nCalifornia's current \"modified\" closed primary system for Presidential elections was chaptered on September 29, 2000 and took effect on January 1, 2001. Senate Bill 28 (Ch. 898, Stats. 2000) implemented a \"modified\" closed primary system that permitted voters who had declined to provide a political party preference (formerly known as \"decline to state\" voters) to participate in a primary election if authorized by an individual party's rules and duly noticed by the Secretary of State.\n\nRedding, California, TV station KRCR explained the confusion in a report titled Here's why you may have gotten a card about the election, without a Republican option:\n\nIf a California voter wants to vote in the Republican Primary, they can revise their party preference information here.", "lang": "en"}
