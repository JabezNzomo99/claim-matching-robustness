He maintained that while some of Portland\u2019s roads might be pock marked, overall, the streets were safer.\n\n \n\n \"In 2005, as a new transportation commissioner, I decided it was more important to keep drivers alive than totally comfortable on side streets. Together with the Portland Bureau of Transportation, we prioritized road safety over smoothness, improving some of the most dangerous streets and intersections,\" he wrote. \"This strategy is paying off much better than we imagined.\"\n\n \n\n The next line really caught our attention: \"Traffic fatalities have fallen dramatically, even as population has risen. You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before.\"\n\n \n\n We wondered if he was right, so we got to checking.\n\nPortland\u2019s population has grown over the years. The U.S. Census shows an estimated 537,000 people living in the city back in 2006. The 2010 figure is more than 580,000. That\u2019s more than an 8 percent increase.\n\n \n\n The real question was whether road safety had really improved during Adams\u2019 time as head of the Portland Bureau of Transportation.\n\n \n\n Our first call was to the city's transportation department for figures on traffic fatalities and accidents. The first part was the easiest to come by.\n\n \n\n Spokesman Dan Anderson sent us a graph that laid out the total number of traffic fatalities over the past decade. This includes bike, pedestrian, motorcycle and car fatalities.\n\n \n\n The numbers bounced around a bit; 47 deaths in 2003 was the high point, while 20 in 2008 was the low. Generally, though, the trend line points downward.\n\n \n\n During the time Adams has been in charge the figures have fluctuated. In 2007 there were 36 deaths, the next year 20, the year after 33. Again, the trend line ultimately points down, but it\u2019s hardly an uninterrupted decline.\n\n \n\n We asked the mayor\u2019s office about these figures and received a two-page written statement from spokeswoman Amy Ruiz. She noted that \"the six years from 2005 through 2010 were notable for having five of the six lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in a year since 1925.\"\n\n \n\n We checked, and they\u2019re correct. But that trend started at least a decade before Adams took control of the bueau: The 16 years since 1995 had 12 of the lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in the same period.\n\n \n\n The overall decline during Adams\u2019 time in charge was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in motorist fatalities. If you look at the categorized figures, motorist deaths have fallen uniformly since 2005 from 19 that year to 7 in 2010. If you look at other categories, however, such as pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle deaths, taken together the trend in those fatalities is upward.\n\n \n\n You might be safer driving, but you\u2019re certainly not safer walking.\n\n \n\n That\u2019s why we\u2019d asked for the number of traffic crashes -- not just those that resulted in deaths.\n\n \n\n Those figures didn\u2019t offer much in the way of support for Adams\u2019 statement either. In 2005, there were some 9,660 accidents. That number rose in 2006 to 9,885 and then fell during the next three years. But, in 2010, it popped up again, hitting 10,334. Overall, the trend line there seems to indicate hardly any change at all during Adams\u2019 tenure.\n\n \n\n We decided we needed a broader perspective on all of this, so we gave the state\u2019s Department of Transportation a call. Spokeswoman Sally Ridenour knew just where to find the stats we were looking for.\n\n \n\n Since 2005, the state seems to have seen the same general trend that Portland has. The number of traffic accidents jumped slightly in 2006, fell the next three years and then jumped again in 2010, with a total of 44,094 accidents.\n\n \n\n If you back up and take a larger, longer term look at accidents, the trend is downward for both Portland and Oregon.\n\n \n\n Unlike Portland\u2019s up and down numbers, the number of deaths statewide -- and this, we should note, is not the same as the number of accidents resulting in a death -- has been on a completely uninterrupted decline since 2005.\n\n \n\n Never satisfied, we wanted to get an even broader picture. So, we pulled up a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation. That report showed that nationally the number of traffic-related deaths has declined since 2005 as well.\n\n \n\n Because we can\u2019t get enough of Excel\u2019s spreadsheets, we took this line of thought a little bit further. We calculated the number of deaths per thousand since 2005 in Portland and in the U.S. at large. While it\u2019s true that, as a whole, Portland is safer than the average, it\u2019s also true that the number of deaths per 1,000 people have dropped by about 26 percent both in Portland and nationally. That is to say that Portland is getting safer at about the same rate as the nation.\n\n \n\n While we were looking through all this data, we found a 2011 article from The Oregonian, which outlines how the Pacific Northwest was leading the nation in this decline. \"Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska -- the transportation department\u2019s \"Pacific Northwest region\" -- saw the nation\u2019s largest decrease. Deaths plummeted 12 percent to 1,215, federal officials said in a report (PDF).\"\n\n \n\n In fact, Oregon\u2019s figure for 2010 is the lowest since 1944, according to the report.\n\n \n\n Naturally, we were a little curious about why this might be happening. We talked to Troy Costales, who heads ODOT\u2019s safety division. He says it comes down to five factors: better engineering on roads and in cars, law enforcement, emergency response and public education campaigns.\n\n \n\n \"In Oregon we've been on a steady decline ever since 1999,\" Costales said. \"We've been out in front.\"\n\n \n\n Ruiz said the fact that national and state trends were down didn\u2019t necessarily undermine Adams\u2019 assertions that his focus on safety had resulted in fewer fatalities. \"He does not say focusing on safety in Portland resulted in unique traffic safety improvements.\"\n\n \n\n That might be the case, but Adams directly links his spending decisions to safety trends. If those trends are happening elsewhere, it\u2019s hard to say just how much of the decline Adams can take credit for.\n\n \n\n In any case, Adam\u2019s wrote that, despite population growth, fatalities are down \"dramatically.\"\n\n \n\n \"You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before\" he took over, he wrote. He\u2019s partly right, the number of driver fatalities is trending down down. Pedestrian fatalities, however, during his time as head of PBOT are trending up, as are motorcycle deaths. What\u2019s more, Portland\u2019s figures aren\u2019t exactly unique. Adams statement ignores those details and the larger state and national context.
