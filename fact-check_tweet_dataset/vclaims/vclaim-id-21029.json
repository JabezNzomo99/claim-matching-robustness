Steny Hoyer wrongly claimed that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cused a private server when he was governor of Indiana.\u201d Pence did use a personal AOL account for some government business, but he did not have a \u201cprivate server.\u201d\n\nHoyer, the House Democratic whip, brought up the vice president\u2019s past email practices in a July 25 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland Democrat was asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet early that morning criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions for taking a \u201cVERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.\u201d Trump referenced Clinton\u2019s use of a private server and private email account to conduct business while she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\n\nFor starters, Sessions cannot take any position on an investigation concerning the presidential campaign. As a former adviser to the Trump campaign, the attorney general has recused himself from \u201cany existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.\u201d (Trump\u2019s mention of the \u201cDNC server\u201d is a reference to the Russian government\u2019s hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer systems. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified that his agency asked DNC officials for access to the party\u2019s servers after they were hacked, but the DNC refused the requests. There is no evidence that Clinton committed any \u201ccrimes\u201d regarding the security breach of the DNC servers, and any campaign-related investigation would be covered by Sessions\u2019 recusal.)\n\nWe also note that the FBI did investigate Clinton\u2019s email use, and the FBI director at the time recommended that no charges be brought against her or her aides \u2014 a recommendation that was accepted by then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Hoyer about the president\u2019s criticism of his own attorney general. Hoyer dismissed it as a distraction. But in doing so, he got the facts wrong.\n\nAs the Indianapolis Star revealed in March, Pence \u201croutinely\u201d used a personal AOL account to conduct government business. The paper obtained nearly 30 such emails through a public records request, and an official with the vice president\u2019s office told the paper that those were a small fraction of state-business messages associated with the AOL account.\n\nBut, contrary to Hoyer\u2019s statement, Pence did not have a private server, nor did he use his personal email account exclusively for government business, as Clinton did. Pence also used a state government account.\n\nThere are other significant differences between the email practices of the two public officials.\n\nThe state of Indiana does not prohibit the use of personal email for government business as long as the emails are preserved, and the former governor took steps before he left office to preserve them, the Star story said. \u201cPence\u2019s office said his campaign hired outside counsel as he was departing as governor to review his AOL emails and transfer any involving public business to the state,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, the State Department\u2019s inspector general said the department has had policies dating to 2005 that require \u201cnormal day-to-day operations\u201d to be conducted on government servers. While occasional use of personal email for State business is permitted, Clinton should have turned over all work-related emails before she left office and did not until 21 months later.\n\nAlso, the IG said department policies adopted in 2007 required that non-department servers used to \u201cprocess or store department information\u201d meet the same security controls as the department\u2019s systems and be registered with the department. Clinton did not adhere to either policy, according to an IG report issued May 26, 2016.
