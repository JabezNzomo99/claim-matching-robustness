This is false: government sources close to the matter say that Prime Minister Trudeau has not spoken to Queen Elizabeth II about security costs. The official registry of the prime minister\u2019s office shows no reference of a call with her in the past month.\n\nWhat began as speculation in the British press over the potential costs affiliated with hosting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Canada devolved into indignation following claims that Canadian taxpayers would pay an annual 850,000 Canadian dollars bill.\n\n\u201cMr Trudeau has assured the Queen that the family will be safe while in his country, with Canada expected to pay around half of the estimated \u00a31million annual bill,\u201d claims a popular Facebook post referencing a probable move to Canada by the British royals.\n\n\u201cAt least it will buy Justin some good selfies with Harry and Meghan,\u201d another Facebook publication commented, while the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a non-profit organization, launched a petition to keep public money from being used for the couple\u2019s security.\n\nOn January 13, British daily newspaper the Evening Standard reported that \u201cJustin Trudeau has agreed taxpayers in his country should pick up the huge bill for the couple\u2019s round-the-clock protection while they are in the country,\u201d without citing sources. The information was repeated in a Daily Mail article, which inspired social media posts in Canada.\n\nHowever, these assumptions are premature and false, according to multiple government sources.\n\nTrudeau told Canadian media Global News in an interview on January 13 that nothing had been settled in regards to the security bill for the royal family, which media estimated to be Can$1.7 million. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, those are decisions for them (the royal couple),\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nA government source close to the matter told AFP that this had not changed as of the time of publication on January 15, adding that reports of Trudeau offering to the Queen to pay for Harry and Meghan\u2019s protection are false.\n\nThe official registry of the Prime Minister\u2019s office, which compiles Trudeau\u2019s travels, statements, meetings and calls with foreign leaders, makes no mention of a call with Queen Elizabeth II in recent months. Trudeau did speak with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on January 8, but their conversation pertained to the plane crash in which British and Canadian citizens lost their lives, on the same day.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau also denied allegations that Canada had agreed to pay for the security bill. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t spent any time thinking about this issue,\u201d he told reporters in Toronto on January 13. This was still the case Wednesday when AFP contacted the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe RCMP would not confirm or speculate on any present or future personal protection measures,\u201d Caroline Duval, media relations officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), told AFP in an email.\n\nHowever, should the Sussexes move to Canada, the RCMP will play a role in their protection. \u201cHis Royal Highness, Prince Henry of Wales (Harry), along with members of his family, are Internationally Protected Persons and are entitled to the protection of the RCMP while in Canada,\u201d Duval said in an earlier statement to journalists.\n\nThe Queen announced in a statement on January 12 that she was \u201csupportive\u201d of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to \u201ccreate a new life as a young family\u201d between Canada and the UK.\n\nAn Angus Reid poll published on Wednesday revealed that 73 percent of Canadians feel that their country should not pay for costs associated with having members of the royal family in Canada. Only 19 percent of respondents said that Canada should pay for some of the costs.\n\nDespite this, 61 percent of Canadians would like to see Prince Harry become the next governor general of Canada, the Queen\u2019s representative in the Commonwealth country, according to another poll conducted for the Postmedia group.", "lang": "en"}
