We have been unable to find specific details about the tires on the most recent presidential limo model, but photographs of the vehicle from Getty Images clearly show tires on \u201cThe Beast\u201d made by Goodyear. A contemporary report from Reuters noted that the vehicle is equipped with \u201crun-flat tires, bulletproof glass and a completely sealed interior to ward off a chemical attack, among many other high-tech security features. It also has extensive electronic communications equipment.\u201d\n\nGoodyear has a long history of providing tires for presidential limos. In 2009, for instance, the company released a statement about its involvement in creating the limo for former U.S. President Barack Obama. The company noted that the tires on that presidential limo (and presumably on the most recent model) were actually truck tires in a 285/70R19.5 size.\n\nIN PRESIDENTIAL TRAVELS, GOODYEAR TIRES WILL HELP OBAMA \u2018GET THERE\u2019 When Barack Obama takes the oath of office to become the 44th President of the United States, he will begin a journey of countless appearances and appointments, and The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company will be a key contributor, though few might notice. The new president\u2019s official limousine will be carried to its various destinations in the Capital and elsewhere on Goodyear tires, continuing a decades-long tradition as the exclusive tire for the presidential limo, and the standard tire of the U.S. Secret Service. On the new presidential limousine, a heavily customized Cadillac DTS, a set of Goodyear tires \u2013 Goodyear Regional RHS \u2013 will be occupying the four corners of the car. These are actually truck tires in a 285/70R19.5 size, necessary due to the vehicle\u2019s extra load that includes a heavy-duty chassis, extended length and armored material.\n\nIn this release, Goodyear also touted its history of working on presidential limos. While we haven\u2019t uncovered specifics for every presidential limo, the following 1989 newspaper clipping from the Akron Beacon notes that Goodyears were used on former U.S. President George H.W. Bush\u2019s limo.\n\nThe 1989 news article states, \u201cGoodyear also said it has supplied tires for presidential fleet limousines for more than 25 years.\u201d That means Goodyear\u2019s involvement with the presidential fleet dates back to Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s presidency in 1964.\n\nAs of this writing, the presidential limo uses Goodyear tires. On Aug. 19, 2020, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked if \u201cThe Beast\u201d would stop using Goodyear tires in light of the president\u2019s call for a boycott. McEnany declined to answer the question, saying that she was \u201cnot going to comment on security matters.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
