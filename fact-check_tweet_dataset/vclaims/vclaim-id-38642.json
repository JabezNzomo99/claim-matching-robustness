Cases have more than doubled from one million in 2009 to 2.4 million in 2019.\u201d\n\nIt is correct that restaurants and takeaways are responsible for hundreds of thousands of norovirus cases each year. However, this only accounts for around 8% of all norovirus cases.\n\nIt\u2019s not correct to say that cases of food poisoning doubled between 2009 and 2019. This just reflects an improvement in how the figures are estimated.\n\nAccording to new research by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), there are approximately three million cases of norovirus in the UK every year, which can cause symptoms including diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\nNot all norovirus cases are food poisoning. Norovirus can be picked up from eating food, but can also be passed from person-to-person or caught from a contaminated environment.\n\nIn total, around 13% of all norovirus cases are linked to food consumption (380,000), and two thirds of these (around 240,000) are caused by food from restaurants or takeaways.\n\nProfessor Guy Poppy, chief scientific adviser to the FSA, said the risk to consumers \u201cremains very low\u201d.\n\nOn average, consumers of takeaways or catered food would get norovirus from one in every 2,000 meals.\n\nBy comparison, open-headed lettuce caused 30% of all food-caused norovirus cases (114,000) but the risk was lower, with one instance of norovirus for every 15,000 portions consumed. Oysters pose the highest risk per serving, with one in every 160 servings leading to norovirus, but this equates to just 3% of all food-caused norovirus cases.\n\nThe figures were published by the FSA after a five-year study into the extent of norovirus in food.\n\nThe FSA also looked at the foodborne illnesses in general, estimating that there are 2.4 million cases every year in the UK, up from the 2009 estimate of 1 million.\n\nHowever, it is incorrect to claim that this shows food poisoning is rising. The FSA said the figures \u201cdo not indicate an increase in total illness, or any new risk to public health\u201d but are simply a \u201cbetter estimation\u201d of the proportion of infectious intestinal disease caused by food.\n\nThe 380,000 cases of norovirus linked to food consumption make up 16% of this total.", "lang": "en"}
