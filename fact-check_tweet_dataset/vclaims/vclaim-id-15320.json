Michelle Obama and Oprah are looking on from the edges of the frame with shocked expressions on their faces.\n\n\"Big Daddy O wants this picture removed from the Internet. Share the hell out of it!!!!\" text below the photo reads.\n\nIf that image sounds fake to you, it's because it is.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image has appeared elsewhere, like on the website Know Your Meme. In this version, Michelle Obama and Oprah are absent though a similar call to action also asks people to repost the picture. But Know Your Meme has labeled this one a parody. Another so-called \"Fraternal Kiss\" parody photo in the site\u2019s collection? Obama kissing former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The image was part of a 2011 advertising campaign from the United Colors of Benetton (and the Obama White House was not happy about it).\n\nThe photo of Obama and Cameron, however, doesn\u2019t appear to be a marketing ploy. Rather, it looks like a guerilla Photoshop job.\n\nThe original photo shows Obama kissing Michelle. According to the caption on a Nov. 6, 2008, Belfast Telegraph story, it happened after he gave his victory speech in Chicago on election night on Nov. 4 that year. The image was also posted on other websites, like Pinterest.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
