During the April 13 coronavirus task force press briefing, Trump was asked if he and Fauci were \u201con the same page.\u201d He responded: \u201cYeah, we have been from the beginning.\u201d At the same press briefing, Fauci discussed how responsive Trump was to the recommendations made by the task force. After discussing the recommendations they made regarding mitigation, Fauci mentioned: \u201cThe travel [restriction] was another recommendation, when we went in and said, \u2018We probably should be doing that.\u2019 And the answer was \u2018yes.\u2019 And then another time was, \u2018We should do it with Europe,\u2019 and the answer was \u2018yes.\u2019 And the next time, \u2018We should do it with the U.K.,\u2019 and the answer was \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Fauci said in the earlier stages of the pandemic that a China travel ban was \u201cnot something that I think we're even considering,\u201d according to New York Times interviews with White House aides and Fauci himself, by January 30 the leading public health officials in the federal government were recommending travel restrictions with China to President Trump. Aides also told the Wall Street Journal that it was Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that convinced the initially- skeptical Trump to make the decision. Azar\u2019s explanation of the decision echoes this reporting, as he said the travel restrictions were implemented based on \u201cthe uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d\n\nFauci supported the travel restrictions with China publicly as well. At the task force press briefing on the day the restrictions were announced, Fauci said that \u201cbecause there are so many unknowns here, we\u2019re going to take the action that the secretary will describe [restricting travel from China], in a temporary way, to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.\u201d\n\nOn February 3, the day after the restrictions took effect, Fauci appeared on CNBC and stated: \u201cAs the entry into the United States of potentially infected people is diminished because of the travel restrictions on both sides, of getting out of China and getting into the United States, I think you are going to see a dampening down of [coronavirus cases in the United States]. And that\u2019s the reason why this was done: to protect Americans from travel-related cases.\u201d\n\nOn February 7, Fauci told reporters that the positives of travel restrictions with China outweigh the negatives and that \u201cthis decision was not made lightly.\u201d\n\nDuring the February 29 coronavirus task force press briefing, Fauci repeated how valuable he saw the travel restrictions: \u201cWe prevented travel from China to the United States. If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.\u201d (The restrictions didn\u2019t actually prevent all travel from China; they merely restricted it.)\n\nOn March 15, Fauci said, \u201cThe president's decision to essentially have a major blocking of travel from China, that already had an effect of not seeding the way, in Europe\u2014Italy didn't do that.\u201d The next week, on March 22, Fauci said the United States was \u201cnot necessarily at all\u201d on the same trajectory for coronavirus cases as Italy, citing Italy\u2019s decision not to \u201cshut out as well the input of infections that originated in China\u201d early on as a possible reason the country was hit particularly hard.\n\nFauci has consistently agreed with the travel decision. Indeed, a wide variety of reporting and his public statements make clear he was an early advocate for such restrictions in internal government coronavirus discussions. Based on all available information, Trump was not accurate to say that Fauci criticized the president\u2019s decision to restrict travel with China.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
