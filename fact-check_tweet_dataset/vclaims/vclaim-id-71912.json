But Carter actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate,\" the ad states.\n\nThat\u2019s a frequent claim out of the Deal campaign. It\u2019s also very similar to a claim that PolitiFact has examined previously and deems worthy of a second look -- given that education is one of the hottest topics in the race and one of taxpayers\u2019 biggest investment. (This year alone, the cost of K-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state\u2019s $18.3 billion budget.)\n\nThe ad from the Republican Governors Association specifically takes aim at Carter\u2019s vote in the most recent General Assembly session on the 2015 state budget (though the RGA gives a wrong citation in the ad for HB 744, the 2015 appropriations bill).\n\nOut of 56 state senators, Carter was one of only four who voted \"No\" on the budget,\" state records show.\n\nThe budget included austerity cuts to education, totaling $747 million. But they were the smallest cuts since 2009 and, as such, were viewed by leaders in education as largely positive.\n\nThis past spring, when Deal signed the 2015 budget into law, Carter explained his opposition was rooted in a belief that having a separate education budget would restore all, not just some, of the previous cuts.\n\n\"Budgets reflect values, and this budget shows that Gov. Deal does not value our students, teachers and classrooms,\" Carter said in a statement in April.\n\nCarter has since expanded on his idea of a separate education budget, including a funding stream from tax cheats to boost spending.\n\nRepublicans argued that Deal increased education funding every year, a claim PolitiFact found his record.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Carter has repeatedly attacked Deal for underfunding education. Most of his public statements as a state senator focused on education and called for more money, both on the K-12 and college levels.\n\n\"To say he does not support more funding is completely erroneous,\" Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said. \"It\u2019s precisely the opposite. He does not want our schools to continue to be shortchanged.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, have suggested that Carter\u2019s vote against the 2015 budget was strictly political posturing.\n\nThey point out that he voted in favor of Deal\u2019s three prior state budgets, all of which had larger education austerity cuts. (Georgia\u2019s 180 school systems collectively were underfunded more than $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.1 billion in 2013 and nearly $1.1 billion in 2014, according to allotment sheets from the Georgia Department of Education.)\n\nAusterity cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985.\n\nCarter has voiced concerns about the state\u2019s commitment to public education during his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia\u2019s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact\u2019s ruling of that claim.)\n\nAround the nation, there are 36 governor\u2019s races this fall and about a third of them -- including the one between Deal and Carter -- are considered competitive, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\n\"Deal is one of five incumbent Republicans who is in some degree of difficulty,\" Sabato said. \"Deal is a slight favorite, but Carter has kept it close.\"\n\nIn summary, the RGA ad claims that Carter \"actually opposed more funding for education.\" It would be accurate to say Carter voted against the current state budget that expanded money for schools.\n\nCarter has called for more education funding for nearly all of his short political career. But when it came down to votes in the state Senate, he voted with Gov. Deal on three budgets that contained austerity cuts and against the governor on a budget that had the smallest austerity cuts in years.\n\nThe GOP was careful in wording its latest ad to say Carter opposed more funding for education \"in the Senate.\" That statement needs that context but is largely on target.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
