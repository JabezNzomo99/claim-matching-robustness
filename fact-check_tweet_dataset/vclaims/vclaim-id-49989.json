I will immediately fire you, no matter who you are!\u201d\n\nThe comment first started circulating in 2016 amid debate over some football players\u2019 decision to kneel during the national anthem. In an interview with the Kansas City Star that year, Hunt said it was an \u201cinternet hoax.\u201d The comment about the field being \u201cmy stage\u201d has previously been falsely attributed to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something where I\u2019ve spoken specifically to the players or any specific player about it,\u201d Hunt told the Kansas City Star in 2016. \u201cBut the entire team knows that our desire is for them to stand during the national anthem.\u201d\n\nBrad Gee, the director of football communications for the Kansas City Chiefs, confirmed to The Associated Press that the claim is inaccurate.

In 2016, Hunt told the Kansas City Star, \u201cFor a couple years now, Coach Reid and the rest of the leadership of the team have spoken to the coaches and the team about the importance of standing during the national anthem. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s new this year. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been focusing on for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nSeveral Chiefs players, including tight end Travis Kelce, have sat or taken a knee during the playing of the national anthem without being fired.\n\nThe claim that Hunt threatened to \u201cimmediately fire\u201d players and staff who do not stand for the anthem resurfaced after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a video statement that the league believes \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d His announcement supporting players\u2019 peaceful protests came amid demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality that were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody in late May.", "lang": "en"}
