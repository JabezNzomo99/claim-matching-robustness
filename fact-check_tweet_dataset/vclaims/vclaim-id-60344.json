This is misleading: the pictured baby had heart surgery in 2012 and the now seven-year-old child does not have COVID-19, his parents say.\n\nFacebook posts shared over 66,000 times here, here and here depict a picture of a small baby connected to medical equipment with surgical staples down its chest.\n\nOne of the misleading Facebook posts has been viewed more than 12 million times in the last three months.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cThis is baby Kyle. Few weeks ago He survived an opened heart surgery, And today the doctors confirm That he has Corona Virus, He is not asking for your money, He only want you to help him out, by sharing this post to even if it's 5 different Facebook groups so He can get many prayers as possible, please don't ignore him (sic).\u201d\n\nSome of the posts link to a page created on May 19, 2020, which is categorised as a musician/band but doesn\u2019t feature any music.\n\nThe claims have been shared in numerous countries, including South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Bangladesh.\n\nHowever, reverse image searches on Yandex and TinEye show that the image has been online since at least 2017.\n\nOne link on the reverse image search leads to an article published on January 14, 2014, on Stuff, a New Zealand-based news website.\n\nThe story titled \u201cLittle battlers: Heart surgery at 5 days old\u201d details how a baby boy named Cameron Bartle -- not Kyle -- had his first open-heart surgery in 2012 after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.\n\nThe article shares the same picture with a caption saying it was a seven-day-old Cameron.\n\nAn internet search of the keywords \u201cCameron Bartle heart surgery\u201d finds an article on June 19, 2016, by the New Zealand Herald reporting on his extensive medical journey.\n\nBy his fourth birthday in 2016, Bartle had had four open-heart surgeries.\n\nThe search also reveals a YouTube video on October 26, 2016 of his parents Rachael and Nick Bartle sharing how they overcame the ordeal. The video shows the same image of the baby used in the misleading posts circulating on social media this month.\n\nAFP Fact Check has tried to contact the parents but they have not yet replied.\n\nLast month, Cameron\u2019s mother told US fact-checking website Lead Stories that the now seven-year-old boy does not have COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI want people to know that photo is my son, he's not named Kyle, and he doesn't have Covid-19.\"", "lang": "en"}
