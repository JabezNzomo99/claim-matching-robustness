We\u2019re focusing specifically here on people\u2019s expectations in relation to a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, as Ms Swinson referred to.\n\nThe term \u201chard Brexit\u201d means different things to different people, but it\u2019s generally used to mean at the very least leaving the EU\u2019s single market (as Ms Swinson referred to).\n\nTheresa May has said this is the only way to control things like immigration. EU officials say this as well. This is because EU free trade rules for the single market require free movement of people between member countries.\n\nAt the start of the year a majority of both Remain and Leave voters said they wanted both free trade and immigration control, says an in-depth study by polling expert Professor John Curtice.\n\nThe disagreement comes in what voters prioritise. Faced with a choice over whether free trade or immigration control comes first, as many as 36% of Leave supporters said they would \u2018definitely\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019 maintain freedom of movement in return for free trade, compared to 74% of Remain voters, at least when confronted out of the blue by a pollster.\n\nAt least half of Remain voters were found to back some policies that the research defined as parts of a hard Brexit as well.\n\nThis is all debatable. There is no set definition of a hard and soft Brexit, and we don\u2019t yet know what the trade offs will be during the negotiations.\n\nWhat this polling does show is that we should beware of making strong claims about what voters on either side think: there are Remainers sympathising with \u201cLeave\u201d positions, and Leavers sympathising with \u201cRemain\u201d positions.\n\nFor a broader examination of the reasons behind voters\u2019 decisions last June, social researchers at NatCen have published extensive analysis.", "lang": "en"}
