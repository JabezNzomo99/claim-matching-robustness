The message has been shared extensively on Twitter. The Logical Indian also received a request to verify the claims.\n\nGoogle and Apple jointly created the Exposure Notifications System 'to help governments and our global community fight this pandemic through contact tracing'. It is an application programming interface which provides support to contact tracing apps by public health authorities. According to Google, this is how the system works: (1) Once you opt-in to the notification system, the Exposure Notifications System will generate a random ID for your device. To help ensure these random IDs can't be used to identify you or your location, they change every 10-20 minutes. (2) Your phone and the phones around you will work in the background to exchange these privacy-preserving random IDs via Bluetooth. You do not need to have the app open for this process to take place. (3) Your phone periodically checks all the random IDs associated with positive COVID-19 cases against its own list. (4) If there's a match, the app will notify you with further instructions from your public health authority on how to keep you and the people around you safe. COVID-19 sensor has been illegally inserted into phones by Apple and Google with the intention to track people. The claim is misleading. Although this is a default service, launched as part of as an Operating System update, and cannot be deleted from the phone. Users, however, have the option to turn off the service or deleted the randomly generated IDs by going to the COVID-19 notifications settings in their respective phones.\n\nAll it means at this point is that the Application Programming Interface (API) will enable exposure notifications. It will allow a 'participating app' such as Arogya Setu, to function as when you choose to install it. Below is a screenshot of the support section of the API:\n\nIn a Joint Statement issued by the tech giants on May 20 clarified, \"What we've built is not an app\u2014rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use the location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app.\" Therefore, COVID-19 tracking device has not been installed into your phones.
