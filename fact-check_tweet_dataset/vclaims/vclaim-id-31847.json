She wasn\u2019t, but that story has been copied by other sites and shared as though it\u2019s true.\n\n\n\nMalia Obama has been a popular target for purveyors of misinformation; we\u2019ve debunked claims about former President Barack Obama\u2019s eldest daughter before.\n\nAnother bogus claim, first published in the spring, has been picking up steam on social media recently.\n\nSeveral readers have asked us if what they\u2019ve seen on Facebook is true. \u201cDid Malia get arrested for using a powdery substance in the bathroom at Harvard?\u201d one reader asked.\n\nNo. That claim originated on a self-described satirical website called DailyWorldUpdate.us, which includes this disclaimer on its \u201cAbout\u201d page: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d The website is part of a network of sites that says it posts made-up stories to provoke conservatives. We\u2019ve written about a lot of the claims made by that network, which is called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.\n\nOften, stories that start on one of that network\u2019s sites will get copied and re-posted by other sites that have no disclaimer. That\u2019s what happened with the story about Malia Obama. DailyWorldUpdate.us posted its story on May 29, and other sites copied and shared the story as though it were true.\n\nFor anyone who reads past the bogus headline \u2014 \u201cMalia Obama Arrested Again, Complete Media Blackout\u201d \u2014 there are some red flags in the story, including the statement that \u201cObama was held at the Harvard County jail.\u201d Harvard University, where Obama is a student, is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is in Middlesex County. There is no \u201cHarvard County\u201d in Massachusetts.\n\nAlso, the fake mugshot of Obama was created using a photo of her carrying a backpack on a street in Manhattan in 2017.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
