Rick Scott and the state Cabinet and Florida\u2019s 29 Republican electors. The website also cites the same story in the Detroit Free Press.\n\nThe filing alleges that the state\u2019s election results were invalid, contending that voting machines malfunctioned or were hacked, many votes went uncounted and mail-in ballots weren\u2019t included, among other problems. The suit aims to force a recount of votes by insisting Hillary Clinton would have won the election had there been no alleged impropriety.\n\nTrump won Florida by almost 113,000 votes, and there has been no proof of \"massive voter fraud.\" The election results were certified on Nov. 22, with only \"minor problems\" reported by election officials.\n\nDespite what the headline implies, state officials have not pushed for a recount. Under Florida law, a recount is triggered if a candidate wins by 0.5 percent or less. Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Clinton was about 1.4 percent.\n\nA voter may file a lawsuit to contest the results within 10 days of the results being certified. The results can be contested if there\u2019s a suspicion of fraud or corruption, a candidate being ineligible, a dispute over vote totals or bribery.\n\nWith the assistance of a left-leaning Washington-based group called Protect Our Elections, the trio of plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on Dec. 2, the final eligible day to contest the results.\n\nThe Facebook post of the report did mention the lawsuit, also noting \"Trump is NOT happy.\" But there\u2019s a good chance he won\u2019t say anything about the lawsuit at all. Even Orlando attorney Clint Curtis, representing the plaintiffs in the recount lawsuit, acknowledged the action may produce zero results before the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19.\n\n\"They can ignore it entirely,\" Curtis told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nBipartisan Report\u2019s headline read, \"Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud.\"\n\nA trio of Florida voters contested the results, not state officials. Their lawsuit cited potential problems like uncounted or improperly tallied votes and voting machines that didn\u2019t work or were hacked. The lawsuit likely won\u2019t bring a recount \u2014 or any action at all \u2014 before the Electoral College votes.\n\nThe headline confounds readers by misrepresenting what the story actually says.
