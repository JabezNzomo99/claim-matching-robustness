He then tweeted that a claim about the golf resort having issues with bed bugs was a \u201cmade up Radical Left Story.\u201d\n\n\n\n Trump made the suggestion about Doral on Aug. 27, 2019, while in Biarritz, the French resort town that was the site of the 2019 G7 summit, where influential world leaders gathered. \u201cPeople are really liking it and plus it has buildings that have 50 to 70 units,\u201d he said about Doral. \u201cAnd so each delegation can have its own building.\u201d\n\nTalk of Doral renewed attention on a lawsuit filed against the resort. Court records show that Trump\u2019s Doral resort near Miami was sued in July 2016 by Eric Linder, a guest who checked in to Doral in early March 2016 to attend a trade convention.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit complaint, Linder awoke shortly after he arrived to \u201cmultiple welts, lumps and marks over much of his face, neck, arms and torso,\u201d at which point he complained to the resort staff. Linder was then informed the room he was in tested positive for bed bugs. Per the lawsuit complaint, the property had a \u201chistory of severe bed bug infestation,\u201d which was either not treated or was done so inadequately.\n\nAccording to a court document filed by a mediator, an \u201cagreement was reached\u201d between the parties on Jan. 24, 2017. Linder, according to news reports, is barred from discussing the details of the settlement by a confidentiality agreement.\n\nBefore the bed bugs scandal hit the news, Trump was already facing scrutiny for his statement that next year\u2019s G7 would be held at his own resort location, which raises ethical issues about the president using the public office to enrich his private interests. Trump\u2019s extensive business network and how he has used it in office have been the source of ongoing controversy over questions about conflicts of interest.", "lang": "en"}
