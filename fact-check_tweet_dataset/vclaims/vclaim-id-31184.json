This photo is being shared in the context of Modi\u2019s recent visit to the U.S. and the \u2018Howdy Modi\u2019 event. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nCongress MP Shashi Tharoor has also posted the same picture with a similar claim on his Twitter account but later clarified that the picture was forwarded to him and \u2018is probably from a visit to the USSR and no the US\u2019. (Archived Tweet).\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in a website with the description, \u2018The meeting of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi 1955, Russia, Chelyabinsk oblast, Magnitogorsk\u2019 (translated from Russian). A user has also given the geo-location of the place in the comments below the photo. The two buildings in the background can be seen in the street view of the location \u2013 \u201828 Prospekt Pushkina, Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia\u2019.\n\nIn an article (\u2018The Soviet land, 1955\u2019) on the \u2018Outlook Traveller\u2019 website, it can be found that Nehru, along with his daughter Indira, has travelled to the USSR in June 1955 and the itinerary included \u2018Magnitogorsk\u2019. The article reads, \u2018In June of that year our first PM Jawaharlal Nehru travelled to Moscow for his first official tour of the USSR (he had been once before in 1927 as an Indian National Congress delegate to the 10th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution). His daughter was with him and they began an epic itinerary from Moscow to Leningrad by way of Stalingrad, Crimea, Georgia, Ashkabad, Tashkent, Samarkand, the Altai Territory, Magnitogorsk, and Sverdlovsk.\u2019 Other photos and more information about this visit can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo shared as taken during Nehru\u2019s visit to the USA in 1954 is actually from his visit to the USSR in 1955.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
