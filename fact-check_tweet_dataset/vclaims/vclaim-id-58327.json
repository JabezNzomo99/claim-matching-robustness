The posts claim the the video shows the airline failed to enforce social distancing measures during the coronavirus pandemic. The claim is false; Pakistan International Airlines said the video was taken aboard one of its flights in April 2020; the video has previously circulated in reports about a Pakistan International Airlines flight.\n\nThe two-minute 31-second video was shared on Facebook here on May 8, 2020. It has been viewed more than 26,000 times.\n\nBetween the 20-mark and 30-second mark, a male voice can be heard speaking in Urdu: \u201cYou\u2019ve charged us the price of three seats for one, and we\u2019ve paid 3,000 dollars. But it seems like you are fooling us. There is no social distancing here.\u201d\n\nThe caption of the Facebook post states: \u201cAir India charged 3 times the fare, in the name of \u2018social distancing\u2019. But the passengers didn't get even a single seat empty between them. Looting the public continues unabated.\u201d\n\nAir India is the flag carrier airline of India and is owned by Air India Limited, a government-owned enterprise.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here, here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim in English and Hindi.\n\nThe video in fact shows a Karachi to Toronto flight run by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the flag carrier of Pakistan.\n\nA visual analysis of the footage using Watch Frame by Frame, a video verification tool, found the word \u201cPakistan\u201d visible on one of the in-flight screens between the one-minute 15-second and one-minute 30-second mark of the video in the misleading post.\n\nBelow are two screenshots of the video in the misleading post with the relevant in-flight screen circled in red:\n\nThe word \u201cPakistan\u201d in the same font style and colour is also seen in photographs taken aboard PIA flights by various travel websites here and here.\n\nA PIA spokesperson, Abdullah Hafeez, told AFP the video was taken aboard one of its Karachi-Toronto flights in April 2020 and shows an altercation that occurred after a passenger refused to \u201cshare seats with anyone as it does not allow social distancing\u201d.\n\n\"It was explained to him that it is not an international aviation rule to ensure middle seats remain vacant,\" Hafeez told AFP via WhatsApp on May 12. \"He was assured that all amenities and touch points in the aircraft have been thoroughly sanitised and all the passengers are required to wear masks throughout the duration of the flight. The passenger was convinced and flew with us on the same flight.\"\n\nThe video in the misleading post was also included in this April 26 news segment from Pakistani broadcaster GNN alongside the title \u201cNo Social Distancing Rules in PIA's flights to bring back stranded Pakistanis Home\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s Press Information Bureau issued a clarification here on Twitter on May 8, branding the misleading social media posts \u201cfake\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
