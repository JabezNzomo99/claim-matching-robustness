But the overall cost sharing was, more or less, what had expected: The Bucks\u2019 owners would pay half and taxpayers would pay half.\n\nAccording to Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, such a split would be good for taxpayers. Here is what April 10, 2015 on \"Here and Now,\" a Wisconsin Public Television show:\n\n\"If this comes out close to a 50-50 partnership, it will be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country.\"\n\nIn other words, Sheehy, who supports the new arena, is saying that taxpayers picking up half the tab for a new Milwaukee arena is relatively low, compared to how much taxpayers have contributed toward arenas for other National Basketball Association teams.\n\nThe parties set a self-imposed of May 29, 2015 to try and finalize the financing deal, which would have to be approved, likely within the next few weeks, as part of the 2015-\u201917 state budget.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe Bucks and their arenas\n\njoined the NBA in the 1968-\u201969 season. Led by and another future Hall of Famer, Oscar Robertson, they won their only league championship in the 1970-\u201971 season. That, the team, meant the Bucks went further, faster, than any expansion team in the history of major professional sports.\n\nIn recent years, however, the Bucks have struggled, and that is one reason there has been a drive to build a new arena. The team\u2019s current home -- the $90 million , which was built through a donation by the late Milwaukee philanthropist Jane Bradley Pettit -- opened in 1988. The 18,600-seat arena is the and the third-smallest in the 30-team NBA.\n\nMomentum for a new arena picked up in April 2014, when the Bucks\u2019 longtime owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl of Milwaukee, he was selling the team to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. Kohl and the new owners pledged to contribute $250 million toward a new arena.\n\nComing up with the other $250 million has been the sticking point, leading to months of negotiations involving , Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. There is time pressure in that the NBA has said a new arena must be built by the fall of 2017, or Milwaukee would risk losing the team to another market.\n\nTo see how other NBA arenas have been financed, we turned to two sources: The 2012 edition of \"Financing Economic Development in the 21st Century,\" a textbook that includes on financing professional sports facilities. And a database, in August 2014, that is maintained by Marquette University Law School\u2019s National Sports Law Institute.\n\nWe\u2019ve listed the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the arenas in the league -- that have been built since 1999. We went back to 1999 because a wave of NBA arenas -- seven of them -- went up that year.\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, there is some disagreement between the figures provided by the textbook and by Marquette. Holy Cross College sports economist , who wrote the sports facilities chapter in the textbook, told us that\u2019s not surprising because there are different ways to define a public contribution and because stadium financing deals aren\u2019t always transparent.\n\nBased on the two sources we checked, at least eight of the 15 NBA arenas built since 1999 were financed with more than 50 percent taxpayer support. Indeed, although there is some variation in the figures in the two sources, seven of the eight arenas were built with at least 82 percent public money (the total cost figures are according to the textbook).\n\nArenas built with more than 50% public money\n\nConversely, the textbook and Marquette agree that only four of the arenas were built with taxpayer contributions of 50 percent or less.\n\nArenas built with 50% or less public money\n\nThere was not agreement between the between the two sources on the public portion paid for arenas in Brooklyn, Indianapolis and Atlanta:\n\nSheehy said a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would \"be much better in terms of the portion of the public financing than most of the other arena projects done around the country.\"\n\nOf the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the cities in the league -- built since 1999, at least eight were built with more than 50 percent of the money coming from taxpayers. Seven of those eight were built with at least 82 percent public money.", "lang": "en"}
