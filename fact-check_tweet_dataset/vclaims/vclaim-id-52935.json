Contacting corona Virus-vidoe [sic] will make you cry.\u201d\n\nThe uncensored image was taken in the United States long before COVID-19 was discovered, and actually shows a victim of domestic violence. It first appeared in a Jan. 24, 2014 story on website totonicapan.org, which featured several photos taken during the wake of the girl and her sister, both less than two years old at the time, and their mother.\n\nThe three were killed by Miguel Mejia-Ramos in a fit of drunken rage towards his wife, whom he first stabbed to death in their apartment that Jan. 18, before doing the same to the kids, according to totonicapan.org and several news reports.\n\nMark News\u2019s false story also featured a \u201cvideo\u201d and a button to \u201cview more pictures,\u201d but clicking on either of them led to the loading of a suspicious domain -- passtechusa.com -- before redirecting to random websites. It could have reached over 23.2 million people.\n\nAmong the false post\u2019s top traffic generators is local FB group Francis Leo Marcos for Change movement, which told readers \u201cDon\u2019t be heartless\u201d and invited them to share the post. Other top traffic generators were FB groups Friends Who Like Jesus Daily LIFE and Mother Teresa's daily message.\n\nAll three posts have since been taken down, but Mark News\u2019s story -- the only story on the website -- remains live.\n\nThis is not the first time publishers of disinformation misrepresented photos of sick minors as COVID-19 patients, in a bid to harvest likes on social media.
