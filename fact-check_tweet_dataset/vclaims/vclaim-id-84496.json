With the recent escalation of the tensions between the two countries due to cross border strikes, terrorist incidents and Kulbhushan Jadhav case, the same question was asked with even more fervour before the India-Pakistan match at the Champions Trophy.\n\nNationalism being the new flavour, the \u2018nationalist\u2019 TV channels tried to outdo each other in their attempt to whip up mass hysteria against the match. The battle of the nationalists unfolded in a very predictable manner\u2026.\n\nTimes Now took up the cause very enthusiastically with the hashtags #BoycottPakMatch and #WhyPlayPak. The self-appointed custodians of the nation asked questions on behalf of the nation, \u201cThe nation wants to know: How can the country defend muscular policy, when it bats with Pakistan?\u201d The channel relayed news about \u201cmassive outrage\u201d among ex-servicemen, martyrs\u2019 families who want India to boycott the match with Pakistan.\n\nContinuing to whip up emotions, Times Now also ran a poll, \u201cCan India play with a \u2018terror state\u2019?\u201d The nation, it seems was divided on the issue and despite the best efforts of the channel to mould public opinion about it, 40% were still interested in watching the match.\n\nThough the channel didn\u2019t tweet on the scores or the result, it couldn\u2019t keep itself away from the stadium for very long, particularly when Vijay Mallya was spotted there.\n\nRepublic, the new kid on the block was rather mute about the match. It tweeted statements of Major Gaurav Arya and Major General GD Bakshi, the two army men whose \u2018nationalist\u2019 views are considered a must whenever such topics are discussed. The statements were on expected lines that the BCCI should have avoided playing the match and let us call it off.\n\nSeeing that its #NationFirstNoCompromise hashtag is not getting much traction, by the end of the day, Republic had abandoned any plans of not tweeting the results. India had won the match, and sulking about it had little value. So, Republic announced India\u2019s victory with a tweet.\n\nZee clearly won the patriotism race, leaving the other two \u2018nationalist\u2019 TV channels behind. Most vocal in its protests, the self-appointed custodians of national interest wanted to know what is more important, cricket or national interest?\n\nSubhash Chandra\u2019s tweets to announce the boycott of the match by Zee media immediately took the group\u2019s standing up by several notches in the eyes of the nationalists. \u201cZee News, Zee Hindustan, WION, DNA and all other news channels from Zee Media will not be covering any news about India Pak match\u201d, tweeted Chandra. In his words, it was a way to \u201ctell our Army that the people for whom they risk their life are more interested in supporting them than cheering for cricket match\u201d.\n\nZee also put out videos with an emotional appeal to boycott cricket with Pakistan.\n\nThe featured hashtag, #SabseBadaDroh, was Zee\u2019s way of declaring all those supporting the match as some kinds of \u201cdrohis (Traitors)\u201d. \u201cZeeNews is boycotting #IndvPak match in respect of our soldiers. Are you?\u201d was the question the channel asked its viewers, who by then had surfed on to another channel to watch the match.\n\nThey brought up a Pak Army video to rally support for the call to boycott but video or not, the match was going ahead.\n\nMost of the nationalist supporters cheered the move of Zee Group and joined the call to boycott the match. But as the game got under way, they watched it on other channels, cheering loudly for India. A fine example of this were the two tweets of Babita Phogat.\n\nThe Zee group anchors were meanwhile brimming with nationalism. They had decided that they were the only ones worthy to be called genuine nationalists as Sudhir Chaudhary tweeted that ZeeNews was \u201cexposing fake nationalists today both in media and politics\u201d. \u201c\u0926\u0941\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0947\u091f \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0916\u0947\u0932\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 ?\u201d was Rohit Sardana\u2019s impassioned appeal. \u201cToday is not the day! They would be playing with nation\u2019s emotions\u201d, tweeted Rubika Liyaquat in the same tone.\n\nZee News positioned itself on a pedestal as the only one willing to sacrifice TRPs for a nationalist cause.\n\nEven though they were boycotting the match, they couldn\u2019t keep away from the excitement for very long. While Sardana kept track of the trending position of their #SabseBadaDroh hashtag, Chaudhury continued to engage with twitter users, from a position of moral high ground. When someone tweeted about blocking Zee, his response was, \u201cIt\u2019s sad Indian Army protects people like you who sell their nation for a cricket match. This is #SabseBadaDroh\u201d.\n\nOnce India won the match, the \u201csacrifice\u201d of Zee was forgotten and social media burst out in celebration. Chaudhary tweeted to remind everyone, \u201cCricket team won but India lost!\u201c. The most retweeted response to Chaudhary was one that said, \u201cCricket team won, India won but Zee lost\u201c.\n\nThus ended the battle of the nationalist channels. Till the next India-Pakistan match\u2026..", "lang": "en"}
