In the tweet, he questions that \u2018when people demand no restrictions on giving birth to as many they wish, why do they question Government if their children starve?\u2019. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi\u2019s tweet about family planning in India and the government responsibility on children starving Fact: Former CJI and present Rajya Sabha member Ranjan Gogoi does not have an account on twitter. Screenshot in the post shows a tweet made from a fan page (parody) account. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn searching for the official twitter handle of Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi on twitter, we found that he has no account on twitter. Using the username mentioned in the screenshot, we found the twitter account (archived) that posted this tweet. The twitter account (@SGBJP) from which the tweet is made clearly states that it is a parody account of Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi. This account is now temporarily restricted by the twitter.\n\nTo sum it up, the screenshot of a tweet made from a parody account is falsely shared as Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi\u2019s tweet about family planning and starving children in the country.", "lang": "en"}
