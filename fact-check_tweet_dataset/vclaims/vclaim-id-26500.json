Whoever understands the grief of Kashmiri sisters and brothers should help us unveil the atrocities inflicted upon them by Indian forces and share this video more and more. Down with the Indian Army. May God bless the Muslims of Kashmir with freedom. Amen.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video has also been shared on Facebook here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the same video has previously circulated in reports about clashes which broke out in the northern Indian city of Panchkula in August 2017 after religious leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was found guilty of rape.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for a screenshot of the video found this video published on YouTube on August 29, 2017.

Narendra Modi says that save daughter, save daughter...Look at the situation here -- this is how injustice is being served to this daughter. No one came to help her. Brother, if you consider me as your sister then you will definitely share this, brother do not delete this video. Beware, the next video could be about your sister or your daughter too.\"", "lang": "en"}
