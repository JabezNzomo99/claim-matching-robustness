And he \u2014 they\u2019re just talking about opening plants now, and so many things have changed.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, roundtable on tax reform, Cleveland, May 5\n\nYet all U.S. Steel has announced is that it will restart two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at the company\u2019s Granite City Works integrated plant in Illinois \u2014 one in March and the other in October. The reopening of the first blast furnace was announced in March, resulting in 500 jobs, and the second was announced in June, adding 300. The plant had been closed since 2015.\n\nPresident Trump has a tendency to cite conversations that did not occur quite the way he describes them \u2014 if they took place at all. So we were a bit suspicious when he mentioned a phone conversation with Dave Burritt, chief executive of U.S. Steel.\n\nOne would think this would be easy to clear up. But the White House did not respond to a query. Burritt also did not respond to an email from The Fact Checker asking him to confirm the conversation.\n\nMeghan M. Cox, U.S. Steel\u2019s spokeswoman, simply offered this response: \u201cTo answer your question, we post all of our major operational announcements to our website and report them on earnings calls. Our most recent one pertained to our Granite City \u2018A\u2019 blast furnace restart.\u201d\n\nCox ignored our question about whether Burritt had had a phone conversation with Trump \u2014 and she ignored our follow-up query restating that question. So one can only assume the phone call did not happen.\n\nBut Charles Bradford of Bradford Research in New York suggested a possible explanation. He noted that an integrated plant such as one in Granite City is made of five or six parts. There\u2019s a blast furnace, but there is also the production of pig iron, an intermediate product; the continuous caster, which creates large slabs; and the rolling mill, which flattens those slabs to a customer\u2019s specifications.\n\n\u201cUsually I would consider that it is one mill,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s possible that Trump misunderstood \u2014 or that Burritt pitched it as separate entities, he said. But the facilities already existed; they are not \u201cnew.\u201d\n\nBradford added that U.S. Steel has been in discussions with a Japanese company to form a joint venture to produce high-strength steel, a new product. So that also might have been part of the discussion at the White House meeting.\n\nBradford said the bigger problem is that the Granite City facility should have been closed 20 years ago. He said it is not competitive with the highly efficient steel mini-mills that have sprung up in the United States, making large integrated mills too costly to run \u2014 at least before Trump imposed tariffs.\n\nThis should be easy to clear up: Either the president of U.S. Steel tipped market-moving information to the president of the United States, or he did not. Interestingly, the securities markets have not reacted at all to the president\u2019s disclosure; U.S. Steel\u2019s stock fell the day after Trump made his comments about six new facilities, and it has continued to decline.", "lang": "en"}
