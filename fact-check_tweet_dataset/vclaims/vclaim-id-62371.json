If you are calling to report a rape, please press one. To report a murder, press two. To report a home invasion, press three. For all other crimes, leave your name and number and someone will get back to you. Our estimated wait time is currently five days. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nBiden, in fact, has come under fire from the left for his position and for proposing to spend an additional $300 million a year on the community policing program started in the Clinton administration. (That would effectively double the budget for the program.) \u201cMore than 50 liberal groups signed a letter Monday to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden criticizing his response to the emerging protest movement against police brutality, warning that failing to embrace a more aggressive agenda risks alienating the African American voters he needs to win the election,\u201d The Washington Post reported in June. \u201cIt is a slap in the face to black folks,\u201d said LaTosha Brown, the head of Black Voters Matter, an Atlanta-based civil rights group that signed on to the letter.\n\nBiden has argued the correct response to prod police departments is to get closer to their communities and undertake reforms. \u201cThe vast majority of police are decent, honorable people, but there are bad apples, man. And we have to change the way in which we teach police. We have to release all the information,\u201d he said at a recent fundraiser. \u201cWe have to make sure that we deal with an entire new set of standards at the federal level like Barack [Obama] and I were doing before we left office. There\u2019s so much we can do, the country is ready to do it. We don\u2019t have to defund the police departments, we have to make sure they meet minimum basic standards of decency. And the vast majority of police, they want that to happen.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker obtained an audio tape of the full conversation on police and Biden\u2019s responses were much more nuanced, though as usual a bit disjointed. The NowThis video does not include Biden adding that his response was not the same as \u201cdefunding all the police.\u201d He also speaks about increasing funding for mental health, which is different from saying he would fund mental health aid out of redirected funds from the police. In effect, Biden appears to say he would condition aid on police reforms as an incentive on the one hand, while simultaneously providing additional resources for mental health, homelessness and other kinds of community support. (A Biden campaign aide confirms this is Biden\u2019s position.)\n\nBIDEN: I\u2019ve proposed that kind of reform. And by the way, the idea, though, that\u2019s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police. There are certain things you cannot send. My daughter, who has her master\u2019s degree in social work, she, she is one who engages in dealing with all those problems, many of which you, you talk about. When you have \u2014 I\u2019ve been very involved in holding over 1,000 hours of hearings on violence against women. And so many women, women are being killed by their, their spouses and/or their so-called lovers. When you get a call to a third-story walk-up in a domestic dispute, you can\u2019t send a social worker, because a social worker may get shot, too. So what happens \u2014 you, what do you do? You can send along a social worker with a police officer. We need significantly more help. That\u2019s why I call for significant increases in funding for mental health clinics and mental health providers. We are desperately in need of that now \u2026\n\nBIDEN: Yes, absolutely. And by the way, not just redirect, condition them. If they don\u2019t eliminate chokeholds, they don\u2019t get Byrne grants. If they don\u2019t do the following, they don\u2019t get any help. If they don\u2019t do \u2014 because you know as well as I do, the vast majority of all police departments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state. It\u2019s only the federal government comes in on top of that. And so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms, you have to make sure you have no-knock warrants eliminated. If you have them, you don\u2019t get Byrne grants. If you have them, boom. And one of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way \u2014 and I\u2019ve been pushing it for years \u2014 changing the way we deal with our prison system \u2026\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has failed to stand up to his supporters and the far-left elements of his Democratic Party who have called for defunding the police,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said. \u201cJust last week, when Biden was pressed by an activist on whether he supported radical efforts to \u2018redirect\u2019 police funding, Biden didn\u2019t hesitate in saying he \u2018absolutely\u2019 did. There can be no misunderstanding what \u2018redirect\u2019 means in this context \u2014 it means taking money originally budgeted for police and moving it elsewhere. At a time when crime is surging across the country, the American people need a president who will stand up to lawlessness and support the brave men and women in blue who keep our communities safe, not one who wants to cut their budgets. As the Trump campaign\u2019s ad makes perfectly clear, they would have no such support under a Biden administration.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
