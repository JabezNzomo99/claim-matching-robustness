Chandrashekar Rao had announced that the state government will not distribute Ramadan gifts this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which warrants strict social distancing measures (translated from Telegu). He makes these statements at 1:39:40 time stamp in the video of the conference.\n\nReportedly, the state government is in the habit of distributing gifts during festivals. The Telangana government had distributed gifts to around two lakh Christians from impoverished backgrounds in 2017 and hosted Christmas dinners. The administration started this tradition back in 2015. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi government headed by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had distributed colourful sarees in 2019 to women below the poverty line as a gift for Bathukamma, a folk festival celebrated in the rural areas of the state coinciding with Dushera festivities.
