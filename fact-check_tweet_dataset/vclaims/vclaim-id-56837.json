Brian Kemp posing with Gregory McMichael, who has been charged along with his son for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nThe photo shows Kemp posing with James Stachowiak, whom the Council on American-Islamic Relations called a \u201cviolent anti-Muslim extremist.\u201d\n\nGregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael were recently charged with murder and aggravated assault for the February shooting death of Arbery, an unarmed young black man, in Brunswick, Georgia. The charges came after footage of the shooting circulated on social media, prompting a national outcry for action on the case.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features an image of the governor posing with a man wearing an \u201cAllah is not God\u201d shirt, attempts to link Kemp to the elder McMichael.\n\n\u201cAhmaud Arbery\u2019s Killer Gregory McMichael sling (sic) side GA\u2019s Governor Brian Kemp,\u201d the caption partly reads. \u201cKemp says he wants to bring justice to Ahmaud\u2019s family \u2026 yeah okay!\u201d (RELATED: Were These Trees Cut Down To \u2018Make Way For 5G\u2019?)\n\nBut the man pictured with the governor is not McMichael. When the photo of the man is compared to McMichael\u2019s publicly available mugshot, that fact becomes clear.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation ran a reverse image search and found the photo in a 2018 article from local Georgia outlet WXIA. The article, titled \u201cKemp distances himself from \u2018extremist\u2019 supporter wearing \u2018Allah is not God\u2019 shirt,\u201d identifies the man as Stachowiak.\n\nKemp faced criticism for the photo after it surfaced during his gubernatorial campaign in 2018. He denied knowing Stachowiak, saying to reporters, \u201cOn these bus tours you can see (supporters) take hundreds of pictures you know \u2013 sometimes a day \u2014 and I certainly don\u2019t agree with his extreme views,\u201d according to WXIA.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
