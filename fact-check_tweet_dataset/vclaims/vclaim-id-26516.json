{"title": "How energy intensive is a Google search?", "subtitle": "It\u2019s really hard to say exactly how energy intensive a Google search is, but a recent Sunday Times article overestimated the figure.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26516", "url": "https://fullfact.org/environment/google-search/", "vclaim": "Sunday Times columnist Rod Liddle claimed that a single Google search uses enough energy to power a low-energy lightbulb for an hour.\n\nThis looks like an overestimate. We don\u2019t know exactly where Mr Liddle\u2019s claim originates from, but back in 2009 the Sunday Times ran a similar story overstating the energy consumption of a typical Google search.\n\nLow-energy LED lightbulbs vary in power requirements but a low-energy replacement for an old fashioned 60W bulb will require about 10 watts. That means it will use 10 watt-hours (Wh) of energy each hour.\n\nBy comparison, in 2009 Google estimated that a typical search required 0.3 Wh of energy. We don\u2019t have any more recent data on this, and Google told us that since then it has made its data centres more energy efficient.\n\nWe also spoke to Yannick Oswald, a PhD researcher in energy footprints at the University of Leeds who told us that if the energy consumption of a Google search has changed since 2009, it\u2019s most likely to have decreased due to improvements in energy efficiency.\n\nNevertheless, even using Google\u2019s 2009 estimate of a search requiring 0.3 Wh, Mr Liddle\u2019s estimate is far too high. The energy required to power a Google search could power a 10 watt bulb for around 108 seconds, not an hour. That\u2019s 33 times less energy than Mr Liddle\u2019s estimate.\n\nThe energy needed to conduct a Google search can vary considerably. It depends on factors including the local efficiency of the internet, efficiency of electricity infrastructure and the distance and time it takes for signals to travel.\n\nSo that (old) 0.3Wh estimate masks the possibility that some Google searches may have required more energy to process.\n\nAlso that figure doesn\u2019t take into account the base energy consumption of your computer or smartphone, or the energy consumption required to make your device and build the necessary digital infrastructure.\n\nSimilarly, the energy consumption of a low energy lightbulb as calculated above doesn\u2019t take into account the base energy required to produce the lightbulb itself or any of the infrastructure required to power it.\n\nMr Liddle was making a point about the link between using Google and climate change.\n\nSo it\u2019s also worth noting that Google matches the energy it uses in its data centres and offices by purchasing an equivalent amount of renewable energy to achieve what they describe as \u201cnet zero operational carbon emissions\u201d.\n\nHowever this doesn\u2019t account for any energy that is consumed by personal computers or devices doing searches.\n\nFull disclosure: Full Fact has received funding from Google and Google.org, Google\u2019s charitable foundation.
