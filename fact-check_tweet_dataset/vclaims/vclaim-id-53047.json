The petition also received coverage in Kent Online.\n\nChange.org confirmed to us that this was a real petition, started by one of their users, which has since been taken down from the site. They explained that: \u201cWe received multiple user complaints about it and when we assessed it we found it to be in breach of our Community Guidelines and so it was removed.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve seen no evidence that the petition was connected to the official Black Lives Matter group in the UK, but we\u2019ve asked them to confirm. Their Twitter account has never mentioned it, and it is not one of the petitions it has asked followers to sign.\n\nThe petition also sparked several counter-petitions in response, which are still online.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as true because the image is of a real petition started on change.org, however it has since been removed and does not seem to be connected to the official Black Lives Matter group in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
