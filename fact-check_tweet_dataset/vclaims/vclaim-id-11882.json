Page, special counsel to the FBI deputy director, also was assigned to the Clinton investigation, which closed in early July 2016 without any charges being filed.\n\nThat same month, the FBI opened an investigation into reports that Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers. Strzok was assigned to lead the Russia probe, and Page was assigned to serve as the deputy director\u2019s liaison to the new investigation, according to the IG\u2019s office.\n\nAfter the election, the Justice Department announced on May 17, 2017, that former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III would serve as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Strzok and Page were soon assigned to the special counsel\u2019s office. Page joined the team on May 28, 2017, and Strzok, who was promoted to deputy assistant director of the espionage section in September 2016, was assigned to the special counsel\u2019s office in early June 2017, according to the IG\u2019s office.\n\nBut neither lasted long in the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nStrzok was taken off the Russia investigation in late July of that year after the IG informed the special counsel\u2019s office that Strzok and Page exchanged text messages that expressed \u201chostility\u201d toward Trump during the 2016 presidential election, as the inspector general\u2019s office would later characterize some of the texts in the June report.\n\nPage\u2019s assignment at the special counsel\u2019s office also ended after less than two months, on July 15, 2017, according to the IG report.\n\nSince learning that Strzok and Page exchanged anti-Trump text messages while assigned to investigate Clinton, the president has accused both of bias in their handling of the Clinton and Russian investigations. In its June report, the inspector general\u2019s office said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the text messages sent by Strzok and Page, but the report found no evidence that their personal views influenced decisions that were made in the Clinton email investigation, as we have previously written.\n\nThe IG\u2019s office issued a second report on Dec. 13 on its text message recovery efforts and findings, prompting Trump to renew his attack on Strzok and Page in a series of false tweets over several days.\n\nOn Dec. 15, Trump tweeted that \u201c19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S \u2026 were just reported as being wiped clean and gone.\u201d\n\nThe 19,000 text messages are not \u201cgone.\u201d To the contrary, the Dec. 13 report \u2014 and the previous one on June 14 \u2014 both said that the IG used forensic tools to recover about 20,000 missing text messages from Dec. 15, 2016, through May 17, 2017.\n\nThe Dec. 13 report expanded on the methods used by the inspector general\u2019s office to recover the previously missing text messages, but repeated that about 20,000 text messages were recovered and that many of those were duplicates.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our emails about Trump\u2019s tweets about the 19,000 text messages being \u201cgone.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 18, the president also falsely tweeted that the 19,000 text messages \u201cwere purposely & illegally deleted\u201d \u2014 claiming that they \u201cwould have explained whole Hoax,\u201d referring to the Russia investigation.\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, made a similar remark \u2014 claiming the 19,000 text messages were \u201cdestroyed.\u201d\n\nThe IG reports contain no evidence that text messages \u201cwere purposely & illegally deleted\u201d or \u201cdestroyed.\u201d Instead, the IG found that there was a compatibility issue between the FBI-issued Samsung S5 phones and a text message collection tool that should have preserved the text messages from December 2016 to May 2017.\n\nThe June report said \u201ca large number of FBI employees\u201d were affected by the failure of the text message collection tool and the loss of data did not result \u201cfrom the actions of any FBI employee, including Strzok.\u201d\n\nThe December report went into more detail about the IG\u2019s use of forensic recovery methods and its findings.\n\nThe report said the FBI switched in early 2017 from Samsung S5 to Samsung S7 and S9 phones partly to \u201caddress issues with the FBI\u2019s text message collection tool.\u201d Page received an FBI-issued Samsung S7 on May 18, 2017, to replace her Samsung S5. Strzok received his new Samsung S7 on July 5, 2017.\n\nThe IG report also said that missing text messages were found \u201cwhere they are typically located through the use of forensic extraction tools\u201d but also in a database identified as \u201centerprise.db.\u201d The IG\u2019s office compared the content of the text messages found in enterprise.db to text messages captured by the collection tool, but found \u201cno discernible patterns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is, the OIG found that the content of the text messages did not appear to be a factor in whether they were found in only one of the enterprise.db database or the messages saved by the collection tool; the messages included some political content, some work-related content, and some personal content,\u201d the new report said.\n\nThe IG\u2019s office asked the contractor hired to recover missing data to review the text messages found in enterprise.db to determine why some were copied to that location. \u201c[T]he contractor informed the OIG that it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI\u2019s text message collection capabilities, and the OIG found no evidence that they did,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe new IG report also said that Strzok and Page received iPhones from the Department of Justice after they were assigned to the special counsel\u2019s office in the spring of 2017.\n\nNo data could be recovered from the iPhones, because the DOJ reset the phones to factory settings after Page and Strzok left the special counsel\u2019s office. Both FBI employees had the iPhones for less than two months, and they continued to use their FBI-issued phones while working in the special counsel\u2019s office, according to the report.\n\nBreitbart, a conservative website, said the special counsel\u2019s office \u201cscrubbed\u201d Strzok\u2019s iPhone before giving it to the IG\u2019s office, but there is no evidence in the IG report of any wrongdoing. The report notes that the DOJ \u201croutinely resets mobile devices to factory settings when the device is returned\u201d by an employee.", "lang": "en"}
