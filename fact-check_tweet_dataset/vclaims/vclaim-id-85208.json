They found that there are more than 13,000 non-abortion-providing federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, compared to 665 Planned Parenthood locations. Readers may have seen this map circulating online:\n\nThe numbers alone are close to accurate. There are about 650 Planned Parenthood health centers. There are more than 9,800 health center delivery sites in the federal Health Center Program and about 4,100 in the Rural Health Clinic program. Under these programs, outpatient primary care clinics get reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for helping medically underserved populations.\n\nRyan uses the term \u201cfederal community health centers,\u201d which is used interchangeably with federally qualified health centers in the political debate over Planned Parenthood funding. Medicaid is a major source of revenue for both Planned Parenthood clinics and federally qualified health centers. So legislation to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood focuses on pulling Medicaid funding and other federal grants from Planned Parenthood and redirecting them to federally qualified health centers.\n\nFederally qualified health centers are required to provide care to everyone, regardless of whether they can pay, and offer sliding-scale fees based on the patient\u2019s ability to pay. These health centers serve a larger and more diverse patient population than Planned Parenthood because they offer more comprehensive services (primary, dental, behavioral health).\n\n\u201cWhile many RHCs [rural health clinics] have a sliding fee scale and see patients regardless of financial implications, some RHCs would not see patients if the patient was uninsured or low income due to financial constraints,\u201d said Nathan Baugh, government affairs director for the National Association of Rural Health Clinics.\n\nBut it would cause some immediate disruptions in patients\u2019 access to family planning services at least in the first year, CBO found. It estimated that somewhere between 5 to 25 percent of patients served by Planned Parenthood would face reduced access to care. But this analysis did not include whether rural health clinics could fill that gap.\n\nCBO warned that unless required under new legislation, federally qualified health centers would not necessarily use new federal funds to pay for family planning services. These health centers could allocate increased funding to a variety of primary and preventive care services, rather than specifically for family planning services that Medicaid beneficiaries would otherwise have gotten from Planned Parenthood.\n\nRyan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said increasing funding for federally qualified health centers by as much as $500 million \u201cwould undoubtedly assist in ensuring a smooth transition. We\u2019ll look to provide resources again with a president who\u2019ll sign it into law.\u201d Previous legislation was written so that if the organization stops participating in abortion services, it would be eligible again to receive Medicaid funding, Strong said.\n\nRyan said redirecting federal funding from Planned Parenthood to \u201ccommunity health centers\u201d would allow the centers to provide the same types of services without the controversy surrounding abortion. He was referring to a network of nearly 14,000 outpatient clinics that receive Medicaid funding but don\u2019t do abortions, and said there are 20 such clinics for each Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\nRyan is referring to federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, which are both outpatient primary care health providers for underserved populations. He is correct that these centers, combined, are vastly bigger in network than Planned Parenthood and \u201cprovide these kinds of services\u201d that Planned Parenthood does (i.e., cancer screening, STD/STI screening and treatment, contraceptive services, pregnancy tests and prenatal services).\n\nBut a key caveat is that rural health clinics \u2014 which account for about a third of the network that Ryan is referring to \u2014 are not required to provide family planning services and do not have to serve low-income patients. And federally qualified health centers provide a broader range of services and fewer contraceptive services than Planned Parenthood does. The Congressional Budget Office has warned there would be an immediate disruption of services if Congress pulls Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood and instead increases funding to federally qualified health centers.", "lang": "en"}
