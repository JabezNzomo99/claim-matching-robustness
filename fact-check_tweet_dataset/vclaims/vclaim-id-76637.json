It was simply \"password.\"\n\n\"What happened was John Podesta gave his password to a hacker. And guess what his password was. 'Password,' \" said Fox News' Jesse Watters on Jan. 4. \"It\u2019s a true story. His password was \u2018password.\u2019 \"\n\nThat\u2019d be funny, if it were true. The thing is, there\u2019s no material evidence to support the claim that Podesta violated a very basic tenet of Internet safety.\n\nThe first person to say that Podesta\u2019s email password was \"password\" was Julian Assange, whose website WikiLeaks published the emails stolen from Podesta.\n\n\"We published several Podesta emails, which show Podesta responding to a phishing email,\" Assange said on Fox Jan. 3. \"Now, how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word \u2018password.\u2019 \"\n\n\"So this is something a 14-year-old kid could have hacked,\" Assange added.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where Assange\u2019s claim comes from. None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta\u2019s email password. And of the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta\u2019s and others\u2019 accounts, none have made similar claims.\n\nFurther, Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn\u2019t allow users to make their passwords \"password.\"\n\nGo try for yourself. We did:\n\nPerhaps Assange is thinking of a February 2015 email in the WikiLeaks dump. In that email, a staffer tells Podesta that his Windows 8 login on what appears to be a new work computer is username: jpodesta and password: [email protected]\n\nInterestingly, in another email sent in May 2015, the same staffer tells Podesta his Apple ID password: Runner4567.\n\nSo we have two of Podesta\u2019s passwords, but neither are for his email account.\n\nIn fairness to Assange, Watters and others pushing the email password claim: Both of these passwords are far too simple to be effective. So it\u2019s possible Podesta similarly made his email password overly simplistic.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know that for sure, and we surely don\u2019t know if his email password was just \"password.\"\n\nPro tip: If you don\u2019t want to end up like Podesta, check out this guide to protecting yourself online, written by cyber crime expert Marc Goodman.\n\nThere is no material evidence to back up this claim. Google doesn\u2019t even allow Gmail users to make their password \"password.\"\n\nWe know from the stolen Podesta emails published on WikiLeaks that he used a Windows 8 login that had the password \"[email protected]\" But that\u2019s not for his email account.", "lang": "en"}
