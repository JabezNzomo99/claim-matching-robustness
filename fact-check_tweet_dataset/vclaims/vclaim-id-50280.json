It has been misleadingly altered; according to photo evidence, the pope only kissed the child.\n\nThe edited image -- which appears here and here on Reddit -- has been circulating since at least 2018.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the original 2013 Associated Press photograph, which was published in The Washington Post. The photo, which showed Francis\u2019 first papal audience on March 27 of that year, can also be found in the AP\u2019s archives.\n\nAn AFP photo showing the same moment also makes clear that the pontiff was kissing, not licking, the baby.\n\nIn addition to appearing on Reddit, a Spanish-language post on Facebook featuring the image has been shared more than 2,000 times.", "lang": "en"}
