It has been shared over 45,000 times.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen no evidence that the attack was politically motivated.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the man in question, named Joshua Adams-Mitchell, was a serving member of the British armed forces. It\u2019s also correct that he was \u201cknocked down by a blue Mercedes and seriously injured\u201d outside a nightclub in Batley, West Yorkshire in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day 2019, according to a police statement.\n\nThe police statement also said that the incident followed \u201can altercation inside the club with a group of males which then proceeded outside the premises\u201d.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Mr Adams-Mitchell was targeted because he was a member of the armed forces. In a West Yorkshire Police statement from January 2019, the Kirklees District Commander, Chief Superintendent Julie Sykes said \u201cthis incident is not believed to be racially motivated and there is no evidence to support the victim was targeted due to his service in the army\u201d.\n\nMr Adams-Mitchell\u2019s attacker, Hamza Ali Hussain, was sentenced in May 2019 to eight years in prison for section 18 wounding (wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm).\n\nAccording to reports, during Mr Hussain\u2019s sentencing, the judge said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of any dispute you had with Mr Adams-Mitchell, in particular I do not find any political motivation, on the evidence, to have struck him with your car\u2026 You missed your intended victim and struck the unfortunate Mr Adams-Mitchell instead.\u201d\n\nRumours that Mr Adams-Mitchell was attacked because he was a member of the armed forces began shortly after the incident, in early January of this year. The British far-right activist Tommy Robinson shared unproven allegations at the time that Mr Adams-Mitchell was \u201cset upon\u201d by 15 Muslim males who called him scum, before one of the fifteen hit Mr Adams-Mitchell with a car.", "lang": "en"}
