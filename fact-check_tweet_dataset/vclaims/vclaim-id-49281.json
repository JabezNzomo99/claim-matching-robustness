The claim originated on the satire website America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.\n\nThe internet is replete with misinformation about Soros. In recent months, Check Your Fact has debunked numerous claims about him, including those that falsely allege he pays protesters and owns the voting technology firm Smartmatic.\n\nIn this case, an article published by USAvotefortrump.com alleges that Soros has been arrested for \u201ccrimes against America.\u201d The purported charges include that he \u201cwillfully compromised the safety of US citizens,\u201d as well as \u201cconspiracy and cyber terrorism.\u201d It claims that President Donald Trump signed the arrest warrant.\n\nBut there is no truth to the article\u2019s claim. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate the charges nor the arrest. The article fails to link to any credible sources, at one point citing the \u201cWhite House Office of Information and Propaganda,\u201d an office that doesn\u2019t exist. (RELATED: Viral Image Attempts To Spread False Claims About George Soros)\n\nThe story appears to lift word-for-word from the satire website America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which shared a link of its story, titled \u201cSoros Taken Into Custody for Crimes Against America,\u201d on Facebook June 29. While America\u2019s Last Line of Defense makes the satirical nature of its content clear, USAvotefortrump.com fails to do so, giving the impression that it is genuine news.\n\nThe reposting of parody news stories without clearly identifying that the content is satirical is a common way misinformation spreads online.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
