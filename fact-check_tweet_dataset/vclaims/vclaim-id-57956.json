Johnson visited the school and spoke to news media about changes to face mask guidelines in schools around the country as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn September 2020, images of the interview went viral, and appeared to show an arrangement of letters on a school wall behind Johnson as he spoke to cameras. The letters, visible above his left shoulder under the \u201cPeriodic Table of Maths,\u201d spelled out the words, \u201cFuck Boris.\u201d\n\nSnopes readers asked us if the image was photoshopped. We learned that it was. To determine this, we found the original interview from numerous media outlets, and compared the visible backgrounds to the above image.\n\nU.K.-based newspaper The Independent shared a version of the interview from a slightly wider angle as the photoshopped image. Above Johnson\u2019s left shoulder, the mathematical elements read out \u201cSe,\u201d \u201cRf,\u201d \u201cPe,\u201d and \u201cDp.\u201d British television outlet Sky News also tweeted a version of the interview shot at a similar angle:\n\nFrom this angle, \u201cSi,\u201d \u201cTa,\u201d \u201cr,\u201d and \u201cSe\u201d were visible above Johnson\u2019s shoulder. None of these angles showed any letters that spelled out \u201cFuck Boris.\u201d\n\nBut internet users still found things to poke fun at in the unedited video. Some users circled a section of the background that spelled out \u201carse\u201d by removing the \u201cT\u201d in the \u201cTa\u201d element:\n\nDuring the interview, Johnson said that wearing face masks inside a classroom was \u201cnonsensical,\u201d and that in keeping with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, they should be worn in schools that were COVID-19 \u201chotspots,\u201d but only in \u201cconfined areas outside the classroom,\u201d like corridors. He added that teachers can\u2019t teach with face coverings, and one couldn\u2019t expect students to learn with their faces covered either.\n\n(We should note that the same school Johnson visited in August had a staff member test positive for COVID-19 in early September).\n\nBeginning on Sept. 1, 2020, the U.K. government mandated that face coverings be required in communal areas and corridors of secondary schools in parts of England that are under lockdown. Teachers in all other secondary schools could make the decision themselves on whether to enforce face masks.\n\nBased on original footage from news outlets that confirmed the background was indeed photoshopped, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
