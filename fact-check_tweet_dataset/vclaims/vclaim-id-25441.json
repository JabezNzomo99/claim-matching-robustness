The other 10 candidates who qualified for the debates will appear Wednesday on the same stage. Our reporters followed all of the exchanges, fact-checking the candidates and providing context and explanation for the policy debates. The timelines of climate change are more complex than two candidates described. \u201cI listen to scientists on this, and they are very clear. We don\u2019t have more than 10 years to get this right.\u201d \u201cScience tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.\u201d\n\nBoth statements are misleading. Both Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a former member of Congress from Texas, and Mr. Buttigieg are referring to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that finds countries have about a dozen years to keep the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. At that point, the planet will face severe effects, including worsened droughts, floods and heat waves. And because most scenarios for curbing warming require halving worldwide emissions by 2030, that means countries must take serious action now. But to claim that there are 12 or just 10 years until the point of no return goes beyond what the report itself says. Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s record on gun control is more complicated than he let on. \u201cBack in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election.\u201d This is misleading. Mr. Sanders suggested he had a long history of fighting the National Rifle Association, the gun industry\u2019s powerful lobbying association. Mr. Sanders noted that he has a \u201cD-minus voting record from the N.R.A., and as president, I suspect it will be an F record,\u201d citing his failed bid for the House in 1988 as evidence. He vowed that as president, he would \u201cdo everything I can\u201d to take on the N.R.A.\n\nBut in portraying himself as a longtime foe of the gun industry, Mr. Sanders left out parts of his record as a lawmaker defending gun rights in a rural hunting state. In 1993, Mr. Sanders, then a representative, voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks and imposed a five-day waiting period for gun buyers. In 2005, while still in the House, Mr. Sanders voted in favor of a measure to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits arising from the criminal use of their products. In 2012, after a mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., he suggested the federal government should steer clear of gun control, saying, \u201cIn my view, decisions about gun control should be made as close to home as possible \u2014 at the state level.\u201d But Mr. Sanders voted in favor of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which passed as part of a broad package of crime legislation. Democrats are all in agreement that climate change is a crisis, but they quarreled over how to address it. \u201cI think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem. It\u2019s a distraction.\u201d The candidates agreed on the urgency of addressing climate change but debated whether the Green New Deal provided the right solution. At this point, the Green New Deal is a nonbinding congressional resolution that outlines an ambitious plan for tackling climate change. It also calls for a federal jobs guarantee, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security for every American, as well as for significant reductions in planet-warming emissions by 2030. Mr. Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado who has been critical of the plan, called the job guarantee \u201ca distraction.\u201d Others who have embraced it, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that criticism ignores an opportunity to create jobs in the renewable energy markets. Marianne Williamson said that the Flint water crisis was rooted in racism, earning some of the loudest applause of the debate. \u201cWhat happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.\u201d\n\nIf Flint, Mich., were rich, would the government have responded differently to the crisis of lead-polluted water? That\u2019s something The New York Times has explored in depth. One thing is clear: The crisis was a failure of government at all levels, from the state-appointed emergency manager who switched the city\u2019s drinking water source from Detroit\u2019s municipal water system to the Flint River in an effort to save money to the health agencies that assured residents the water was safe even as people complained that it smelled bad, tasted funny and was discolored. Two years later, a task force appointed by the governor at the time found race and poverty also played a role. \u201cFlint residents, who are majority black or African-American and among the most impoverished of any metropolitan area in the United States, did not enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards as that provided to other communities,\u201d the report said. Mr. Hickenlooper suggested universal health care would not play well with moderate voters. \u201cLast year, Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the House, and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage.\u201d This is exaggerated. Mr. Hickenlooper was referring to Medicare for All, the progressive plan for universal health care. Many of the seats Democrats flipped in taking control of the House in 2018 were in swing districts, or districts carried by President Trump; most of the freshmen who won those seats are centrists and do not support \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But at least two of them \u2014 Representatives Katie Porter and Katie Hill of California \u2014 do, and they campaigned on it. Both signed onto Medicare for All legislation in the House. In 2017, Ms. Porter said on Twitter: \u201cI believe in universal coverage, and I support Medicare for All.\u201d Ms. Hill\u2019s campaign posted a video on Facebook explaining her reasoning for backing Medicare for all, describing how she and her husband, Kenny, faced $200,000 in medical expenses early in their marriage. \u201cEnsuring progress on health care is one of the top priorities for me as the issue hits extremely close to home, and we have to do whatever it takes to get us to Medicare for all as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut other Democrats were more cautious. Mr. O\u2019Rourke called for a new voting rights act and legislation to address health and educational disparities, and said he would sign onto a House bill that would create a commission to study the issue of reparations. Mr. Sanders, who opposes cash payments, said he would focus on \u201crebuilding distressed communities,\u201d including tripling federal aid to schools in poor neighborhoods. Ms. Warren said that as part of her plan to \u201cclose the black-white wealth gap in America,\u201d she would allocate $50 billion to historically black colleges and universities. Mr. Sanders blamed trade policy, apparently referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, for Detroit\u2019s decline. \u201cDetroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low wage countries.\u201d This is exaggerated. Nafta, which went in effect in 1994, is often blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs in the Midwest, but Detroit\u2019s struggles started well before that as global competition increased. Auto jobs started scattering during the energy crisis of the 1970s and the economic downturn of the 1980s. Moreover, jobs in Detroit were also lost to competition in the union-averse South, where many carmakers seeking cheaper labor relocated operations. Ms. Warren said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade deals were not about helping American workers but were actually about helping big companies. \u201cAnyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. Look at the Nafta 2.0. What\u2019s the central feature? It\u2019s to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly true. While the drug provisions are not the core element of the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (Nafta 2.0), it is a controversial provision that continues to hold up ratification of the trade pact. As The Times reported in March, the agreement gives biologic drugmakers 10 years of protections against other products that would rely on the data they used to win approval. That 10-year provision would raise the timeline in Canada, where the industry currently has eight years of protection, and in Mexico, where it technically has none. It would not change current policy in the United States, where the standard is already 12 years.\n\nMr. Hickenlooper falsely said that Colorado had the strongest economy in the United States when he was governor. \u201cI learned the small-business lessons of how to provide service and team work and became a top mayor, and as governor of Colorado, created the No. 1 economy in the country.\u201d This is false. According to the latest federal government data, at the end of Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s last term as governor, in 2018, Colorado\u2019s economy ranked seventh in the country when measured by real gross domestic product growth. Measured on a per person basis, the state\u2019s real G.D.P. growth was ranked 15th.
