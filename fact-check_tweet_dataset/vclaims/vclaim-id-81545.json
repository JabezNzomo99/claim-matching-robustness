Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Guidelines for reopening the schools in Telangana for the Academic year 2020-21. Fact: The Telangana government has not issued any such guidelines for reopening the schools. In the order released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, it can be read that a decision on the re-opening of educational institutions will be taken in the month of July 2020. Also, the officials have clarified to \u2018Times of India\u2019 that they have not issued any such guidelines. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the guidelines mentioned in the post, no information was found about the Telangana government releasing such guidelines. In the recent order issued by the Telangana government regarding the extension of the lockdown till 30 June 2020, there is no mention of educational institutions or any other guidelines meant for them. In the order released by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 30 May 2020, it can be read that a decision on the re-opening of educational institutions will be taken in the month of July 2020.\n\nAlso, the officials have clarified to \u2018Times of India\u2019 that they have not issued any such guidelines. \u2018PIB in Telangana\u2019 has also tweeted the \u2018Times of India\u2019 tweet.\n\nTo sum it up, these guidelines for reopening the schools were not issued by the Telangana Government.\n\nUpdate (JUNE 02, 2020):\n\nAs the false guidelines for reopening the schools in Telangana went viral, Chitra Ramachandran, Spl. Chief Secretary of Higher Education clarified that no such guidelines about the reopening of schools in Telangana have been issued, and termed the message in circulation as fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
