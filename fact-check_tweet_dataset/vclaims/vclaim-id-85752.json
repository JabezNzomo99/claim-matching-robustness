She actually was the third, after Susan Estrich (Mike Dukakis, 1988) and Donna Brazile (Al Gore, 2000), but she was the first to win.\n\nFirst of all, we should note that the White House referred queries about Lara Trump to the Trump campaign. A request for comment was ignored.\n\nAn RNC official, meanwhile, said that the organization was not trying to imply that Trump had a better record than all previous administrations. \u201cWe purposely did not say \u2018any other administration\u2019 because we know that\u2019s not true,\u201d the official said.\n\nTrump, of course, replaced John Kelly at Homeland Security with Kirstjen Nielsen, so now he has a total of five women with Cabinet rank. That still lags both Obama and Bill Clinton (Seven with Cabinet rank in his first term) but Trump places third overall, ahead of any other president, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nBut just because the person at the top is female, it may not mean the rest of the team is. The Washington Post appointment tracker shows only one Education appointee, Secretary Betsy DeVos, is female, while the nine other Senate nominees at Education are male. That\u2019s 10 percent, vs. 50 percent female appointments at Education under Obama.\n\nUnder no metric has Trump appointed more women than any previous president. In fact, he currently lags behind Obama and Clinton and possibly George W. Bush in terms of the percentage of female appointments. As we noted, the RNC tweet could have been better worded, especially since RNC officials concede this point. Trump may be better than other presidents, but not recent presidents.", "lang": "en"}
