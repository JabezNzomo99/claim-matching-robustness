In the midst of these measures, rumours about a vast global conspiracy are being shared on Facebook.\n\nAAP FactCheck found two Facebook posts implicating Hollywood identities Tom Hanks, Oprah Winfrey and Harvey Weinstein in the conspiracy. The posts, while containing minor differences, make the same claims.\n\nA March 16 post claims Canadian prime minster Justin Trudeau \u201cwas served a criminal indictment by the U.S. for corporate and financial crimes,\u201d and that actor Hanks was \u201carrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia\u201d.\n\nA March 15 post says Italy has shutdown airports \u201cas over 80 Vatican and financial officials have been served same [sic] criminal indictments\u201d and that \u201cconvicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities\u201d.\n\nBoth posts then claim \u201cCEOs of some major world corporations have been indicted/arrested and some forced to resign all in the last 30-60 days\u201d and that the \u201cLab-created Corona Virus is a cover up for mass mandatory vaccination agenda\u201d.\n\nThe final three paragraphs of both posts claim that \u201cTrump will win 2020 elections\u201d, \u201cSome top religious leaders will be arrested or forced to resign\u201d, and \u201cH5N1 bird flu will be intentionally released this week out of China\u201d.\n\nThe two Facebook posts have collectively been viewed more than 400,000 times, shared over 1,400 times and have received over 700 likes.\n\nCOVID-19 has caused major losses on global stock markets and forced entire countries into quarantine. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a press conference on March 18 that the ongoing crisis will last for \u201cat least six months\u201d.\n\nAs the crisis goes on, Facebook posts sharing false information and conspiracy theories, like the March 15 and 16 Facebook posts, are being shared widely.\n\nThe March 15 post, from an Australian user, claims: \u201cThis morning, at 4:30AM, our Prime Minister was served a criminal indictment by the US for corporate & financial crimes\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has not been served a criminal indictment by criminal prosecutors in the United States. Since March 15 Prime Minister Morrison has appeared at press conferences and given interviews on Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus.\n\nThe March 16 post from a user from New Zealand, based in the US, makes the same claim about another head of state: \u201cThis morning at 4:30 a.m., Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was served a criminal indictment by the U.S. for corporate and financial crimes\u201d.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not been arrested. On March 16 he held a press conference outlining Canada\u2019s ongoing response to COVID-19. Trudeau was photographed giving the address in front of his Ottawa residence, where he has been self isolating after his wife tested positive for the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe March 15 post goes on to say that \u201cTom Hanks was arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia refusing to fly back to USA.\u201d\n\nTom Hanks was not arrested for pedophilia on March 14, or at any other time. On March 12 the actor posted a message on Twitter telling his fans that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. The couple were released from a Gold Coast hospital on March 17, but remain in self isolation as they wait to be cleared of the potentially deadly virus, according to their son Chet Hanks.\n\nBoth posts then claim \u201cItaly\u2019s airports have been completely shut down as over 80 of Vatican and financial officials have been served same criminal indictments for financial crime, pedophilia, child trafficking and sex abuse.\u201d\n\nSeveral major airports remain open in Italy, according to the Australian Smart Traveller website. Milan\u2019s airport (Milano Malpensa) was listing planes inbound as of March 20. Some regional airports, however, suspended flights in accordance with a ministerial decree \u2014 including the Toscana Aeroporti in Florence.\n\nAAP FactCheck found no evidence to support the claim of Vatican officials arrested. Any such news in the closely watched internationally recognised independent city-state, which maintains its own criminal justice system separate from Italy, would be widely reported.\n\nBoth posts then state: \u201cConvicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities\u2026 Instead of a 55-year sentence, he only received a 23-year sentence.\u201d\n\nMr Weinstein\u2019s trial and conviction was a closely reported legal event and AAP FactCheck found nothing to support the claim of a supposed deal. Mr Weinstein was found guilty of sexual assault and rape in February and in March was sentenced to 23 years in prison by the New York State Supreme Court. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office recommended a maximum sentence of 29 years for the convictions. The Los Angeles District Attorney charged Weinstein with another four charges, he is yet to face court over the allegations.\n\nThe posts also say Weinstein\u2019s alleged plea deal included testimony against Oprah Winfrey among other famous figures. TV host Winfrey addressed the rumour and videos purporting to show her arrest in a Twitter post: \u201cIt\u2019s NOT TRUE. Haven\u2019t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world\u201d.\n\nThe post then goes on to say: \u201cThe lab-created Corona virus was a cover-up for the mass mandatory vaccination agenda.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims that that Covid-19 was created in a lab. Regarding the unsupported claim that the \u201cCorona virus\u201d is a \u201ccover-up for the mass mandatory vaccination agenda\u201d, there is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, nor any mass vaccination effort. While trials are underway there is not expected to be a vaccine for 12 to 18 months.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook posts to be false. The claim that Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau has been arrested is false and also appears to be made in relation to Australia\u2019s prime minister \u2013 also falsely. Hollywood\u2019s Tom Hanks has not been arrested. There is no evidence to support the claim that Harvey Weinstein made a special deal with prosecutors in exchange for testimony against famous figures including Oprah Winfrey. Oprah Winfrey herself has debunked claims of her arrest. There is no evidence of a mass arrest of Vatican officials and while most of Italy\u2019s airports have been shut down, some are still operating. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.
