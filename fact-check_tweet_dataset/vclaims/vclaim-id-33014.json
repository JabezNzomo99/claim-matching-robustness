Devin Nunes, R-Calif., posted an apparently fake tweet attributed to one of the platform\u2019s most prolific users, President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has tweeted outlandish or inscrutable comments in the past, perhaps prompting some to question whether he authored the above tweet (we\u2019ve cropped out the user\u2019s name for privacy purposes).\n\n \n\n It is not true.
