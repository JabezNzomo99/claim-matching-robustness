President. Ever.\" This cover you", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-75153", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/dec/20/blog-posting/no-time-magazine-cover-does-not-call-trump-worst-p/", "vclaim": "There is no Time magazine cover featuring President Donald Trump with the text \"Worst. President. Ever.\" This cover you may have seen going around Facebook isn't real.\n\nThe fake cover has a close-up portrait of Trump, with the special effect of his profile morphing into a skull. Below the magazine\u2019s iconic red logo are large white letters that say \"Worst. President. Ever.\" The subhead says: \"How DONALD TRUMP\" has disgraced the highest office in the nation,\" with more name-calling thrown in.\n\nTime has featured Trump on its cover several times before and after his presidential victory. But there is no record of this cover in Time\u2019s vault.\n\nAs our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted, the fake cover has been circulating on social media since at least November 2017. The \"worst\" president cover has a fabricated twin with a counter message about Trump: \"Best. President. Ever.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the weekly magazine published an online post about Trump\u2019s many cover stories.\n\n\"Since launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has appeared on more than a dozen TIME magazine covers,\" Time\u2019s post said. \"He has been depicted in multiple stages of meltdown, standing beside his election opponent and an unstable Washington monument, speaking behind a podium on the campaign trail and at his inauguration.\"\n\nTime has featured Trump on its covers in unflattering ways. But he hasn\u2019t been on a cover with the text \"Worst. President. Ever.\" That\u2019s a made-up claim making the rounds on Facebook.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
