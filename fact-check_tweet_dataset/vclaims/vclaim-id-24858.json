That\u2019s 7.3% of all of the department\u2019s budget for day-to-day operations that year.\n\nThat\u2019s a record amount of spending in cash terms (if you don\u2019t account for inflation over time), but not if you do account for inflation or look at it as a proportion of total Department of Health and Social Care spending.\n\nLooked at in real terms, more was spent on purchasing services from private providers in both 2015/16 and 2016/17\u2014around \u00a39.4 billion in each year.\n\nA larger proportion of the department\u2019s budget was also spent on private providers in those two years\u20147.7% compared to 7.3% in 2018/19.\n\n\n\nThe amount of money spent by the NHS on services from private providers is a controversial topic and we\u2019ve written before about the trends in spending on private providers across the NHS.\n\nAs we said back in 2017, research from the health think tank the King\u2019s Fund found that the use of private providers varies across the NHS.\n\nThe Health Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) say \u201cWhile the NHS has always purchased some services from the private sector, the role of the private sector in providing routine community, diagnostics and elective (non-emergency) care was formalised and expanded in the 2000s, and now accounts for a significant share of public spending on health in England.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
