They have an absolute right, Howie. And so the president of the country has the right to do this.\u201d\n\nThe short answer here is: Trump is correct that the president has broad powers to deny admission of people or groups into the United States. But the power has not been tested in the way that Trump proposes, and how we got there is a fascinating story of changes in attitudes toward various groups of foreigners throughout American history. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nIf Trump is elected president and follows through with an immigration ban on Muslims (or any other group of people, for that matter), he can do so by asserting powers under the United States Code and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which is the nation\u2019s main immigration act.\n\nUnder Title 8, Section 1182 of the U.S. Code, the president has authority to use a proclamation to suspend the entry of \u201cany aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States [who] would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d for however long he deems necessary. This provision was included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n\nSuch presidential proclamations already exist, and they were made out of foreign policy or national security concerns. For example, President Obama issued a presidential proclamation in 2011 suspending the entry of \u201cany alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted, committed or otherwise participated in\u201d war crimes or other violations of humanitarian law. That means the State Department has authority to block someone from getting a visa if they are found ineligible under that criteria.\n\nWhile Trump has focused on Muslims, it was a fear of communists that drove Congress to give this power to the president over six decades ago. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 \u2014 and in a lengthy veto statement, he cited concerns about broad powers being granted to the executive branch, even to \u201cminor immigration and consular officials.\u201d\n\nTruman wrote in his veto statement: It repudiates our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and in the words of St. Paul that \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free \u2026. for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n\nWhat rights do those deemed inadmissible have to due process, or to practice religion or speech? The Supreme Court has ruled that people outside the United States don\u2019t have constitutional rights. Further, the court ruled that Congress can decide who can and can\u2019t enter the country, and how much immigration authority to delegate to the executive branch, said William Stock, immigration attorney and president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nCitizens who wanted to hear from foreign scholars barred under ideological exclusions in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 made \u201cFirst Amendment claims to say it should be illegal for the president to bar people from the United States just because of beliefs that they held, and freedom of speech they wanted to express,\u201d Stock said. But \u201cin most cases, the Supreme Court said outside of the United States, the president can do what he wants as a matter of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the authority that Trump invokes is the flip-side to Obama\u2019s use of his broad authority to choose not to deport large groups of people, and consider them eligible to be in the United States through the deferred action program. Trump is proposing to use the same type of broad presidential authority \u2014 but using it to limit, rather than expand, immigration. Immigration attorneys we consulted said the power has not been applied as broadly as Trump proposes.\n\nStill, this does not mean Trump would have \u201cabsolute\u201d authority. That\u2019s good news for lawmakers on Capitol Hill such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who does not support Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban. With a veto-proof majority, Congress can decide to rewrite the law to take away or limit the president\u2019s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nFor once, it seems Trump bothered to look up the facts \u2014 a refreshing change for us at The Fact Checker. But his claim does not qualify for the coveted Geppetto Checkmark. Trump characterizes this power as an \u201cabsolute right,\u201d which conjures the image of a Roman emperor giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down at the U.S. border. But there are some restrictions he could face as president, from Congress.\n\nUnder previous presidents, certain groups of people (such as those who committed war crimes) have been banned from the country. People with certain ideologies (such as communism) have been banned as well. But Trump suggests banning nearly a quarter of the global population, or more. The authority that Trump invokes has not been tested in a way that Trump proposes, and Congress could act to nullify his actions, even over his veto.", "lang": "en"}
