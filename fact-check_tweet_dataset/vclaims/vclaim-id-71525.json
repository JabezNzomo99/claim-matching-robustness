The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly. And Chairman Kim would not meet with him.\"\n\nThe statement that Obama and his administration \"were begging for a meeting\" is not backed up by the record.\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office, and staff there had no comment.\n\nObama\u2019s special representative for North Korea policy, Glyn Davies, laid out the administration\u2019s position for senators at a 2013 hearing.\n\n\"The United States will not engage in talks for the sake of talks,\" Davies said March 7, 2013. \"The United States will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. We will not reward the DPRK for the absence of bad behavior. We will not compensate the DPRK merely for returning to dialogue. We have also made clear that U.S.-DPRK relations cannot fundamentally improve without sustained improvement in inter-Korean relations and human rights. Nor will we tolerate North Korea provoking its neighbors. These positions will not change.\"\n\nThis policy came on the heels of discussions with North Korean negotiators in 2011 aimed at restarting more robust talks that had been on hold since 2008. Initially, Pyongyang indicated it was open to the return of international inspectors, and a moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and all nuclear activity, including uranium enrichment.\n\nIn 2012, the process broke down when North Korea announced plans to launch a satellite, a move the Americans called a deal-breaker.\n\nUS-North Korean expert Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, said Obama was \"reticent to engage the top leader without having the pieces in place.\"\n\n\"Obama never, to the best of my knowledge, asked, much less begged, for a meeting with Kim Jong Un,\" he said. \"In fact, he took a stand-off approach, which came to be known as strategic patience.\"\n\nIn his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama spoke of the preconditions for talks.\n\n\"The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations,\" Obama said.\n\nJoseph DeThomas at the Penn State School of International Affairs said he is unaware that Obama ever sought to meet with Kim \"at all.\"\n\n\"Certainly in the second term, the United States conditioned all talks in pretty strict terms,\" DeThomas said.\n\nThe closest Obama came, said Kelsey Davenport with the Arms Control Association, was holding out talks as reward for strong promises of change from North Korea.\n\n\"The Obama administration remained open to talks with North Korea, but set onerous preconditions requiring Pyongyang to take steps toward denuclearization before beginning negotiations,\" Davenport said.\n\nDavid Albright with the Institute for Science and International Security echoed all of the above.\n\n\"I have never heard this,\" Albright said.\n\nIn addition, the Obama administration imposed stiff economic sanctions on North Korea, including sanctions on Kim himself.\n\nTrump said the Obama administration was begging for a meeting with Kim.\n\nThe public record shows the Obama administration rejected the idea of meetings of any sort until North Korea promised to back off of its nuclear program and accept international inspections.\n\nWhile the administration held out hope of North Korea meeting those preconditions during Obama\u2019s first term, in the second, it took a harder line. There is no evidence that Obama begged for a meeting.", "lang": "en"}
