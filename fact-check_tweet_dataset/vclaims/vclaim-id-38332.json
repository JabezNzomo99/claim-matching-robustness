A spokesman for Kissinger confirmed that the three dubious quotes are \u201centirely fictitious.\u201d\n\nOnly two of the quotes attributed to Kissinger in the post, which features a long block of text and several dubious quotes, appear to be genuine. They come from a December 2016 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d interview in which Kissinger discussed the foreign policy implication of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Kissinger said in the interview \u2013 and the post accurately quotes. (RELATED: Did Henry Kissinger Say \u2018Forcible Vaccination\u2019 Would Lead To \u2018Extermination Services\u2019?)\n\nIt also more or less accurately quotes the former secretary of state as saying, \u201cOne, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.\u201d\n\nBut the other three quotes about \u201ceight years of tyranny,\u201d Trump being \u201cthe one true leader\u201d and there being \u201cnot a single thing wrong with him\u201d do not appear anywhere in that interview transcript or elsewhere. Jessica LePorin, a spokesperson for Kissinger, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that those quotes were \u201centirely fictitious.\u201d\n\nKissinger has met with Trump a number of times to discuss foreign policy and spoken publicly about the president on occasion, according to media reports.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
