It actually comes from a character in former gymnast Dan Millman\u2019s book.\n\nBorn in Athens, Greece, around 470 B.C., Socrates pioneered the \u201cSocratic Method\u201d of question-and-answer-based dialogue and taught historically significant philosophical figures like Plato and Xenophon. He is widely considered a foundational figure in Western philosophy. (RELATED: Did Plato Say, \u2018Only The Dead Have Seen The End Of War\u2019?)\n\n\u201cSocrates wrote nothing so everything we think he \u2018said\u2019 is always attributed to him by another source: Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes, et cetera,\u201d said University of Michigan professor and Socrates expert Sara Ahbel-Rappe in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nHowever, neither Plato nor Xenophon attribute the expression to Socrates in their works. It appears nowhere in Plato\u2019s \u201cThe Socratic Dialogues\u201d or Xenophon\u2019s \u201cConversations with Socrates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can definitely say that no ancient source ever attributed anything like this statement to Socrates,\u201d said Ahbel-Rappe. \u201cSocrates was not interested in change at all, at least in the sense of fomenting political change. Nor did he concern himself with political fights, but only with the revolution within.\u201d\n\nThe quote actually originated in former gymnast Millman\u2019s 1980 fictionalized memoir \u201cWay of the Peaceful Warrior,\u201d in which a character nicknamed Socrates offered the saying as a piece of advice, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\n\u201cYou have many habits that weaken you,\u201d said the character. \u201cThe secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.\u201d (The wording varies slightly in later versions of the book.)\n\n\u201cThe reassignment of the quotation to the Greek luminary was, no doubt, facilitated by confusion between the matching names,\u201d wrote Quote Investigator. \u201cThis is a known mechanism for misattribution.\u201d\n\nWhite House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump shared the misattributed quote on Twitter in 2018. She later deleted it and tweeted the quote again, noting it came from the fictional character.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
