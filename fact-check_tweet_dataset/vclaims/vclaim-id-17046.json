There is a description associated with the image that reads- \u201cAn x-ray image shows a live cockroach in a patient\u2019s chest in Zimbabwe. A patient in Zimbabwe had serious chest pains, after taking an x-ray at Rusape General hospital the image showed that he had a live cockroach in his chest moving about. Doctors recommended that he goes abroad preferably India. So the patient had to sale his house and a few contributions from relatives.When he got to India another x-ray was taken and was told there was no cockroach in his chest but the cockroach was in the x-ray machine they used in Zimbabwe.\u201d Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: In Zimbabwe, an X-ray image shows a live cockroach in a patient\u2019s chest. Fact: The image in the post is a photoshopped one. The source image is an X-ray of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s chest taken by a doctor at Cedars Hospital of Lebanon in 1954. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, the original picture used in this fake image was found in an article from \u201cBBC News\u201d. According to the article, the X-ray was of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s chest and it was sold at an auction. When looked for more information about Marilyn Monroe\u2019s chest X-ray, an article of \u201cThe Hindu\u201d regarding the same auction was found. From the article, it was found that this X-ray is one of the three X-rays of Monroe\u2019s chest taken during her 1954 visit to Lebanon Hospital in Cedars.\n\nBoth the X-ray images exactly match including the shadows except for the cockroach. This story is found to be doing the rounds on social media since 2012 in different countries across the world. Same X-ray images are circulated as those of patient form Ghana and Nigeria. Snopes had earlier debunked these stories.\n\nTo summarize, the X-ray posted doesn\u2019t show a live cockroach in a patient\u2019s chest. It is a photoshopped one.\n\nDid you watch the first episode of the new DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
