Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s head of IT operations Amit Malviya tweeted a video purportedly of an old speech by politician and psephologist Yogendra Yadav on Friday, 19 April, claiming that Yadav had indulged in communal politics. Malviya, in his tweet, said that Yadav had bragged about \u201chis Muslim identity\u201d while delivering a speech in a Muslim-dominated constituency in Haryana. The caption shared with the video read: \u201cI usually don\u2019t carry TV debates to social media but making an exception to expose Yogendra Yadav\u2019s Janus face. Here is a video where he can be seen bragging his Muslim identity to a largely Muslim audience in Muslim dominated Mewat.

It starts with the text: \u201cAt a Mahapanchayat in Muslim dominated Mewat in Haryana, Yogendra Yadav makes it a point to inform the gathering about his \u2018Muslim identity\u2019 and tells them that his name is Salim.\u201d After showing around a minute of Yadav\u2019s public address, the video concludes with the text: \u201cWhen are you withdrawing from public life?\u201d This comes after a recent TV news debate on India Today, in which Yadav had told Malviya that his grandfather was killed by a Muslim mob. Malviya had accused Yadav of using this as a communal card during his electoral campaigning. .@_YogendraYadav shares the tragic story of his grandfather's murder, challenges @amitmalviya to produce any proof that shows him playing caste politics\n\nWatch #NewsToday with @sardesairajdeep: https://t.co/DpV7oVVA9F pic.twitter.com/I7IIItYzxp \u2014 India Today (@IndiaToday) April 18, 2019 Yadav had openly challenged Malviya to produce \u201cone clipping\u201d as evidence to support his claim.\n\nThe video put out by Malviya has been clipped to strip it off its context. The same can be ascertained after a viewing of the entire speech. Yadav tweeted out a link to the entire video, which revealed that it was from July 2018. Yadav was addressing a crowd in Kolgaon, Haryana in the aftermath of the lynching of Rakhbar Khan in Alwar, Rajasthan. Along with the video, Yadav wrote in his tweet: \u201cClinching evidence that Amit Malviya had doctored the few seconds video he has circulated. Just listen to this small fragment from my speech. BJP lie factory cut out my words: \u2018Na Hindu banega na Musalman banega\"! Also: \u2018Nafrat ka jawab mohabbat se dena hai\u2019. Are we surprised?\u201d Clinching evidence that @amitmalviya had doctored the few seconds video he has circulated. Just listen to this small fragment from my speech.\n\n\n\nBJP lie factory cut out my words: \"na Hindu Banega na Musalman Banega\"!\n\n\n\nAlso: \"nafrat ja jawab Mohabbat se Dena hai\"\n\n\n\nAre we surprised? pic.twitter.com/j5wjXf1797 \u2014 Yogendra Yadav (@_YogendraYadav) April 19, 2019\n\nAfter establishing the context behind the clipping, it becomes clear that Yadav was recounting the episode involving the murder of his grandfather and the subsequent actions of his father to stress on the need for peace in times of violence and not as a pitch for his electoral campaign. The claim was also fact-checked by Boom Live, who reached out to Malviya about his tweet. The BJP leader stood by his claim, saying \u201cThis video is in context and as proof that that Yadav went to Muslim dominated areas and started speaking about his Muslim name.\u201d \u201cIt is not my job to put out a video that will suit Yadav,\u201d he added, as per the report.", "lang": "en"}
