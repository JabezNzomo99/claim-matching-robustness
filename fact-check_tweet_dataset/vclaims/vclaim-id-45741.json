They are still available for sale.\n\nThe Danish toy maker announced on Twitter June 3 a pledge to donate $4 million to organizations \u201cdedicated to supporting black children and educating all children about racial equality.\u201d The announcement came after protests occurred across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in the custody of a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nSocial media users circulated the claim that Lego pulled its law enforcement-themed toy sets from stores after the trade publication Toy Book first reported on June 2 that Lego instructed Rakuten Linkshare to request that its affiliate marketers remove certain products \u201cfrom sites and any marketing ASAP.\u201d Affected products included the toy sets \u201cBurger Bar Fire Rescue,\u201d \u201cPolice Helicopter Chase,\u201d \u201cPolice Monster Truck Heist\u201d and an adult White House set, according to the New York Post.\n\nHowever, Lego did not stop selling the products altogether, but rather temporarily halted digital marketing strategies such as affiliate links for the toys sets, according to Lego Group Brand Relations Senior Director Michael McNally.

To be clear, that is not the case and those reports are false,\u201d McNally said in a June 8 email to the Daily Caller. \u201cGiven the tragic events in the US over the past 10 days, we did pause all digital marketing, including content that could be perceived insensitive if promoted at this time. We intend to resume digital marketing this week.\u201d\n\nLego also tweeted a clarification on June 4 after Brad Parscale, President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, made a similar claim.\n\n\u201cWe are not removing any LEGO sets from sale,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cReports otherwise are false.\u201d\n\nThe products in question are still available for purchase on Lego\u2019s website.", "lang": "en"}
