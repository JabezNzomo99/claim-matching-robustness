The claim is false; the tweet was not posted by Morrison, but a parody Twitter account.\n\nThis image has been shared more than 100 times since it was published on Facebook on May 30.\n\nThe purported tweet reads: \u201cWatching with concern the developments in the US. I\u2019m so glad we don\u2019t have any racism here in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe image circulated in late May 2020 as protests against police brutality and systemic racism erupted in the US following the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, AFP reported here.\n\nThe purported tweet was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA keyword search found that the tweet was originally published here by a parody Twitter account under the handle @ScottyFromMktg.\n\nThe tweet has been viewed nearly 1,500 times since it was published on May 30.\n\nThe name of the @ScottyFromMktg account reads \u201cScott Morrison PM of Australia (parody)\u201d and its description states that its content is \u201csatire\u201d. The account was created in December 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Morrison's verified Twitter account is under the handle @ScottMorrisonMP and was registered in April 2009.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the parody account (L) and the verified account (R) for Scott Morrison:\n\nTwitter\u2019s record shows Morrison did not tweet about the US protests between May 25, when Floyd\u2019s death caught media attention, and June 10, at the time of publishing.\n\nSimilarly, none of his deleted tweets between May and June 2020 were about the anti-racism movement in the US, according to Politwoops, a website that tracks deleted tweets by politicians.", "lang": "en"}
