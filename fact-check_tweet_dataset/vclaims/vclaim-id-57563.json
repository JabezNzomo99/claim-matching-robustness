There\u2019s no evidence California is actively registering illegal immigrants to vote.\n\nCalifornia enacted in 2015 the New Motor Vehicle Act aimed to increase voter turnout by automatically registering people to vote when they renew or obtain a driver\u2019s license through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), unless they opt out. The same year, the state began allowing undocumented immigrants who can establish California residency and meet other qualifications to obtain special AB 60 driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThe post, which has been shared more than 600 times, appears to misrepresent those two laws, claiming, \u201cCalifornia is registering three million non citizens to vote when they get their driver\u2019s license.\u201d (RELATED: Can Noncitizens Use Chicago\u2019s Citykey IDs To Vote In Local, State And Federal Elections?)\n\nThe New Motor Vehicle Act, however, only applies to Californian residents who are 18 years or older and meet the state\u2019s other voter requirements: be a U.S. citizen, not currently be in state or federal prison or on parole for a felony conviction and not currently be found mentally incompetent to vote by a court. Applicants applying for AB 60 licenses are not eligible and will not be registered to vote under California\u2019s motor-voter law, the California DMV website notes.\n\nIn October 2018, the DMV said approximately 1,500 people \u2013 including noncitizens \u2013 had been erroneously registered to vote because of a \u201cprocessing error.\u201d But, according to the Sacramento Bee, the Secretary of State\u2019s office said none of the individuals mistakenly registered were AB 60 licensees living in the country illegally, and the Daily Caller found no evidence that California is proactively doing so, as the post claims.\n\nPaula Valle, a spokeswoman for the California Secretary of State\u2019s office, told the Daily Caller in a March 6 email that the DMV has a \u201chard stop in their system\u201d to prevent automatic registration of AB 60 applicants.", "lang": "en"}
