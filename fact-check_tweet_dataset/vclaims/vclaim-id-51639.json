The temple\u2019s video of her visit has been viewed on Facebook more than 2.6 million times.\n\nThe visit was also attended by India\u2019s High Commissioner to New Zealand, Muktesh Pardeshi, who posted pictures of the event on his Twitter account. However, the caption on the Facebook post is incorrect in stating Ms Ardern visited the temple after declaring New Zealand COVID-19 free.\n\nOn June 8, Ms Ardern announced (video mark 20min36sec) NZ had \u201cno active cases\u201d of COVID-19 for the first time since February 28. On August 6, the date of the prime minister\u2019s visit, NZ\u2019s Ministry of Health reported no new cases of COVID-19 and that it had been 97 days since the last one. Three days later, NZ marked 100 days \u201csince the last case of COVID-19 was acquired locally\u201d, a situation that held until August 11, when four new cases of community transmission were reported in South Auckland.\n\nAAP FactCheck sought comment from the NZ prime minister\u2019s office regarding the post\u2019s claims but received no reply at the time of publication. However, a spokesperson for the Radha Krishna Mandir confirmed to AAP FactCheck that the NZ prime minister did visit the temple on August 6.\n\nVersions of the Facebook post have been debunked here, here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The post\u2019s caption incorrectly states Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern declared New Zealand free of COVID-19 during a visit to a temple in Auckland on August 6. Ms Ardern announced on June 8 there were no COVID-19 cases in NZ. False \u2013 The primary claim of the content is factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
