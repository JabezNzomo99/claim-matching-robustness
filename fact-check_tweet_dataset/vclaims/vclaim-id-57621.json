The post also claims this \u201ccure\u201d has prevented any COVID-19 deaths in Israel \u2014 but more than 30 people have died of the disease there.\n\nAs COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, spreads around the world, numerous false and misleading claims of \u201ccures\u201d for the virus are spreading on social media.\n\nA recent claim is from a post titled \u201cIn Israel No Death from COVID 19.\u201d It falsely states that the \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19, \u201cor the way to eliminate it,\u201d has been discovered, and that it comes from Israel, where it says the virus \u201cdid not cause any death.\u201d\n\nIn reality, as of April 2, more than 6,800 people in Israel have tested positive for COVID-19, and 36 have died. Over 100 people were in serious condition and 83 were on life support.\n\nThe post also claims that this \u201ccure\u201d is the reason that the \u201cPeople of Israel is relaxed\u201d about COVID-19.\n\nActually, the Israeli government has issued emergency regulations that include reducing entry to the public space, imposing responsibility on employers, closing non-essential stores and imposing restrictions on public transport, as well as \u201chome isolation\u201d guidelines.\n\nThe post\u2019s \u201crecipe\u201d for the phony cure includes lemon and bicarbonate \u2014 short for sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which is commonly used as an antacid.\n\n\u201cMix and drink as hot tea every afternoon,\u201d the post says. \u201cThe action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus [and] completely eliminates it from the body.\u201d\n\nThis claim is baseless. According to the World Health Organization, \u201cto date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.\u201d\n\nKrutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, confirmed this in an interview.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no data that shows using lemon juice or hot tea or anything like that would kill a virus,\u201d she said.\n\nAngela Rogers, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center, noted in an email that \u201cthere is nothing that has been shown yet to kill or eliminate COVID-19 virus, and it\u2019s still not clear whether any other therapies in the news (steroids, targeted immune modulators, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine) are actually helpful.\u201d\n\nKuppalli said people can lower their risk of contracting the virus by washing their hands, covering their coughs and sneezes, maintaining distance from each other, and following public health measures that have been implemented in their area.\n\nWe\u2019ve reported on many falsehoods and misleading statements about the new coronavirus.
