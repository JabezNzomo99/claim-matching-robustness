Spirit Halloween has said it plans to open stores this year.\n\nFounded in 1983, Spirit Halloween operates temporary Halloween costume and decor stores across the U.S. and Canada, according to the brand\u2019s website. Its physical stores are typically open from late August to early November, the website states.\n\nThe image being shared shows an announcement, purportedly from Spirit Halloween, addressing its \u201cLoyal Patrons and Fans.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Post Conflates COVID-19 Antibody And Viral Tests)\n\n\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that the Spirit Halloween team must issue a notice regarding seasonal store openings in 2020,\u201d reads the alleged letter, in part. \u201cDue to the outbreak of COVID-19, and the lack of international commerce at this time, it is likely that our stores will not be opening for the 2020 season.\u201d\n\nIn reality, there is no record of Spirit Halloween making an announcement to that effect for 2020. The statement doesn\u2019t appear on the brand\u2019s website or in any of its social media posts. An internet search turned up multiple media reports and other fact-checkers debunking the claim.\n\nWhen reached for comment via email, a spokesperson for Spencer Spirit Holdings, which owns Spirit Halloween, sent Check Your Fact a statement refuting the rumor about the brand\u2019s holiday stores not opening this year. The statement was also posted on the brand\u2019s official Facebook page on June 26.\n\n\u201cWe heard you\u2019re crushed, disheartened, and downright sad. Well, don\u2019t worry, the rumors aren\u2019t true,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWE ARE BACK & WE GOT THIS COVERED. We are safely preparing the best in-store experience possible and can\u2019t wait to welcome you back at our 1,400 locations Nationwide \u2013 popping up this August!\u201d\n\nThe fake Spirit Halloween letter appears to have been created by YouTuber Mak Ralston as an April Fools Day prank for his channel Haunt Former. In a June 28 video, Ralston said that he fabricated the letter as a joke.\n\n\u201cI never meant for this to get out other than my video and my community,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was a funny joke, and obviously people have stretched it, so I want to apologize to anyone that this has upset or Spirit Halloween, if this has gotten you into any media frenzy.\u201d\n\nThe store locator on Spirit Halloween\u2019s website shows that some of its physical stores have already opened \u2013 in Maryland, for instance \u2013 and others are scheduled to open soon.", "lang": "en"}
