The group\u2019s report was issued on Tuesday, and the first sentence of the report echoes what both the president and vice president have asserted in public: \u201cOne in five women is sexually assaulted in college.\u201d\n\nThis statistic is derived from a 2007 study, The Campus Sexual Assault Study, which was conducted for the Justice Department\u2019s National Institute of Justice. The researchers, led by Christopher Krebs of RTI International, also surveyed men, but the statistic cited by the administration focuses on women so we will look carefully at that part of the study.\n\nIn the Winter of 2006, researchers used a Web-based survey to interview undergraduates at two large public universities, one in the Midwest and one in the South. A total of 5,446 undergraduate women, between the ages of 18-25, participated as part of a random sample. The survey was anonymous and took about 15 minutes to complete. (Participants received a $10 Amazon.com certificate for participating.)\n\nSo, first of all, it\u2019s important to remember that this is a single survey, based on the experiences of students at two universities. As the researchers acknowledged, these results clearly can be generalized to those two large four-year universities, but not necessarily elsewhere. Moreover, the response rate was relatively low:\n\nThe sexual assault instances were further divided into sexual assault while incapacitated from drugs or alcohol or sexual assault through physical force. Most of the sexual assaults were identified as rapes, though the report said \u201csexual battery\u201d could have included \u201csexual touching,\u201d such as forced kissing or fondling.\n\nNotice that the percentage of sexual assaults \u201313.7 percent\u2014was lower than the one-in-five figure cited by administration officials. (It is more like one in seven.) That\u2019s because the president and vice president used careful phrasing that covered a student\u2019s entire time in college. The overall survey interviewed students that included freshmen, sophomores and juniors.\n\n\u201cWomen surveyed in their senior year of college (those having the longest risk period for sexual assault since entering college) had the greatest cumulative prevalence of each type of completed sexual assault,\u201d the report said, referring to Table 1. \u201cAlmost 20% of the seniors experienced some type of sexual assault since entering college, with 6.9% experiencing physically forced sexual assault and 16.0% experiencing incapacitated sexual assault.\u201d\n\nIn other words, information that is localized to the seniors at two colleges has now been extrapolated by politicians to the universe of college experience. (The report itself states that the data are limited just to those universities.) And to some extent, the results depend on how questions are phrased and answers interpreted. Below we have embedded the key questions that led to the statistic cited by the White House.\n\nOn its Web site, the National Institute of Justice notes that rapes and other forms of sexual assault are among the most underreported crimes, but that \u201cresearchers have been unable to determine the precise incidence of sexual assault on American campuses because the incidence found depends on how the questions are worded and the context of the survey.\u201d It said that two parallel surveys of American college women were conducted in 1997 and came up with very different results, with one survey showing rapes were 11 times higher than the percentage in the other survey. The reason appears to be because of how the questions were worded. (Hat tip to Washington Post polling analyst Scott Clement for pointing us to this page.)\n\nWe approached this project objectively and implemented it with as much methodological rigor as possible. This gives us confidence in the results. I do think there is room for improvement in our methods and I think a larger sample of universities and respondents would yield results that are more representative, but in the face of some significant challenges we implemented a study using solid methods and we have tried to be very clear about what we did, how we did it, and what we learned.", "lang": "en"}
