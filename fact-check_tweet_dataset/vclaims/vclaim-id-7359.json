The Eurozone figure has since been revised to 0.4%, the same as the UK.\n\nIn the longer term, UK growth is below growth in the Eurozone.\n\nThe Eurozone is made up of those countries that use the Euro, and isn\u2019t the same as the European Union as a whole (which includes countries like Poland and the UK which don\u2019t use the Euro).\n\nThe EU\u2019s growth last quarter was, like the UK\u2019s, 0.4%. Its growth was still the same even if you remove the UK from the calculation.\n\nReferring to the UK\u2019s performance the Office for National Statistics said: \u201cThe economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year.\u201d\n\nGDP is the main measure of the size of a country\u2019s economy. It can be measured in different ways, one of which is adding up the value of all goods and services produced in a country.\n\nLooking at a single quarter\u2019s growth figures in isolation won\u2019t give you the big picture. Quarterly GDP growth has been higher in the EU and Eurozone since the last quarter of 2016.\n\nGDP growth in the Eurozone and wider EU is forecasted to be higher than in the UK in 2018 and 2019.", "lang": "en"}
