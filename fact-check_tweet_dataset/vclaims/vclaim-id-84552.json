The entire time, they repeatedly questioned him as to why he wouldn\u2019t answer Republic TV\u2019s questions about his late wife Sunanda Pushkar\u2019s death. While the full video of the press conference can be seen on Republic TV\u2019s YouTube Channel, a 2 minute video of the chase can be seen below:\n\nWhile such hounding is not unprecedented, what went largely unnoticed were the personal attacks by members of the Republic TV crew. In the following video, you can hear someone in the crew stating \u201cYou\u2019re a coward\u201d twice.\n\nIn the next video, you can hear Republic TV correspondent Khalid Shah ask \u201cWhy are you running away Mr Tharoor? Why are you running away like a coward?\u201d at the start. Towards the end, two distinct voices repeat the question again, \u201cWhy are you running away like a coward?\u201d\n\nShashi Tharoor retweeted another leaked video by a Twitter account called \u2018The Last Caveman\u2018 and alleged that he was not just called a coward, but a killer too.\n\nAs reported by The News Minute, Shashi Tharoor on Thursday filed an application before the Delhi High Court seeking to restrain Republic TV from making defamatory publications against him with regard to the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar.\n\nThe Delhi High Court stated that Republic TV has to respect Shashi Tharoor\u2019s right to remain silent on this issue.\n\nThe day before, Republic TV journalists were denied entry to a All India Congress Committee press conference.\n\nWhile the act of disallowing journalists of a specific channel by a political party in a public press conference is condemnable, one also wonders if it is journalism when four correspondents and multiple cameramen from the same TV channel chase a politician, shove their microphones into his face and repeatedly ask the question, \u201cWhy are you running away like a coward\u201d?", "lang": "en"}
