No such scene appears in any episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nFloyd died in Minneapolis police custody in late May after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, despite Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn\u2019t breathe, according to video of the incident. Derek Chauvin, the officer videotaped kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder, CBS News reported.\n\nThe May 31 article, titled \u201cThe Simpsons Predict Derek Chauvin Kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s Neck in 1990\u2019s Episode,\u201d features an alleged screen grab from a scene from the animated comedy series. In the purported scene, the police officer character appears to be standing on the neck of a black character, while Lisa Simpson holds a \u201cJustice for George\u201d sign behind them. The alleged screen grab is juxtaposed with a real photo of Chauvin.\n\n\u201cGiven the similarities between the events, it seems The Simpsons predicted a police officer kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck,\u201d the article states. (RELATED: Did \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?)\n\nWhile some viewers believe \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d series has accurately predicted future events, there is no evidence that the animated comedy series foreshadowed Floyd\u2019s death. No such episode matching the description of the one in the article appears in Amazon\u2019s complete catalogue of its 31 seasons. An internet search also turned up no record of the purported scene.\n\nThe drawing of the alleged scene was actually created by cartoonist Yuri Pomo, who posted it on Instagram on May 31.\n\n\u201cWith this piece I\u2019d like you to think deeply, Taking the chance to bring The Simpsons as an example for the cause,\u201d the accompanying caption reads. \u201cNormally you\u2019re used to see colorful and cheerful drawings from me, but since I\u2019ve got quite a good audience, I\u2019d like to use it as much as I can in the right way when the situation requires it, and bring something good, and useful with my drawings, and you guys know it.\u201d\n\nPomo\u2019s Instagram page contains dozens of other political cartoons drawn in the style of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the drawings you see on my page are made by me, with a deep and strong meaning behind,\u201d Pomo told the Daily Caller via Instagram direct message. \u201cSadly the past days one of my drawings has been taken/stolen and passed by a real Simpson episode.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
