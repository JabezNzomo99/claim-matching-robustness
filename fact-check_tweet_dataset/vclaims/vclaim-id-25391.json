The claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least June 2012; according to local media, it shows PLA armoured vehicles coming to Hong Kong from mainland China as part of a \u201cnormal and necessary\u201d troop rotation in June 2012.\n\nThe one minute, six seconds video was shared in this Twitter post on July 24, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 6,200 times.\n\nThe Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cLast night, the Communist Party's troops entered and garrisoned Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe tweet was posted on the same day that China\u2019s defence ministry said that the PLA could be deployed in Hong Kong in order to maintain \u201cpublic order\u201d after weeks of protests. The PLA has maintained a garrison in Hong Kong since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.\n\nThe same video was also published here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least June 2012.\n\nA longer version of the video was published here on YouTube on June 16, 2012.

The military vehicles travelled along the Guangshen Expressway and entered Hong Kong via Lok Ma Chau, before heading towards the Shek Kong Barracks with police escort. The convoy (pictured) is formed by 90 communication vehicles, trucks and armoured vehicles, which were divided into three teams. The vehicles travelled orderly along the slow lane of San Tin Highway towards Pok Oi Interchange, then onto Castle Peak Road and Kam Tin Bypass, before reaching Shek Kong Barracks. The operation is believed to involve the rotation of personnel at the garrison.\n\n\u201cA PLA spokesperson told Oriental Daily that the operation was part of the army's internal affairs and refused to provide any further details. He/she added that the stationing and rotation of military personnel and equipment, as well as military exercises, are all part of the \u2018normal and necessary part\u2019 of the army\u2019s operations. The spokesperson thanked the people of Hong Kong and media for their concerns about PLA affairs.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
