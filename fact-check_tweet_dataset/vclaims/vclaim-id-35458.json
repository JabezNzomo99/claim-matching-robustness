And we have 25,000 people we still love outside. And close to 100,000 wanted to come tonight.\"\n\nAn Oct. 11 Facebook post seized on that line.\n\n\"20,000 inside, 25,000 outside, all to hear the POTUS speak!\" it says. \"Ask yourself, does this look like a country that wants to impeach our president?\"\n\nAn image below the text shows the streets packed with people outside of an arena.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019re not fact-checking Trump\u2019s claim about the crowd size here but Minnesota Public Radio has looked at his boast. In short: the Target Center where Trump appeared can hold approximately 20,000 people, but a precise count of how many people were there is difficult. Even if more than 20,000 attendees were in the center that day, it\u2019s not the first time \u2014 a basketball game and a U2 concert drew 20,412 and 20,200, respectively.\n\nAs for those who didn\u2019t make it inside the arena, Minnesota Public Radio reported that \"the president\u2019s assertion that 25,000 were left on the outside is dubious given that an overflow space wasn\u2019t full and reporters on the outside of the arena saw nothing nearing that number.\"\n\nThe accuracy of the photo, however, is easier to fact-check. It\u2019s not showing the Trump crowd.\n\nIt\u2019s not outside the Target Center, where the Minnesota Timberwolves play. It\u2019s in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 22, 2016, during a victory parade after the Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA championship. Angelo Merendino shot the photo for Getty Images.", "lang": "en"}
