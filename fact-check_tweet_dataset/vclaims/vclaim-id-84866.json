Trump continues to say that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is biased against him because of Curiel\u2019s Mexican heritage and Trump\u2019s border security proposals, including building a wall. Gingrich has called such claims \u201cinexcusable\u201d and \u201cone of the worst mistakes Trump has made.\u201d\n\nA literal translation for \u201cLa Raza\u201d is \u201cthe race,\u201d but it\u2019s interpreted as a broader term describing the Latino community. Opponents of immigration note that the term has roots in the Chicano nationalization movement of the 1960s. But \u201cLa Raza\u201d is a common name incorporated throughout the community and often used by Latino organizations and businesses, including restaurants and medical clinics. A search for \u201cla raza\u201d on yellowpages.com turned up more than 3,000 results in California alone.\n\n\u201cThe only tie that we have is that we serve the Latino community, and they do as well,\u201d said Luis Osuna, president of the lawyers association. \u201cBut they\u2019re a politically driven advocacy group, and we\u2019re just a local diversity Bar association that focuses on both diversity and equality in the legal field, but particularly among Latinos.\u201d\n\nLisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, confirmed this, saying: \u201cThe two organizations know of each other but are two completely separate organizations, and nothing wrong with either organization. The judge is not a member of NCLR, but there wouldn\u2019t be any issue if he was.\u201d\n\nThe latest criticism is that the group considers the National Council of La Raza and other pro-immigrant organizations a part of its \u201ccommunity,\u201d as evidenced by a list of organizations on its website under the heading \u201cCommunity.\u201d But that\u2019s a real stretch. Another misleading claim is that the organization gave a scholarship to an undocumented student in 2014, when Curiel served on the scholarship selection committee. In reality, the student identified himself as undocumented only after he was selected for a scholarship.\n\nAs for the scholarship, one of the recipients of a 2014 scholarship from the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association Scholarship Fund was a part-time law student who identified himself as undocumented \u2014 after he received the award. The student received a $1,500 scholarship and wrote in his bio that he emigrated to America at age 11, and that he \u201cwishes to someday tell any student struggling with higher education, \u2018Look, a boy from Oaxaca, who did not know English and is undocumented has now graduated from law school and is an attorney.\u2019\u201d Curiel was one of 10 people on the scholarship selection committee.\n\nThe California Supreme Court has ruled that undocumented immigrants can be admitted to the state bar as long as they have fulfilled requirements to practice law in the state, effective January 2014. The organization does not ask applicants for their citizenship status, and the student identified as undocumented when he wrote his bio for an event program, Osuna said.\n\nWe asked what constituted \u201cradical\u201d activities, and the spokesman said the lawyer group was affiliated with two groups that have advocated for pro-immigrant policies (Hispanic National Bar Association and the Mexican American Legal Defense), as shown by their names appearing on the \u201cCommunity\u201d section online. The lawyer group also linked to those two organization\u2019s news releases and hosted events featuring their leaders, he said.\n\nNeither the Hispanic National Bar Association nor the Mexican American Legal Defense has an official affiliation directly with the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association. However, the lawyers group has paid to be an affiliate member of the Hispanic National Bar Association in the past. Still, as we noted, listing other pro-immigrant organizations under the San Diego lawyers association\u2019s \u201cCommunity\u201d section as a resource doesn\u2019t prove that the lawyers group itself is \u201cradical.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released June 7, Trump called Curiel\u2019s professional memberships into question but also announced he does not \u201cintend to comment on this matter any further\u201d: \u201cDue to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge\u2019s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge\u2019s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.\u201d]\n\nYet Curiel is a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association, which is a professional organization for Latino lawyers. There\u2019s no evidence the organization is advocating for giving law scholarships to undocumented immigrants. And the new attack that the group lists the National Council of La Raza as a member of its \u201ccommunity\u201d on its website is just a red herring that says nothing substantive about the lawyers group\u2019s activities or merits as a professional organization.", "lang": "en"}
