Several comforting pictures of humans rescuing animals are also available on the Internet.\n\nOne such picture of a kangaroo snuggling a woman has gone viral. Facebook page Chennai Memes claims that the kangaroo is hugging a volunteer after being rescued from bush fire. The post is carried along with the caption heart breaking ! and hashtag #AustralianBushFires\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This kangaroo was rescued as an orphan by the staff of an Australian sanctuary. The image is more than three years old and has no relation to the bush fires.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post was liked\u2019 by more than 5,300 users and shared over 870 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThough many Facebook users have shared the viral post believing it to be related to the Australian bush fires, some have also raised doubts about the authenticity of the claim.\n\nOne such user, Ashok Kumar, referred to an old article in a website called boredpanda. The viral image can be seen in this article. The article has given image credit to The Kangaroo Sanctuary Alice Springs.\n\nWe found that on October 1, 2016, the Facebook page of The Kangaroo Sanctuary Alice Springs had put out a video of a kangaroo named Queen Abi cuddling a woman. The viral image is taken from this video.\n\nAnimal welfare website the dodo published an article on Queen Abi on October 6, 2016. The article had the same video and similar images of the kangaroo. It reported that Abigail (in short Abi) was an orphaned joey rescued by the care staff of the kangaroo sanctuary in Australia\u2019s Alice Springs. The animal developed a strong bonding with the staff and used to snuggle them in gratitude and love.\n\nThe Australian bush fires have killed thousands of animals, including kangaroos and koalas. Locals and volunteers have rescued several trapped animals. These reports can be seen here and here. But this image of a kangaroo hugging a woman has no connection with the recent bush fires in Australia.", "lang": "en"}
