But it is correct that, just examining cost per place, secure custody is more expensive than Eton on average.\n\nDepending on the type of custody accommodation, the annual price per place for a child ranges from \u00a376,000 to \u00a3210,000 in England and Wales, while the full annual fee for Eton College is just over \u00a340,000 a year.\n\nAll types of custody for children cost more than Eton\u2019s fees\n\nThere are three different types of custody for people under 18: secure children\u2019s homes, secure training centres, and young offender institutions.\n\nThe average cost per place in a secure children\u2019s home in England and Wales was around \u00a3210,000 a year in 2016/17, for a place in a secure training centre it was about \u00a3160,000, and in an under-18 young offender institution it was around \u00a376,000. The Youth Justice Board told us these are the most up to date figures available.\n\nThese figures are an average\u2014some places will cost more or less depending on the type of accommodation and the young person involved. The Ministry of Justice says that \u201cservices commissioned in secure residential accommodation are done so on the basis of meeting the individual needs of the young people accommodated there\u201d.\n\nThese prices don\u2019t include the costs of transporting sentenced young people, for example, between the court and a young offender\u2019s institution. They do cover Ministry of Justice funding for education in young offender institutions.\n\nEach place in a secure custody facility isn\u2019t necessarily occupied by the same young person for a year. In 2016/17 the majority of \u201ccustodial episodes\u201d which came to an end did so within three months and 8% had lasted more than a year.\n\nThere are three main types of custody for young people\n\nSecure children\u2019s homes are mostly council-run and provide children with teaching or training on site. They tend to be for children between 10 and 14 years old, and can also take on vulnerable children subject to a welfare placement, not just those who are sentenced or remanded in custody.\n\nThey house between five and 36 young people and have high staff to young person ratios. Figures from 2016 show that there was one staff member for every two young people in secure children\u2019s homes.\n\nSecure training centres are run by private companies, offer education and training and house 50 to 80 people, split into units of five to eight. They provide for children who are between 12 and 17, and according to the Ministry of Justice are \u201cmore motivated to attend school, or have risk factors which would make a placement in a [young offender institution] inappropriate.\u201d\n\nYoung offender institutions are for people aged 15 to 21, although those under 18 are held in separate buildings. They are run by the prison service and private companies, and are larger than the other two types of children\u2019s custody, housing between 60 and 400 people, split into wings of 30 to 60. They also have a lower ratio of staff to young people. Figures from 2016 show that there was one staff member for every ten young people in young offender institutions.\n\nThe annual cost of sending a child to Eton College is \u00a340,700 in 2018/19, without bursaries or scholarships. This includes things like food, boarding and education materials for its pupils, who join aged 13. There are also extra charges for things like music lessons and sports club membership. Students aren\u2019t at Eton for the entire year\u2014the length of the school\u2019s three terms mean students are in school for around eight months per year.\n\nThe school says 21% of students in 2015/16 were on means tested bursaries, averaging a 66% reduction in fees. It also says in 2016/17, 73 pupils received full fee remission.\n\nThe full fees price isn\u2019t necessarily the same as the actual cost of maintaining a child at Eton. The school has other sources of income aside from fees, such as grants, investments and trading income, as well as costs not directly related to the education and care of its current pupils.", "lang": "en"}
