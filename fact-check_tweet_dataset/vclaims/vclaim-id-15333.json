But the claim is false; the misleading clip has been edited from footage posted online by the Congress party in 2017 which actually shows the crowd chanting support for Indian National Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe misleading video was included in this Facebook post published on March 12, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe crowd is chanting Modi at a Congress rally\u201d.\n\nThe man seen speaking into a microphone on the stage is Alpesh Thakor, a member of the legislative assembly from western Indian state of Gujarat. This is his official Facebook page.\n\nIn the 41-second clip, Thakor can be heard telling the crowd to shout \u201cRahul Gandhi Zindabad\u201d which translates to English as \u201cLong Live Rahul Gandhi\u201d.\n\nRahul Gandhi is the president of the Indian National Congress party. This is his official Twitter page.\n\nIn the misleading video, the crowd responds to Thakor\u2019s request with chants of \u201cModi, Modi\u201d.\n\nThe misleading clip has been edited from a longer video of a rally in Gujarat\u2019s capital Gandhinagar, which was filmed on October 23, 2017.\n\nThe original video was published here on the YouTube page of the Gujarat Congress.\n\nThe same video was also live streamed on the Gujarat Congress Twitter account here on October 23, 2017.\n\nThe Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee is a unit of the Indian National Congress for the state of Gujarat. This is its official website.\n\nMultiple media reports about the Gandhinagar rally, including this report from Mumbai based news site DNA from October 23, 2017, show similar scenes to those seen in the Gujarat Congress video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the DNA article, which includes a photo of the rally in Gandhinagar:\n\nThis video published on a Gujarati news YouTube channel on October 23, 2017 also shows the rally.\n\nAFP compared the misleading video with the original Gujarat Congress.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (l) and the Gujarat Congress video (r):\n\nThe misleading video is of lower quality than the Gujarat Congress video.\n\nThe misleading video also contains a black rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen in place of the blue banner seen in the Gujarat Congress video.\n\nThe footage in the misleading video matches exactly with three sections of the longer Gujarat Congress video.\n\nThe first part of the misleading clip, from zero to five seconds, can be seen in the Gujarat Congress video at the 33 minute four seconds mark.\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (l) and the Gujarat Congress video (r).\n\nThe next section of the misleading clip, from six seconds to 16 seconds, can be seen in the Gujarat Congress video at the 33 minutes 34 seconds mark.\n\nIn the misleading clip, the crowd shouts \u201cModi, Modi\u201d at the seven seconds mark, after Alpesh Thakor shouts \u201cRahul Gandhi\u201d.\n\nIn the corresponding section in the Gujarat Congress video, the crowd\u2019s response to Thakor can be heard as \u201cRahul Gandhi Zindabad\u201d which translates to English as \u201cLong Live Rahul Gandhi\u201d.\n\nThe misleading clip then cuts to a black screen at the 17 second mark:\n\nThe video then resumes to show Thakor speaking again. From the 18 seconds mark to 41 seconds in the misleading clip, the footage then corresponds with the Gujarat Congress video from the 12 minutes 09 seconds mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the crowd in the misleading clip (l) and the Gujarat Congress video:\n\nIn the misleading clip at this point, the crowd can be heard shouting \u201cModi, Modi\u201d, but in the 2017 Gujarat Congress video, the crowd remains silent.\n\nIn the misleading video, Thakor then continues to speak until the end of the clip, while the crowd continues their Modi chant. But in the Gujarat Congress video, the crowd remains silent.", "lang": "en"}
