Have a look!\u201d.\n\nThe video has also been circulating on Facebook since at least December 2018.\n\nAlt News used InVid to break down the video into multiple frames, then performed a reverse image search of one of those frames on Yandex. This led us to several images and videos of similar-looking expressways.New China TV posted the same video on January 2, 2019, with the caption, \u201cAmazing engineering: Stunning aerial view of Yaxi expressway in SW China\u201d.\n\nUsing this information, Alt News did a keyword search on Google. We found multiple videos and websites consisting of visuals of the Yaxi Expressway. A Facebook user uploaded this video on November 7, 2018, with the caption \u201cyaxi road\uff0cYaxi Highway\u201d.\n\nChina Xinhua News also posted the video on their Facebook page on January 2, 2019.\n\nA simple Google search told us that Yaxi expressway is a 240 km section of the Beijing-Kunming highway, and is made up of 270 viaducts and 25 tunnels. It runs from Ya\u2019an to Xichang, a province in Sichuan. The construction of the expressway began in 2007 by the central government and it became open for public use in 2012. The project cost almost 20.6 billion yuan ($3.3 billion).\n\nFurthermore, we searched on Google to find out if a highway from China to Pakistan actually existed. A highway between China and Pakistan does exist. Karakoram highway is a 1,300 km national highway which goes from Hasan Abdal in the Punjab province of Pakistan, through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan controlled Kashmir, to China National Highway 314. We found a BBC video that shows the same.\n\nThe claim has previously been fact-checked by Boomlive and Times of India in January, then by The Quint in May when the video resurfaced.\n\nIn conclusion, a video has been circulating on social media with the claim that it shows an 880 km highway connecting Pakistan and China, however, the video is actually of Yaxi expressway connecting Ya\u2019an to Xichang in China.", "lang": "en"}
