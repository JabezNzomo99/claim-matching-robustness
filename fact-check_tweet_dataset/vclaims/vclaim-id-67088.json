The posts carried between one and seven photos, consisting of the following:\n\u2022 five different angles of an expressway on a mountainside,\n\u2022 a map that outlines that path of the MCE.\n\nOne post carried only the forked highway photo, another featured four of the five mountainside images, while the rest bore a mix of the photos.\n\nA reverse image search reveals that the mountainside photos actually show a motorway called Arb\u00ebn Xhaferi, connecting North Macedonia and the Republic of Kosovo\u2019s Pristina city.\n\nThe circulating images were shot by photographer Bujar Gashi, whose watermark can be seen in the photos. Their earliest traceable copies can be found in an article by Albanian website albinfo.ch published on May 29, 2019.\n\nGashi also uploaded the images on his FB page Explore Kosovo - with Bujar Gashi on May 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019, where he confirmed in the comments section that the motorway connects to North Macedonia.\n\nMeanwhile, the photo of a forked highway can be traced to a September 2012 Wikimedia Commons photo of the Shin-Tomei Expressway in Japan. It was taken on Sept. 9, 2012 and uploaded by a photographer under the name Batholith.\n\nLastly, the map shown in four of the circulating FB posts was grabbed from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)\u2019s information page on the MCE.\n\nAccording to DPWH, the 73.75-kilometer highway is intended to address traffic congestion in Metro Cebu and will provide \u201ca seamless traffic flow from Naga City up to Danao City traversing along the slopes of the mountain range of Cebu Province.\u201d\n\nSegment 3 of the project, which connects Naga City to the Minglanilla or Talisay boundary, is undergoing \u201cimplementation,\u201d according to the information page of DPWH.\n\nThis was confirmed by Joyces Verzales, public information officer from DPWH Region 7, in an interview with VERA Files Fact Check.\n\nOn Sept. 2, engineer Joselito Sayson, who heads DWPH Region 7\u2019s Construction Division, told VERA Files in an email that Segment 3 is targeted to be completed \u201cwithin Fiscal Year 2022.\u201d On the other hand, the implementation of Segments 1 and 2 via a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme is still in the proposal stage.\n\n\n\nA report from SunStar Cebu in January said right-of-way problems affected construction of MCE\u2019s Segment 3, after residents directly affected by the project refused to allow construction work in their area unless they were paid in full.\n\nThe false posts began surfacing a few days after the Supreme Court designated 11 regional trial courts to handle right-of-way acquisitions for other projects under the Duterte administration\u2019s Build, Build, Build program.\n\nThe seven posts collectively have over 900 shares.", "lang": "en"}
