A few seconds into the footage, a man hits the woman with a wooden plank while another walks around with a machete in his hand.\n\nThe video has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp with the caption which claims, \"Feel free to spread this video in India and all around the world. I have done it. This will be a noble work that you will do because this video was shot near the India Bangladesh border.\"\n\nBOOM received the same video on its helpline number for verification.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the video is not from the India-Bangladesh border as people in the video were speaking in Portuguese.\n\nWe broke the video and performed a reverse image search on a few of its key frames. We were directed to the same clip that was tweeted in November by a Brazilian website's Twitter handle.\n\nThe video has been captioned in Portuguese as, 'Strong Scenes: Couple Get Beaten Up After Burglary Plans Foiled.' (Original text in Portuguese: Cenas fortes: casal leva peia da popula\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s assalto frustrado)\n\nBOOM then ran a relevant keyword search and was directed to multiple news reports, which reported about the attack on the couple.\n\nThe incident happened in October, when a couple was overpowered by passengers in a moving minibus after they tried to rob people onboard. According to reports, they were pulled out of the vehicle near the Socorro area of Sergipe, a north eastern state of Brazil moments after they announced their plans of armed robbery.\n\nThe bus was travelling from the city of Laranjeirus to Aracaju in North East Brazil.\n\nThe couple was armed with a machete and attacked the ticket collector of the vehicle, according to the article. Later, the passengers overpowered them and beat up the man who suffered a deep gash on his head. Meanwhile police reached the spot and after receiving medical care, the couple was taken to the police station.", "lang": "en"}
