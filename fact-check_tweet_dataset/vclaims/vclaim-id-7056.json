No, the video being spread by Twitter user \"p4z\" is not real or even recent, it was made in Egypt in 2013 during an evocation/demonstration and does not show real corpses.\n\nTwo days after over fifty people were shot dead in the Gaza strip during unrest near the Israeli border fence, @_p4z_ tweeted:\n\nHowever the video in question has been online since at least 2013 and shows students at Egypt's Al-Ahzar university during a protest where they 'evoke' martyrs:\n\nWe were unable to determine what exactly they were protesting for or against but they clearly weren't supposed to be \"real\" corpses.", "lang": "en"}
