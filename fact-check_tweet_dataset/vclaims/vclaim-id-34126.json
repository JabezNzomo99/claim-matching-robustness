Bernie Sanders said that the United Nations is projecting \u201chundreds of millions of climate refugees\u201d in the \u201cyears to come\u201d as a result of climate change. The U.N., however, doesn\u2019t currently endorse a particular estimate, and the term \u201cclimate refugee\u201d is in many ways problematic.\n\nIn the debate, which was hosted by the Washington Post and MSNBC on Nov. 20, moderators asked a few presidential contenders a question about climate change: How would the candidates ensure support for climate action beyond a two-term presidency?\n\nAs part of his reply, Sanders said, \u201cThe United Nations is telling us that in the years to come there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not respond to our requests for a source for his statement, but Sanders\u2019 remark is similar to a comment the U.N. deputy high commissioner for refugees made in 2008. While at a climate change conference in Poland, the official said that between 200 million and 250 million people would be displaced by 2050 because of global warming.\n\nAs we\u2019ll explain, that figure is likely flawed \u2014 and it was also more than a decade ago. More recent statements from U.N. officials do not indicate the agency endorses an estimate.\n\nIn 2011, for instance, the high commissioner for refugees said there was \u201cno consensus\u201d on a number, and a 2016 FAQ available on the agency\u2019s website says \u201cit is hard to say\u201d how many people will be displaced by climate change. A 2015 blog post by the United Nations University\u2019s Institute for Environment and Human Security also states that there are \u201cno reliable estimates of the number of people on the move today or in the future as a result of environmental factors\u201d and that \u201c[n]o one knows how many climate migrants will exist.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, reports from the International Organization for Migration, the U.N.\u2019s migration agency, have discussed a range of estimates for the number of climate migrants \u2014 IOM\u2019s preferred term \u2014 in the future. But the group has not produced its own estimate, or validated any figure. Instead, reports emphasize that too little is known to make a reliable estimate. We contacted IOM\u2019s top migration, environment and climate change official, but did not receive a reply.\n\n\u201cSuch statements have been made frequently over the last 20 years, but there is little evidence to back them up,\u201d University of Sydney migration expert Stephen Castles said in an email, of Sanders\u2019 comment. \u201cPeople do move to adapt to climate issues,\u201d he said, \u201cbut generally move with[in] their own countries or regions.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll run down how some of the existing estimates came to be and why experts have said they\u2019re not dependable. But first, let\u2019s clarify the nomenclature.\n\nScholars in the field don\u2019t use the term \u201cclimate refugee\u201d because \u201crefugee\u201d has a very specific meaning in international law \u2014 and currently would not apply to most people displaced because of climate change.\n\nThe U.N. Refugee Agency explains on its website that a \u201crefugee\u201d is a person who has crossed an international border \u201cowing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u201d or someone fleeing \u201cevents seriously disturbing public order.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental concerns aren\u2019t listed here, and research shows people affected by climate change usually move within a country first, according to the agency. The agency says it does not endorse the term \u201cclimate refugee,\u201d and says it is \u201cmore accurate\u201d to talk about \u201cpersons displaced in the context of disasters and climate change.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s fairly cumbersome, so we\u2019ll stick with \u201cclimate migrant\u201d to refer to anyone leaving their home because of climate change \u2014 although figuring out how many or who those people are isn\u2019t always so clear, since migration is usually due to a mix of reasons, including economic, political and social factors. IOM defines climate migration as any temporary or permanent movement away from a place of residence \u201cpredominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment due to climate change.\u201d\n\nA related, but distinct term is \u201cenvironmental migration,\u201d which would cover any environmental reason, not just those due to climate change. Both terms, however, do not have any legal standing.\n\nThe most recent IOM report to address estimates of climate or environmental migrants was published in 2014, and stated that there was \u201cgreat uncertainty about the figures.\u201d It noted that the forecasts for the number of environmental migrants by mid-century vary widely \u2014 by as much as a factor of 40 \u2014 or between 25 million and 1 billion.\n\nThe actual figure, the report explained, will depend on a host of factors that are largely unknowable at this point, including which climate scenarios will play out, how humans will respond and adapt, and political and demographic factors. As a result, the agency said it \u201cdoes not advance an estimated figure.\u201d\n\nThe same wide-ranging estimates have appeared in a variety of IOM reports over the years, including particular mention of one estimate of 200 million environmental migrants by 2050. But each time, the reports have put the figures into context and noted the uncertainty.\n\nIn a section titled \u201cLack of reliable estimates,\u201d a 2009 IOM report said the \u201cmost widely cited figure predicts 200 million environmental migrants by 2050\u201d and pointed to the 40-fold range of estimates between 25 million and 1 billion.\n\nAnother 2009 IOM report also referred to the 200 million estimate, but noted that it \u201chas been dismissed as apocalyptic and based on no more than anecdotal evidence and intuitive judgement\u201d and said that \u201c[p]redictions of migration flows caused by environmental factors are impossible to make\u201d based on the available literature.\n\nA 2008 IOM report also called the 200 million number \u201cthe most widely repeated prediction,\u201d adding, \u201c[b]ut repetition does not make the figure any more accurate.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a 2016 briefing from the IOM\u2019s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre said the 200 million to 1 billion estimates \u201care known for likely overestimating the phenomenon and represent guesstimates rather than actual evidence.\u201d\n\nSo where did these estimates originate? None of them were created by the U.N. or IOM. Instead, they largely come from one Oxford professor who first predicted in 1993 that there would be 150 million \u201cenvironmental refugees in a greenhouse-affected world\u201d by 2050.\n\nIn that paper, environmental scientist Norman Myers proposed approximate numbers based on projected populations and a loose tallying of the number of people who might be affected by sea level rise in places including Bangladesh, India, Egypt and China. An extra 50 million people were then added in for presumed climate-induced food shortfalls. There are few details about how each of the numbers is derived, and Myers acknowledged in the paper that his estimate was \u201crough.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent publications, including an influential 1995 report for the Climate Institute, Myers revised his number upward to 200 million. And in a 2007 interview with the British charity Christian Aid, Myers said he believed the figure would be closer to 250 million.\n\nChristian Aid, in fact, may be the source of the upper-end 1 billion estimate. The group\u2019s 2007 report stated that \u201cunless strong preventative action is taken, between now and 2050 climate change will push the number of displaced people globally to at least 1 billion.\u201d A closer reading of the report, however, shows that the figure includes many displacements from human rights abuses and development projects. The subset attributed to environmental factors totals 300 million, including Myers\u2019 estimate of 250 million from climate-related impacts and 50 million from natural disasters.\n\nIt\u2019s likely Myers\u2019 200 million and 250 million figures that the U.N. deputy high commissioner for refugees had in mind in 2008. As documented in a 2011 report put together for the U.K.\u2019s Government Office of Science, most of the existing estimates of the number of climate or environmental migrants stem from Myers\u2019 work, which over time did not incorporate new methodology. And many experts have critiqued his findings, noting that his predictions are based on the number of people in a region who could be at risk, rather than those who would actually migrate. Such predictions also assume that it\u2019s possible to distinguish a climate or environmental migrant, despite the fact that migration usually has multiple causes.\n\nCastles, the University of Sydney migration expert, said there is \u201cno basis\u201d for Myers\u2019 projections. After a dustup surrounding another Myers climate migrant prediction \u2014 50 million by 2010, which did not come to pass but was shared on the U.N. Environment Programme\u2019s website \u2014 Myers told the BBC in 2011 that it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to predict the number of climate refugees. But he added that \u201cin the long run I do believe very strongly that it will be better for us to find that we have been roughly right than precisely wrong.\u201d\n\nThe 2008 IOM report also noted that Myers, who passed away this October, admitted that his estimate required some \u201cheroic extrapolations.\u201d The report concluded, \u201cthe simple fact is that nobody really knows with any certainty what climate change will mean for human population distribution.\u201d\n\nIn terms of more recent estimates, there are a few other figures, including one from the World Bank. The organization\u2019s 2018 report focused on three regions of the world \u2014 sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America \u2014 and found that if no action is taken on climate change, there could be more than 143 million climate migrants in just those three areas by 2050. The report, however, doesn\u2019t make a global prediction, and all of the migration is internal, not cross-border migration.\n\nTo be clear, many scientists are concerned about climate change\u2019s effect on migration. But there isn\u2019t a consensus on the number of people who will move \u2014 and it\u2019s important to recognize that not all climate migration is necessarily forced.\n\nAs the IOM\u2019s Migration, Environment and Climate Change Division head Dina Ionesco explains in a 2019 blog post, given the slow onset of climate change in many places, migration is still a choice for many.\n\nAnd migrating away from an affected area is not always the worst outcome. The 2011 U.K. report notes that the people who move away from environmentally dangerous areas often have more resources than those who stay put. As a result, the report argues that focusing on the number of environmental migrants \u201ccould mean neglecting the major humanitarian issues surrounding those who stay behind, and indeed those who are unable [to] migrate and who become trapped in parlous environmental circumstances.\u201d The report concludes: \u201cTrying to produce global estimates of \u2018environmental migrants\u2019 is methodologically unsound, unhelpful for policy purposes and may even be counterproductive.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
