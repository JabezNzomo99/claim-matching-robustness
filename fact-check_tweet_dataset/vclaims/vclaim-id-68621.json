(The post has since been deleted.) \"She\u2019s predicted to come through Mexico, hit us and everything in between up to Houston. She's already a Category 2 and hasn't even got into warm water yet.\"\n\nThe post uses the official logo of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has a map showing a projected path of the storm. It had been shared more than 36,000 times on Sept. 1, 2017.\n\nJoe Maley, the author of the post, did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe National Weather Service took the rare step of debunking the forecast on Twitter on Sept. 1, 2017, flagging the post as fake.\n\n\"Keep your eyes out for fake forecasts. THIS is what an official NOAA advisory looks like. Note: forecast only goes out 5 days. #Irma,\" the National Weather Service tweeted.\n\n\"National Weather Service issued a tweet in response to a Facebook post by someone who is not an employee of NOAA, NWS or the National Hurricane Center,\" National Weather Service spokeswoman Maureen O'Leary told us. \"The post included logos and language that could be mistakenly taken as an official forecast.\"\n\nAs of this writing, the National Weather Service projects Irma\u2019s probable path as moving in the direction of the Caribbean, but it\u2019s still too early to tell where the storm will make landfall and whether it will impact the United States.\n\nU.S. code subjects people who counterfeit weather forecasts or falsely represent government-issued forecasts to fines or imprisonment for under 90 days.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
