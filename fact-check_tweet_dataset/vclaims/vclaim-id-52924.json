You can see the conditions of hospital in Pakistan and there's no space in hospitals for corona patients. So, please take it serious this is a worldwide dangerous virus,\" reads the caption of one of the posts.\n\nAfter the clip was shared online, it was believed that the patients were waiting outside due to the overwhelming number of COVID-19 patients and insufficient space in hospitals. Further, it was reported that around 40 patients were undergoing treatment in the ward and all of them were evacuated. A 50-year-old patient, identified as Shamim, died due to lack of oxygen supply during the process of shifting. Further, a broadcast of the incident was done on the Youtube channel of Gourmet News Network (GNN), a Lahore based Pakistani news channel.\n\nTherefore, the situation seen in the video occurred as a result of a fire in the surgical ward of a hospital located in Lahore, Pakistan. The COVID ward of the hospital is irrelevant to the viral video. Further, the incident has no connection with Hyderabad, India.
