That target was missed, and debt on this measure has only started to fall in the last year.\n\nIn May 2010, when the Coalition began, the national debt (excluding debt held by public sector banks) was \u00a31.03 trillion. As of March 2019 it had risen to \u00a31.80 trillion.\n\nYou can also measure debt to include the debt held by public sector banks (those banks that were partially or wholly nationalised during the financial crisis). This measure isn\u2019t as commonly used, however, as it can distort the underlying figures.\n\nOn this measure, debt has fallen from \u00a32.3 trillion in May 2010 to \u00a32.1 trillion in March 2019, because the debt attributable to those banks declined sharply as many of the government\u2019s holdings in them were sold back onto the open market.\n\nSo the claim has close to the correct figure for May 2010 using debt excluding public sector banks, and close to the correct figure for the present day using debt including public sector banks. But they\u2019re obviously not comparable.\n\nRegardless, debt as a percentage of GDP is a better measure for making comparisons over time. Looked at this way, debt (excluding public sector banks) rose from 65% of GDP in May 2010 to a peak of 86% in September 2017, before falling back to 83% as of March 2019.", "lang": "en"}
