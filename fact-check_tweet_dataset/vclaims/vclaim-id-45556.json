The post fooled many, including reporters. Most notably in terms of virality, however, it also fooled the anonymous entity behind the sprawling \u201cQAnon\u201d or \u201cQ\u201d conspiracy theory. On June 1, 2020, Q \u201cdropped\u201d a side-by-side shot of the gag segment on top of the the trailer, accusing the press of pushing an \u201cAmerica on Fire\u201d narrative:\n\nQ would later admit the mistake, confusingly blaming the mix up on \u201chelicopter rides\u201d which create verification \u201cchallenges.\u201d\n\nThe viral attention apparently shocked Bad Scooter, who tweeted \u201cI dramatically underestimated Twitter.\u201d The user deleted the original video and posted an all caps clarification that the video was fake. As proof, the user included the actual MSNBC clip from which the audio was derived:\n\nMSNBC\u2019s parent company also confirmed to The Verge that the clip was a fake. \u201cTo confirm, the posts are fake,\u201d NBCUniversal spokesperson Alexandra Roberts told the outlet. For these reasons, the claim that MSNBC tried to pass \u201cWorld World Z\u201d trailer footage off as video of protests in Philadelphia is not rooted in reality.", "lang": "en"}
