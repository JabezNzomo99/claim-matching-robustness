In 2015/16 it equalled 4% of GDP, and it\u2019s forecast to fall to 3.5% in 2016/17, a fall of near enough two thirds.\n\n\u2018Public sector net borrowing\u2019 is the headline measure of the government\u2019s budget deficit. It\u2019s the difference between the government\u2019s income (mainly taxes) and everything it spends on public services, investment, and debt interest.\n\nOne reason for the fall in borrowing as a proportion of GDP since 2010 is that the government spent less. The cash value of the government\u2019s deficit fell by about half. In 2009/10 the government borrowed about \u00a3155 billion; in 2015/16 it borrowed about \u00a376 billion.\n\nAnother reason why borrowing fell as a percentage of GDP was that GDP got bigger. The cash value of UK GDP rose by almost a quarter, from about \u00a31,530 billion in 2009/10 to about \u00a31,880 billion in 2015/16.\n\nThe Coalition government had said it was going to reduce the deficit by more than that. In its first budget, it said that it would eliminate what\u2019s called the \u2018cyclically-adjusted current budget deficit\u2019 by 2015/16.\n\nThat\u2019s a narrower measure of the government\u2019s deficit. It doesn\u2019t include investment spending, and it\u2019s adjusted to take into account of whether the economy is in a \u2018boom\u2019 or \u2018bust\u2019 period. Over the past 10 years, the cyclically-adjusted current deficit has been about half of public sector net borrowing.\n\nBy focusing on the cyclically-adjusted current budget deficit, the coalition government aimed to avoid creating an incentive to cut investment spending unnecessarily, and to give itself the flexibility to deal with potential economic crises.\n\nBut the cyclically-adjusted current budget deficit wasn\u2019t eliminated. It did roughly halve, falling from a cash value of about \u00a372 billion in 2009/10, to about \u00a338 billion in 2015/16.\n\nBy implication, the broader measure \u2018public sector net borrowing\u2019, which Mr Hammond was referring to, didn\u2019t fall by as much as the Coalition hoped for either.", "lang": "en"}
