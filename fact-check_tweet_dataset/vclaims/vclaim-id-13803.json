[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the prime minister\u2019s statement and checked his claim against Department of Health figures.\n\nBulk-billing is defined as when a doctor bills Medicare directly and accepts the Medicare benefit as full payment for their service. This means the patient is left with no out-of-pocket expenses. [2]\n\nThe percentage of Medicare-funded consultations that are bulk-billed is referred to as the bulk-billing rate. [3]\n\nThe Department of Health annual statistics show the bulk billing rate nationally for non-referred GP visits was 55.8 per cent in 1984-85, when Medicare started. The rate hit 86.1 per cent in 2017-18 - the highest level on record.\n\nAccording to the department, patients accessed almost 155 million GP services in 2017-18, at a cost in Medicare benefits of $7.8 billion. This compares to 149 million services in 2016-17 at a cost of $7.5 billion in Medicare benefits - an increase of 4.9 per cent in service volumes and an increase in benefits of 5.5 per cent.\n\nAnnual figures for overall Medicare claims also hit a record high in 2017-18 reaching 78.9 per cent.\n\nThe department\u2019s figures showed the volume of total Medicare services in 2017-18 was 414.3 million services, at a cost of $23.2 billion in Medicare benefits. This compares to 394.3 million services 2016-17, at a cost of $22 billion in Medicare benefits - an increase of 5.9 per cent in service volumes and an increase in benefits of 6.3 per cent. [4]\n\nHowever the bulk-billing rate for specialist services was not a record. In 2017-18 the rate nationally was at 31.1 per cent which was lower than a peak of 32.5 per cent in 1995-96.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes that based on the annual statistics Mr Morrison\u2019s claim is mostly true.", "lang": "en"}
