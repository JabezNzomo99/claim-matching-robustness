They will work 24\u00d77. @NagpurPolice.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, several people have shared similar claims associated with the helpline numbers \u20181091\u2019 and \u20187837018555\u2032 on Twitter and Facebook. Since then, Alt News has received several requests on WhatsApp to verify the messages.\n\nIn this article, Alt News will fact-check which states or districts have started the home-drop service for women and what are their helpline numbers.\n\nFact-check 1: Places where \u20181091\u2019 and \u20187837018555\u2019 are valid\n\nAlt News did a keyword search on Google of \u201c1091 and 7837018555\u201d and found a report from December 2 in The Tribune which includes a statement from Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal, \u201cWe have started many programmes to ensure the safety and security of women in Ludhiana. We have two dedicated helpline numbers, 1091 and 7837018555, for women. These are open 24\u00d77. Women can dial these numbers to get a free ride to home in Ludhiana.\u201d\n\nAnother report by NDTV states that Ludhiana police, Punjab is offering free rides to women unable to find a cab from 10 pm to 6 am throughout the year. The official website of Ludhiana police mentions both the numbers as women\u2019s helpline.\n\nMost viral texts are promoting misleading information as it implies that home-drop service is introduced across India. However, they do not mention that \u20187837018555\u2019 is valid only in Ludhiana.\n\nOn December 5, Punjab police shared an article by Times of India in a tweet which said, \u201cOver 3000 calls have been received on the women helpline no. of @Ludhiana_Police inquiring about the facilities of dropping home at night. These calls were not just from the city residents but also from outside Punjab.\u201d\n\nA 2016 notification by the ministry of communication and information technology allocated \u20181091\u2019 (women\u2019s helpline) for SMS-based service to all states and UTs. However, the same has not been implemented pan-India. A list of all the women\u2019s helpline numbers functional across states and UTs was found on the website of NARI (national repository of information for women) under the ministry of women and child development. \u20181091\u2019 is not valid in several states such as Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, among others. It is also not valid in the UT of Andaman and Nicobar.\n\nFact-check 2: Which other states or districts offer the police home-drop service?\n\nChandigarh police website states, \u2018In case any lady is out of her place of stay late at night and is unable to avail a taxi, auto, cab, etc. to reach her place of stay safely, then she may call the PCR at No. 100 or 0172-2749194 or 0172-2744100. The PCR shall send its vehicle to safely drop the lady to her place of stay within Chandigarh.\u2019\n\nChief Minister of Punjab, Capt Amarinder Singh tweeted on December 3, \u201cWomen in Punjab can avail free police help to reach their homes safely anytime between 9 PM-6 AM. This facility will be available via-100, 112 & 181 through which you will be connected to Police Control Room. For an added sense of security, a lady officer will also accompany you.\u201d On December 3, the directorate of information and public relations in Punjab posted a press note by CM Singh confirming his statement. \n\n\n\nOn December 4, Nagpur City Police tweeted, \u201cWe are providing \u201cHOME-DROP\u201d facility for the Safety and Security of Women: Any woman who is alone/stranded, with no means to go home, between 9 pm \u2013 5 am, would be safely escorted by us till her home, FREE of Cost. DIAL 100 or 1091 or 07122561103. #NagpurPolice #AlwaysThere4U.\u201d\n\nOn December 5, a New Indian Expressreport said, \u201cThe HyderabadPolice have started deploying women for patrolling and handling women-related issues. These teams, called \u2018Women on Wheels\u2019 (WoW), patrol the city on bikes. As a pilot project, the Women on Wheels will pick up and drop women based on calls to Dial 100. This will be done in coordination with SHE Teams.\u201d\n\nA Hindustan Times report published the same day states, Andhra Pradesh started a pilot of the programme named \u2018Abhay\u2019 in the Prakasham district on the night of December 4. The state has assigned eight four-wheelers and 70 two-wheelers for the service. The report also states, \u201cEach of the eight four-wheelers is manned by a driver and a woman police officer armed with a body camera and a walkie-talkie, ready to be dispatched once an SOS call is received on number 100 between 9 pm and 5 am. Four of these vehicles are currently located in the Ongole city, two in Chirala and one each in Kandukur and Markapur towns.\u201d\n\nOn December 6, Ahmedabad Police tweeted, \u201cAhmedabad Police started this initiative on #WomensDay back in March 2018. In case any lady is unable to get a taxi, auto at night. Feel free to Dial 100. We will send our vehicle to safely drop them at home. #SafetyFirst #Police4Public\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the recent Hyderabad rape incident, several states and districts have started home-drop services for women. Alt News will update this article as and when other administrations implement the service. For now, the facility is available in Punjab, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Andhra Pradesh. The \u20181091\u2019 number has been allocated to multiple states where women can call when in distress such as in cases of domestic violence. Certain police departments have also advertised \u20181091\u2019 as the number to request home-drop. However, \u20187837018555\u2019 is a Ludhiana-specific number. The complete list of women\u2019s helpline emergency numbers for individual states can be accessed on the NARI website.\n\nReaders should further note that a single emergency helpline number (112) was launched this year, integrating the police (100), fire (101), health (108) and women\u2019s helpline (1091) numbers. Access to 100, 101 and 102 numbers are restricted (these are the services to be accessible at least within local area); access to 108 and 181 (launched in December 2012 as per a report in The Hindu Business Line) has been defined as unrestricted (these are the services, which shall be accessible from anywhere, national or international).", "lang": "en"}
