The pencils carry the slogan: \u201cToo Cool to Do Drugs.\u201dBut a sharp-eyed fourth-grader in northern New York noticed when the pencils are sharpened, the message turns into \u201cCool to Do Drugs\u201d then simply \u201cDo Drugs.\u201d As a result of the discovery by 10-year-old Kodi Mosier of Ticonderoga Elementary School, the company, called The Bureau For At-Risk Youth of Plainview, recalled the pencils. \u201cWe\u2019re actually a little embarrassed that we didn\u2019t notice that sooner,\u201d spokeswoman Darlene Clair told [the] Press-Republican of Plattsburgh.\n\nReports at the time suggested the organization would be re-issuing the pencils with the slogan positioned in the opposite direction to eliminate the problem:\n\nA new batch of pencils will have the message written in the opposite direction, so when they are sharpened, they read \u201cToo Cool To Do\u201d and finally \u201cToo Cool.\u201d For pointing out the botched message, Moiser earned his class a letter of apology from the company and box full of T-shirts. Why does Kodi think the company didn\u2019t catch the mistake themselves? \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t sharpen their pencils,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
