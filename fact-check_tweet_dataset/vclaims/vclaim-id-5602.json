The EU\u2019s Court of Auditors regularly \u201csigns off\u201d\u2014in its own words\u2014the reliability of the accounts themselves, and has given them a clean bill of health for the last decade.\n\nBut it has consistently found significant errors in how the money is paid out since it began giving opinions in 1995, for the 1994 EU financial year.\n\nThe exception to this is the most recent year. The latest report has, for the first time ever, found a significant amount of payments to be largely error-free. It found that \u201cPayments for 2016 were legal and regular, except for cost reimbursement payments\u201d.\n\nTwo opinions, not one\n\nThe European Court of Auditors checks the EU\u2019s accounts and delivers verdicts on them annually. It actually gives two different opinions on them: whether they\u2019re accurate and reliable, and to what extent there\u2019s evidence that money is being received or paid in error.\n\nThe auditors give a clean opinion on the accuracy and reliability of the accounts when they present a true and fair view of the EU\u2019s finances and follow the rules of financial reporting. This has been the case since 2007.\n\nIf they\u2019re mostly fine, but have some problems, the auditors give a qualified opinion. This was the case before 2007. If they have extensive problems, they give an adverse opinion on the reliability of the accounts. This has never happened.\n\nThe same opinions are delivered on the \u2018regularity\u2019 of the accounts\u2014 mainly whether the payments are free from significant errors. Until 2016, the Court of Auditors had always given an adverse opinion on this ever since it started giving opinions in 1995.\n\nHowever, the most recent report gives a qualified opinion that \u201cA significant part of the 2016 expenditure audited was not affected by a material level of error\u201d.\n\nSo what does all this say about the EU\u2019s accounts? The numbers accurately reflect what\u2019s actually happened\u2014it\u2019s just that some of it shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\n\nIn 2016 the EU spent \u20ac136 billion\u2014or about \u00a3110 billion, at the average exchange rate for 2016. That's a few billion less than what the UK spent on the NHS. The Court said the EU\u2019s accounts in 2016: \u201cpresent, in all material respects, a true and fair view of the EU\u2019s financial results for the year and its assets and liabilities at the end of the year.\u2026 We were therefore able to give a clean opinion on the reliability of (i.e. \u2018sign off\u2019) the accounts, as we have done every year since 2007.\n\nBut it did find that 3.1% of EU spending was subject to error. This is slightly lower than in previous years, but as long as the estimated error is above a threshold of 2%, it\u2019s considered \u201cmaterial\u201d.\n\nHowever, the \u201centitlement payments\u201d (rewards for meeting conditions, rather than payments for costs incurred) were found to have an error level below the 2% threshold.\n\nThis meant that, for the first time since 1994, the accounts were given a \u201cqualified\u201d, rather than \u201cadverse\u201d, opinion. The auditors found that: \u201cA significant part of the 2016 expenditure audited was not affected by a material level of error\u201d.\n\nError is not always the same as fraud or waste\n\nJust because some money is paid in error doesn\u2019t mean people all the people involved have deliberately tried to defraud the EU.\n\nA small minority of the cases that the auditors look at each year involve suspected fraud. The UK\u2019s Public Accounts Committee of MPs has concluded for years that the complexity of the EU\u2019s spending programmes, which creates misunderstandings, contributes towards these errors.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the money was \u2018wasted\u2019, just that it wasn\u2019t paid out according to the rules. One way to run afoul of the rules, for instance, is to award an EU-funded contract directly without holding a proper bidding process. Even though the rules haven\u2019t been followed, it's not always the case that another firm would have been able to put in a lower bid.\n\n\u201cOur estimate of the level of error is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste. It is an estimate of the money that should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe most common type of error is when people claim for costs they\u2019re ineligible for, followed by procurement errors like the one discussed above.\n\nIt\u2019s not all the EU\u2019s fault, and it gets some of the money back\n\nWhile the EU is ultimately responsible for its own budget, the majority of the spending is implemented by member countries. Both the EU and member states make similar amounts of error.\n\nIn the UK\u2019s case, the Public Accounts Committee has criticised the government for designing programmes which add to the complexity of EU spending, and showing a \u201cdistinct lack of urgency\u201d in tackling that complexity and reducing the penalties the UK needs to pay back to the EU.\n\nIt can take the EU several years to make corrections to the money paid out in error. It estimates that between 2009 and 2015 it recovered just over 2% of the average payments.", "lang": "en"}
