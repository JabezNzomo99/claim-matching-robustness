Better known as \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d McGraw and his wife, Robin McGraw, \u201ccounsel millions of viewers on issues ranging from marriage and domestic abuse to addiction to weight loss\u201d on their top-rated daily program.\n\nDr. Phil\u2019s popularity has brought him a fair share of criticism and made him the target of numerous celebrity rumors, the latter most frequently spread by the National Enquirer and its sister tabloid, who over the last few decades have published several dozen articles accusing \u201cDr. Phil (and sometimes Robin) of various indiscretions, from minutia like being a \u2018ratings whore\u2019 to personal turmoil such as a \u2018secret divorce deal\u2019 to outright felonies like sexual and child abuse.\u201d\n\nSo relentless has the National Enquirer\u2019s gossip reporting on Dr. Phil been that in 2016, he and his wife filed a $250 million libel and malicious defamation lawsuit against the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc. According to the Washington Post:\n\n[The lawsuit] claimed the publications specifically focused on the McGraws as a means to overcome financial instability. The lawsuit mostly focused on allegations from the tabloid that Dr. Phil abused his wife. It claims [AMI\u2019s reporting] has hurt both their professional lives, which center on providing counseling, often to couples trying to save their marriages. But it included other examples as well. In one, the magazine \u201cthreatened\u201d to write that a drunk Dr. Phil stood behind a man and smashed a beer mug over his head at a Lubbock, Tex., bar called the Copper Caboose while he was a student at Texas Tech University. The issue, according to the suit, is that the Copper Caboose didn\u2019t open until six years after he\u2019d moved away from the city \u2014 where he didn\u2019t return until 2014 \u2014 and didn\u2019t serve alcohol until 2009. The [Enquirer] said that much of [the] information it has published can be found in lawsuits filed against Dr. Phil. This is true, the lawsuit stated, but the tabloid arguably stated allegations as fact.\n\nThe McGraws dismissed their lawsuit a few months later without providing any information about its ultimate resolution, but since then the Enquirer seems to have stopped reporting negative rumors about Dr. Phil in favor of offering sensationalist, promotional articles about guests on his show.\n\nNonetheless, one piece of gossip-mongering that has never gone away is the claim that Dr. Phil and his wife of 43 years, the former Robin Jo Jameson, are headed for an imminent divorce \u2014 an event that, according to the Enquirer, was forestalled only due to a \u201csecret divorce deal\u201d over a supposed \u201ctell-all book\u201d authored by Robin:\n\nIn the ultimate betrayal, Dr. Phil McGraw\u2019s wife Robin is writing a tell-all book that exposes his darkest secrets, sources say. Robin\u2019s \u201cwarts-and-all\u201d memoir about their 32-year marriage could bring her a whopping $3 million advance, according to publishing insiders. \u201cPhil believes he\u2019s being betrayed,\u201d a friend of the 58-year-old TV shrink told The ENQUIRER. \u201cBut at the same time, he feels he\u2019s almost powerless to stop Robin! \u201cTheir marriage has been on shaky ground for some time, and he thinks that if he demands she not write the book, she will dump him for good.\u201d And the self-help guru has plenty of reason to worry, said another source. \u201cRobin reveals how Phil has humiliated her by his cheating and lying,\u201d a friend of 55-year-old Robin told The ENQUIRER. \u201cShe\u2019s also written about their secret divorce deal \u2014 which is already done \u2014 and disclosed the real reason he hates his talk-show mentor Oprah Winfrey!\u201d Robin\u2019s manuscript also reveals that the couple has already worked out a secret divorce pact, said her friend. \u201cPhil knows Robin wants the success of a best-seller, but he\u2019s confident he can dissuade her by giving her a payoff equal to the potential $3 million book advance she\u2019d reap,\u201d his friend told The ENQUIRER. \u201cPhil can be very convincing, and he\u2019s telling her it\u2019s what\u2019s best for their marriage. He thinks she\u2019ll take the loot \u2014 \u2018crazy money\u2019 he calls it \u2014 and forget all about turning the manuscript into a book.\u201d\n\nThe Enquirer article quoted above was originally published in April 2009, but neither a Dr. Phil divorce nor the publication of a Robin McGraw-authored \u201ctell-all book\u201d has transpired in the more than 10 years since then. Although Dr. Phil continues to be dogged by divorce rumors, nothing other than tabloid reporting suggests such rumors have any substance to them.\n\nThe McGraws addressed (and denied) tabloid reports of a pending divorce on their show as far back as 2008, as transcribed on the Dr. Phil website:\n\nDuring the summer, pictures of Dr. Phil and Robin were all over the tabloids, which claim they were getting a divorce. With Robin\u2019s seat in the audience vacant, Dr. Phil says, \u201cI am not getting a divorce. Trust me; she\u2019s here.\u201d Robin joins him onstage. \u201cSee, I\u2019m married,\u201d she says, showing her wedding ring. \u201cIsn\u2019t she cute? We just celebrated our 32nd anniversary,\u201d Dr. Phil says proudly. Robin says she\u2019s shocked that strangers would write lies about something that is so precious to her and Dr. Phil. \u201cIt really bothers me, because you know what? I\u2019m not even mad at him, and they have me divorcing him!\u201d she says. Dr. Phil shows a recent photo in a tabloid which shows him carrying a bag, allegedly full of personal effects. The headline claims that Robin kicked him out, when in actuality, he was holding his tennis bag. \u201cI\u2019d think if I was going to move out, I\u2019d take more stuff than this,\u201d he jokes. Another tabloid photo showed a moving van in front of their house, loading up a large mirror. Robin and Dr. Phil explain that they were having their house remodeled while they were on vacation. \u201cWhat you have to understand about tabloids is that what they print about public figures \u2014 and we are considered public figures \u2014 does not have to be true,\u201d Dr. Phil says. \u201cWhat they do is they go find anybody, and they pay them to be a source. These sources are always anonymous. It\u2019s always, \u2018A friend\u2019 said this, \u2018a friend\u2019 said that. They are not friends; they are cowards. They won\u2019t step up and show their face. They just do it because if your face and a scandal will sell newspapers, you\u2019re going to be on it.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s the belief that you can\u2019t live in Hollywood and be happily married, but you can,\u201d Robin says. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s really insulting to me is, if I was getting a divorce, it would be filed at the courthouse, and I would say so. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. People get divorced every day,\u201d Dr. Phil says. \u201cI would hate it. I would ask for your prayers and support. And if I got kicked out \u2026\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Dr. Phil again denounced divorce rumors from \u201cstupid tabloids,\u201d this time during an appearance on the \u201cRachael Ray Show\u201d:\n\n[My wife] lost both of her parents close together at a very young time in her life, and she said to me one day sitting on the end of the bed, \u2018You know, I\u2019m now an orphan, I\u2019ve got no people.\u2019 That\u2019s the day I told her, \u2018That\u2019s not true. Look me in the eye and let me tell you I will never leave you.\u2019 She believed it that day and it\u2019s something we take very seriously, which is why I just shake my head at these stupid tabloids \u2014 we are not getting a divorce, and for them to obsess on something that is so at the core definition of our family is just astounding to me.\n\nAs recently as September 2019, Robin posted a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d message to Phil on Instagram, including a photograph of the two of them posing in front of the famous pop art \u201cLove\u201d sculpture, describing her husband as her \u201cforever love,\u201d and proclaiming that \u201cI love you more and more with every birthday\u201d:\n\nObviously we cannot say with absolute certainty that any couple will not divorce at some point in the future. But although divorce rumors have swirled around the McGraws for 15 years or more, those rumors appear to be driven by nothing more than fabricated tabloid gossip, and the McGraws have expressed no interest or intent in divorcing, have vehemently denied such rumors multiple times, continue to work closely together, and present the outward appearance of a long-wedded couple who remain happy in their marriage:", "lang": "en"}
