Graves, a Republican from Ranger, has become one of the for a GOP push in the U.S. House to defund Obama\u2019s health care law in order to prevent the government shutdown.\n\nDuring an last weekend on ABC\u2019s \"This Week,\" Graves defended his plan and cited additional evidence to show that support for Obamacare is dwindling.\n\nIn response to a question about a Wall Street Journal editorial regarding the GOPs inept strategizing on budget issues, Graves said:\n\n\"That\u2019s their opinion. An editorial clearly is what that is. But when you read the Chicago Tribune, they say delay and stop Obamacare,\" Graves said. \"Warren Buffett says stop it now, start over. \u2026 It\u2019s not just Republicans, this is widespread.\"\n\nGraves\u2019 comments about Buffett were familiar to us and to our audience, which asked us to review the claim. Did Warren Buffett, one of Obama\u2019s early presidential backers, withdraw support for the president\u2019s signature public policy legacy?\n\nGraves\u2019 claim about Buffett was set in motion by posts from conservative bloggers, who began posting earlier this month, that the Omaha billionaire recently said \"scrap Obamacare and start all over.\" The claim originated with a Sept. 13 post on website titled \"Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start Over.\" That post used a portion of Buffett\u2019s comments from three years ago, before the health care law was passed. Other sites, including the and , linked to or included portions of the Money Morning post in their stories.\n\nOur PolitiFact national colleagues recently completed a of the bloggers\u2019 claim, and found the statements were taken out of context and not representative of Buffett\u2019s opinions. The claim was rated Pants On Fire. The same day as the Sept. 17 PolitiFact article, the Washington Examiner also ran a discrediting the bloggers\u2019 Buffett claim. And FactCheck.org the claim this week.\n\nWe asked Graves\u2019 office about his ABC News statements.\n\nThe office noted that the Money Morning claim, along with follow-up stories by other media outlets, included inaccurate timeline context with their Buffett claim. But outside of the faulty time element, Buffett did say he would stop Obamacare, start over and explain how to do that, Graves\u2019 office said. And, because Graves did not attribute an inaccurate time frame to Buffett\u2019s comments, they believe his statement was true, the office said.\n\nBut what exactly did Buffett say about Obamacare, when did he say it and what are his current thoughts on the matter?\n\nBuffett\u2019s Obamacare statements included in the Money Morning blog were taken from an he gave with CNBC on March 1, 2010. A Politico from the same year -- which was also quoted by Graves\u2019 office in response to our questions -- summarized the interview. In that interview, Buffett was asked whether he was \"in favor of scrapping this and going back to start over.\" He said: \"I would be if I were President Obama.\"\n\nWhat the blog posts and Graves did not include in their comments was the full context of Buffett\u2019s statements. At the time, Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., was referring to a pending health care bill. (The Affordable Care Act was signed into law days later on March 23, 2010.)\n\nBuffett went on to say that he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate version of the bill, but that he\u2019d vote for it instead of doing nothing. Ultimately, Buffett said he\u2019d like to see a plan that really attacked (health care) costs.\n\nLast week, Buffett the assertion that he did not support Obamacare.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,\" Buffett said in an interview with the Omaha World-Herald. \"I support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought should be done for a long, long time.\"\n\nBuffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, told us in an email that Buffett\u2019s office set the record straight for any news organization that contacted them. She also mentioned her boss\u2019s explanation during a CNBC news interview last week.\n\nAfter fact checkers began exploring the claim, the Weekly Standard updated its original blog post to say: \"It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people , has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed \u2026\"\n\nSo what about Graves\u2019 claim?\n\nThe Georgia congressman stated that Warren Buffett said stop Obamacare now and start over. The claim was similar to other blogger claims debunked by fact checkers, and based on an interview Buffett gave three years ago before Obamacare was signed into law. Buffett did say he would scrap the then Senate bill, but also noted that he would vote for it instead of continuing with the existing health care situation.\n\nGraves\u2019 claim may not have misrepresented Buffett\u2019s comments as being recent like the bloggers did, but his comments were made after similar claims about Buffett were found to be misleading. And Graves still made the claim, without any additional context, five days after several fact checkers debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
