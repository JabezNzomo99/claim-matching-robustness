Kwatra also stated that the clean-up at Juhu beach had to be postponed because of high tides and heavy rains.\n\nBOOM reached out to Kwatra, who told us that his organisation carries out beach cleaning drives independently.\n\nKwatra said, \u201cWe have been cleaning beaches for the past 97 weeks and have tagged Swacch Bharat Urban on Twitter among others for a better reach. However, our photos have been reproduced and work has not been credited in the tweets by the handle.\"\n\n\"Often people are misled by such social media posts, as they are caught unaware about who is hosting these clean-up drives and they don't know who to reach out to.\u201d\n\nElaborating on their work, Kwatra said, \u201cWe tag verified handles on Twitter so that we can reach more people who would come forth and volunteer. Though it is a positive gesture by a government organisation to post our photos, attribution of our work could only get us more 'Beach Warriors'.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, BOOM found that the official handle of Swacch Bharat Urban has recently attributed only government institution cleaning drives and identified non-profit organisations as \"Swacchagrahis\" at large.\n\nIn fact, Kwatra\u2019s work was retweeted by the handle in March, last year.", "lang": "en"}
