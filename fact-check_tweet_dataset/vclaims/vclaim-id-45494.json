RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.\n\nMr Tudge's claim is not the full story.\n\nHe homed in on a specific type of visa \u2014 the Temporary Skill Shortage visa \u2014 to make the case that Australian workers are being prioritised.\n\nThe labour market testing rules referred to by Mr Tudge, requiring employers to advertise locally before hiring temporary foreign workers, apply only to the TSS visa, and even then there are significant exemptions.\n\nFor example, labour market testing is not required when it would conflict with Australia's international trade obligations.\n\nThat means it does not apply to workers from China, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Chile, South Korea, New Zealand or Singapore.\n\nMoreover, the TSS visa represents a relatively small and shrinking proportion of the total number of visas issued in any given year that include work rights.\n\nWhether the growing numbers of foreign workers with other types of temporary work visas \u2014 for example student visas or working holiday visas \u2014 have been undercutting wages and jobs that could be filled by Australian workers is not a simple question.\n\nSome studies suggest skilled migration has had little if any impact on wages or employment.\n\nOthers suggest growing numbers of predominantly low-skilled workers, for example on student or working holiday visas, could be undercutting wages and employment, particularly for younger people.\n\nBut any evidence is anecdotal. As experts have pointed out the data is \"ropey\", partly because employers and some migrant workers are unlikely to report the underpayment of minimum wages.\n\nThis makes assessing the impact of temporary migration \u2014 skilled or otherwise \u2014 problematic.\n\nWhat is being debated?\n\nIn her opinion article, Senator Keneally said migration had played a key role in Australia's economic prosperity but in recent years the \"shape and size\" of the intake had hurt Australian workers.\n\nShe singled out a growing reliance on a \"cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour\" as the culprit.\n\nAsked to respond in the ABC Radio National interview, Mr Tudge cites a Coalition decision to replace the 457 visa with the new TSS visa for temporary skilled migrants, including the introduction of labour market testing.\n\nHe points out that the biggest category of temporary migration is New Zealanders, who under a reciprocal agreement can freely enter and exit Australia.\n\n\"Is the Labor Party is saying that we should scrap that agreement?\" Mr Tudge asked.\n\nHe also mentions student visas, saying they add enormous value to the community by spending money and creating jobs.\n\nHowever, Mr Tudge's response does not address the broader question raised by Senator Keneally of whether lower-skilled foreign workers, including those on student visas or working holiday visas, might be undercutting wages and employment for Australian workers.\n\nFact Check has previously examined the operation of Australia's temporary visa system.\n\nIn March 2018, for example, Fact Check found a claim by Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus that one in 10 workers are now on temporary visas was \"unsubstantiated\", mainly because Ms McManus's calculations assumed all temporary visa holders with the right to work were actually working.\n\nAs Fact Check noted at the time: \"Most temporary visa holders are not required to work while in Australia, and data is not kept on their working habits.\"\n\nMost visas issued in Australia are temporary. Of these, the vast bulk are tourist or business visitor visas, with no work rights.\n\nBut what about temporary visas with work rights?\n\nThe largest number are issued to New Zealanders, who are free to live and work in Australia for as long as they want (barring health or legal problems) under a longstanding trans-Tasman agreement.\n\nStudent visas represent the next most common category in any given year. For most students (with some exceptions), this visa allows up to 40 hours of paid work per fortnight during semester, with no limit during semester breaks.\n\nWorking holiday visas, allowing the visa holder to work (if they wish) in one place for a maximum of six months, are another significant category.\n\nThere are also \"other employment\" visas, a catchall class covering postgraduates, entertainers, specialists, seasonal workers, diplomats and people visiting for cultural or religious purposes.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs describes this category as visas that \"allow people to undertake short-term, non-ongoing highly specialised work, enrich social and cultural development, strengthen international relations, or provide training opportunities of benefit to Australia\".\n\nBut the type of visa that has attracted perhaps the most controversy in recent years is also one of the smallest categories: temporary resident skilled employment visas.\n\nThis category includes the now-abolished 457 visa, which allowed skilled migrants to work in specialty fields in Australia for up to four years; and its replacement, the TSS visa referred to by Mr Tudge, which includes short and long term options allowing migrants to live and work in Australia for periods up to two or four years.\n\nAs with student visas and some other temporary visas, the TSS visa is issued in two classes: \"primary\" or \"secondary\", with primary visas granted to the applicant and secondary visa to the applicant's partner or dependants.\n\nThere are no work restrictions placed on secondary visa holders.\n\nHow has the make-up of Australia's visa system changed?\n\nChris F. Wright, an associate professor at the University of Sydney Business School, said the immigration policy framework had changed profoundly in recent years, with a growing emphasis on temporary visa holders.\n\n\"Until 1996 virtually all migrants who came to Australia were given permanent residency with the same rights and protections as citizens,\" Associate Professor Wright told Fact Check.\n\n\"Since 1996 there has been a greater and increasing focus on temporary residency with visa holders not receiving many of the rights and protections available to citizens.\"\n\nThe following table shows the major types of visas that include work rights. It excludes from the totals business and tourist visas and various miscellaneous visas such as crew and transit visas not directly relevant to the debate.\n\nIt compares visas issued in 2018-19, the latest financial year for which data is available, with 2012-13, Labor's final full financial year in office.\n\nThe figures do not show the total number of people in Australia at any given time on different types of visas, or net arrivals (arrivals minus departures) by visa type.\n\nIn 2018-19 permanent skilled visas made up about 3.7 per cent of the total visas with work rights.\n\nThat was down from 4.9 per cent in 2012-13 under Labor.\n\nPermanent family visas have also become relatively less important, making up 1.6 per cent in 2018-19, compared to 2.1 per cent in 2012-13.\n\nOver the same period the share of student visas has increased significantly, from 9.8 per cent of the total to 13.7 per cent, although the share of working holiday visas fell from 9.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent.\n\nAs the graph shows, temporary skilled visas \u2014 the visa class highlighted by Mr Tudge \u2014 make up a small and shrinking share, equivalent to 2.8 per cent of the total in 2018-19, compared to 4.8 per cent in 2012-13.\n\n\n\nIn April 2017 former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull announced he was scrapping the controversial 457 visa, warning the temporary skilled migration program had \"lost its credibility\".\n\nThe replacement TSS visa came into effect in March 2018, with Mr Turnbull promising it would be \"manifestly, rigorously, resolutely conducted in the national interest to put Australians and Australian jobs first\".\n\nThe new rules included tougher English language requirements, mandatory criminal checks and a minimum of two years' experience in a relevant job.\n\nProspective employers were also required to undertake labour market testing by advertising for local workers first before hiring a foreign worker.\n\nAppearing at Mr Turnbull's media conference, the then immigration minister Peter Dutton said: \"In relation to the advertising, the advertising will be required, whereas it is not at the moment\".\n\nMr Turnbull spoke of \"mandatory labour market testing\" which he said was \"a very significant change\".\n\nIn his Radio National interview Mr Tudge says the Coalition introduced labour market testing after scrapping the 457 visa. He also says the Coalition \"strengthened\" the labour market testing provisions.\n\nIn fact, when the Howard government introduced the 457 visa in 1996, labour market testing was required under some circumstances. As a 2016 Senate inquiry report set out, labour market testing was dropped, reinstated and changed on several occasions over the years.\n\nThe broad purpose is to make sure that qualified Australians are not available for jobs being filled by temporary skilled migrant workers.\n\nIn August 2018 various changes were introduced to strengthen these requirements.\n\nBusinesses wanting to hire a temporary skilled foreign worker must demonstrate that they have tested the local labour market within the four months prior to nominating a skilled overseas worker for a TSS visa, over at least four weeks.\n\nAdvertisements must be in English; must specify skill and experience requirements; and they must specify salaries for all positions paying less than $96,400.\n\nThey must include at least two advertisements using the same approach as a national recruitment website, print media or radio with national reach, or the business website of the sponsors.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs told a recent Senate inquiry that between July 1, 2018 and February 28, 2019, there were 1,952 Temporary Skill Shortage visas that were refused for failing to meet the labour market testing criteria. That represented about 5 per cent total applications.\n\nIn particular, labour market testing is not required when it would conflict with Australia's international trade obligations \u2014 either because of general World Trade Organisation rules or because of a specific free trade agreement between Australia and another country.\n\nThat means it's not needed when the workers being nominated by an Australian sponsor are from China, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Chile, South Korea, New Zealand or Singapore.\n\nWhat are the criticisms of labour market testing?\n\nThe system has been criticised by both business groups and unions.\n\nFor example, in a 2019 Senate submission, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argues labour market testing \"does not add much value to achieving the recruitment of Australians first\" but it significantly adds to the red tape burden.\n\nIt said employers looking to hire foreign temporary workers would have likely already made \"numerous attempts\" to hire locally.\n\n\"Australia is a large country, where mobility of labour is often limited, and obtaining a skilled worker in a particular business, in a specified location at a particular point in time is a challenge for any business, and especially for regional businesses,\" the submission said.\n\nUnions, on the other hand, argue the labour market testing rules are being flouted, for example by businesses offering unreasonably poor wages and conditions in local advertising to access cheaper workers through temporary skilled migrants; or setting unrealistic and unwarranted skills and experience requirements for vacant positions to exclude otherwise suitable Australian applicants, among other things.\n\nThe final report, by the Senate's Labor-dominated Legal and Constitutional Affairs Reference Committee, recommended the Government introduce \"more stringent evidentiary requirements\" for labour market testing regime to help better protect Australian jobs.\n\nIt also said the Government should not enter into any future free trade agreements involving labour market testing waivers.\n\nBut a dissenting report written by Coalition committee members, like Mr Tudge, strongly rejected the argument that the system has not been working as intended.\n\n\"Government members of the Committee are deeply saddened by this insular and parochial position,\" the dissenting report says.\n\n\"Government Senators take an alternate view which is that the holders of skilled visas can bring great energy, diversity and opportunity to the Australian labour market.\"\n\nAre Australian jobs and wages being undercut?\n\nAccording to some labour market experts the relationship between migration levels and wages and employment is not simple.\n\nIn a March 2017 paper, Australian National University economics professor Robert Breunig and colleagues Nathan Deutscher and Hang Thi To, modelled the impact of skilled migration on employment and wages by examining different segments of the jobs market.\n\nProfessor Breunig said although migration added to the labour supply, which placed downward pressure on wages, it also added to productivity and boosted growth, which had the opposite effect, lifting wages.\n\nThe net impact was in most cases zero.\n\nSimilarly, a 2019 report by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia concluded temporary skilled migrants were among Australia's most productive workers.\n\n\"The modelling \u2026 shows that recent migrants in some cases are associated with increased labour force participation and wages for local workers although the impacts are small in magnitude,\" the report said.\n\nHowever, those two reports largely examined the impact of permanent visas and temporary skilled visas.\n\nAssociate Professor Wright pointed out that while these types of visas had played an important role in the past, they were forming an increasingly small proportion of Australia's immigration intake, which had been increasingly dominated by other temporary visas such as working holiday maker visas and international student visas.\n\nA study by the Grattan Institute's John Daley, prepared for a 2019 conference organised by the Reserve Bank of Australia, argues that growing numbers of working holiday makers and student visa holders could be helping to suppress wages growth and adding to unemployment and underemployment, particularly for younger workers.\n\nDr Daley said many of these migrants had incentives to work for less than minimum wages.\n\nHe said while there was anecdotal evidence of this, \"it is impossible for data sources on the Australian labour force to pick up all of this phenomenon\".\n\n\"It is possible that the scale of the influx to the labour market is depressing wages and increasing under-employment specifically for low-skill younger workers,\" he said.\n\nDr Daley said data on underpayment of minimum wages was \"inherently ropey\", with employers unlikely to fess up if they are paying less than the minimum wage.\n\nHe said while migration could have led to lower wages growth and higher unemployment for younger workers, \"it cannot be the primary culprit behind the broad-based slowdown in wage growth\".\n\nSome economists have questioned whether labour market testing is the best way of targeting genuine skills shortages.\n\nIn Australia \u2014 unlike some other countries such as the United Kingdom \u2014 the process of labour market testing does not involve an independent assessment of whether the skills shortage is genuine.\n\nAssociate Professor Wright said employer sponsorship was a \"fundamental design feature\" of Australia's temporary skilled visa scheme, both the 482 visa and the 457 visa before it.\n\nHe and colleague Andreea Constantin used a survey of 1,602 employers who sponsored temporary skilled visa holders in Australia to show that a large share of employers in some industries, particularly hospitality, used temporary skilled migration stream not necessarily to find suitably qualified workers, but rather to recruit workers with particular \"behavioural traits\", such as being hard working.\n\n\"Our article found that only 1 per cent of employers surveyed claimed they would increase wages or provide other incentives to potential candidates as a means of addressing their recruitment challenges,\" Associate Professor Wright said.\n\n\"This suggests that even if employers recruited temporary sponsored skilled migrants because of skill shortages that meet the generally accepted technical definition of a lack of suitably qualified workers, the skill shortages that existed were not acute.\"\n\u2022 Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Effects of temporary
