Accusing Congress President Rahul Gandhi of not supporting the government post-Balakot airstrike, the Law Minister said that media channels have provided sufficient evidence of a successful retaliation by the Indian Air Force. He said, \u201cthe BJP is proud of television channels,\u201d while citing an alleged video where Pakistanis themselves admit to the killings of 200 people. \u201cI heard and saw a video where Pakistani army personnel are consoling people who were crying.\u201d The Union Minister\u2019s statements can be heard at around 13:30 minutes into the speech.\n\nThe full transcript of his statement can be found here \u2013 \u201c\u2026\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940 \u091c\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948?\u0906\u092a \u0938\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092b \u0926\u094b \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0916\u095c\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0947, \u0926\u094b \u0926\u093f\u0928\u0964 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u090f\u092f\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0907\u0915 \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0909\u0920\u093e\u092f\u0947, \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u092e\u094b\u0936 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u092e\u0924\u0932\u092c \u0906\u092a \u092d\u0940 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0924\u0940\u0938\u0930\u093e, \u0907\u0924\u0928\u093e \u090f\u0935\u093f\u0921\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u0906\u091c \u092a\u092c\u094d\u0932\u093f\u0915 \u0921\u094b\u092e\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0906\u091c \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u091f\u0940\u0935\u0940 \u091a\u0948\u0928\u0932\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0947 \u090f\u0935\u093f\u0921\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u0915\u094b \u0930\u0916\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0935\u0940 \u0906\u0930 \u0935\u0948\u0930\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0909\u0921 \u0911\u095e \u0906\u0932 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u0935\u093f\u095b\u0928 \u091a\u0948\u0928\u0932\u094d\u0938\u0964 \u0905\u092c \u0939\u092e\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0938\u0941\u0928\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093e \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u090f\u0915 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u091c\u093f\u0938\u092e\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0928\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u093f\u0938 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0938\u0947 200 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u092e\u0930\u0947 \u0939\u0948, \u0930\u094b \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u094b \u0915\u0902\u0938\u094b\u0932 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u094b\u0936\u093f\u0936 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 (\u2026Rahul Gandhi, what\u2019s wrong with you? You were standing with the government for only two days. Later, you started questioning the airstrike. Then, when your ministers started demanding evidence, you were silent, which means that you agreed with them. Thirdly, there is so much evidence today in the public domain. On behalf of the party, I want to thank TV channels that they kept the full evidence in front of the country. We are very proud of all television channels. Now we are hearing, we also saw a video where the people of Pakistan themselves showed how 200 people had died. They are crying and Pakistan army personnel are trying to console them.)\n\nThe alleged video that the Union Minister was talking about does not pertain to Balakot. This misinformation, circulated on social media and subsequently popularised by mainstream media, was debunked by Alt News here.\n\nMultiple media organisations had posted a video shared by a US-based Gilgit activist who claimed that the video represented a Pakistani army officer admitting to the martyrdom of 200 militants. Ironically, the activist had also stated to ANIthat he does not vouch for the video\u2019s authenticity.\n\nAlt News carefully listened to the audio of the clip and found that Pakistani army men and others in the video were not talking about the martyrdom of 200 militants, but the death of only one man.\n\nHere\u2019s what the audio says \u2013 \u201c\u092f\u0947 \u0930\u0941\u0924\u092c\u093e \u0905\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0939 \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0959\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0928\u0938\u0940\u092c \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948. \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u092a\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u091b 200 \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0947 \u090a\u092a\u0930 \u0917\u090f \u0925\u0947? \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0938\u0940\u092c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0925\u093e \u0936\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0924. \u0939\u092e \u0930\u094b\u095b\u093e\u0928\u093e \u091a\u095d\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948, \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948, \u0906\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948. \u0924\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u0905\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0939 \u0915\u0947 \u0959\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0947, \u091c\u093f\u0938\u092a\u0947 \u0915\u0930\u092e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u091c\u093f\u0938\u092a\u0947 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0940 \u0959\u093e\u0938 \u0928\u095b\u0930-\u0913-\u0915\u0930\u092e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938\u0915\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u0928\u0938\u0940\u092c \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u2026\u092a\u0930\u0947\u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0926 \u092e\u0930\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948, \u095b\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e \u0939\u0948. \u092e\u0930\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0947. (This is a privilege received by only a few men special to God. Did you know some 200 men went up? Martyrdom was in his destiny. We climb every day, we go and come back. So he is special to God, who had God\u2019s mercy, and was destined for this. Don\u2019t get worried, your father is not dead, he is alive. You shouldn\u2019t say he is dead.)\u201d\n\nWhile talking to the child, who can be seen sitting on the lap of a Pakistani army officer, someone from behind the camera says that he should not cry over his father\u2019s death. Some 200 men had gone up (the mountains or hills) but only the child\u2019s father did not return.\n\nAlt News also discovered the video of the man\u2019s burial rites, where scenes from the viral video are visible as well.\n\nThere are several other hints in the video that suggest it does not represent the aftermath of Balakot airstrike. For instance, the presence of thick snow in the background while ground reports from Balakot show no signs of the same. Alt News also reached out to sources in the Pakistani media who informed that the man who died was a civilian porter, Ehsanullah. He suffered a heart attack on February 28 while assisting an army unit. Ehsanullah\u2019s funeral rites took place on March 1 in Singhara Darora, Upper Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. We checked on Google maps that Balakot is at least 300 km away from the said location. Alt News\u2019s detailed investigative report can be read here. Since the Pulwama attack and India\u2019s February 26 airstrike in Balakot, not only social media but mainstream media has also been a prominent contributor to the fake news cycle. Furthermore, we have observed that politicians too have not shied away from indulging in circulating misinformation. Not only did Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cite the misleading video in a public address but Union Minister Shandilya Giriraj Singh shared it on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
