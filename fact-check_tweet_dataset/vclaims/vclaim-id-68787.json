Republican candidate for governor John Cox has pledged that, if elected, he\u2019ll hack through California\u2019s thicket of regulations, in an effort to reduce expenses.\n\nSpecifically, Cox wants to reform the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, an agency he has described as overstaffed and wasteful.\n\nRecently, he claimed Caltrans spends an exorbitant amount to build and maintain each mile of roadway compared with other states.\n\n\"It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation,\" Cox said in an interview published on the Political Vanguard website on Oct. 19, 2017.\n\n\"California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\" CEI is a libertarian think tank which sourced the statistic to the Reason Foundation, another free market think tank.\n\nFollowing both statements, Cox went on to advocate for greater reliance on private construction to reduce expenses.\n\nThere\u2019s a debate about why it\u2019s so expensive to build roads in California. But we\u2019re not fact-checking that debate. Instead, we\u2019re zeroing in on Cox\u2019s specific claims that California's road spending is \"nearly five times\" per mile compared with other states.\n\nOn his campaign website, Cox describes himself as a \"Jack Kemp-style Republican who grew up on Chicago\u2019s south-side.\" Today, he\u2019s a San Diego businessman who \"founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities.\"\n\nHis priorities, as listed on his website, include lowering California\u2019s taxes and fighting the influence of special interests.\n\nCox is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, an effort to repeal California\u2019s recent gas tax increase, which was signed into law this year to raise money for road repairs. The increase includes a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase, which went into effect this week.\n\nWe asked Cox\u2019s campaign for evidence supporting his claims.\n\nIt pointed to recent reports by the Reason Foundation, which studies transportation spending.\n\nIn 2013, the foundation published its \"20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems.\"\n\nThat report shows California spent nearly $680,000 per mile in 2009 on roadways. That was 4.7 times as much as the national average of approximately $144,000 per mile spent in other states. That matches Cox\u2019s claim of \"nearly five times\" as much.\n\nBut our research shows, and Cox\u2019s campaign has acknowledged, the information from 2009 is outdated.\n\nAn updated 2016 Reason Foundation study shows California spent about $420,000 per mile in 2013 compared with the national average spending of about $160,000 per mile in the same year.\n\nThat data places California\u2019s spending at about 2.5 times the national average, far less than Cox\u2019s claims.\n\nWe asked Cox\u2019s staff about the discrepancy. David Kersten, a policy analyst with the campaign, said the candidate didn\u2019t have the most up-to-date figures.\n\n\"When he wrote that (San Francisco Chronicle) op-ed, he didn\u2019t have that new number,\" Kersten told us in an interview. \"Everybody was using the older report.\"\n\nMatt Shupe, Cox\u2019s campaign spokesman, said he and Kersten would update Cox on the new figure and use it in future statements.\n\nCox\u2019s staff noted that one category of California\u2019s road spending, administrative costs, totals nearly five times as much the national average, even in the 2016 report. We checked and the report does show that, though Cox\u2019s staffers acknowledged that\u2019s not the same statement the candidate made in the op-ed or in his Political Vanguard interview and at the center of this fact check.\n\nCaltrans, the agency targeted by Cox, disagrees with the methodology of the Reason Foundation studies. A Caltrans spokesman said much of the studies\u2019 roadway data is from local streets and roads not built or maintained by the state. The spokesman also noted that California\u2019s state roadways are larger and more congested than in other states, making them more expensive to build and maintain.\n\nRepresentatives for the Reason Foundation did not respond to our interview requests.\n\nRepublican candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed it costs \"nearly five times as much\" in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation.\n\nA study using 2009 data shows California spent 4.7 times as much per mile as the national average on roads. Updated data from 2013 shows the state\u2019s spending still far above the national average at about 2.5 times the cost per mile, but far lower than Cox\u2019s figure.\n\nCox\u2019s campaign staff told us the candidate relied on outdated information and would be updating this figure in future statements.\n\nWhile the candidate\u2019s larger point about higher road spending in California appears to be correct, his specific claim about it being \"nearly five times\" as much per mile is outdated and wrong.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nJohn Cox is among several candidates competing to succeed Jerry Brown in the 2018 California governor's race.
