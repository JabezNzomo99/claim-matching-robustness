In terms of political strategy, the approach may make sense: Even though the health-care law is unpopular, repealing it does even worse in polling. The ad also suggests Democrats see an edge in embracing the law, rather than running away from it.\n\nThe ad also asserts that Tillis supports a plan that \u201cwould end Medicare as we know it.\u201d The Fact Checker awarded the group Four Pinocchios for an earlier ad that said a GOP plan would \u201cend Medicare.\u201d The addition of \u201cas we know it\u201d appears to be a tweak to address that critique, though it certainly leaves the same impression.\n\nThe ad seeks to highlight three of the more popular provisions in the law: no more denying coverage for preexisting conditions; free preventive services such as mammograms; a gradual elimination (by 2020) of the \u201cdoughnut hole,\u201d or coverage gap, in the Medicare prescription drug program. (The coverage gap accounts for the ad\u2019s claim that $1,700 more would be spent on prescriptions, if it were 2020, but some of coverage gap still exists.)\n\nBut Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw says that the candidate thinks there \u201care many good ideas\u201d in a conservative alternative unveiled by other senator from North Carolina, Richard Burr (R), as well as Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah.) \u201cAs it relates to this ad and the ACA, Speaker Tillis\u2019s opposition to Obamacare should not be seen as opposition to working toward solutions that result in lower costs and improved access to health insurance,\u201d Shaw said. The Burr/Coburn/Hatch plan \u201cis definitely a better option than the Affordable Care Act and a positive step toward a conservative alternative.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one of the sources cited in the ad, a USA Today article, quotes a conservative analyst as saying that, in the wake of the law\u2019s implementation, any repeal of it would require an alternative that kept key elements in place:\n\nBob Moffitt, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Policy Innovation, said any repeal would have to be followed by a new law that includes many similar elements. Those include health insurance plans for those with pre-existing conditions and the ability for people to keep insurance purchased through health exchanges. Moffitt cited the recent proposal from Republican Sens. Richard Burr, Orrin Hatch and Tom Coburn as a way to maintain those benefits.\n\nWe make no judgment on the specifics of the Burr/Coburn/Hatch proposal; critics on the left have faulted the provision concerning preexisting conditions as being not as comprehensive as the ACA. Notably, however, the proposal makes no changes to the Medicare aspects, presumably meaning that the ACA\u2019s gradual elimination of the doughnut hole would remain on course.\n\nTy Matsdorf, a spokesman for Political Majority USA, said that Tillis \u201chas been extremely vocal about repeal\u201d but has not offered an alternative. \u201cThey might like some of the provisions [of Burr/Coburn/Hatch], but that is very different than having a concrete replacement proposal after repeal.\u201d\n\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act makes it increasingly difficult to ever repeal it. In effect, the introduction of a Republican alternative means that senior lawmakers recognize that they will only be able to revise it, while leaving other parts intact.\n\nYet for reasons of internal GOP politics, every candidate appears to be expected to pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, thus giving Democrats an opening to claim that Republicans \u2014 if only briefly \u2014 want to go back to the old insurance regime. But just as repeal is increasingly not credible, neither are claims that Republicans simply want to turn back the clock. (Tillis, however, certainly would have a better defense if he specifically embraced or proposed an alternative.)", "lang": "en"}
