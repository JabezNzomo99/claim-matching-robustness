Trey Gowdy the \u201chighest level of security clearance\u201d?\n\nA: No. That is a months-old fictitious claim that continues to circulate online.\n\nSome online stories would have readers believe that President Donald Trump gave Rep. Trey Gowdy \u2014 the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \u2014 the \u201chighest level of security clearance possible,\u201d as one website put it.\n\nThose reports are false, as some Facebook users suspected and reported.\n\nA story published on mediaconservative.com with no byline alleged that the South Carolina congressman \u201chas been given the highest level of security clearance possible, granted with an executive order from the President himself.\u201d\n\nTrump has not signed such an executive order. It is not listed on the White House\u2019s log of presidential actions. Nor does such an order appear on the Federal Register\u2019s lists of executive orders in 2017 or 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress do have access to intelligence \u201cby virtue of their elected positions,\u201d according to the CIA. The agency says that \u201cclassified intelligence reports are routinely provided only to the committees that have responsibilities in the national security area.\u201d\n\nGowdy is also a member of the House intelligence committee.\n\nWhile the mediaconservative.com story was posted Jan. 31 (and again March 9), the fictitious claim about Gowdy has circulated since at least late last year \u2014 when it appeared on thelastlineofdefense.online, which bills its work as \u201cconservative satire\u201d and states that \u201ceverything on this website is fiction.\u201d The website is on our list of known purveyors of fake and satirical stories.\n\nThe story didn\u2019t stop at claiming that Trump gave Gowdy the \u201chighest level of security clearance possible.\u201d It also claimed without attribution that Gowdy\u2019s next task \u201creportedly would be to investigate the extent to which Barack Obama went when he supplied the Muslim Brotherhood with weapons after they took control over Egypt by force.\u201d\n\nA member of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 a political Islamist group that began in Egypt in 1928 \u2014 did become the president of Egypt in 2012, but not by force. Mohamed Morsi was the country\u2019s first democratically elected president and held office until 2013, when he was ousted and jailed in a deadly coup by Egyptian armed forces.\n\nIt was after the coup that the Obama administration ended military aid to the country \u2014 a moratorium that Obama later lifted in 2015.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nKirkpatrick, David D. \u201cArmy Ousts Egypt\u2019s President; Morsi Is Taken Into Military Custody.\u201d New York Times. 3 Jul 2013.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump Just Made Trey Gowdy The Most Powerful Man In Capitol Hill.\u201d Mediaconservative.com. 31 Jan 2018.", "lang": "en"}
