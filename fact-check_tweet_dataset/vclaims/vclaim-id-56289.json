A day after, Robredo herself supposedly showed up at the hospital, but the president refused to meet her.\n\nThe claim was shared by several Facebook pages and accounts as early as Sunday, June 21. Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool called Claim Check flagged at least 7 posts that contained this claim.\n\nThe facts: The Diliman Doctors Hospital released a statement on Tuesday, June 23, denying the rumors. Vice President Leni Robredo also said the incident \u201cnever happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur institution received food donation on 3 occasions from the Office of the Vice President, but none of which have been found to be spoiled,\u201d the hospital said in its official statement.\n\nThe hospital added that Gutierrez or any representative from the OVP never showed up in its premises to offer bribes. \u201cDiliman Doctors Hospital is focused [on] providing the medical needs of the community in this time of health crisis,\u201d the hospital added.\n\nOn June 22, Robredo also posted on Facebook to deny the claims and urge the readers to report the people who spread the rumors about her office.\n\n\u201cIf there was no malice, you should have checked first before posting. You should know that posting fake news makes you criminally liable,\u201d Robredo said. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
