Won't you welcome us,\" reads a caption with the video, referring to Afzal Guru, a separatist Kashmiri who was awarded death sentence for his role in the 2001 Parliament attack. Guru was executed in 2013.\n\nThe video comes at a time when the government has plans to redraws the map of Jammu and Kashmir. On August 5, Home Minister Amit Shah announced in Rajya Sabha that Article 370 - which grants autonomy to the J&K - will be scrapped. Internet and phone services stay suspended in Kashmir and Section 144 has been imposed in Srinagar banning public gatherings.\n\nYou can watch the video below and access its archived link here.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on screen grabs from the video and was able to track the same clip to February 2019, shared on social media albeit with a different claim. You can view the posts below.\n\nThe same video has also been shared on YouTube this February with similar claims.\n\nAll the above videos have been shared in February this year. The Indian Air force had struck training camps of the terrorist group \u201cJaish-e-Mohammad\u201d in Balakot, Pakistan on February 26, 2019.\n\nBOOM watched the video closely and found that towards the end, the camera focuses on a motorcycle with registration number JK-02 which is the vehicle registration of Jammu city.\n\nWhen BOOM had earlier come across the same clip on social media in February, we had contacted a local from Jammu who told us that the video was from there. \"This is Vijaypur crossing near Samba. It's a recent video,\" the person had told BOOM.\n\nWhile BOOM could not independently identify the exact location where the video was recorded, we were able to track the video's existence much before the present political developments in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nALSO READ: Article 370 Scrapped, Jammu and Kashmir To Be Bifurcated: What We Know", "lang": "en"}
