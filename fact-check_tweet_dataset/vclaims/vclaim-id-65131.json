It has resurfaced in the budget debate in comments on websites such as the Huffington Post and TheNation.com.\n\n \n\n In announcing the $100,000 figure, the institute produced a video that included brief clips of an MPS administrator reciting salary and fringe benefit numbers during a school board meeting the previous day. The average total compensation figure for teachers exceeded $100,000.\n\n \n\n We asked MacIver spokesman Brian Farley if he had any additional evidence. He cited a February 2011 posting from the School Zone blog on JSOnline.com, which reported slightly different numbers than those in MacIver\u2019s video.\n\n \n\n The posting quoted MPS\u2019 budget manager as saying that in 2011-2012 (the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2011), the average MPS teacher would receive total compensation of $101,091 -- $59,500 in salary and $41,591 in benefits.\n\n \n\n We double-checked with MPS spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin and she confirmed the figures.\n\n \n\n We wanted to compare the $101,091 for MPS teachers to other teachers, but the latest figures compiled by the state Department of Public Instruction are for 2009-2010, two years earlier.\n\n \n\n Those figures show for 2009-2010, MPS teachers earned, on average, $56,095 in salary plus $30,202 in benefits, for a total of $86,297.\n\n \n\n That was lower than eight other school districts in Milwaukee County, including Greendale, Greenfield, Shorewood, Cudahy, Fox Point, South Milwaukee, Franklin and Nicolet, which was highest at just over $103,000.\n\n \n\n Let\u2019s return to the MacIver Institute claim.\n\n \n\n The conservative think tank said the average annual compensation for a Milwaukee Public Schools teacher would exceed $100,000 in 2011. As of July 1, 2011, according to the school district, that figure will be $101,091.\n\n \n\n MacIver\u2019s claim is True.", "lang": "en"}
