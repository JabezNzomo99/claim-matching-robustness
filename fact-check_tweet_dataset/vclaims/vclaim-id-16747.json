And he said that for anyone to pretend otherwise would be, and I quote, \u2018flying in the face of reality\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea have repeatedly said that there shouldn\u2019t be customs checks on the Northern Irish border. The problem, for those worried about the prospect, is that it\u2019s not their choice to make.\n\nThe government\u2019s position before the referendum was that \u201coutside the EU\u2019s Customs Union, it would be necessary to impose customs checks on the movement of goods across the border\u201d.\n\nMr Lidington\u2019s remarks in May reflect the official line at the time, although they seem to have been about the Common Travel Area facilitating the movement of people rather than customs checks on goods. But the point he made can be applied equally to customs checks: \u201cthis would depend on what Ireland's obligations were with an EU of 27\u201d.\n\nThe UK can\u2019t negotiate directly with Ireland to keep free trade across the border. Trade negotiations are an all-EU matter\u2014individual countries like Ireland aren\u2019t allowed to strike their own deals.\n\nEven if an EU-UK trade agreement is reached, with the UK outside the customs union there would still have to be some kind of customs checks on the Irish border. That\u2019s because such agreements come with \u2018rules of origin\u2019 to verify that goods purporting to be from Ireland don\u2019t actually come from, say, China. These rules of origin would need to be enforced somehow.\n\nWe go into more detail in this piece.", "lang": "en"}
