And owners of domains who reside in Crimea lost what they had earned.\u201d\n\n \n\n Klimenko then said: \u201cOur country must be prepared that it will be cut off from the worldwide internet -- the likelihood of 'tectonic shifts' in our relations with the West in the direction of deterioration.\u201d\n\n \n\n Internet experts contacted by Polygraph.info said that it is theoretically possible to cut off much of a country\u2019s access to the internet from the outside.\n\nAmong the possible ways would be to cut fiber optic cables going in and out of the country, they said. Another possibility would be to convince telecommunications providers to coordinate an attempted shutdown and sever services simultaneously, they added.\n\n \n\n Despite that, a total shutdown of Russian internet service would be a highly impractical endeavor, according to experts.\n\nSimilar to most countries, Russia has a diverse and redundant fiber-optic infrastructure that provides access to the internet through Europe and Asia, internet expert Doug Madory told Polygraph.info in an email.\n\n \n\n \u201cThere are multiple telecoms with multiple international links,\u201d said Madory, the director of internet analysis at Dyn, a company that monitors internet performance. \u201cIt is not like North Korea with a single link to the outside.\u201d\n\n \n\n Khatuna Mshvidobadze, a professor of cyber security at Utica College, told Polygraph.info: \u201cIt would require a coalition of European and Asian governments to cut off the internet to Russia \u2013 an impossible mission.\u201d\n\nMoreover, she added, Russia has satellite uplinks and downlinks, guaranteeing that the country could not be completely cut off from the global web.\n\nMshvidobadze said that to deny Russia internet access \u201cany imaginable technological capability would not only be incredibly expensive, it is yet to be developed.\u201d\n\n \n\n Jeffrey Carr, an expert in cyber-warfare and the head of Taia Global, told Polygraph.info that cutting Russia off the internet \u201cis not realistic at all. Even if every U.S. telecommunications provider cuts Russia out - which would never happen - Russia could access the global internet through any of China\u2019s telecommunications companies.\u201d\n\n \n\n Christopher Burgess, the chief executive officer at Prevendra, a cyber-security firm, told Polygraph.info that while it is possible to block certain domains from the internet, \u201cno country or a coalition would universally block \u2018.ru.\u2019\u201d \u2013 the Russian internet domain.\n\nAnd, even if that were to be attempted, it does not mean that Russia would be taken off the internet, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is theoretically possible, but improbable,\" Burgess said. \"At best, there would be a disruption.\u201d\n\n \n\n As for Klimenko's comment on how some Western providers cut access to Crimea on specific commercial services, Burgess said \u201cthe service providers Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard were mandated to deny services to the Crimea region following its annexation,\u201d he said.\n\nBurgess added that domain owners lost access to the advertising offerings of Google\u2019s Adwords, Microsoft Bing, and other providers.\n\n \n\n But that is a far cry from Russia from being cut off from the internet.\n\n \n\n \u201cThey haven't blocked internet connections themselves, just the ability of people in Crimea to access the websites of certain U.S. companies,\u201d cyber expert Madory said:\n\n \n\n Russia itself holds the keys to locking itself out of the global internet, experts say.\n\n \n\n \u201cIf the Russian government were to order the major Russian telecoms to disable their international connections, they would likely be required to comply,\u201d Madory said.\n\n \n\n \u201cIf the two major fixed line carriers (Rostelecom, TTK) and \u2018big three\u2019 mobile networks (MTS, Vimpelcom, Megafon) cut their links to the outside world, it would disable much of the international capacity for Russia,\" he said.", "lang": "en"}
