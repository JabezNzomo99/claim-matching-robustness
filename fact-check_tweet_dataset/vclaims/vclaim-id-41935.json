Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Bangladeshis entering into Assam after the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Parliament. Fact: The posted video is an old one. Amit Shah has introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha on 09 December 2019. But the posted video can be found in circulation from January 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a video of \u2018News Nation\u2019 with the same visuals was found in the search results. The \u2018News Nation\u2019 video has the following description: \u2018Exclusive: Bangladeshi immigrants infiltration video from Silchar border\u2019 and was uploaded on 22 January 2019. But, Amit Shah has introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha on 09 December 2019. So, an old video is being shared again to mislead the people. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the video was not taken after the CAB\u2019s introduction in the Parliament.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
