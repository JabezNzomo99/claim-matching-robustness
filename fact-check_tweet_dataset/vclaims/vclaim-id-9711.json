Not really. The claim is being pushed by an unreliable website based on a few tweets and a Craigslist ad.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 25, 2018 on YourNewsWire titled \"Busted: Soros Paid March For Our Lives Protestors $300 Each\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAt least this time YourNewsWire mentions where their \"reports\" come from so we can actually check the primary sources, most notably the Craigslist ad (archived here). The text of that ad read (our highlights):\n\nMARCH FOR OUR LIVES anti-gun violence protest! Street team! CASH PAID (Los Angeles)\n\ncompensation: cash\n\nWE ARE HIRING UP UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING AT 7 PM STILL HIRING 20-25 outgoing salespeople to sell merchandise at the gun March for Our Lives gun control protest. 50,000-100,000 people expected at Pershing Square in downtown L.A. SATURDAY, MARCH 24th We will be selling March for Our Lives buttons, flags, wristbands, etc\n\nSo basically an ad for hiring temporary merchandise salespeople earning a commission. But via his Twitter account Jacob Wohl also reported replying to the ad and getting following reply back:\n\nIt is unclear who the \"Glenn Buchwald\" is who supposedly sent that mail or if (and how) he is connected to George Soros. The article or the Twitter account provide no proof or evidence for this. They also don't prove the money was actually paid and if each of the reported 500,000 to 800,000 marchers in Washington D.C. alone received the same amound of money.\n\nIt would have cost Soros between $25 million ($50 for 500,000 people) and $240 million ($300 for 800,000 people) for the Washington march alone if the article was true (not counting costs for administration and transaction fees). And there would be way more evidence available from thousands of people telling their friends online they received all this cash and urging them to sign on too. So we're going to go ahead and call this one fake.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are the most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Forgive 4,444 Pedophile Priests In Australia\n\u2022 Fake News: Obama Did NOT Announce Bid To Become UN Secretary General\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Did NOT Cut Pedophile's Prison Term Claiming 3-Yr-Old Asked To Be Raped\n\u2022 Fake News: Former Bill Gates Doctor Did NOT Say Billionaire Refused To Vaccinate His Children\n\nYourNewsWire has published several other hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" even lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
