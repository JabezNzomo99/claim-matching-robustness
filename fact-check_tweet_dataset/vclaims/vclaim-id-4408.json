The post suggested that the scores were settled as the victim in the Mandsaur rape case was a Hindu and the alleged rapist, a Muslim; in revenge for Kathua where it was the other way round. The post caused outrage on social media with many latching on to it as an example of the reaction of Muslims to the Mandsaur rape. The post was written with an obvious intention to provoke and create a communal divide \u2013 it achieved its objective. Who is this Rajiya Bano with such spiteful views? Is it a real person or a fake account? Let us find out.\n\nAccording to the Facebook profile, Rajiya Bano lives in Karachi, Pakistan and is a faculty member at Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU). She also claims to have studied fashion art at the same university. There are many clues in the profile and the posts of this account that point to Rajiya Bano being a fake account.\n\nThe most noticeable point at the first glance is that the correct spelling of the name should be \u201cRaziya\u201d and not \u201cRajiya\u201d. Many Hindi speakers may pronounce \u201cz\u201d as \u201cj\u201d as the alphabet doesn\u2019t exist in Hindi but for a Pakistani to do the same seems highly unlikely. One can argue that a misspelt name alone is not enough proof of a fake profile but what we discovered about \u201cRajiya Bano\u201d via the said person\u2019s Facebook profile confirmed our suspicions.\n\nThe photograph used by the account is a common profile picture that has been used for many years. This is a trend seen in many fake accounts where they use pictures floating on the Internet. Alt News had exposed an account giniromet which used the same tactics.\n\nIt was a Facebook post on 20 May that fully exposed our hate-spewing Rajiya Bano and blew the cover of this fake profile. The replies to a post that asked \u201cKya haal hai doston\u201d post has comments inquiring why has this person changed his name. In one of the comments, the person is addressed as \u201cSharma Ji\u201d, while in another comment this person is addressed as \u201cPawan\u201d. The person can be seen engaging with his friends in his new avatar. \u201cJust wait and watch dear\u201d, said Sharma ji. The fake profile of Rajiya Bano has now been deleted. Many unsuspecting social media users fell for his post and outraged about the reaction of Muslims to the Mandsaur rape. This person\u2019s agenda was sinister and he did not think twice about using the horrendous rape of a child to create communal tension. Watch out, the faker is still around on social media, probably cooking up new ways to fulfil his divisive agenda.", "lang": "en"}
