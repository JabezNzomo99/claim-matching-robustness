Only Niger saved us by some two points. We probably owe a debt of gratitude to Niger, we would have been last. You look at our combined score of 44 (2019), that\u2019s way lower than Singapore which had the highest score of 88\u2026when you read that report which I\u2019ve taken my time to do it draws attention to the fact that we are the focus in this country too much on enrollment\u201d\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. It conveys the productivity of the next generation of workers compared to a benchmark of complete education and full health across 157 countries.\n\nThe HCI is made up of five indicators: the probability of survival to age five, a child\u2019s expected years of schooling, harmonized test scores as a measure of the quality of learning, adult survival rate (fraction of 15-year olds that will survive to age 60), and the proportion of children who are not stunted.\n\nThe maiden edition of the World Bank\u2019s HCI report was published in October 2018 and subsequently captured in the 2019 World Development Report (WDR).\n\nMr Ablakwa claimed Ghana was \u201clast but one\u201d in the HCI report which sought to suggest that the country ranked 156 out of the 157 countries. But this is false because Ghana ranked 116, leaving behind 41 countries including South Africa (126) and Nigeria (152).\n\nFurther, Ghana scored 0.44, and not 44 as indicated in the claim. The HCI score ranges between 0 and 1, and therefore Ghana could not have attained 44.\n\nHe further alleged that Ghana was two points behind Niger that ranked last. Niger scored 0.32 to rank 155 out of 157. Niger never emerged last on the HCI chart. It was Chad that emerged last in the HCI ranking.\n\nThe Harmonized Test Scores is only one of five Human Capital Index indicators and Digital news platform, Graphiconline in a June 2019 article reported Ghana\u2019s low score in the HTS, ranking last but one among 157 countries.\n\nHowever, Okudzeto Ablakwa mischaracterised Ghana\u2019s ranking in the Harmonized Test Scores which is a subset of the HCI as representing our position on the Index.\n\nGhana scored 307 in the HTS, falling short of the 391 average scores by her peers in Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) bracket. But the Harmonized Test Scores ranking does not reflect the whole Human Capital Index, World Bank Program Leader for Human Development Antonio Giuffrida confirmed to GhanaFact in an email.\n\nGhanaFact contacted the former deputy education minister and he partly said:\n\n\u201cI did not get anything wrong. If you look at the Harmonized Test Score, assessing quality, Niger was the country that saved us from being last and that was what I was referring to. I was specifically talking about quality. I was not talking about the whole HCI, I was referring to quality at the basic level which we need to fix as a country.\u201d\n\nThis notwithstanding, GhanaFact checks from his comments on the TV3 programme as captured in this report show he did not limit his argument to HTS but rather wrongly suggested the 2019 Human Capital Index report ranked Ghana last but one in the world.\n\nWe rate the claim that Ghana was ranked last but one in the 2019 World Bank Human Capital Index report as false.", "lang": "en"}
