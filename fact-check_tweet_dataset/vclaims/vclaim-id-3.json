The Instagram post had 7,992 likes as of February 18. 2020.\n\nThis claim is false. The photograph shows four young women and a young man standing on the street in a black and white photo, alongside a caption that reads \u201cBernie Sanders at the stonewall riots\u201d and his name printed at the bottom left.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 Communication Director Mike Casca confirmed to Reuters via email that the photo does not show Sanders.\n\nThe photograph is a black and white version of a colour photo that has been used in multiple memes in recent years (examples here, here and here) \u2013 the oldest we could find was 2015. Reuters was unable to verify if the original photo was part of a company\u2019s marketing campaign or organically posted online.\n\nThe Stonewall uprising (more here) was a rebellion against the police raid of a New York City gay bar 50 years ago. The riots happened in the spirit of 1969, when protests against the war in Vietnam coincided with the African-American, Latino and women\u2019s rights movements. On June 28, 1969, New York police raided the Stonewall Inn, ostensibly to bust an illegal Mafia-owned establishment selling watered-down liquor without a license. But police also abused the patrons as they had done to gays many times before. Police also suspected the bar\u2019s management was blackmailing wealthy customers by threatening to out them as gay. The patrons of the Stonewall had had enough, and they fought back (a look back available on Reuters.com here).\n\nBy the 1960\u2019s, Bernie Sanders had moved to Vermont full-time (see here), where he began writing about revolutionary thought against the establishment, contributing to a paper called the Vermont Freeman (see here). The Senator has been outspoken in his support for LGBT+ rights in the past (see here). In March 1969, his son Levi Sanders was born, also in Vermont, making Bernie a new father to a three-month-old at the age of 27 at the time of Stonewall. Sanders began his political career in 1971 (see here).\n\nSome may have drawn resemblance between the young man in the photograph and Bernie because of footage of Sanders getting arrested during Civil Rights protests in 1963, ase seen here . A young Sanders can be seen getting arrested by police wearing a black sweatshirt and similar glasses to the young man in the photograph.\n\nThe claim that the photograph of young people standing in front of a \u201cstone wall\u201d shows Senator Bernie Sanders at the stonewall riots is false \u2013 the photograph shows an unidentified, more recent group of youngsters.\n\nFalse: This is not a photograph of Bernie Sanders at the Stonewall riots", "lang": "en"}
