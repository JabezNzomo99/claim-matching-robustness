They rejected separation when oil was $100 a barrel. They have twice as much reason to do it now that oil is $50 a barrel.\u201d\n\nIt is correct that crude oil prices are currently at around $50 a barrel. Back at the time of the first Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 oil was selling for just over $90 a barrel.\n\nEnergy policy, and how oil revenue would be invested, was part of the Scottish government\u2019s vision for an independent Scotland.\n\nWe don\u2019t know of any polls that asked the Scottish people what they thought about oil prices during the referendum, but we do know their views on the economy.\n\nBefore the referendum roughly a third of people polled thought Scotland\u2019s economy would do better if it was independent and a third felt it would do worse, according to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey.\n\nThe last Scottish independence referendum had a turnout of almost 85% of those eligible. 55% of those voters said No to independence and 45% said Yes.\n\nDespite the falling price of oil, these proportions haven\u2019t changed much. A number of polls have suggested that if the independence referendum was run again the result would be similar. Some polls suggest that the proportion of people saying they would vote Yes may even have increased by a few percentage points.", "lang": "en"}
