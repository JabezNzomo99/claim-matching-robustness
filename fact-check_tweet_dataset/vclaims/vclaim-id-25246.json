The post translates to 'the country's watchman tea seller is a thief'.\n\nThe image was posted to the Facebook page 'Punya Prasun Bajpai Fans Club' on January 6, 2019. Click here to view an archived version of the post.\n\nWhen BOOM looked for the photo on Bagga's official twitter handle, we found images of the same t-shirt shared by him on September 21, 2018. However, the caption on the t-shirt in the original image reads, 'Desh Ka Chowkidar' in Hindi.\n\nThe words 'Chai Wala Chor Hai' have been photoshopped into the image.\n\nWe also found the exact same photo tweeted by him on December 2, 2018.\n\nBagga had also tweeted photos of himself along with others clad in similar t-shirts on September 26, 2018,\n\n\n\n\n\n The post reads: Met chowkidar brothers in Dwarka today and gifted them Desh Ka Chowkidar T-shirts. They said Rahul Gandhi should apologize for his denigrating comment on chowkidar.\n\n\n\nA photoshopped image of Bagga wearing a t-shirt with #Mera PM Chor Hai ('My PM is a thief') written over it had gone viral on Twitter and Facebook in September 2018 as well.
