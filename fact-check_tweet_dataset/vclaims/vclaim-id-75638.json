The apex court has refrained from relaxing its order despite being accused of being insensitive to sentiments of many Hindus and also despite appeals from the trader community.\n\nIn 2016, post Diwali, the air quality of the national capital deteriorated severely and the city was covered with toxic smog. The Supreme Court stepped in imposing a ban on the sale of fire crackers in November 2016.\n\nHowever, the court relaxed its order on September 12, 2017 only to be reversed on October 9th, days ahead of Diwali this year.\n\nWhat happened to air quality in Delhi during the Diwali season in 2016\n\nAir quality had deteriorated at an alarming rate as PM 2.5 levels hit record high in several parts of the city.\n\nPM 2.5 are particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers found in the air. These microscopic solid particles and liquid droplets upon inhalation can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and lungs increasing the risks cardiopulmonary diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and can even lead to a stroke.\n\nThe prescribed standard for 24 hour average PM 2.5 level in the air is 60 \u03bcg/m3 as set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India's pollution watchdog. This is much higher than the 25 \u03bcg/m3 standard set by the World Health Organisation (\u03bcg/m3 refers to micrograms per cubic metre).\n\nOn the day of Diwali, PM 2.5 levels in Delhi had crossed severe levels. (see the definition of severe, below)\n\nHere's what air pollution looked like in eight locations across Delhi-NCR a week before Diwali, on Diwali day and a week after the festival in 2016.\n\nPM 2.5 levels in 8 locations of Delhi \u2013 NCR (\u03bcg/m3 for 24 hours average)\n\nAt Punjabi Marg in west Delhi, PM 2.5 level was already 2 times higher than the prescribed standard of 60 \u03bcg/m3. On Diwali day PM 2.5 level rose to 7 times the prescribed standard which soared to 13 times, a week after Diwali.\n\nAt R K Puram in south Delhi, PM 2.5 level was 2.5 times higher a week before Diwali, 5 times on Diwali and 12 times a week after Diwali \u2013 the prescribed standard.\n\nAt Anand Vihar in north Delhi, PM 2.5 level was 3 times higher a week before Diwali, it increased 6 times on Diwali and 14 times \u2013 the prescribed standard.\n\nHow was Diwali 2016 different from Diwali 2015?\n\nPollution levels during Diwali was higher in 2016 than in 2015. As data from 3 locations \u2013 Punjabi Marg, R K Puram and Anand Vihar shows, PM 2.5 levels which were at comparable levels before the day of Diwali, soared in 2016 compared to 2015 post Diwali.\n\nDay 1 to Day 14 in 2016 refer to Oct 24 to Nov 06. In 2015 it is Nov 05 to Nov 18.\n\nWhile PM 2.5 concentration in the air subsided in 2015 post Diwali, it increased alarmingly to peak levels in 2016.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nAverage wind speed on Diwali day 2016 was 1.3 metre per second while it was more than double (3.4 m/s) on Diwali day 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the mean mixing height on Diwali day was 492 meters and 152 meters on Diwali night. The corresponding numbers for 2015 were, 590 meters 324 meters.\n\nMixing height refers to the height to which suspended particles in the air rises leading to vertical mixing of the air. It depends on the atmospheric temperature. Higher the temperature, higher the mixing height and thus, higher dispersion of suspended pollutants.\n\nWith lower wind speed and mixing height in Diwali 2016, the pollutants remained suspended near the ground escalating the condition.\n\nWhat is current pollution level in Delhi as compared to other metropolitan cities?\n\nWhile Delhi \u2013 NCR has recorded PM 2.5 concentration between \u2018moderately polluted\u2019 to \u2018poor\u2019 levels, other metropolitan cities have recorded better air quality.\n\nOn October 14, 2017 Chennai (Location - Alandur) recorded PM 2.5 concentration of 47.08 \u03bcg/m3, Mumbai (Location Bandra) \u2013 42.71 \u03bcg/m3 and Bangalore (Location - BTIM) \u2013 14.72 \u03bcg/m3 , all fall under the prescribed standard of 60 \u03bcg/m3.\n\nFollowing is the real-time map of air pollution of October 14, 2017 as monitored by Berkeley Earth, an US organization that keeps track of climate change.", "lang": "en"}
