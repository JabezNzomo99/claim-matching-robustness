Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he disagreed with Trump.\n\n\"The intelligence I\u2019ve seen suggests that this was ordered by the crown prince,\" Lee said on NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press Nov. 25.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was more cautious, but she told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"when it becomes necessary, the president also needs to speak directly to the Saudis and say enough is enough.\"\n\nTrump released a statement about Saudi Arabia on Nov. 20. It contained a number of questionable assertions, and we\u2019ll go through them here.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nAfter more than four years of civil strife, the humanitarian disaster in Yemen is enormous. Out of a population of 28 million, 11.3 million are in acute need in order to survive, according to the latest U.N. estimates. More than 8 million people are at risk of famine.\n\nThe conflict involves many parties. The Houthi Shia Muslim rebel movement forced the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee in 2015. A Saudi-led coalition put Hadi\u2019s government, with Hadi remaining outside the country, back in control of part of Yemen. Those are the two main armed groups, but the war has seen a changing mix of alliances with other factions.\n\nTrump called the conflict in Yemen a proxy war, so the fairest reading of his words is that if Iran stopped backing the Houthis, Saudi Arabia\u2019s opponents, then the Saudis would follow up with aid. The implication is that the Houthi forces would either strike a deal or collapse.\n\nGerald Feierstein, former U.S. ambassador to Yemen in the Obama administration, said under either condition, Saudi Arabia has put relief money on the table. Feierstein said at some point before 2016, the Saudis told him they offered billions if the Houthis stood down.\n\n\"The Saudis and Emiratis have also said publicly that they would fund reconstruction and development programs in Yemen once the conflict ended,\" Feierstein told us.\n\nFeierstein said the Saudi offer amounted to about $9 billion.\n\nThe catch, according to former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution, is that the civil war in Yemen is more complicated than just Iranian and Hezbollah support for the Houthis \u2013\u2013 a charge that Iran denies.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition wants to restore full power to Hadi, Riedel said. But groups that oppose the Houthis don\u2019t necessarily want to see Hadi in control either.\n\n\"By placing the war solely as an Iranian-created conflict, Trump is trying to absolve the Saudis of responsibility,\" Riedel said.\n\n\"After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States.\"\n\nThe $450 billion Trump repeatedly mentions comes without evidence. We have asked the White House to show us what lies behind the $450 billion and have yet to get an answer.\n\nHossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump\u2019s assertion.\n\n\"There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,\" Askari said.\n\nPart of the total would be $110 billion in arms sales that Trump claimed emerged from his visit to Saudi Arabia. Arms analysts told us that, at best, the figure is aspirational.\n\n\"The $110 billion is not even remotely solid,\" said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley in October. \"The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in \u2018implemented\u2019 sales from this deal.\"\n\nThe $110 billion includes sales that have been in the pipeline from before the Trump administration took power. Complex weapons systems take years to play out.\n\nIn the past 10 years, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries.\n\nSome of the sales are speculative. For example, the United States approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. But the Saudis let a September deadline to seal the deal come and go.\n\nWhen Trump offered a version of this before, he suggested that over a million jobs were on the line. We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\n\n\"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.\"\n\nCould Saudi Arabia swap Russian or Chinese weapons for its American-made systems?\n\nNot likely, said Rachel Stohl, director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"The Saudis have been reliant on U.S. and other Western governments\u2019 weapons for years,\" Stohl told us. \"It would be extremely difficult \u2014 from a parts, integration, and interoperability perspective \u2014 to simply switch to Chinese and Russian suppliers. It would be a very slow transition for the military to resupply its major systems to Russian and Chinese platforms.\"\n\nIn theory, Saudi Arabia could buy elsewhere, but in practice, the Gulf State nation has many reasons not to.\n\n\"Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\nTrump claims this in the statement, but a search of the Nexis news database shows no mention of Saudi representatives saying publicly that Khashoggi was an enemy of the state or a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Muslim group with chapters in many Arab countries.\n\nRiedel said it was a theme developed \"behind the scenes\" \u2014 perhaps by the Saudis themselves. But in the United States, Trump supporters began spreading the idea.\n\nFox News host Harris Faulkner said Oct. 18 that \"Khashoggi was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.\" A conservative talk show CRTV tweeted a segment that said Khashoggi \"was a radical activist with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood!\" Donald Trump Jr. sent his followers a tweet that built on the message that Khashoggi was \"tooling around Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda co-founder Abdullah Azzam.\"\n\nThe reality is that many years earlier, Khashoggi had been drawn to Islamic movements, but he later distanced himself from radical movements. He met Osama bin Laden when, with CIA backing, bin Laden was fighting the Russians in Afghanistan. Khashoggi reported on him as a journalist.\n\nWhen U.S. forces killed bin Laden, Khashoggi wrote of him, \"You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.\"\n\nSo perhaps Saudi officials told Trump that Khashoggi was a threat to the Saudi kingdom, but so far as anyone can tell, that was in private.\n\n\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\"\n\nAccording to news reports, the CIA has concluded that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination. \"The CIA\u2019s assessment, in which officials have said they have high confidence, is the most definitive to date linking Mohammed to the operation,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nLawmakers publicly sided with the CIA\u2019s interpretation over Trump\u2019s.\n\nEchoing Lee, his Republican colleague, the incoming House Intelligence chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that he has been briefed by the CIA, \"and while I cannot discuss the contents of the briefing in any way, I can say that I think the president is being dishonest with the American people.\"\n\nSteven Aftergood, an intelligence specialist at the Federation of American Scientists, told PolitiFact that intelligence inherently \"deals in uncertainties. So one could still say of almost any conclusion, \u2018maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\u2019 But this is a way of evading the substance of the judgment, which is that he almost certainly did order the assassination.\"\n\n\"I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what political advantage members of Congress would find in opposing Trump\u2019s stance on Saudi Arabia. Several lawmakers explicitly cited human rights as a reason for their concerns. For instance:\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.: \"The President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the U.S. won\u2019t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.: \"Our foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests. It is in our natl interest to defend human rights. (Human-rights) violations lead to mass migration, help extremism flourish & often result in new governments hostile towards the U.S. because we supported their oppressors.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va.: \"The President\u2019s failure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way for the death of Jamal Khashoggi is just one more example of this White House\u2019s retreat from American leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.: \"I\u2019m shocked that President Trump said there will be no punishment for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi\u2026 Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government. Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable.\"\n\nThe breadth of lawmakers\u2019 expressed concern for human rights is unusually strong, advocates say.\n\n\"The strongly negative, bipartisan reaction to President Trump\u2019s statement reflects widespread revulsion at the idea that the United States would be willing to avert its eyes from a blatant, gruesome murder,\" said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy with the advocacy group Human Rights First.\n\nF. Gregory Gause, who heads the international affairs department at Texas A&M University\u2019s Bush School of Government and Public Service, said the critics of Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u2019s killing tend to fall into two categories.\n\nOne group, he said, are lawmakers \"who have always thought that human rights and democracy should play a greater role in our Middle East policy and thus have always been critical of Saudi Arabia.\" The other are lawmakers \"who have been supportive of the relationship with Saudi Arabia for strategic reasons, but find the crown prince\u2019s behavior beyond the pale and want the Trump administration to try to use leverage with Riyadh to isolate, and maybe even remove, the crown prince.\"\n\n\"After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\"\n\nTrump is correct about Saudi Arabia ranking second in the world in oil production, as this chart shows.\n\nHe also has a point that Saudi Arabia has agreed to increase oil production in recent weeks. That commitment came after the news of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.\n\n\"Following this commitment, the prices of crude started falling,\" she said. (See a related fact-check.)\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only cause of lower oil prices, experts said.\n\nOil production by the United States has experienced a larger net increase than the entire production increase from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is part).\n\nOther countries have also increased their production, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMeanwhile, on the demand side, a big reason for the decline is the expectation that the global economy will slow, leaving too much oil and not enough customers, said Paul J. Sullivan, an economics professor in the Eisenhower School at the National Defense University.\n\nIn addition, oil is priced in dollars, and the increasing strength of the dollar has made oil cheaper, Sullivan said.\n\nAll told, there are \"hundreds of other economic factors\" that played into oil prices outside of Saudi Arabia, Sullivan said.", "lang": "en"}
