This is inaccurate.\n\nA post shared over 13,500 times on Facebook is visible here . Other posts with the claim are visible here and here .\n\nIt is true that in most states voters must pay the appropriate postage on their return ballot envelope. The number of stamps, and therefore the cost, depends where the voter lives.\n\nFor example, local media reported that across Illinois, except in Chicago where ballot return envelopes have prepaid postage, the average cost is about $1.40 per ballot ( here ). In Tennessee ( here ) officials have stated that \u201ca first class stamp is all that is required to mail a ballot back\u201d (which costs $0.55, bit.ly/3kCqje3 ).\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) lists here 17 states that cover the cost of postage. Other states that have also announced prepaid postage for the election include Pennsylvania ( here ), Massachusetts ( here ) and South Carolina ( here ).\n\nIn statements to the media, the U.S Postal Service (USPS) explained that while residents in states where prepaid postage is not provided should buy their own stamps, USPS cannot reject votes without postage.\n\nA USPS spokeswoman told Reuters that \u201cproper postage is required by federal law\u201d and that election officials are meant to inform voters of \u201cthe amount of first-class postage required to return their ballots.\u201d USPS is, however, instructed to deliver these ballots even if they lack appropriate postage. The spokeswoman confirmed that if a ballot is mailed \u201cwith insufficient or unpaid postage, it is the Postal Service\u2019s policy not to delay the delivery of completed absentee or vote-by-mail ballots.\u201d\n\nUSPS also said it was \u201cproactively working with state and local election officials\u201d on mailing requirements including postage. \u201cIn cases where a ballot enters the mail-stream without the proper amount of postage, the Postal Service will collect postage from the appropriate Board of Elections,\u201d it told Reuters via email.\n\nThe NCSL confirms this policy, stating that USPS \u201cwill deliver a ballot envelope even if it does not have sufficient postage\u201d (see bit.ly/3fNMbzq ). The NCSL explains that the Postal Service will \u201ctypically\u201d bill the local election office for postage, which could represent a \u201csignificant expense\u201d.\n\nOrganizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have objected to voters having to buy postage stamps in some states, considering it to be a \u201cpoll tax\u201d and potential barrier to low income voters.

While Americans should pay for postage where required, it is USPS policy to deliver return ballots regardless of insufficient or unpaid postage.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
