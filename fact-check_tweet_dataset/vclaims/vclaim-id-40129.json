The claim is false; the video has previously circulated in media reports about a Norwegian woman who learnt to run like a horse.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than five million times after it was published on Facebook here on July 3, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared more than 32,000 times.\n\nThe one-minute, 57-seconds clip shows a woman moving on all fours.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis happens in Russia\u2026.she was taken care of by a dog for 16 years...because she was abandoned by her parents at the age of 3...The most recent update is she has recovered and can now communicate like a human!\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared with the same claim here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter, and here and here on YouTube.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has previously circulated in media reports about a Norwegian woman who learnt to run like a horse.\n\nA reverse image search using a keyframe from the video on Google and Yandex found the same video published here on YouTube on June 14, 2019.\n\nThe headline states: \u201cNorwegian woman Ayla Kirstine has an unusual equine skill -- running and jumping like a horse.\u201d\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison between the misleading Facebook video (L) and the genuine YouTube video (R):\n\nThe same woman features in multiple media reports published in May 2019.\n\nThis report published by Insider on May 17, 2019, is headlined: \u201cA Norwegian woman's videos have gone viral because of how good she is at running and jumping like a horse\u201d.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cAyla Kirstine has an unusual skill \u2014 running and jumping like a horse. She can canter with equine form, making it over some very high homemade jumps.\n\n\u201c\u2018When I was 4 years old I loved dogs and wanted to be a dog myself,\u2019 Kirstine told INSIDER. \u2018So when I knew I liked horses I only used what I had learned.\u2019\n\n\u201cKirstine, from Norway, has amazed the internet with her equine skills after going viral on German Twitter. Not only does she canter with the form of a horse, but she even manages to jump cleanly over a wooden bench as if her body were made for it.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe Huffington Post published this report about the same woman on May 16, 2019.\n\nThe report\u2019s headline states: \u201cNorwegian Woman Really Loves Horsing Around,\u201d while the subheadline says: \u201cAyla Kirstine of Norway has gone viral thanks to a series of videos in which she runs like a horse.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe Huffington Post published Kirstine\u2019s Instagram handle, but it was no longer available when AFP tried to access it on September 10, 2019.\n\nIn the interview with Insider published on May 17, 2019, Kirstine said she had thought of deleting her Instagram account after she received \u201cunkind comments\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
