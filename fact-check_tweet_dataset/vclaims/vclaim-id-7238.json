The 93-year-old former Prime Minister had suffered a stroke in 2009 that weakened his cognitive abilities. Subsequently, he also developed dementia.\n\nVajpayee\u2019s condition worsened in the last 36 hours and he was put on life support. However, before any official announcement of his demise was made, national media outlets, in an attempt to break news, declared the former Prime Minister dead.\n\nTimes Now published an article titled \u201cFormer Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee passes away at 93\u201dat 2:39 PM and later altered the report to \u201cAtal Bihari Vajpayee health LIVE updates: Confusion over Home Minister Rajnath Singh\u2019s statement on Vajpayee\u201d.\n\nTimes Now published another article on \u201cVajpayee\u2019s health\u201d at around 4 PM without providing any clarification for its earlier slight. Furthermore, the article\u2019s strapline ironically mentioned that \u201ca number of media organisations misquoted Rajnath Singh while he was speaking in the context of Chhattisgarh Governor Balramji Dass Tandon.\u201d But the media outlet missed adding that it made the error as well.\n\nThe Twitter handle of ABP Majha also prematurely tweeted that Vajpayee had passed away and laterdeleted its tweet without any clarification or apology.\n\nABP News Hindi too took down a tweet posted at around 12:53 PM where they wrote \u2013 \u201camidst reports of Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s death, a mortuary van reaches the premises of AIIMS.\u201d\n\nThe Statesman reported that Vajpayee was no more at 2:40 PM but later changed the title of their report to \u201cAtal Bihari Vajpayee death rumours on social media.\u201dThe English daily, however, clarified in the article that their earlier \u201creport had inadvertently said Vajpayee had passed away.\u201d\n\nHuffPost India carried out an article at 1:40 PM declaring the former PM dead without the official announcement finding a space in their reportage.\n\nIndia TV said on live telecast that Atal Bihari Vajpayee passed away and claimed to have gotten the information from DD News.\n\nAfter AIIMS press release was published, India TV said in the same live broadcast that the former PM passed away at 5:05 PM.\n\nAt around 3 PM, Sudarshan News broke the news of Vajpayee\u2019s death \u2013 two hours before AIIM\u2019s press release.\n\nIronically, at around 5:30 PM they published another article declaring the death of the former PM.\n\nAs posted by a Twitter user, India News too prematurely reported the demise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee at 2:40 PM.\n\nTripura Governor Tathagata Roy tweeted at 11:23 AM that the former PM has \u201cpassed away.\u201d\n\nRealising his faux pas, Roy later deleted his tweet and apologised for the same. He wrote that his tweet was based on the information he received from an \u201call-India TV channel.\u201d\n\nHimachal Pradesh education minister, Suresh Bhardwaj, gave a speech where he also declared that the former PM was dead. The video of his speech was uploaded by social media users.\n\nCirculating such news without verifying facts can sometimes lead to chaos. Hours before the demise of former CM of Tamil Nadu Jayalalitha, social media was brimming with rumours declaring her dead. The Twitter hashtag #RIPJayalalithaa began trending, causing frenzied citizens to attack Chennai\u2019s Apollo hospital. Any slights of posting misinformation on a public portal should always be rectified with a clarification so as keep citizens rightly informed.", "lang": "en"}
