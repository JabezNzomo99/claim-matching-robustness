And if we start putting out impractical targets, we may lose a lot of key constituencies who we need to bring along to have a real low-carbon solution on the most rapid time frame that we can achieve,\u201d such as labor unions, Moniz said.\n\u2022 None \u201cGuaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cProviding all people of the United States with \u2014 (i) high-quality health care; (ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing; (iii) economic security; and (iv) access to clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and nature.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cProviding resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cMeeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cRepairing and upgrading the infrastructure in the United States, including . . . by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cBuilding or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed, and \u2018smart\u2019 power grids, and working to ensure affordable access to electricity.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cUpgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cOverhauling transportation systems in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in \u2014 (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transportation; and (iii) high-speed rail.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cSpurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the United States and removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cWorking collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\"\n\n\u201cIn my own subjective assessment, getting to near-zero emissions over the next decade would be physically possible but sociopolitically infeasible,\u201d said Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric researcher at the Carnegie Institution for Science. \u201cDuring World War II, up to 60 percent of national GDP was directed towards the war effort. If we were to mobilize around the climate problem the way we mobilized around the fight against Germany and Japan, then we could possibly do this.\u201d\n\nNothing in the resolution eliminates \u201call Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military,\u201d as Trump tweeted. Accomplishing some of the goals undoubtedly would affect the industries Trump mentions, but it\u2019s inaccurate to say the Green New Deal would \u201cpermanently eliminate\u201d them. It might be accurate only for the oil industry, since the plan calls for \u201cmeeting 100 percent of the power demand\u201d with clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources. It should be noted that some key provisions in the Green New Deal call only for \u201ctechnologically feasible\u201d changes.\n\nAs part of the resolution\u2019s rollout, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office released some accompanying literature in the form of \u201cfrequently asked questions.\u201d These FAQs included statements that went beyond the terms of the resolution itself, and they soon became fodder for attacks by Fox News commentators and Republicans. There were also signs that not all Democratic backers of the Green New Deal were on board with statements in the FAQs. Campaigning in Iowa, Booker noted that he endorsed only the \u201cframework and the resolution.\u201d\n\nWhy 100% clean and renewable and not just 100% renewable? Are you saying we won\u2019t transition off fossil fuels? Yes, we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won\u2019t build the new economy to replace it \u2014 this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically. We do this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.\n\nAnother version of the FAQ, which has been taken offline by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff, said something similar: \u201cThe Green New Deal sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren\u2019t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then. However, we do believe we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, restore our ecosystem, and more to get to net-zero emissions.\u201d (We pulled up an archived copy of this document using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.)\n\n\u201cThe only document our office is officially standing by is the actual resolution that we published,\u201d Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, told The Fact Checker on Saturday. \u201cThe job guarantee is in the resolution. We are absolutely not backing off from that or anything else in the resolution, like getting to a greenhouse gas neutral economy in 10 years, massively building up new clean manufacturing or transitioning off fossil fuels as fast as possible by rapidly deploying renewable power generation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
