The ad starts out by focusing on Gillespie: \u201cHe\u2019s been called a super lobbyist\u2026the ultimate Washington insider\u2026paid millions to lobby for the oil companies\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe ad then shifts back to the Gillespie, noting he lobbied for Enron \u201cwhile they committed the largest corporate fraud in history.\u201d Gillespie indeed was one of the firm\u2019s four lobbyists for Enron, primarily concerning regulation in California, but there\u2019s no evidence he knew of the fraud \u2014 which fooled investors, the financial media, the Bush administration and all but a small percentage of the people working for the company.\n\nThe other four governments \u2014 identified only by their flags \u2014 are the Bosnian Serb Republic, Costa Rica, Macedonia and Pakistan. But what\u2019s the link to the foreign dictator? He is not identified but it clearly is Laurent Gbagbo, who led the Ivory Coast from 2000 until his arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court in 2011.\n\nThe Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law, requires lobbyists for foreign governments to disclose the reason they have been hired \u201cas well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities.\u201d We have embedded below the relevant FARA disclosures filed by Quinn Gillespie. You will search in vain for Ed Gillespie\u2019s name, as all of the documents are signed by Jack Quinn, his Democratic partner.\n\nIndeed, the deal with the Ivory Coast was inked on Nov. 10, 2004, and ended in April 2005. Where was Gillespie when the deal was set? He was on leave as RNC chairman from June 2003 to until February or March 2005. So this claim hinges on perhaps a one-month overlap. (Update: another FARA filing indicates the firm worked with the Ivory Coast government from the end of December through June of 2005.)\n\nAs our colleague Rachel Weiner reported, a 2012 New Yorker article disclosed that Jeff Connaughton, a Democrat and lobbyist for the firm, \u201cbelieved that the firm was trying to get the Ivorian regime to do the right thing by holding elections.\u201d Connaughton flew to the Ivory Coast, met with Gbagbo and found he \u201chad no interest in democracy \u2014 he just wanted good P.R. The firm soon ended the relationship.\u201d\n\nThe main point was that Ed was NEVER involved in any FARA work, made clear to Jack and me when we started the firm that he would not do FARA work. He was at the RNC when I decided to take the lead on Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with QGA or me we would have confirmed that Ed had absolutely NOTHING to do with it.\n\n\u201cThe facts of the ad are accurate,\u201d Warner spokesman David Turner said. \u201cThe firm is Quinn Gillespie Associates. He was at the firm at the time they represented these clients and thus profited off that representation.\u201d\n\nThe ad\u2019s shift from Gillespie\u2019s lobbying to the firm\u2019s lobbying is a slimy sleight of hand that most viewers of this ad would probably overlook. This is no evidence that Gillespie had anything to do with the Ivory Coast deal, which ended years before Gbagbo was shipped to the International Criminal Court. Gillespie certainly wasn\u2019t there when the deal was inked, and he was barely back at the firm before the deal was terminated.\n\nYes, the firm briefly had a deal with the Ivory Coast. But there is no evidence Gillespie was ever involved, in either the lobbying or personally with Gbagbo. Warner earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
