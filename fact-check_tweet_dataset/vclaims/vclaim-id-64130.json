This is false; the ballots in the video are from an August 2020 closed primary election in Florida, when voters could only cast ballots for their own party. A local election official said envelopes for November\u2019s vote will not reveal any party affiliation.\n\n\u201cThis is good to know no matter which side of the fence you are standing on. Your vote is right on the outside of the envelope. It is not kept private. It is hidden in plain sight. Do not vote by mail,\u201d warns a Facebook user who posted a video of two envelopes for mail-in ballots on August 15, 2020.\n\nThe claims come as President Donald Trump, trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls, continues to cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in voting, which millions of voters are expected to rely on rather than risk exposure to COVID-19 at polling places.\n\nEach envelope bears the name of a different person, one Republican and one Democrat, according to the woman speaking in the video.\n\nOn the back of the ballots to be sent through the mail, a series of numbers ends in \u201cD\u201d for the Democrat, and \u201cR\u201d for the Republican, leading the narrator to fear that \u201ca postal person could see this, if they\u2019re a Democrat and say \u2018oh, that\u2019s an R, let\u2019s toss it\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe video was subsequently shared by other Facebook users, until its core information was made into a one-sentence post shared thousands of times without the video of the ballots.\n\nIn the comments that accompany various iterations of the posts, fears of vote tampering are evident. \u201cSo if a Postal Worker sees it he or she xan just toss it into a dumpster and that vote goes uncounted,\u201d one wrote.\n\nThe ballots in the video are real, but do not reflect how mail-in voting will take place for the November elections.\n\nThey are from the southeastern US state of Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County. The front of the envelope, briefly visible when the narrator flips it, bears the name of the election board.\n\nBlaine Moss, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Office, told AFP by email that the ballot was from the August 18 primary election, in which voters registered within a political party chose the candidate that will represent them in the November election.\n\n\u201cThe ballots in that video are primary ballots. The numbers that can be seen below the bar code are there for the purposes of the canvassing board,\u201d Blaine said, adding: \u201cThe alternative would be to open the envelope and look at the ballot itself to ensure that the voter voted the proper party and precinct style. We want to maintain ballot confidentiality, so those numbers are on the outside.\u201d\n\nBecause these primaries consist of Republicans voting for Republicans, and Democrats for Democrats, nothing would be gained by getting rid of votes from one party or another.\n\nBlaine specified that, \u201cAll ballots for the general election in November will look exactly the same,\u201d and \u201cthere would be no way to tell the party affiliation of a voter based on their vote-by-mail envelope for the general election.\u201d\n\nThe Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections is aware of the confusion created by the video, and posted this information on Twitter and Facebook to dispel voters\u2019 concerns.\n\nElections in the United States are conducted locally, which the National Conference of State Legislatures says \u201cmakes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to rig US elections at the national level.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 general election, 2.7 million registered voters, amounting to 28.7 percent of the 9.6 million Floridians who turned out to vote, did so by mail, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Twenty-eight thousand vote-by-mail ballots were rejected that year, it said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned the reliability of mail-in voting and the integrity of the election. On May 26, 2020, for example, he said on Twitter that \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-IN Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,\u201d despite many experts including a US Federal Election Commissioner dismissing such claims as false.\n\nOn August 21, 2020, Trump-appointed US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before a US Senate committee on his now-suspended reforms, which are accused of undermining the US Postal Service\u2019s capacity to carry out vote-by-mail in November.\n\nDeJoy denied that mail was being slowed down and committed to on-time election delivery.", "lang": "en"}
