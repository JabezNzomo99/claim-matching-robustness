Hillary Clinton has made as a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nThe RNC has estimated Clinton's proposals would cost some $777.6-billion during her first term. The Republicans did a credible job in tallying up Clinton's plans, but they did make one huge mistake.\n\nClinton, at one point in 2007, talked about offering every newborn child born a $5,000 bond as part of an effort to encourage savings for such things as college tuition. The estimated cost would be $80-billion over four years. The RNC included the proposal in its Spend-O-Meter.\n\nThe only problem is that Clinton never formally proposed it and indeed told the Boston Globe last month that the plan did not have as much political support as her other plans to pay for college.", "lang": "en"}
