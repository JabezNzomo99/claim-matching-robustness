A lot has been happening in this three-week period. I wish I'd had more of my staff on board, but we're still waiting for confirmation for them.\n\n\"Much has been done. Much needs to be done. But I did and have done as I promised. I have met with senior officials shortly after arriving here. We evaluated the rules of ethics and recusal. I have considered the issues at stake. \u2026\n\n\"I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign.\"\n\nA headline on the Conservative Patriot blog claimed Sessions was \"caught colluding with Obama.\" But there is no evidence of that.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
