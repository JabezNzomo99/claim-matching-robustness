But in reality, Lemon\u2019s show only airs on weekdays and a CNN spokeswoman confirmed to FactCheck.org that Lemon was not on air that day.\n\nWe also checked CNN\u2019s transcripts for episodes of \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d for the days following al-Baghdadi\u2019s death and found no instances of Lemon saying the dubious quote.\n\nOther fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, have written about very similar images that were manipulated to look as if the \u201cunarmed father of three\u201d reference appeared in a chyron on CNN \u2014 which it didn\u2019t.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
