The story is the same as one on yournewswire.com and was previously debunked by Snopes.\n\nThese articles are fake news and appear to be a riff on a USA Today editorial that criticized Trump after his tweet Dec. 12 calling U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand \"a lightweight senator ... who would come to my office \u2018begging\u2019 for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them.\"\n\nSome interpreted Trump\u2019s tweet as veiled language that Gillibrand would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, although White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed that characterization because she said he used similar language about men.\n\nUSA Today\u2019s editorial board reacted to Trump\u2019s tweet: \"A president who\u2019d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama\u2019s presidential library or to shine George W. Bush\u2019s shoes.\"\n\nThe fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme.\n\nUSA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts\u2019 film, Roberts commented about the differences between America\u2019s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been \"looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country\" while \"doing a brilliant job,\" and Michelle Obama \"isn\u2019t fit to clean to clean her toilet.\"\n\nThe statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump.\n\nWe found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion.\n\nIn fact, Roberts has supported national Democrats in recent years including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nIn October 2016, Roberts was one of several Hollywood and Broadway stars to team up to hold a fundraiser for Clinton at the St. James Theatre in New York. Wearing a \"Hill Yeah\" t-shirt, Roberts read from the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins.\n\nRoberts also appeared at Democratic fundraisers hosted by Obama, including a Santa Monica fundraiser on in April 2016 and one at Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s home in 2014.\n\nWe were unable to find contact information for the USA Daily Portal website. We sent an email to the Your News Wire website that previously posted the article and did not get a reply.\n\nA fake news story stated that Roberts claimed \"\u2018Michelle Obama isn\u2019t fit to clean Melania\u2019s toilet.\" We rate this headline Pants on Fire.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this fact-check stated that Roberts read one of Molly Ivins\u2019 columns. Allison Engel, co-author of the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins, contacted PolitiFact after our fact-check published to tell us that the excerpt that Roberts read was from the play. Engel said she supplied the text to the producer of the fundraiser.", "lang": "en"}
