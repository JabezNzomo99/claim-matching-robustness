The claim incorrectly advises to have the colored side facing out if you are sick and the white side out if you are healthy.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cWhile at the doctors office today, we were informed by a Nurse the proper way to use a medical mask... When using a medical mask you\u2019re supposed to use as follows: Colored side out if you\u2019re sick and do not want to spread your germs around. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you\u2019re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in... The Nurse said the entire doctors office never knew either, until the supplier sent them \u201cproper directions\u201d for them this past week! Hope this helps!\u201d\n\nThe image does not give any information about the name of the nurse, the doctor\u2019s office or the supplier. It also does not credit any health organization or office for these directions.\n\nA video released by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows Dr April Baller, who works with the Infection Prevention & Control in the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, explaining how to wear a medical mask correctly. In the video she says: \u201cidentify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side.\u201d ( here )\n\nAn infographic that WHO has available on its website explains how to wear a medical mask safely. It says to \u201censure the colored-side faces outwards.\u201d ( bit.ly/2BSuXTH )\n\nSeto Wing Hong, a co-director of WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, also explains in a Bloomberg QuickTake News video how to correctly wear a medical mask ( here ). He explains: \u201cYou see it has a blue color on the outside because it\u2019s waterproof. And then you have white on the inside which is absorbent. So, if I cough, it absorbs it. So, you got to wear it like this, the blue on the outside, the white on the inside.\u201d\n\nWhile the blue and white sides of a medical mask serve different purposes, they don\u2019t need to be worn according to one\u2019s COVID-19 status.\n\nMedical mask producers confirmed this claim is untrue. Mike Bowen, Executive Vice President of Prestige Ameritech, told Reuters via email he was unaware of any official guidance in \u201cwhich each side has a different function\u201d and that the blue side of the mask faces out. A spokesperson for 3M told Reuters via email that their experts advised, \u201cSurgical masks should be worn with the white cover web against the face and the colored side of the mask facing outward.\u201d\n\nFalse claim. Users should identify the inside of the mask, which is usually white. It should be worn with the color side facing out and the white side facing in.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
