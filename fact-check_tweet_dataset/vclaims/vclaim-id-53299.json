The expression does not appear in the book but, as Parry points out, it is thematically similar to the following line:\n\n\u201cBut he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst Fascists were they who disowned the word \u2018Fascism\u2019 and preached enslavement to Capitalism under the style of Constitutional and Traditional Native American Liberty.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator found the earliest instance of a variation of the expression in a 1917 speech by labor activist Eugene V. Debs. In the speech, Debs is quoted as saying, \u201cEvery robber or oppressor in history has wrapped himself in a cloak of patriotism or religion, or both.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous other iterations of the quote in print throughout the 20th century, but it has only been attributed to Lewis in print since 2005, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
