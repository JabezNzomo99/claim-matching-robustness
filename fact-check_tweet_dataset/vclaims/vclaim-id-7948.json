There is no \"Agent Nesmith Variacles of the FBI\" and the \"Department of Refugee Affairs\" mentioned in the original article does not exist. The story was copied by several \"real\" fake news websites but in fact originated on the satircal website Reagan Was Right under the title \"Late Night Raid On Michigan Mosque Nets 11 ISIS Terrorists and More Than 40 Vests\". You can read the original here (archived here in case it goes down). The original article opened:\n\nA mosque in a small town outside of Dearborn, Michigan has been raided by a joint task force from the FBI, Homeland Security and the ATF. According to preliminary reports from the scene, which is closed off for more than a mile, 11 \"very dangerous men\" who aren't supposed to be in America at all have been apprehended plotting what would have been our next 9-11.\n\nA link in the original article supposedly going to a quote or statement from the fictitious Department of Refugee Affairs actually takes readers to this image:\n\nNaturally many of the sites copying the story omitted the link to this image and also the satire disclaimer which is displayed at the bottom of every article on Reagan Was Right:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
