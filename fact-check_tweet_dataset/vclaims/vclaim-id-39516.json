(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHurricane Willa is projected to make landfall on Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast on Tuesday, Oct.t 23. However, its projected landfall is more than 1,000 miles north of the caravan\u2019s current location. The latest news reports say the caravan is in the town of Huixtla, in southern Mexico. Hurricane Willa\u2019s watch and warning advisories do not extend to Huixtla.\n\nPatriotic Express cites weather.com (The Weather Channel) as reporting that the hurricane \"should approach landfall along the southwestern coast of mainland Mexico by late Tuesday, which is expected to occur anywhere from near or north of Mazatl\u00e1n to near Puerto Vallarta.\"\n\nThe caravan is far from that point.\n\nParts of the Patriotic Express story are less misleading than the headline, saying that the hurricane \"is set to cross the path that the migrants will eventually cross.\"\n\n\"As the caravan heads north, there\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019ll eventually run into deteriorating conditions leftover from Willa \u2014 which we\u2019ll soon see what level of damage it imposes upon populated areas of Mexico,\" the post said. \"The strain on resources in many areas of Mexico is already bad \u2014 let alone the possibility of being hit by a major hurricane and a large army of hungry migrants.\"\n\nThough the caravan is heading north, it\u2019s uncertain if it will cross the towns expected to be impacted by Hurricane Willa. Even then, the caravan \u2014 walking north \u2014 would be many days away from reaching that point if it went that direction. (If it chose to go to the Brownsville, Texas, border, it would be on the opposite side of the hurricane\u2019s expected landfall.)\n\nThe number of people in the caravan has increased since it started Oct. 13, reports peg the number traveling at around 7,000 \u2014 lower than 10,000 claimed in the Patriotic Express headline.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to make landfall in Mexico \u2014 but nowhere near the caravan\u2019s current location. It\u2019s uncertain whether the caravan will pass through towns impacted by the hurricane. We rate the headline False.", "lang": "en"}
