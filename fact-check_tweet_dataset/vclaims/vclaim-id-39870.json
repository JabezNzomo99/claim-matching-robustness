His company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in the U.S. and manufactures airships.\n\nEngineer and entrepreneur Igor Pasternak hosted a fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff in 2013. Pasternak's business, in the past, provided some military hardware to Ukrainian military troops who were fighting Russian forces in Donbas.\n\nA smear piece targeting U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff swept a California businessman and engineer into the mix and, in doing so, potentially endangered his child.\n\nOn Sept. 29, 2019, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted a story headlined, \u201cEXPLOSIVE REPORT: Rep. Adam Schiff Linked to Prominent Ukrainian Arms Dealer!\u201d The purported \u201carms dealer\u201d in the story is Igor Pasternak, who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a Ukrainian.\n\nSoon after the Gateway Pundit story was published, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program. Both outlets were lashing out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTrump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the Ukrainian government. Thus both The Gateway Pundit and Ingraham attempted to make the case that Schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with Ukraine. But the story is thin, based entirely on the fact that Pasternak, an engineer and business owner, hosted a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013.\n\nFox News falsely reported that Pasternak \u201cmoved his corporation into [Schiff\u2019s] California district\u201d and stated without proof that Schiff \u201ccould have\u201d traded political favors for campaign donations.\n\nPasternak\u2019s company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in Montebello, California, and is not in Schiff\u2019s Congressional district (Pasternak\u2019s district is the 38th, represented by Linda Sanchez). Pasternak, who spoke to us by phone, said neither Fox nor The Gateway Pundit reached out to him for his side of the story.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit story claims Pasternak \u201csold arms in places like Syria\u201d and \u201chas also been connected to [billionaire philanthropist] George Soros.\u201d This is a laughable fantasy, Pasternak said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts,\u201d Pasternak told us. \u201cIt just has nothing to do with reality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not a new narrative. The same story floated in 2018 on a different website, that time in response to a memo authored by Schiff detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nPasternak did host a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013, but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians, both Democratic and Republican, a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool Open Secrets. And he did design some military hardware, including small arms and surveillance equipment, which were used by the Ukrainian military in that country\u2019s conflict with Russian forces.\n\nBut his company\u2019s main occupation is the manufacture of airships, also known as lighter-than-air aircraft. Furthermore, Pasternak was raised in Ukraine but was born in Kazakhstan. He is also an American citizen. His mother tongue is Russian, he told us. He doesn\u2019t speak Ukrainian.\n\nPasternak took The Gateway Pundit\u2019s smear against him in stride, joking that the website had publicized \u201cthe best picture of me.\u201d\n\nBut what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images, some of which Pasternak believes were taken from his Facebook account. In that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy\u2019s name. The story also contained the family\u2019s home address. The information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media, prompting Pasternak to contact authorities.\n\n\u201cIt really to me is not a joke,\u201d Pasternak told us. \u201cIf it was just me, then OK, thank you for publicizing my best picture.\u201d But Pasternak, who like Soros is Jewish, read it in a threatening light, noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him. \u201cThey clearly understand he\u2019s the most vulnerable point for me.\u201d\n\nSoros, whose foundation donates money to progressive causes, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nPasternak said he didn\u2019t make any money off the equipment sent to the Ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting Maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014. Pasternak said it\u2019s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro-Ukraine activities in the face of Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia got him on \u201cPutin\u2019s bad list.\u201d\n\nSince at least 2014, the Russians have harnessed social media in the U.S. to spread disinformation to influence public opinion, a technique they deployed in their 2016 U.S. election-interference operation.\n\nWe reached out to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child, but received no response.\n\nAlthough we normally link to stories we fact check, we chose not to do so in this case because the Pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address.", "lang": "en"}
