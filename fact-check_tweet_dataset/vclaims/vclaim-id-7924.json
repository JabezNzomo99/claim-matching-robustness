I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll take all the heat you want to give me.\"\n\nTrump and members of Congress focused on three major issues during the televised portion of the their conversation: a permanent law for Dreamers, Trump\u2019s funding request for a border wall, and additional changes to the country\u2019s legal immigration system.\n\nThe Trump administration rescinded in September the Obama-era program that protected from deportation certain immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. With recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, now facing risk of deportation, the administration gave Congress a March 5 deadline to find a remedy.\n\nSome remarks were similar to claims we\u2019ve fact-checked before, including Trump\u2019s Pants on Fire claim about the diversity visa lottery program. Here\u2019s a fact-checking recap:\n\nTrump: When then-President Barack Obama \"signed the executive order (on DACA, he) actually said he doesn't have the right to do this.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of Obama\u2019s legality on DACA fell short as he mischaracterized the administration\u2019s action and Obama\u2019s words. We rated it Mostly False since Obama didn\u2019t sign an executive order, and when he announced the new policy, he didn\u2019t say that he lacked the authority.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Obama reserved the right to enforce immigration laws selectively: emphasizing the deportation of criminals who were undocumented, rather than undocumented students or workers who presented no threat to public safety.\n\nTo be sure, Obama drove home the point many times before that that he had to follow the law. Where he was particularly vague, however, was on the scope of his flexibility and the tools at his disposal.\n\nTrump is right that not all DACA beneficiaries are children, but he went too far saying some are as old as 39 or 40 years old.\n\nOf the nearly 690,000 immigrants benefiting from DACA, the sizable majority are over the age of 18, and the average age is 23.8, we\u2019ve found.\n\nPew Research Center in September 2017 said no DACA recipients were older than 36, \"because the program required applicants to have entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and have been under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.\"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.: 900 DACA beneficiaries are \u2018members of the U.S. military\u2019\n\nDurbin is largely accurate on the number of DACA immigrants in the military. There have been 823 DACA recipients sign enlistment contracts, Pentagon spokesman U.S. Army Major Dave Eastburn told PolitiFact in October.\n\nOf that number, 515 were currently serving on Active Duty or in the Reserves and 308 individuals were in the Delayed Training Program, Eastburn said. Of the 515 currently serving, 138 have become naturalized citizens, he said.\n\nTrump said there cannot be security without a border wall with Mexico. \"All you have to do is ask Israel,\" Trump said.\n\nIsrael cut its illegal immigration rate by \"99 percent\" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border, as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed in February 2017. We found the claim to be Mostly True, as experts said the fence alone was not responsible for the dramatic decrease. Policies also deterred illegal border crossings.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise to build a border wall with Mexico rates In the Works, after the construction of prototypes in California. But Mexico still won\u2019t pay for its construction, and Democrats oppose appropriating funds for it.\n\nTrump: \u2018Fewer people are trying to come in\u2019 illegally through the border\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded the lowest number of apprehensions nationwide and at the southwest border since 1971.\n\nImmigration officials believe increased enforcement in the interior of the country have deterred immigrants from attempting to cross illegally into the United States.\n\nTrump: On the visa lottery program, \u2018they put the hand in the bowl, probably what\u2019s in the hand are the worst of the worst, but they put people that they don\u2019t want into a lottery, and the United States takes those people\u2019\n\nTrump inaccurately described how the diversity visa lottery program works, oversimplifying the process and misstating foreign governments\u2019 involvement.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s characterization, the program is administered by the U.S. State Department. Visa lottery applicants are randomly selected by a computer, not picked from a bowl. They must also be extensively vetted by the United States before coming to the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s flawed description of the program previously earned him a Pants on Fire, and his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, earned a False rating for claiming program participants are not vetted.", "lang": "en"}
