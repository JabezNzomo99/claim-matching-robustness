That\u2019s turned out to be false, and the president\u2019s ill-fated pledge is featured prominently in many of the AFP advertisements.\n\nLamb\u2019s old plan was provided through a public-private program aimed at lower-income workers called CoverTN, which split the premium costs between an employee, the employer and the state. That\u2019s a big reason why Lamb\u2019s premium was only $52 a month, but in an interview she said she would have gladly paid and could have afforded the full $156 a month.\n\nCoverTN was terminated at the end of the 2013 because it did not meet key requirements of the ACA, in particular a ban on such caps on benefits. The Obama administration denied the state\u2019s request for a waiver, and so the plan was shut down.\n\nFor health-care reformers, such annual caps on benefits were a sign of a substandard plan that could put someone in bankruptcy if they had an accident that resulted in unexpected medical costs. But Lamb doesn\u2019t look at it that way because she already had suffered a major and costly accident that was unrelated to her chronic condition.\n\n[Update, March 19: Lamb, in an email, clarified that she never asked the hospital to reduce the bill. She said she had been told the cost of the surgery, before insurance, would have been $125,000 but it was reduced to below $25,000 because of \u201cnetwork savings.\"]\n\nOnce Lamb was required to go on Obamacare, she discovered she qualified for a $15-a-month subsidy, which could be applied to nearly 40 different options. She chose one of the more expensive options\u2014a Platinum plan \u2013 because it limited out of pocket expenses to $1,500, as her doctor fees and blood tests would be higher under the Obamacare plans. She also considered a plan with a lower premium, but it would have meant higher out of pocket expenses. \u201cInstead of paying $6,000 a year, I would have been paying $10,000 a year\u201d with the plan with a lower premium, she said.\n\nAnyone with a chronic condition would have opted for the plan with the lowest out of pocket maximum, even with a higher premium, so Lamb\u2019s choice makes sense. But it did mean she faced sticker shock, going from $52 a month to $373 a month, even after her subsidy.\n\nOne Lupus sufferer, Erin Kotecki Vest, blogged that she was amazed at Lamb\u2019s tale of woe after she researched the coverage provided by CoverTN. \u201cJust ONE of my treatments ALONE wipes out everything CoverTN had to offer me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI would hit CoverTN\u2019s $25,000 annual limit the first week of January.\u201d\n\nAs we have often noted, there are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act. The Obama administration erred in suggesting that everyone will be a winner and that nobody would be forced to give up a plan that they liked.\n\nBut AFP takes it to the other extreme, highlighting a unique case to condemn the entire law. Lamb certainly faces higher costs now, and she apparently was happy with her previous state-subsidized plan. So she turns out to be one of the losers under the law, and as a one-time Obama supporter she has every right to be upset.\n\nAfter she had her horse-riding accident, the hospital even decided to foot much of the bill, which is a scenario that the Affordable Care Act is supposed to prevent. (That hospital didn\u2019t just eat Lamb\u2019s expenses; it passed them on to everyone else through higher bills.) In theory, people with insurance will no longer be charged extra to pay for the medical expenses of people with no or limited insurance.", "lang": "en"}
