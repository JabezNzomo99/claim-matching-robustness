Users are claiming that the man in the video is \u201cBJP Rajasthan MP Kalicharan Saraf\u201d. Twitter user @JenniOfficel had tweeted the video on August 23 with this claim, where it had received over 1.63 lakh views at the time of writing. (link to the archived tweet)\n\nAnother Twitter user, @Political__Dr, had tweeted this video with the same claim. At the time of writing, it had been viewed over 1,100 times. (link to the archived tweet)\n\nA Facebook page titled \u2018Ravish Kumar \u2013 The Fearless Reporter\u2019 had also posted this video on August 23 with the same claim. This video has received 19,000 views at the time of writing. (archived version of the post)\n\nThe video was also being shared with these claims on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhen we ran a reverse image search of a frame from the viral video, we discovered a Facebook post from July 28, 2015. The user who had uploaded the video described the person in it as a BJP leader.\n\nWe also found a fact-check report from ABP News dated April 27, 2018. According to this report, this video was originally taken in 2014 and had also been circulating with claims of inappropriate behaviour in 2018. The report also stated that the woman in the video is Suman Sharma, former chairperson of the Rajasthan State Commission for Women, and the man with her on the stage was Ashok Garg, a BJP councillor from Jaipur. The report clarified that Sharma was not the chairperson at the time (in 2014).\n\nThe report carries the statements of Suman Sharma and Ashok Garg. At the 2:06-minute mark, Sharma says, \u201cNothing like that had happened, there was no such intention. I greeted him out of respect, he is the senior councillor from my area and he extended his hand towards me to express his gratitude in response. I was not insulted. The way people are making this footage viral now, they are definitely insulting as a woman. They want to use this video for political mileage. This is visible in their mindset. I want to request all those people through your channel to avoid resorting to such types of actions.\u201d Similarly, at the 3-24-minute mark, Garg says that the two greeted each other like brother and sister. He said, \u201cI extended my arms considering her a sister and nothing else. If something like this had happened, would the other members have allowed me to stay in the party till now?\u201d\n\nSuman Sharma therefore categorically denied misbehaviour by BJP councillor Ashok Garg. The video is now being shared with false claim targeting BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf. It is noteworthy that viral claims misidentify Saraf as an MP.", "lang": "en"}
