But the research finding that up to 30% of emergency cases were of a kind that GPs regularly deal with doesn\u2019t apply to all A&Es.\n\nThe research is specific to major A&E departments. They deal with about two thirds of all A&E cases.\n\n30% is also the higher end of the estimate. The researchers found it was somewhere between 10% and 30%.\n\nThe number of yearly visits to A&E departments of all kinds increased by 9 million between 2000/01 and 2015/16.\n\nBut there are three different types of A&E departments in England. Patients can go to major A&E units, the type you would normally think of when you picture someone going for emergency treatment; speciality units that deal with particular types of emergency, such as dentistry; and walk-in centres that deal with more minor injuries.\n\nWe don\u2019t have figures as far back as 2000 on these separate types. But we do know that attendances at major A&E departments have gone up by 3 million since 2002/03. Attendances at specialist A&Es have risen by 88,000 since that year. And visits to walk-in centres, which were recently introduced, have increased by more than 4 million since 2003/04.\n\nDo we know how many need to be there?\n\nIn 2010 the Primary Care Foundation found that between 10% and 30% of cases turning up in A&E were ones that were regularly seen by GPs. It\u2019s this figure that the Department of Health told us Mr Hunt was referring to when he said 30% of A&E visits don\u2019t need to be made.\n\nThe report estimated that between 10% and 30% of A&E visits \u201ccould be classified as primary care cases (types that are regularly seen in general practice)\u201d. In other words, they\u2019re cases that all GPs would be comfortable with even if they didn\u2019t have any specialism in emergency medicine.\n\nOne of the report\u2019s authors told us that the estimate referred specifically to major A&E units, rather than the walk-in centres or speciality units which also cater for accidents and emergencies.\n\nSo it\u2019s not right to say that up to 30% of the extra nine million A&E visits since 2000 could be dealt with by a GP, as this would include the other types of A&E including walk-in centres which are specifically for dealing with more minor ailments. At most, the finding refers to 30% of the extra 3 million visits to major A&E units.\n\nOther studies have found that some A&E patients could be dealt with in less urgent settings. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that around 15% of patients who attend A&E could be seen by community medical facilities if they were available within 24 hours.\n\nIn 3% of recorded diagnoses in A&E\u2019s last year \u201cnothing abnormal was detected\u201d. Just over 11% of those whose treatment was recorded were listed as not receiving any treatment.\n\nPatients aren\u2019t doctors; it\u2019s not always possible to know whether you need to go to a GP or A&E. Just because someone hasn\u2019t received any treatment or could have been treated by a GP doesn\u2019t mean that they shouldn\u2019t have gone to A&E for help.\n\nThe Primary Care Foundation\u2019s report noted that the proportion of A&E patients who could be seen by a GP if one was available on the day is \u201cmuch higher\u201d than those who could be seen outside of A&E if they had to wait several days for a GP to become available.\n\nDo people go to A&E instead of GPs?\n\nIn 2013, the Royal College of Physicians told a committee of MPs that they believed there was a relationship between the availability of GP appointments and the numbers of people going to A&E. The Royal College of General Practitioners told the same committee that they questioned whether GPs had the capacity to take on more work.\n\nA study by Imperial College London found that there was a link between whether or not patients could get an appointment with their GP within two days and whether they would go to A&E instead. The authors looked at 95% of GP surgeries in England in 2010/11. But they also pointed out that other smaller studies have not found the same link and that more work needs to be done in the area.\n\nAround 85% of people report that they were able to get a GP appointment the last time they tried, according to the NHS\u2019s GP Patient Survey. This has been decreasing since 2012, when it was around 88%.", "lang": "en"}
