No, that's not real. The story was made up by a website that invents news about bizarre crimes and sex acts and calls it \"fauxtire\" (\"faux\" + \"satire\").\n\nThe story came from an article published by Huzlers on May 23, 2018 titled \"Woman Shoots Boyfriend For Catching Her Cheating; Says She Didn't Give Him Permission To Catch Her\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Amy Johnson, 25, is being charged with attempted murder after she shot her boyfriend for allegedly catching her in the act of cheating, in which she later told authorities: \"I didn't give him permission to catch me cheating\". Amy Johnson allegedly shot her boyfriend after he discovered her to be cheating, according to Amy's boyfriend, who survived the gunshot wound, he walked into the bedroom to find Amy having sexual intercourse with another man, after which she took out a gun and shot her boyfriend in the leg while asking him: \"I can't cheat in my own life?\"\n\nThe picture used with the story doesn't even show someone from San Francisco, it is a 2012 mugshot from El Paso County, Texas:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Prom Limo Driver Did NOT Crash Intentionally After Students Play Lil Pump's 'Gucci Gang' Via Aux Cord\n\u2022 Fake News: 'BBQ Becky' Did NOT Call 911 On A Black Police Officer Who Pulled Her Over\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Feminist Didn't Change Daughter's Diapers For Weeks Because She Didn't Give \"Consent\"\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Say Being Black Is A \"Choice\"; Does NOT Plan To Bleach Skin\n\u2022 Fake News: Viral Sensation \"Lil Tay\" NOT Picked Up By Los Angeles Child Protection Services", "lang": "en"}
