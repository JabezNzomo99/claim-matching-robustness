His death has prompted protests against racism and police brutality across the country.\n\nSome social media users have shared an image of a man wearing sunglasses, a face mask and a hoodie memorializing Floyd along with claims that it is Floyd pictured. They attempt to cite the photo, purportedly taken at Floyd\u2019s June 9 funeral in Houston, as proof that his death was staged.\n\n\u201cGeorge Floyd,\u201d text in the image reads. \u201cAt his own funeral.\u201d (RELATED: Are Two Of The Former Police Officers Involved In George Floyd\u2019s Death In-Laws?)\n\nThe photo, however, does not show Floyd.
