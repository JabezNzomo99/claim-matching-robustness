Ryan denounced Trump\u2019s remarks and canceled what would have been his first appearance with Trump at a rally in Wisconsin the following day.\n\nWe rated True a claim by Clinton that Ryan still endorses Trump, but the ill will between the two Republicans remained. An hour after tweeting about the polls, Trump called Ryan in another tweet \"our very weak and ineffective leader.\"\n\nThe response from Ryan\u2019s office: \"Paul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same.\"\n\nFiery exchanges between Trump and Clinton marked the second debate, which was held at Washington University in St. Louis. The town hall-style event drew more viewers nationally than the Green Bay Packers-New York Giants game, but fewer than the first debate. It generated more than two dozen fact checks by our colleagues.\n\nSo, who did Americans say won the second debate?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the national, scientific polls:\n\nSo, not only did Trump not win by a landslide in any of the polls, he didn\u2019t win any of the polls, period.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t get back to us before deadline on what polls would back Trump\u2019s statement.\n\nAll we could find in his favor were non-scientific polls, open to anyone to participate, that were conducted online. But such polls can be heavily influenced, for instance, by campaigns pushing supporters to vote, or can skew to one side based on the audience of the website. Some may even allow more than one vote per person.\n\nThe Drudge Report reported that among more than 1.1 million people who cast votes in its survey, 72 percent said Trump won and 28 percent said Clinton won.\n\nIn a non-scientific poll offered online by MLive.com, the website for the Ann Arbor News and other newspapers in Michigan, Trump won by a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent among more than 27,000 votes cast. And in a non-scientific poll offered by the website of a group of New Jersey newspapers, Trump won 64 percent to 31 percent among more than 241,000 votes cast.\n\nFor what they\u2019re worth, those are landslide margins.\n\nBut even in non-scientific surveys, Trump didn\u2019t win them all: In a non-scientific survey done online by the Fox television affiliate in Milwaukee, Clinton won by 52 percent to 48 percent among 325,000 votes cast.\n\nComplaining about a lack of support from Ryan, Trump nonetheless claimed he won the second debate with Clinton \"in a landslide\" in \"every poll.\"\n\nBut four national, scientific surveys all showed that not only did Trump not win by a landslide margin, he didn\u2019t win any of the polls at all.", "lang": "en"}
