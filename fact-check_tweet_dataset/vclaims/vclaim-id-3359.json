So far this year the figure is 83%.\n\nSpending by councils on adult social care in England has fallen by around \u00a31.3 billion since 2010, according to experts. Councils have reported that they have made, or plan to make, savings of \u00a36.3 billion on adult social care services since 2010.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to publish a more detailed factcheck of mental health spending soon, so for now we haven\u2019t covered the last part of Ms Long Bailey\u2019s claim.\n\nHow many hospital trusts are in deficit?\n\nIt\u2019s correct that 61% of acute hospital trusts were in deficit by the end of 2016/17. Acute trusts make up the bulk of NHS providers in England and offer a wide range of services. Other types of trust include ambulance, community, mental health and specialist trusts.\n\nThose other types of trust are less likely to be in deficit. That means across all types of trust, 44% were in the red that year.\n\nLooking at the most recent figures, 83% of acute hospital trusts were in deficit by the end of September 2017, and 65% of all trusts were.\n\nBetween 2015/16 and 2020/21 spending on NHS England is set to increase by \u00a38.7 billion (in 2017/18 prices), though overall health spending is set to increase by about half as much. Because of an increasing population though, spending on the NHS per person is set to fall in the coming years.\n\nNHS England has been asked to make \u00a322 billion of savings between 2016 and 2021 in order to keep up with rising demand and an ageing population.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked more at spending on the NHS and other health services here.\n\nSpending on adult social care by councils in England has fallen by around \u00a31.3 billion in real terms since 2010, according to health think tanks. It went from \u00a319.1 billion in 2009/10 to \u00a317.8 billion in 2016/17\u2014a fall of 7%.\n\nFollowing calls for more money to be put into adult social care earlier this year, the government promised an extra \u00a32 billion for adult social care over the next three years. We\u2019ve looked at this in more detail here. But health think tanks still estimate that there will be a funding gap of \u00a32.5 billion by 2019/20.\n\nMs Long Bailey seems to have been referring to findings from a survey done by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) when she said social care budgets had been cut by \u00a36.3 billion. We\u2019ve asked her office for more information.\n\nADASS, which is made up of leaders of council social care services, found that councils across England plan to have made savings of \u00a36.3 billion since 2010 (by the end of 2017/18) on adult social care. We\u2019ve asked ADASS if this figure accounts for inflation and for more details about the survey.\n\nIn 2017/18 councils expected these planned savings would come mainly from efficiency savings, and things like reducing services, increasing charges above the level of inflation and increasing pay by less than inflation. But only 31% of councils responding to the survey were fully confident they would be able to make planned savings this year.\n\nThe survey was conducted before some councils knew the full details of the money towards adult social care that they would receive from the NHS and increasing council tax. It\u2019s possible that this money may affect the level of savings councils plan on making.", "lang": "en"}
