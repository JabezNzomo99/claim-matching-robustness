It is being claimed that bus drivers in Japan are currently on strike but are not accepting fares while continuing the service. The claim does not specify the place in Japan but gives the impression that the strike is ongoing.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident reported in the viral post is not a recent one. Bus drivers went on strike in Japan last year.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nFacebook page Wonderful Engineering posted the image of a bus with the text that reads: Currently bus drivers in Japan are on strike continuing to drive their routes while refusing to take fares from passengers! So keeping Japan on time, but costing the bus companies gas on top of lost revenue. Dear world, this is how a protest is done. At the time of filing the story, the post had been shared more than 800 times.\n\nTo find the truth, we ran a search on the internet with the keywords Japan bus drivers on strike. We found many media reports published on May 11, 2018.\n\nAccording to these reports, protesting bus drivers in the Japanese city of Okayama were running the bus services but not taking fares from passengers. Bus drivers were demanding job security. The dispute between workers and the Ryobi bus company reportedly began after a rival company launched a similar kind of bus service in April, offering cheaper fares.\n\nHowever, we didn\u2019t find any news articles that can confirm that bus drivers in Japan are still on strike.\n\nIt is clear that the incident is around a year old, bus drivers in Japan went on strike last year.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Don\u2019t get dazzled by these mesmerising fireworks in Mumbai\u2019\n\nALSO WATCH: Fact Check: Video showing rocket launches by Indian Army has nothing to do with PoK", "lang": "en"}
