Then, on May 8, during a call with former members of his administration, Obama publicly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s response to COVID-19 as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster.\u201d\n\nNow, a viral post, shared widely on Facebook, is claiming that Obama \u2014 through Organizing for Action, the nonprofit established during his second term \u2014 is \u201cworking to disrupt everything that our current president\u2019s administration is trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe post attributes the claims to conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer.\n\nBut Krauthammer, who died in 2018, did not write the article and Organizing for Action no longer exists.\n\nThe same attribution was debunked by Snopes in 2017, but has resurfaced since Obama has taken an active role in the presidential election.\n\nThe false attribution of the article apparently began when the website Nesara-Republic Now-Galactic News published a piece titled \u201cThe Enemy Amongst Us!!\u201d on Oct. 11, 2017. It claimed the piece had appeared in the New York Post and attributed it to Krauthammer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning contributor to the Washington Post who was a staple on Fox News.\n\nWhen questioned about the origins of the article by Snopes, one of Krauthammer\u2019s research assistants said, \u201cDr. Krauthammer did not write it and has nothing to do with it.\u201d Moreover, \u201cThe Enemy Amongst Us!!\u201d isn\u2019t listed on the New York Post\u2019s author page for Krauthammer.\n\nThe text \u2014 except for the introductory and closing paragraphs \u2014 was mainly taken from a blog post by Bill Wilson dated Feb. 13, 2017, and titled \u201cThe perilous times we live in\u201d on The Daily Jot, Wilson\u2019s website. The Daily Jot describes its content as \u201cNews Analysis from a prophetic Christian Worldview.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post, which features a photo of Obama over the headline \u201cTRAITOR,\u201d claims Organizing for Action is \u201cthe shadow government organization aimed at resisting and tearing down the Constitutional Republic we know as AMERICA.\u201d\n\nIn January 2013, during his second term, Obama launched OFA, which described itself as a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization that advocated for Obama\u2019s national agenda, including \u201cgun violence prevention, sensible environmental policies to address climate change and immigration reform.\u201d\n\nOFA merged in 2019 with the National Redistricting Action Fund, a group run by Eric Holder, Obama\u2019s former Attorney General. The merged organization, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, is leading a campaign called All On The Line to promote redistricting reform and participation in the 2020 census.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
