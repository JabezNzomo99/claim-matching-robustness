One such keyframe (highlighted below) threw up relevant search results.\n\nWe were redirected to two-month-old links which meant that the video cannot depict police excess during the recent communal riots in Delhi.\n\nFacebook page \u2018Rana JD\u2019 shared the video on December 25, 2019, with the hashtag #SHAMEONINDIA.\n\nA subsequent keyword search on Youtube led us to a longer version of the clip shared by the channel \u2018SPN News\u2019 on December 20, 2019. According to the channel, the police lathi-charge was during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Bulandshahr.\n\nAfter the Citizenship Bill was passed in the Parliament, several districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Bulandshahr, witnessed violent protests. According to a report in The Wire, at least 18 civilians lost their lives in the clashes.\n\nA video of police lathi-charge during anti-CAA protests in UP\u2019s Bulanshahr has been circulated online as Delhi police.", "lang": "en"}
