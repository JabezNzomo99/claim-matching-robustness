The report is from 2013 and did not say that.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two years since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, and more than six since she exited her post as U.S. secretary of state. But viral falsehoods about the prominent Democrat continue to fester on social media.\n\nRecent headlines circulating across platforms are now misrepresenting a years-old NBC News report to erroneously assert that the network\u2019s news division found Clinton had protected a \u201cpedophile ring\u201d while at the Department of State.\n\n\u201cNBC NEWS: Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring,\u201d a false headline on dc-populist.com reads. A June 19 YouTube posting of the NBC report used the same headline and has accrued more than 200,000 views.\n\nThe actual NBC News segment \u2014 which aired on the \u201cToday Show\u201d in 2013 \u2014 focused on questions, based on leaked memos, about internal investigations within the State Department during Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state. It noted that one of those investigations dealt with an allegation of pedophilia, but the report did not say that Clinton \u201ccovered up\u201d a \u201cpedophile ring.\u201d\n\nThe June 2013 segment detailed an internal department inquiry into whether investigations of alleged improprieties by an ambassador and department personnel were properly handled. The news report cited allegations of \u201cundue influence from top State officials.\u201d\n\nThe report said there was an allegation the ambassador \u201croutinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,\u201d and that the department\u2019s investigation was improperly halted.\n\nIn October 2014, the State Department Office of Inspector General published the executive summary of its report on whether the department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security mishandled that investigation and seven others.\n\nIn three of those cases, the inspector general found an \u201cappearance of undue influence and favoritism,\u201d which it said \u201cis problematic because it risks undermining confidence in the integrity of the Department and its leaders.\u201d That included the case of the ambassador \u2014 who had been publicly identified as Howard Gutman, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report notes that Gutman met with two senior State Department officials, denied the allegations and was permitted to return to work. While the report said further evidence could have been collected and recommended \u201cclear and consistent protocols and procedures\u201d for the handling of such inquiries, it noted that \u201cbased on the limited evidence collected by DS, the suspected misconduct by the Ambassador was not substantiated.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the allegations against the ambassador were never backed up. And the internal watchdog\u2019s review never faulted Clinton for mismanaging or intervening in the investigation.\n\nGutman later chronicled the impact of the claims made against him in a 2015 column in the Washington Post titled \u201cThe ambassador\u2019s tale: Lessons I learned about success and scandal.\u201d\n\nIn short, NBC News reported six years ago on leaked memos outlining claims that investigations were being improperly handled within the State Department. But the underlying claims made against an ambassador were never substantiated, and neither the news report nor the department watchdog said that Clinton had \u201ccovered up\u201d a \u201cpedophile ring.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
