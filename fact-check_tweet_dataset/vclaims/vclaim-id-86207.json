Ilhan Omar is in the news these days for her commentary on congressional supporters of Israel, which Democratic leaders have labeled anti-Semitic. That\u2019s not something we can easily fact check, but even before this controversy erupted, we got a query from a reader about her statement above: \u201cDo McDonald\u2019s workers really only make $7,000 a year? That seems far below the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said that she was referring to an article in Nation\u2019s Restaurant News that relied on a required disclosure in McDonald\u2019s 2018 proxy statement about the \u201cpay ratio\u201d at the company. As a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, publicly traded companies must show how the pay of their chief executives compares with the compensation of their median employees. McDonald\u2019s is a global company, so the median figure is for all employees around the world.\n\n\u201cThe Company considered all full time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers employed on such date,\u201d the disclosure said. \u201cOur methodology was straightforward and transparent; we did not exclude employees or make any adjustments to compensation. Using this methodology, 2017 total compensation for our median employee (a part-time restaurant crew employee located in Poland) was $7,017.\u201d\n\nBut Omar was not talking about part-time workers, let alone one in Poland. She referred to 7,000 [dollars] \u201cfor the worker who has put in 40 hours a day.\u201d (The spokesman said she misspoke, and meant a 40-hour week.) The article in Nation\u2019s Restaurant News did not note that the $7,000 figure was for a part-time worker in Poland.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s starting wage at corporate owned and operated restaurants is above the federal minimum and our average wage for hourly workers is more than $10 per hour, which is why overly general characterizations of the wages we offer can be misleading and inaccurate,\u201d said Lauren Altmin, a spokeswoman at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nAltmin added that \u201cemployees can earn paid leave, have flexible schedules, and have access to up to $2,500 in prepaid college tuition as well as the ability to enter free high school diploma programs, English as a Second Language classes and education and career advising services through Archways to Opportunity.\u201d\n\nStill, we should note that the pay differential between the McDonald\u2019s chief executive and median worker is huge: 3,101:1. That\u2019s the worst ratio among 17 public restaurant companies \u2014 and the third-worst among public companies. Even if the ratio were adjusted to the average U.S. wage, the pay differential would exceed 1,000:1.\n\nEven that is more than three times the 312:1 CEO-to-average-worker ratio in 2017 for the 350 largest firms in the United States, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. An anonymous survey of 356 companies by Equilar, an executive data company, found the median CEO pay ratio across all submitting companies was 140:1, and the average was 241:1.\n\nEasterbrook\u2019s pay was nearly double the next-highest restaurant executive\u2019s pay. The company, in its SEC filing, noted that more than 90 percent of Easterbrook\u2019s pay is \u201cat risk\u201d vs. objective targets and that the company had gained $36 billion in value during 2017 as a result of \u201ca transition from turnaround to growth.\u201d\n\nThe CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 20:1 in 1965 and 58:1 in 1989, according to EPI, with much of the difference to today\u2019s ratios due to \u201cstock-related components of CEO compensation (stock awards and cashed-in stock options), not by changes in salaries or cash bonuses.\"\n\nJUST Capital, a nonprofit that ranks and measures companies according to various criteria important to Americans, puts McDonald\u2019s very low on its list, in the bottom 10 percent of nearly 900 companies. The company does especially poorly on paying its workers a living wage, according to JUST Capital, with only 10 percent of U.S. workers making enough money to cover costs for food, housing and medical care.\n\nOmar can point to a document filed with the SEC for her data point and can certainly raise pointed questions about the pay gap at McDonald\u2019s between the chief executive and the typical worker. But her statement lacks context. The $7,000 figure is for a part-time worker in Poland, not a full-time worker in the United States as she suggested.\n\nOmar relied on an article that did not make clear the caveat in McDonald\u2019s disclosure. But we always warn politicians (and their staffs) that it is important to check the original source, as news media accounts may be inaccurate or misleading.", "lang": "en"}
