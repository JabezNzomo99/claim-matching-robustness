She doesn\u2019t appear to be saying that half the criminal cases in some areas involve paedophiles.\n\nWe don\u2019t know which specific figures or courts Ms Truss was referring to. We\u2019ve asked the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOfficial figures can only tell us so much\n\nThe Crown Court deals with more serious crimes in England and Wales. 13% of the cases received by the Crown Court in the 12 months to September 2016 were prosecutions for sexual offences.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that 13% of cases that actually go before a jury are for sexual offences. The official statistics show far fewer trials than cases received by the Crown Court. This may be because cases in which the defendant pleads guilty aren\u2019t counted as trials; we\u2019ve asked the statisticians to confirm this.\n\nThe upshot is that, as far as we know, the official data can\u2019t tell us how many of the defendants that actually face the jury do so because they\u2019re accused of a sexual crime. So Ms Truss may have been using another source of information.\n\nAn alternative, unofficial estimate has been made recently\n\nIn October 2016, criminal barristers Richard Jory QC and Sam Jones wrote that \u201cmore than half of all cases now heard in the Crown Court concern sexual allegations, and the proportion is increasing\u201d. This may be what Ms Truss was referring to.\n\nMr Jory told us that the barristers spoke \u201cto a number of court staff and users, including other advocates and judges, and combined this with our own experience in the courts to make an assessment\u201d.\n\nOn their own, there\u2019s no way to know how accurate the barristers\u2019 overall estimates are without official figures which actually record the subject of trials, which so far we haven\u2019t been able to find.", "lang": "en"}
