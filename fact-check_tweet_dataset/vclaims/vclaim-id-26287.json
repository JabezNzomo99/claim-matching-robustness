Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Pankaja Munde crying after her defeat in Maharashtra General Elections-2019. Fact: The image in the post is a screengrab of Pankaja Munde\u2019s interview with a news channel on 20 October 2019, but the Maharashtra Election results were declared on 24 October 2019. Moreover, Pankaja Munde hasn\u2019t cried anywhere during that interview. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nFrom an article of \u2018NDTV\u2019, it can be found that the results of Maharashtra Assembly Elections-2019 were declared on 24 October 2019, and BJP leader Pankaja Munde has lost from the constituency \u2018Parli\u2019. In the image, it can be seen that news channel TV9 was interviewing Pankaja Munde. So when searched on YouTube, the interview video was found on the \u2018YouTube\u2019 channel of \u2018TV9 Marathi\u2019. But when one goes through the timestamp of that video, it was found to be uploaded on 20 October 2019, i.e. 3 days prior to the declaration of Maharashtra election results. Also, during the interview, Pankaja Munde hasn\u2019t cried anywhere. The visual in the image can be seen at 1:42 secs of the interview video.\n\nTo summarize, this image is falsely being shared as Pankaja Munde crying after her Maharashtra election defeat.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
