Is that what she said?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-03-28T07:00:50Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84804", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/28/does-tammy-duckworth-really-want-to-accept-200000-refugees-from-syria/", "vclaim": "If the figure \u201c200,000 refugees\u201d seems familiar to readers, it\u2019s because we have regularly criticized Donald Trump for falsely claiming that President Obama wants to admit that many refugees from Syria. In reality, Obama has committed to accepting only 10,000 refugees from Syria. The administration also committed to accepting 185,000 refugees from all countries in 2016 and 2017.\n\nBut the Duckworth campaign is adamant that she has never said that she wants to accept 200,000 refugees from Syria. The campaign points to a congressional letter, spearheaded by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), that she signed in September that called for accepting 100,000 refugees from Syria and 200,000 overall just in 2016, based on a request from Refugee Council USA. That is still far more than Obama \u2014 10 times as much \u2014 but it is half the figure cited in the ad.\n\nThe Fact Checker has never encountered a Senate campaign that claimed it did not have audio of a recent news conference. Duckworth spokesman Matt McGrath said it is SOP to record events, but it did not happen in this case. \u201cWe don\u2019t have one on this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not disputing what she said, we\u2019re disputing the context.\u201d\n\nIn McGrath\u2019s telling, Duckworth was referencing the Cicilline letter, which called for admitting 200,000 from all countries. \u201cI think she spoke in a shorthand that was clear to all present, especially since the Kirk campaign had prepped the entire Chicago press corps on the Cicilline letter in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nCameron provided The Fact Checker with audio of Duckworth\u2019s full answer, which started: \u201cI actually signed on to take more than what the president proposed. I signed on for two hundred thousand refugees.\u201d (The rest of her answer was a personal account of how she would feel if she were a refugee with a baby.)\n\nDuckworth\u2019s repeated use of \u201csigned on\u201d certainly could be a reference to the letter. As far as we know, no major refugee organization has called for admitting 200,000 refugees from Syria. At the same time, it seems strange that Duckworth would be talking about the total number of refugees when the key issue for debate is how many to accept from Syria.\n\nIn any case, Duckworth\u2019s answer resulted in a pile of clips in which it was stated that she called for accepting 200,000 refugees from Syria. Hinz, whose article became a source for other reporters, said he never was asked by the campaign to correct his report. Not until the \u201c200,000\u201d figure regularly began appearing in Kirk attacks \u2014 and after the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., raised alarm about refugees \u2014 did the Duckworth campaign move to obtain corrections, such as in an AP report in January.\n\nKevin Artl, a Kirk campaign spokesman, stands by using the 200,000 figure, noting that it was widely reported at the time. \u201cShe should publicly clarify her position and then, if we willfully misrepresent it, then feel free to whack us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, we are in good company with these credible news outlets and all they have is a letter written two months prior to her November press conference \u2014 a presser with conveniently missing audio.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t find it very credible that the Duckworth campaign lacks audio of a recent news conference \u2014 and our interviews with reporters at the news conference indicates that she was specifically asked about the number of refugees from Syria. At the same time, it seems strange that she would suddenly double the number she wanted to accept from Syria. Her phrasing also suggests that she was talking about the letter she signed that called for 100,000 refugees.\n\nWe wavered as to whether Kirk\u2019s use of the 200,000 figure was worthy of One or Two Pinocchios. The preponderance of evidence suggests that Duckworth misspoke, and The Fact Checker frowns on campaigns that frame attack ads around gaffes. But it would be an easier ruling if the Duckworth campaign had quickly tried to correct the coverage of her remarks. As it turned out, every news organization at the time reported her remarks as meaning 200,000 refugees from Syria, giving the Kirk campaign an opening to tag that figure as her official position.", "lang": "en"}
