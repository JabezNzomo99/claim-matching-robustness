One of his was a GE gas engines plant in Waukesha, a city about 20 miles west of Milwaukee.\n\nIn both the and on the , the president insisted that over the past four years, corporate profits and stock prices soared while wages fluttered.\n\nIn the State of the Union, Obama claimed that \"average wages have barely budged.\" PolitiFact National rated his statement , finding the average had risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation from 2008 to 2012.\n\nIn Waukesha on Jan. 30, 2014, the president alluded to a slightly different statistic and was more bold.\n\n\"Because the truth is -- and you know this in your own lives, and you see it in your neighborhoods among your friends and family -- even though the economy has been growing for four years, even though corporate profits have been doing very well, stock prices have soared, most folks' wages haven't gone up in over a decade.\"\n\nWe wondered: Even taking inflation into account, is it true the majority of Americans haven\u2019t seen their wages increase in more than 10 years?\n\nwas a big topic in the weeks leading up to the State of the Union. So, one thing to make clear upfront is that in his Wisconsin remarks, the president singled out wages -- the paycheck you get from your job. That\u2019s a narrower category than income, which can include money taken in from other sources such as investments or government benefits.\n\nWhen we asked for evidence to back the president\u2019s wages claim, a White House spokesman cited from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows the median weekly earnings for full-time workers in the final quarter of each year from 1999 through 2013.\n\nThe median wage means half of workers earned more than that amount and half earned less.\n\nFrom the database, we assembled the following table. The wage figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\nSo, the inflation-adjusted median wage during the final quarter of 2013 was $334 -- $1 lower than during the final quarter of 1999, more than a decade earlier.\n\nHowever, the table also shows that the median wage went up in some years and down in others during the period cited by the president. It was as high as $344 and as low as $332.\n\nWe put Obama\u2019s claim and the database to four experts: economist of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; economist of the Urban Institute, who served as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan; , senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute; and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director .\n\nThey agreed that it\u2019s not possible to track the wages of actual individuals over a period of more than a decade, and so it can\u2019t be known whether most of them had a higher wage in 2013 than in 2009.\n\nBut the experts also agreed the median wage figure cited by The White House is the best available.\n\nAs Steuerle told us: \"Looking at the median tells us what is happening across the economy, but not what is happening to each individual worker over time.\"\n\nTwo other points, neither of which bears directly on the accuracy of Obama\u2019s wage claim:\n\nMathur said the broader measure of income gives a better picture of the standard of living of low- and moderate-income people, since it includes assistance such as the earned income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid.\n\nAnd Tanner said total compensation, including things such as health and retirement benefits, has risen in recent years even if wages haven\u2019t.\n\nObama said: \"Most folks\u2019 wages haven\u2019t gone up in over a decade.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to know, considering all Americans, whether most of them saw a wage increase in the period cited by the president. But he cites the best-available figure, which shows the median weekly wage, adjusted for inflation, was $1 less at the end of 2013 than it was in 1999.\n\nWe rate the president\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
