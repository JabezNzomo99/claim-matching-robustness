Duterte ran for the PDP-Laban Party when he won that election in a landslide.\n\nThis image in the post below on Facebook is accompanied with the words: \u201cHere\u2019s a throwback from one of the original dilawans.\u201d Dilawans means yellows, referring to the colour that represents the Liberal Party (LP).\n\nDuterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno Aquino, led the Liberal Party while in power from 2010 to 2016.\n\nThe purported campaign flyer of Duterte looks very similar to a genuine one from Roxas in the 2016 election campaign, as seen in this tweet at the time from CNN Philippines.\n\nAbigail Valte, a former Aquino spokeswoman who worked for Roxas\u2019s presidential campaign, also provided AFP a signed copy of the genuine campaign flyer.\n\nBoth photos have the following features:\n\u2022 Roxas\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan: \u201cWalang drama, trabaho lang,\u201d or: \u201cNo Drama, Just Work\u201d\n\u2022 The Liberal Party\u2019s 2016 campaign platform: \u201cDaang Matuwid\u201d, or \u201cStraight Path\n\nFurther evidence that the misleading campaign flyer was meant to indicate that it was the 2016 election campaign is the number three alongside Duterte's photo. This was his number on the 2016 electoral ballot.\n\nBelow is a snapshot from the Philippine Commission on Election's website below that shows the numbers of three for Duterte and five for Roxas.\n\nHowever the typeface for the candidates\u2019 names on the various flyers are different.\n\nThe election commission's website also shows Duterte ran for Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan or PDP-Laban ( Philippine Democratic Party\u2013Power of the Nation) in the 2016 elections, not the Liberal Party.\n\nThe false post was apparently intended to highlight that Duterte, who as president regularly criticises the Liberal Party and its members, had previously been allied to it.", "lang": "en"}
