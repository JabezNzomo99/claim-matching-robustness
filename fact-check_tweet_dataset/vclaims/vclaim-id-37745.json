It suggests that 5G has damaged peoples\u2019 immune systems and so boosted the virulence of the common cold.\n\nThe main implication of the claim\u2014that 5G can impact immune systems\u2014is totally unfounded. There is no evidence linking the new coronavirus to 5G.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Wuhan does have some 5G coverage. The local government listed a number of venues with 5G coverage in August 2019. We can\u2019t find evidence it was the very first city with 5G but we\u2019ve seen reports saying Wuhan was one of several Chinese cities where early 5G trials took place. Another said Wuhan was \u201cone of the first pilot cities of the 5G network in China\u201d.\n\nIn October 2019, China\u2019s three state telecoms companies announced they would be rolling out phone services that use 5G, and that big cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou were already covered by the network.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written about before, there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to humans. 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves\u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).\n\nThese radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don\u2019t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nPublic Health England has said that there\u2019s no \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that exposure below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.\n\nThere is no evidence that 5G can damage the immune system.\n\nAs for the claim that the new coronavirus observed in Wuhan is the \u201cnormal cold\u201d with boosted virulence\u2014that is simply not the case.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed in other fact checks, although the new coronavirus spreading in Wuhan has commonly been referred to by the media and others as just \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, it is just one type within this family of viruses.\n\nCoronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes the common cold, SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004) and this new coronavirus identified in people in Wuhan.", "lang": "en"}
