No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian site that makes up tales about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on July 27, 2018 titled \"Boston pastor accused of coating hosts with cocaine, crystal meth before service\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBoston, MA | A Dorchester pastor was arrested on drug possession charges after Boston police said they found cocaine, crystal meth, fentanyl, and 50 oxycodone pills inside the Grace Fellowship Church. Police believe Pastor Julian McMillan, 38, lured homeless people and drug addicts into his church by coating hosts with a mixture of cocaine, crystal meth, fentanyl, and oxycodone. Carney Hospital staff became suspicious after two church members, one 88-year-old man and a 10-year-old girl, overdosed on fentanyl the same day and warned police.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and may have mistaken it for actual news:\n\nThe supposed photo of the pastor has been circulating for years on various websites showing before and after photos of drug addicts.
