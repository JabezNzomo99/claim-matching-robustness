We caught them and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it. There were four women, and maybe more. I think the number\u2019s four or five. But one had her mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it I believe was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of payments to any of the 13 women who have publicly come forward with claims that Trump had physically touched them inappropriately in some way. There\u2019s also no evidence that they are making up stories, as many told friends or family about the incidents at the time.\n\nAllred\u2019s daughter, the lawyer Lisa Bloom, set up a GoFundMe account for her client Jill Harth, which so far has only raised $2,317 of a $10,000 goal, and facilitated a donation that paid off the mortgage on Harth\u2019s apartment in Queens. Harth, who said Trump pursued her and groped her when she worked with him on a beauty pageant in the early 1990s, has noted that she did not come forward with her story but was outed by media, which had discovered an old lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThose woman \u2014 they\u2019re incredible women. They went on television \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to and I didn\u2019t ask them \u2014 and they said the New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes. And they went on a lot of shows. They were really incensed and they couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nTrump conflates a lot of things here into a misleading tale. The New York Times in 2016 ran a long article about how Trump treated women in private. The opening anecdote concerned a former paramour, Rowanne Brewer Lane, depicting how he had asked her to put on a bikini and announced she was a \u201cstunning Trump girl.\u201d After the article appeared, Lane said it was \u201cupsetting\u201d to read how the Times put a negative connotation on the incident. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate them making it look like that I was saying it was a negative experience, because it was not,\u201d she told Fox News.\n\nTrump is referring to a 2016 interview in the New York Times with Jessica Leeds, who described an encounter with Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight more than three decades ago, when she was a traveling business executive at a paper company. It did not take place as people were coming onto the plane, as Trump claimed. Instead, about 45 minutes after takeoff, she said, Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt, she said. \u201cHe was like an octopus,\u201d Leeds said. \u201cHis hands were everywhere.\u201d She fled to the back of the plane. \u201cIt was an assault,\u201d she said.\n\nLeeds told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with the Times. The Trump campaign offered the perspective of a British man who claimed to have sat near the two on the plane and somehow three decades later remembered the incident in detail. \u201cShe was the one being flirtatious,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, the FBI told us they\u2019ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times \u2014 many times over the years. They know him very well. But here there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint \u2014 they didn\u2019t know the location, they didn\u2019t know the time, they didn\u2019t know the year \u2014 they didn\u2019t know anything. And it\u2019s like, where do you go?\u201d\n\nThe FBI was used in 1991 to investigate sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, nominated to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush, by Anita Hill, a former University of Oklahoma law professor. There is nothing to prevent the FBI from updating a previous background check in light of new information. A standard FBI background check, which is what was completed as part of Kavanaugh\u2019s vetting for the Supreme Court, looks for \u201ccurrent problems\u201d and probably wouldn\u2019t have covered allegations that both were not yet public and are three decades old. If the White House were to ask for an expanded background check, the FBI would have the ability to investigate the various claims and add to its existing report.", "lang": "en"}
