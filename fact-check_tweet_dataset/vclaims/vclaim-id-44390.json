In this case, the post features a doctored WHO infographic recommending, among other strategies, for people to avoid having unprotected sex with animals.\n\nThe real infographic, tweeted out by the WHO Jan. 30, actually suggests \u201cno unprotected contact with live wild or farm animals.\u201d\n\nOther WHO recommendations to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus include washing hands, covering the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with people suffering from cold or flu-like symptoms and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.\n\nResearchers are still learning how exactly the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, but transmission is most likely between people with close contact, according to Fox News. On Jan. 30, the United States and South Korea confirmed its first cases of person-to-person transmission.\n\nAccording to the WHO\u2019s Jan. 30 report, there have been 7,818 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, with 7,736 of those occurring in China and 82 occurring in other countries. Only five confirmed cases of the virus have been documented in the U.S. (at the time of publication), according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 30, after the virus spread from China to at least 18 other countries.", "lang": "en"}
