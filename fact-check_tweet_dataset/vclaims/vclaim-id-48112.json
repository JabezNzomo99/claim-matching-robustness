Despite the current state of Metro Manila\u2019s public transport system, several other presidents after him developed public transportation projects that are used by Filipinos today.\n\nMass transit is defined as the transportation of large numbers of people, especially within urban areas. This includes not only trains but also buses, subways, and other modes of public transportation.\n\nThe LRT Line 1 was opened in 1984 and was indeed a project of Marcos. However, LRT Line 2 and MRT Line 3 were developed after the late dictator was ousted. Meanwhile, the PNR already existed way back in 1891, before the Marcos administration.\n\nThe LRT Line 2 also started construction during Ramos' term in 1997. It officially opened in 2003, under the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Arroyo also initiated the Strong Republic Transit System in 2003, which integrated these existing railways for a more seamless commute.\n\nAs of 2019, there are also at least 6 new railways to look out for under the Duterte administration.\n\nThis is not the first time Rappler has fact checked Sangkay Janjan TV.
