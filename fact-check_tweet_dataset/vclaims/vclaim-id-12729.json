Dati WPS, ngayon pati Benham Rise! Kailan pa kayo magigising sa bangungot nito (Before, it was the West Philippine Sea, now, also the Benham Rise! When will you wake up from this nightmare)?\"\n\nThere have been no reports from mainstream nor state media about the Chinese foreign minister making such a statement. Online searches of the quote have not produced any results from government institutions and media organizations.\n\nWang told reporters in March that China will have a \"prudent and steady\" cooperation with the Philippines on oil and gas exploration. He made the statement after several Filipino lawmakers expressed alarm over reports that several Chinese ships were illegally surveying Benham Rise, located off the eastern coast of Northern Luzon. In January, a Chinese ship granted a permit to conduct research in the area was reported to have committed several violations.\n\nThe Philippines obtained \u201csovereign rights\u201d over the 13-million-hectare underwater landmass after the United Nations approved in 2012 the country's territorial claim over it. This gave the Philippines the exclusive right to explore and exploit the oil, gas, mineral resources and sedentary species in Benham Rise.\n\nSilent No More PH's fabricated post coincided with a meeting in Singapore of the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China to discuss a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, which is being disputed by the Philippines and three other Asean states, China and Taiwan. The post surfaced a week before Chinese President Xi Jinping's Nov. 20-21 state visit to the country on the invitation of President Rodrigo Duterte.", "lang": "en"}
