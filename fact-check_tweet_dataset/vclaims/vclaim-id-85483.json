The video is from March, 2019 where an argument had ensued between Lok Sabha MP Sharad Tripathi and MLA Rakesh Singh Baghel, both from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A verbal spat turned into a fist fight after Tripathi expressed his displeasure at his name missing from a foundation stone of a local road. After Baghel responded that it was his decision, Tripathi made his way towards Baghel, removing his shoe and hitting the MLA with it. The scuffle intensified when Baghel got up and struck back at the MP. Only after the intervention of other party members and a policeman did the brawl break away.", "lang": "en"}
