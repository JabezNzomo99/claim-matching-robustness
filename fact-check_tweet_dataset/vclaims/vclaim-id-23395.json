The picture is being used to argue that Mr Farage was a member of the far-right British political party.\n\nThe photo does show Mr Webster leaving court surrounded by a group of followers in 1979.\n\nHowever, similarly to Channel 4\u2019s Factcheck, while we have been unable to confirm who the person next to Webster is, a number of people with knowledge of the National Front at that time have said that they do not believe it to be Mr Farage. Nor do they recall him ever being a member of the National Front.\n\nJoseph Pearce, a former National Front member, told Full Fact he couldn\u2019t say for sure but\u2014given his own heavy involvement with the party at the time, and the fact that he had not heard of Mr Farage then\u2014he would be surprised if the person shown was Mr Farage.\n\nGerry Gable, editor of Searchlight\u2014a magazine that investigates and opposes fascism, antisemitism and racism in Britain and abroad\u2014and now working with Northampton University\u2019s Searchlight project, said that all those in the photo were known National Front members, but he didn\u2019t know their names. Gable added there is no evidence to suggest Mr Farage was a National Front member.", "lang": "en"}
