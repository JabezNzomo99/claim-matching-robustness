If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold.\n\n2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.\n\n3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.\n\n4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.\n\n5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours \u2013 so if you come into contact with any metal surface \u2013 wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.\n\n6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.\n\n7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.\n\n8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but \u2013 a lot can happen during that time \u2013 you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.\n\n9. You should also gargle as a prevention.\n\n10. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. Can\u2019t emphasise enough \u2013 drink plenty of water!\u201d\n\nThe post finishes with a timeline purporting to describe how COVID-19 infection might progress. It reads:\n\n\u201c1. It will first infect the throat, so you\u2019ll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days\n\n2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.\n\n3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.\n\n4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you\u2019re drowning. It\u2019s imperative you then seek immediate attention.\u201d\n\nThe post has been viewed more than 50,000 times and shared more than 660 times.\n\nCOVID-19 has spread to more than 118 countries around the world since first reported in December 2019 and infected more than 125,000 people as of March 12, 2020, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the virus a pandemic.\n\nThe post begins with the claim that COVID-19 symptoms do not include a runny nose and sputum but rather those were just symptoms of the common cold.\n\nAccording to the WHO, COVID-19 symptoms can include a runny nose.\n\nProfessor Anthony Cunningham, an infectious diseases physician from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck sputum and a runny nose can be symptoms of COVID-19 however are more likely to be symptoms of the common cold.\n\n\u201c4.5 per cent of people with the Coronavirus actually had nasal symptoms alone. It\u2019s of course uncommon,\u201d he said.\n\nThe post also claims people with \u201ccoronavirus pneumonia\u201d can display dry cough symptoms but not a runny nose.\n\nProf Cunningham said not everyone infected with COVID-19 will develop pneumonia and that the claim was not correct because people infected with COVID-19 can still get a runny nose with cough and fever.\n\n\u201c[COVID-19] causes a cold or a very mild pneumonitis in about 80 percent of people. It\u2019s only about 15 per cent of people who get what would probably be identified by them as clinical pneumonia and five percent as critical,\u201d he said. \u201c[People who develop pneumonia from coronavirus] can have combinations of these symptoms.\u201d\n\nThe post suggests that exposing the virus to a temperature of 26 to 27 degrees will kill it because COVID-19 \u201cis not heat-resistant\u201d, and that it \u201chates the sun\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is still not known how weather and temperature will affect the spread and transmissibility of the virus.\n\nProfessor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist from the Australian National University, told AAP FactCheck 26 to 27 degrees Celsius temperatures won\u2019t kill the virus.\n\n\u201cViruses survive quite well at lower temperatures and what would kill it is boiling it at heat more than lower temperatures. (26 to 27 degrees is) just room temperature. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to die from that,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Cunningham said sunlight could be effective against coronaviruses since UV light is usually effective in disinfection.\n\n\u201cExposure to UV light will actually kill off DNA. It will dry out everything so you\u2019ll get a relative drop,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a virus dries out, the infectivity drops substantially and chances of getting infected from dried out surfaces are extremely low.\u201d\n\nWhile the post claims COVID-19 can travel \u201cabout 10 feet\u201d (approximately 3m) in a sneeze, 2015 advice from the Australian government\u2019s Department of Health states respiratory droplets projected in a sneeze or cough can travel for around one metre.\n\nThe post makes a number of claims about the survival rate of the coronavirus on different surfaces, including that it lasts for at least 12 hours on a metal surface, six to 12 hours on fabrics and five to 10 minutes on someone\u2019s hand.\n\nThe WHO, however, says it is not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces but studies suggest that, like other coronaviruses, it may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.\n\nNew, yet-to-be peer-reviewed research funded by the US National Institutes of Health has found virus can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days.\n\nProf Collignon also said the COVID-19 virus could survive longer than five to 10 minutes on a person\u2019s hands.\n\nThe University of Sydney\u2019s Prof Cunningham said the survival period depended on the state of the virus on the person\u2019s hands and the environment.\n\n\u201cSkin defences can actually then inactivate it. The real problem is wet material like mucus from someone else\u2019s snot actually being there and you actually touching your face,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the post\u2019s claim that drinking warm water is \u201ceffective for all viruses\u201d Prof Collignon said the claim was baseless, however it is important for people to stay hydrated if they have an illness.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dehydrated, you\u2019re not going to fight it as well so having a reasonable fluid intake is a good idea, but whether it is warm or cold, it would make no difference,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Cunningham also rubbished the post\u2019s claim that gargling salt water is a prevention,, saying the best gargling would do is provide symptomatic relief.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just nonsense. (Gargling is) for symptoms,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Cunningham said the virus infects by getting into a person\u2019s nose \u201cnot through your mouth\u201d.\n\nThe post ends with what it claims is a pathway and timeline of symptoms people experience when they get infected with COVID-19 including a throat infection in the first three to four days then pneumonic symptoms five to six days later and then difficulty in breathing due to nasal congestion.\n\nWhile these symptoms can appear in someone who has contracted COVID-19, Prof Collignon told AAP FactCheck not everyone will develop all of these and in the exact same order.\n\n\u201cSome people just have a mild runny nose and sore throat, a bit of a fever \u2013 that\u2019s it. But people can also develop pneumonia but that does not happen to everyone. That just happens to people who get really sick,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Cunningham said the virus would not infect the throat first due to the tough epithelium (a thin layer of tissue) down the back of the throat but rather the more delicate nasal epithelium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the nasopharynx (the upper airway behind the nose) which can infect the throat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that infection can go down into the trachea causing pneumonia is correct, as is the post\u2019s statement that with pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post to contain a mixture of true and false claims. A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Prof Collingnon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won\u2019t kill the virus however UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, according to Prof Cunningham, however staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. Prof Cunningham also said it was not accurate to say infection will happen first in the throat, as the delicate tissues behind the nose are more likely starting points. Partly False \u2013 The claims of the content are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
