Her husband is supposedly in critical condition.\n\nThe blog trendingnewsonline.info in its undated August post ran the headline, \u201cMainit: Piskal na nakasagutan ng MMDA, tigok matapos ratratin sa tapat ng kanyang bahay sa Caloocan. Asawa nito, agaw buhay!\u201d (Breaking: Fiscal in MMDA road argument shot dead in her house in Caloocan. Husband in critical condition!)\n\nThe facts: Estepa is still alive. There was no such shooting.\n\nThe video embedded in the hoax article is a May 2017 GMA News report about Diosdado Azarcon, a different state prosecutor shot dead outside her house in Caloocan.\n\nThe video will play for a few seconds, then a pop-up of an age restriction warning and a Facebook share button will appear, prompting the user to share the video first before watching the rest of it.\n\nThe site also has no permanent links to content. Similarly constructed dubious sites usually carry a death hoax of a particular personality, then tend to change its content later to run another death hoax.\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) Prosecutor Estepa was caught on video arguing with a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) official initially over an illegal parking violation on Tuesday, August 14. Estepa repeatedly asked for her 5-minute \"grace period\" during the argument. Her husband, Macky Estepa, later arrived at the scene.\n\nThe following day, the MMDA asked the Land Transportation Office to revoke Christine\u2019s license. The couple issued a public apology on the same day.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
