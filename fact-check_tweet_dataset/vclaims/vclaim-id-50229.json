She just had the slaves go work for other white people.\u201d\n\nThe comment can be heard at the 20-second mark in The Associated Press video below:\n\nThe line didn\u2019t appear to have been received well. It was first met with awkward silence, then verbalizations of opposition. At one point a voice can be heard saying, \u201cCome on, man.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s statement did not end there, however. He followed up, pointing out that professional sports organizations and the music industry often profit off the work of Black people without having any Black people in positions of power to control the capital they earn, stating:\n\nYou don\u2019t see the real power. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s putting the internet in your school just to track you. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s targeting you \u2014 Black woman in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s the head of the boards. At risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at Gap. And that has to change today, or I walk away.\n\nAlthough these follow-up comments received applause and cheers by some, his remark about Tubman offended others. In a now-viral video,Toni Fulton can be heard saying, \u201cYo, we leaving right now.\u201d Fulton, who attended with her sister, told The Washington Post that, \u201cWe know better than to be in a space that we\u2019re not uplifted in. While he was saying a lot of crazy things that didn\u2019t directly offend us, that was offensive and it wasn\u2019t appropriate for us to be there anymore.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one to who took her discontent to Twitter.\n\nTubman is a widely revered historical figure, often described as the most famous \u201cconductor\u201d of the Underground Railroad. She risked her life several times over to help slaves escape bondage in the South and walk toward freedom in the North before the U.S. Civil War.\n\nThis is not the first time West has raised controversy with his comments about slavery. In 2018 he apologized after stating that he believed slavery to be a \u201cchoice.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
