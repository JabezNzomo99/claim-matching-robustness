Recent posts include a photo of a flyer with the alleged escaped foreigner's sketch.\n\nThe facts: The BI clarified in a statement that the story of the foreigner's \"escape\" from NAIA's quarantine area is a hoax. Further, the DOH did not issue any advisory or bulletin about a foreigner who escaped the NAIA quarantine area.\n\nBI Spokesperson Dana Sandoval also told Rappler that immigration lookout bulletins may only be issued by the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Philippines has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Tuesday, March 10. President Rodrigo Duterte earlier declared a state of public health emergency, which means that persons suspected of carrying the virus could face sanctions if they refuse to undergo quarantine. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
