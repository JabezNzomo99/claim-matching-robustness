The New York Times compared the film to Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d for its potential to fool people:\n\nIt is probably no accident that Patrick Stewart, narrating Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cDragons: A Fantasy Made Real,\u201d sounds so much like Orson Welles. Tuning in to this film at any point tomorrow night between 8 and 9:30 could be a \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d experience. Like Welles\u2019s \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d radio broadcast in 1938, a long fantasy news bulletin that convinced some Americans that Martians had actually landed in New Jersey, \u201cDragons\u201d takes a fictional premise, announces it at the beginning of the show and then runs with it, with no further disclaimers. So when viewers hear \u201cHalf of all young males are killed in territorial battles\u201d and \u201cTheir wings soak up heat like solar panels, another adaptation for life in this forbidding climate,\u201d it\u2019s easy to forget that this isn\u2019t a serious documentary about a known species.\n\nA similar mockumentary about the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of a mermaid was also aired on Animal Planet in 2012.\n\nOn the dragon beat, we have also investigated reports that the mythical creatures fell from the sky in Tibet, were killed in Malaysia, and that baby dragons are real and enjoy resting on peoples\u2019 fingers. None of those reports, sadly, were legitimate.", "lang": "en"}
