Kamala Harris said, \"Joe, I\u2019m so proud to stand with you.\"\n\nA recent Facebook post suggests this is a relatively new opinion.\n\n\"I don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me,\" the post quotes Harris as saying in June 2019.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any evidence Harris said this when we looked for the quote in the Nexis news archives. In a search for the quote online, Google returned two results: a link to a Facebook page where someone had posted it in a comment, and a June 2019 blog post titled, \"Kamala Harris buries Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe blog post is supportive of Harris, then still a presidential candidate, and praises her performance during a debate.\n\nThe statement that appears in the Facebook post is also in the blog post, but it\u2019s not in a quote attributed to Harris. Rather, it\u2019s the blog post\u2019s author who writes: \"I don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me.\"", "lang": "en"}
