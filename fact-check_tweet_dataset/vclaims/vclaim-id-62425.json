Goldberg\u2019s shirt didn\u2019t depict Trump or any other person.\n\nGoldberg has been outspoken in criticizing Trump throughout his presidency, even once stating that she could not use his name in conjunction with the word \u201cpresident\u201d in an interview with CNN in 2018.\n\nThe image in the Facebook post depicts Goldberg allegedly wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with an illustration of Trump shooting himself in the head. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan \u2013 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2013 is visible below the illustration in the photo.\n\n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t ABC fired This Idiot?\u201d text in the image says of Goldberg, whose show \u201cThe View\u201d airs on ABC. \u201cWonder WHY There is Racism\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo has been digitally manipulated. Goldberg \u2018s shirt didn\u2019t originally feature the graphic illustration of the president or the words \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Had Goldberg worn such a shirt, media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have, except to debunk the claim.\n\nAfter comedian Roseanne Barr retweeted the altered photo in May 2018, Goldberg responded in an episode of \u201cThe View,\u201d displaying it alongside the original, unaltered photo. The unedited photo, taken at the January 2017 Women\u2019s March, actually shows Goldberg wearing a shirt with the words \u201cAnd you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup.\u201d\n\nGoldberg has previously denied wearing the shirt. When the altered photo started circulating on social media in April 2017, she also debunked the notion that she wore it on an episode of \u201cThe View,\u201d saying, \u201cEven though I don\u2019t care for this man, I would never wear the shirt that\u2019s there.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
