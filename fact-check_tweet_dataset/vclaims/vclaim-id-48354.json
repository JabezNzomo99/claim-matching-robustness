Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: The saint talking about \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 in the video is the one killed in Palghar mob lynching. Fact: The man in the video is \u2018Shri Vratadhar Ramanuj Jeeyar Swami Tridandiji\u2019. He is the President of \u2018Akhil Bharat Hindu Maha Sabha\u2019. He confirmed to FACTLY that he is the one in the video. The names of the two saints killed in Palghar mob lynching are Mahant Kalpavruksha Giri (age -70 yrs) and Sushilgiri Maharaj (age \u2013 30yrs). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image, an extended version (archived) of the same video was found to be uploaded on Facebook with the same claim. In the extended video, at 1 min 35 secs, it can be heard that the saint in the video was referred to as \u2018Jeeyar Swamiji Maharaj\u2019. So, when searched on the internet with the keywords, it was found that the person in the video is \u2018Shri Vratadhar Ramanuj Jeeyar Swami Tridandiji\u2019. He is the President of \u2018Akhil Bharat Hindu Maha Sabha\u2019.\n\nWhen FACTLY contacted him, he clarified that he is the one talking in the video. Also, the videos and photos of Vratadhar Jeeyar can be found on a Facebook profile with his name. It can be seen that his facial features, tilak and voice match with the man in the video. So, the person talking in the video is not the saint lynched in Palghar. The names of the two Hindu saints killed in Palghar mob lynching are Mahant Kalpavruksha Giri (age -70 yrs) and Sushilgiri Maharaj (age \u2013 30yrs). Their photos are being circulated on different media and they do not match with the man in the video.\n\nTo sum it up, the saint talking about \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 in this video is not the sadhu killed in Palghar.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
