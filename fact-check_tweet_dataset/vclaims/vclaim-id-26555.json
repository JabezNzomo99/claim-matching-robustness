On average, under the 100:1 regime, African Americans served virtually as much time in prison for non-violent drug offenses as whites did for violent offenses.\u201d\n\nAs The Post reported: \u201cOnce the ratio narrowed to 18-1 in 2010, the number of federal crack convictions dropped dramatically. In 2016, roughly 1,500 people were sentenced, a decrease of 67 percent from six years earlier, the commission reported.\u201d (These statistics cover federal offenses. Most crimes are prosecuted by the states, not the federal government, and roughly 90 percent of all U.S. prisoners are in the custody of the states, according to the Justice Department.)\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, pushed for a new round of reform in the criminal justice system, bringing together a bipartisan coalition of Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, the ACLU and others, prevailing on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to post the bill for a vote, and weathering criticism from conservatives such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). The result was the First Step Act, which Trump signed in December.\n\nThe FIRST STEP Act shortens mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. It also eases a federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule \u2014 which currently imposes a life sentence for three or more convictions \u2014 and issues a 25-year sentence instead. Most consequentially, it expands the \u201cdrug safety-valve,\u201d which would give judges more discretion to deviate from mandatory minimums when sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses. In an overdue change, the bill also makes the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive. Passed in 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act has helped reduce the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses \u2014 a disparity that has hurt racial minorities. The FIRST STEP Act will now apply the Fair Sentencing Act to 3,000 people who were convicted of crack offenses before the law went into effect.\n\nThe law Trump signed also directs the creation of more prisoner programs designed to reduce the likelihood of recidivism and awards time credits toward early release to prisoners who participate. However, the president\u2019s budget proposal for 2020 would provide $14 million for the programs in the First Step Act, when the law calls for $75 million a year for five years, as the Marshall Project reported.\n\nBiden said at the July 31 debate: \u201cThe bill he talks about is a bill that in my \u2014 our administration \u2014 we passed. We passed that bill that you added onto. That\u2019s the bill, in fact, you passed.\u201d He was responding to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), but Booker, one of the sponsors of the First Step Act, was talking about the same bill as Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Fair Sentencing Act was certainly important, but it was narrower and relatively non-controversial,\u201d Trump spokesman Zach Parkinson said. \u201cEven Jeff Sessions was a co-sponsor of the bill, and it saw little opposition in Congress.\u201d Of Biden, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rich for him to take credit for undoing what is widely considered to be a bad law that he helped make.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign said the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, which allows judges more discretion on sentencing in Trump\u2019s First Step Act, first appeared in the 1994 crime law Biden sponsored. The law Trump signed expanded the safety valve to cover more types of offenders, the Biden campaign said. Biden also sponsored the Second Chance Act in 2007 with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). That bipartisan bill provided grants to local governments and other groups to fund \u201cliteracy classes, job training, education programs and substance abuse and rehabilitation programs for inmates.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is proud of the work that the Fair Sentencing Act did to reduce the crack versus powder cocaine sentencing disparity and repeal several mandatory minimums,\u201d Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said. \"He was also instrumental in the creation of the safety valve that the First Step Act recently expanded. As president, he would eliminate mandatory minimums, private prisons, and the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, while delivering numerous other urgently-needed reforms.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cI did criminal justice reform, which President Obama could not get approved\u201d \u2014 is worth Three Pinocchios. The First Step Act was described as historic criminal justice reform, but one of its biggest pieces was, in fact, an extension of Obama\u2019s efforts in 2010. When we reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign, a spokesman acknowledged the Fair Sentencing Act was \u201ccertainly important\u201d legislation, but the president was not so careful.", "lang": "en"}
