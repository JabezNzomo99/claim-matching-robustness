At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year,\" Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. \"That\u2019s an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we\u2019re doing very poorly in terms of A-list.\"\n\nBack in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were \"No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four.\" PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated.\n\nThis new claim is a bit more tempered.\n\nDoes the United States spend more per student than other major countries?\n\n\"The question is, how do you define \u2018major?\u2019\" said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of cutting federal involvement in K-12 education.\n\nMcCluskey relies on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trump\u2019s statement.\n\nAccording to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States.\n\nSwitzerland ranks first on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is third.\n\nThe United States\u2019 per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was 31 percent higher than the OECD\u2019s average of $9,000.\n\n\"It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland,\" McCluskey said. \"Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they\u2019re all major.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics.\n\nA conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. \"While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance,\" it read.\n\nAmerican students\u2019 scores on the test were mediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries.\n\nThat concurs with Trump\u2019s assessment that \"we\u2019re doing very poorly,\" education-wise.\n\n\"For a country that spends as much as we do, you\u2019d think we\u2019d have better outcomes,\" McCluskey said.\n\nTrump said that in the United States spends \"more per student than almost any other major country in the world.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion that U.S. taxpayers don\u2019t get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students\u2019 test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway.", "lang": "en"}
