The media desk referred us to one of Eskom\u2019s\n\n\u201cYou will note that we now refer to \u2018more than 90% of electricity in South Africa\u2019,\u201d the media desk said.\n\nBut the 95% figure can still be found on Eskom\u2019s\n\n. And up until recently, it was also the figure used in Eskom\u2019s Twitter bio.\n\nBoth numbers we\u2019re checking in this report were removed from the Twitter account after Africa Check asked Eskom for the sources of its claims. (\n\nEskom\u2019s media desk told Africa Check that the 90% figure comes from\n\n(Stats SA), the country\u2019s data agency, and asked that we direct our query to them.\n\nthat gathers information on the volume of electricity units generated and distributed by all producers and Eskom.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to calculate Eskom\u2019s percentage of generation and distribution from the data published in the release,\u201d Nicolai Claassen, director of industry statistics at Stats SA, told Africa Check. However, off-grid and self-generation is excluded from the report, Claassen said.\n\nAccording to preliminary numbers in\n\nof electricity were delivered to South Africa\u2019s provinces. Claassen said these numbers indicate consumption as electricity cannot be stored and used later.\n\nSo how much did Eskom supply? Claassen said that 16,380 GWh came from the power utility. This works out to 90%.\n\nThe balance is made up of electricity from private producers and contributions from the\n\nWe rate the claim as mostly correct.\n\nAside from saying that the 45% was a \u201chistorical figure\u201d, Eskom failed to provide any information to support its claim.\n\nOur first step was to determine how much Eskom electricity was consumed in Africa in a year.\n\nOn the advice of Prof Anton Eberhard, director of the\n\nof the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town, we used the\n\nas a proxy for consumption. According to the report, Eskom sold\n\nof electricity to customers from\n\nThe majority (94%) of this was local sales, with the remainder being sold internationally.\n\nIf Eskom\u2019s claim is correct, it would mean that 462,931 GWh were consumed in Africa \u2013 208,319 GWh is 45% of this number. The available data does not reflect this, however.\n\nData on electricity use in Africa is limited.\n\n(Afrec) attributes the lack of \u201cperfect\u201d energy data for the continent to factors such as that \u201cmost African countries\u201d don\u2019t have reliable energy databases \u201cdue to limited capacities, competencies and understanding of their importance\u201d.\n\nThe commission, which is tasked with\n\nelectricity use on the continent to be 700,000 GWh in 2018, based on data provided by countries.\n\nThe report says the IEA estimates data for\n\nin Africa for which individual data is not available.

This made up close to 30% of the estimated amount of electricity used in Africa in 2018 (700,000 GWh). The claim is therefore incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
