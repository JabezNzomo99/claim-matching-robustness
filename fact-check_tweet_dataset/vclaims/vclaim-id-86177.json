But if the president is going to keep getting this wrong, it\u2019s time to give this falsehood a Pinocchio rating.\n\nThere are two numbers that Trump loves to reference when discussing the international nuclear agreement negotiated with Iran when Obama was president: $150 billion and $1.7 billion. The latter was a cash transaction, said to be the settlement of a long-standing Iranian claim against the United States, with interest, that was curiously timed to arrive when Iran released four detained Americans. (We discussed this payment at length in this fact check.)\n\nTrump might have grounds to complain about the circumstances of the $1.7 billion cash transaction. But he\u2019s all wet about the $150 billion claim, especially when he suggests it was taxpayer money. That\u2019s certainly what he did in this tweet, asking why Democrats will not agree to appropriate $5 billion for a wall on the southern border with Mexico when they \u201cgave Iran 150 Billion Dollars.\u201d\n\nBut unlike the cash deal, this was not U.S. money. It was Iran\u2019s money, frozen in international financial institutions around the world because of sanctions intended to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. For instance, many of the funds were held in banks in Asia, including China and India, as well as Turkey. Many of the countries received waivers to buy Iranian oil and gas during the sanctions but placed the payments in escrow-style accounts that remained off-limits to Iran. The Islamic Republic also transferred assets to Asian banks from Europe in anticipation of financial sanctions.\n\nOn top of that, Trump\u2019s repeated use of the $150 billion figure is off-base. That was an upper-range estimate, but the Treasury Department said much of it was not liquid. Once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left, Treasury said.\n\n\u201cEstimates of total Central Bank of Iran (CBI) foreign exchange assets worldwide are in the range of $100 [billion] to $125 billion,\u201d Adam J. Szubin, acting Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told Congress in 2015. \u201cOur assessment is that Iran\u2019s usable liquid assets after sanctions relief will be much lower, at a little more than $50 billion. The other $50-70 billion of total CBI foreign exchange assets are either obligated in illiquid projects (such as over 50 projects with China) that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them. These assets would not become accessible following sanctions relief.\u201d\n\nNader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University\u2019s Crown Center for Middle East Studies, did his own calculation of Iran\u2019s frozen assets in 2015. He noted that $10 billion was in Iraqi banks and could not be recovered quickly and that nearly $25 billion was deposited in Chinese banks as collateral for several Chinese investments in Iran. He estimated that only about $29 billion would be available to Iran for immediate use. In context of Iran\u2019s oil revenue, he wrote, \u201c$29 billion of released funds doesn\u2019t amount to that much and represents only half of Iran\u2019s current oil export revenue.\u201d\n\nWe should note that Trump said Obama \u201cgot nothing\u201d in exchange for lifting sanctions as part of the nuclear agreement. Perhaps that\u2019s a matter of opinion, but experts said that Iran was generally in compliance with the agreement when Trump decided to terminate it.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the $150 billion continues to be problematic. That was a high-end estimate, and the actual number available to Iran appears to have been between $25 billion and $50 billion.", "lang": "en"}
