Thank you to everyone who sent us quotes for checking via Twitter using hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA, on Facebook or by email.\n\nThe 2017-18 federal budget introduced a random drug testing trial for recipients of the Newstart Allowance for job-seekers and Youth Allowance in three locations. During a discussion of the measure on Q&A, Social Services Minister Christian Porter said \u201crates of drug use amongst unemployed are 2.5 times higher than amongst employed people\u201d.\n\nIs that right?\n\nAsked for sources to support his statement, a spokesperson for Christian Porter confirmed the minister was referring to illicit drugs, and directed The Conversation to page 84 of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare\u2019s 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey.\n\nCollecting data on employment status and drug use\n\nThe National Drug Strategy Household Survey quoted by the minister\u2019s spokesperson is a reliable and comprehensive dataset.\n\nThe federal government has conducted the survey every three years since 1998. It is currently conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a federal government agency. The survey collects data on drug use and drug-related issues in the Australian population.\n\nThe first findings of the 2016 survey were released on June 1 this year, but those results didn\u2019t include detailed employment data. The latest employment-level data is from 2013, when the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collected information from almost 24,000 people across Australia.\n\nThe 2013 survey asked questions about people\u2019s use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare defines \u201cillicit drugs\u201d as \u201cillegal drugs, drugs and volatile substances used illicitly, and pharmaceuticals used for non-medical purposes\u201d. So that\u2019s the definition used in this FactCheck. You can read the full list of drugs included here.\n\nRecent drug use among employed and unemployed people\n\nThe data below is based on the number of employed and unemployed people aged 14 and over who said they had used the drugs listed at least once in the 12 months prior to the 2013 survey.\n\nCompared to employed people, unemployed people were 1.5 times more likely to have used an illicit drug. They were:\n\u2022 None 1.4 times more likely to have used cocaine;\n\u2022 None 1.6 times more likely to have used pharmaceuticals for non-medical purposes;\n\u2022 None 1.6 times more likely to have used cannabis;\n\u2022 None 1.8 times more likely to have used ecstasy; and\n\u2022 None 2.4 times more likely to have used methamphetamine (for example, ice and speed).\n\nSo, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data, Porter\u2019s statement that drug use among unemployed people is 2.5 times higher than among employed people is a selective use of the data. It\u2019s true for methamphetamine use, but not for other types of drugs, or illicit use of drugs overall.\n\nThe most commonly used illicit drug among unemployed people was cannabis, which had been used by 18.5% of that population in the previous 12 months. Methamphetamine had been used by 5.6% of the unemployed population in that period.\n\nIn the 12 months prior to the 2013 survey, 24.5% of unemployed people had used illicit drugs, compared to 16.8% of employed people.\n\nOther trends in illicit drug use\n\nAccording to the data, a larger proportion of unemployed people had never used illicit drugs (55.5%) compared to employed people (48.8%).\n\nWhile people who were unemployed were less likely to have ever used illicit drugs, those who did were 1.4 to 2.4 times more likely to have used them in the previous 12 months.\n\nOverall, unemployed people were 1.5 times more likely than employed people to have taken an illicit drug in the the previous 12 months.\n\nChristian Porter\u2019s statement that \u201crates of drug use amongst unemployed are 2.5 times higher than amongst employed people\u201d was incorrect.\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare data showed unemployed people were 1.5 times more likely than employed people to have used an illicit drug in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe figure Porter quoted relates to methamphetamine, which unemployed people were 2.4 times more likely than employed people to have used in the past 12 months. \u2013 Nicole Lee\n\nI agree with this FactCheck. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has the most appropriate and up-to-date statistics on drug use by Australians with the most recent data on this particular issue being for 2013.\n\nI have checked the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data. The data show the unemployed had been recent drug users at a higher rate than employed people in the year leading up to the 2013 survey. But overall this was at a rate a bit less than 1.5 times that of the employed, not 2.5 times as Christian Porter said on Q&A. \u2013 Peter Whiteford\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit is the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
