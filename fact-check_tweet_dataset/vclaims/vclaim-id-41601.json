But, FACTLY has found the video clip to be a part of a web series. The complete video can be seen on the YouTube channel of \u2018CWE\u2019 and was uploaded on 18 March 2019. \u2018CWE\u2019 is Continental Wrestling Entertainment channel started by WWE wrestler \u2018The Great Khali\u2019. So, the video clip is not that of a real-life incident and is a part of a web series of \u2018CWE\u2019. Earlier, when another clip of a web series of \u2018CWE\u2019 went viral as that of a true incident, FACTLY has debunked it and that fact-checked article can be read here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
