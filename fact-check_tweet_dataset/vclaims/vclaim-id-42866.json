Multiple posts with this graphic were also flagged by Claim Check, Facebook's tool for monitoring posts with potentially dubious information.\n\nThe facts: As of Friday, May 8, the government's coronavirus task force has not announced an extension of the enhanced community quarantine beyond May 15. The graphic was also manipulated.\n\nOn April 24, the government announced an extension of the ECQ from May 1 until May 15 in areas with a high number of coronavirus cases. No further extension of the ECQ has been announced as of Friday. (READ: DOCUMENT: Omnibus guidelines on enhanced, general community quarantine)\n\nThe Metro Manila Council, composed of the mayors of the 17 local government units of the National Capital Region, will meet on Saturday to discuss their recommendation on extending or lifting the ECQ in the metropolis. However, the final decision will come from the government's coronavirus task force.\n\nMeanwhile, the original graphic posted by Nueva Ecija TV48 on April 24 indicated that the ECQ would be extended until May 15. The station posted on Facebook saying the graphic with the false claim was \"obviously edited.\"\n\n\n\nIn the past, Rappler debunked other false claims about the government's efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak. These included posts alleging that President Rodrigo Duterte will announce a \"total lockdown\" and another false claim that the President ordered a mandatory \"no work, with pay\" policy. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
