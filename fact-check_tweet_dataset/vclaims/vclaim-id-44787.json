It turns out that many roofs in Hubei China are covered with chrysanthemum bats, a type of bat.\"\n\nWe also received the video on the BOOM helpline number (+91 7700906111)\n\n\n\nThe video is being posted on Facebook and Twitter with the same caption.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the posts on Facebook.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nBOOM found that the video is over eight years old and was uploaded by Miami based roofing contractor Istueta Roofing. The workers can be heard speaking in Spanish in the original video, without the cinematic background music that has been added in the viral video.\n\nThe company writes about the video: \"Our crew is in for a surprise when they begin the removal process of our clients' old roof and hundreds of bats come flying out from underneath the tiles. This was unexpected! (Bat Removal is not a service that we provide.) A special thanks to our Production Manager, Danny Argote, for getting this on camera.\"\n\nThe video is originally from Florida, USA and is not from any Chinese provinces.\n\nView the original video on the roofing company's YouTube channel below:\n\n\n\nThe 2019-nCoV (2019 novel Coronavirus) has so far claimed 362 lives. The virus is suspected to have originated from the Hunan Seafood market in Wuhan city in China's Hubei district. The city, which has around 11 million residents, has been put under lockdown. The disease outbreak comes during the Lunar New Year Festival when China sees many residents flying in and out of the country.\n\nALSO READ: WHO Declares Coronavirus As Global Public Health Emergency\n\nAccording to a study published by the Lancet, the epidemiological and genomic characterisation of the virus is similar to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) like virus. The study states that although bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\nThe outbreak of the virus has also sparked a slew of misinformation on social media.\n\nALSO READ: Boiled Garlic Water For Treating Coronavirus?
