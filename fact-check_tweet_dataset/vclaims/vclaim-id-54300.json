As Gessner explained in his blog back in 2011:\n\nMy first true business venture, after college, was trying to make and market a poster in which one man urinated on another. That should be all I need to say to give you a sense of my basic business acumen. Somehow it never occurred to me that this concept \u2014 a guy pissing on another guy \u2014 was not going to make me rich. To be fair the story is slightly more complicated: the poster was born of a political cartoon I drew in college for the Harvard Crimson. It was a picture of the back of Ronald Reagan, recognizable mostly by his ridiculous pompadour, urinating on an African American homeless man who was sleeping, covered with newspapers, in a gutter. It was called \u201cThe Trickle Down Theory.\u201d [M]y good friend Dave and I decided to start a small business that would market satiric posters, and for our first effort we chose a real life depiction of my semi-notorious cartoon \u2026 We decided to hire a limousine and two actors to play a chauffeur and the homeless man, while getting Dave\u2019s grandfather to play a generic rich guy. As the director, it was part of my job to coach poor Dave\u2019s grandpa in spraying the water from a mustard bottle onto the man playing the bum in the gutter. Dave and I filmed the thing in the backstreets of our mutual hometown, Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nAs noted in that blog entry, the original poster Gessner created simply bore the legend \u201cTHE TRICKLE DOWN THEORY\u201d at its bottom. The text that now accompanies the photograph about \u201cNew Yorker millionaire Brandon Torrent\u201d is a completely fabricated backstory that someone else added to the image:", "lang": "en"}
