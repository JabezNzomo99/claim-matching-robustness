The claim is false; according to experts, corpses do not get more infectious over time and the rise in infections after funerals is a result of mourners infecting one another.\n\nThe Facebook post, shared more than 1,300 times in South Africa since July 21, 2020, reads in part: \u201cAfter the 72 hours the toxicity of the body is 100 times more potent and everyone who comes close to even the sealed casket/coffin is in grave danger of contracting the virus (sic).\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately undertakers are allowing people to bury outside the 72hour window period and this is the thing that makes funerals a playground for COVID-19 (sic),\u201d it adds.\n\nThe claim has been repeated on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nAccording to South Africa\u2019s recent Government Gazette published on July 17, 2020, bodies of dead people infected with COVID-19 can be kept in a mortuary for up to seven days. Previously the maximum holding period was two days.\n\n\u201cThe latest regulations mandate that a COVID-19 positive body must not be kept at a mortuary for more than seven days before disposal (burial or cremation),\u201d Gavin Kirk, a forensic pathology expert and senior lecturer at South Africa\u2019s University of Cape Town, told AFP Fact Check in an email.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 positive bodies are a potential source of infection after death. The period of infectivity is not certain and various reports have given infective periods from a few days to weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Kirk said it is likely that the \u201cdegree of infectivity declines the longer the period is after death\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe source of infection [from] COVID-19 positive bodies can be contaminated body surfaces or directly from the respiratory tract and organs.\u201d\n\nThose handling bodies or performing post-mortem examinations wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) to guard against these potential risks.\n\n\u201cHandling and moving a body may cause some expulsion of material from the airways which can be a potential danger. Similarly, if the respiratory organs are manipulated during a post-mortem examination,\u201d Kirk said.\n\n\u201cOnce the body has been sealed in a body bag following all the necessary protocols (as per the guidelines) and placed in the coffin or casket, there is no danger of infection \u2013 as long as all procedures have been properly carried out.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) agrees. A document on March 24, 2020, states that the safety procedures for a dead person infected with COVID-19 should be consistent with those used for any autopsies of people who have died from an acute respiratory illness.\n\n\u201cIf a person died during the infectious period of COVID-19, the lungs and other organs may still contain live virus, and additional respiratory protection is needed during aerosol-generating procedures,\u201d it reads.\n\nIt specifies that family or friends may view the body but should not \u201ctouch or kiss the body\u201d and adds that those who will handle the burial of the body should wear gloves and wash their hands with soap and water after the burial is completed.\n\nAsked if a COVID-19 infected body needs to be buried within a certain time because of its \u201ctoxicity\u201d, Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at South Africa\u2019s University of Witwatersrand, said it was not the case.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the virus will have died after three days,\u201d he wrote in an email to AFP.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that after 72 hours, corpses are highly infectious -- and increasingly so -- even in a sealed coffin, which Madhi dismissed as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d.\n\nMadhi said infections at funerals have little to do with the corpse but rather with the living.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] because of the living people\u2019s behaviour and nothing to do with the corpse. The virus is not a living creature and cannot transmit unless living people spread it,\u201d he said.\n\nCheryl Cohen, associate professor in epidemiology at the University of Witwatersrand and co-head of the Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis at the National Institute for Communicable Disease (NICD), echoed Madhi\u2019s comments that transmission at funerals is because of the mourners.\n\n\u201cThis is a respiratory virus spread by droplets -- generally, as long as people don\u2019t have very close contact with the corpse, like touching, kissing or hugging, there should not be a risk from the corpse,\u201d she said.\n\nAttendance at a funeral is limited to 50 people in South Africa, according to pandemic regulations, and a permit must be obtained from a magistrate or police station. Furthermore, wearing masks, sanitising hands and social distancing are mandatory.\n\nFunerals have become a contentious issue in the country with flouted regulations under the microscope by social media users, as reported in this AFP Fact Check on the funeral of Zindzi Mandela, the youngest daughter of South Africa\u2019s Nelson Mandela.\n\nMore than 471,123 people have contracted the novel coronavirus in South Africa as of July 29, 2020, according to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, with more than 7,497 deaths and 297,967 recoveries.", "lang": "en"}
