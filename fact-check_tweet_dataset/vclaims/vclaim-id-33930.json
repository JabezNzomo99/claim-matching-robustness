David Edelman. He has not worked for the government since early 2017.\n\nThe House voted to impeach President Donald Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress Dec. 18. It comes months after a member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nA viral Facebook post falsely alleged that a bespectacled man circled in the photo, taken by Getty photographer Nicholas Kamm on Nov. 9, 2016, is the Ukraine whistleblower. It has been shared more than 5,500 times.

He previously worked as the special assistant to the president for economic and technology policy in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cFAKE NEWS: the \u2018NERD\u2019 circled below is the whistleblower,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTRUE (just not news): the \u2018NERD\u2019 circled below is\u2026 this nerd. Me. Left the government in 2017. Sorry to disappoint, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nThe call between Trump and the Ukrainian president occurred on July 25 of this year, so it is impossible for Edelman to have had anything to do with the whistleblower complaint. He left his government job in January 2017, according to FactCheck.org.", "lang": "en"}
