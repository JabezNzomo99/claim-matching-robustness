If talks go according to the SC's judgement, the mediation process would need to end in the next 8 weeks.\n\nHere are 5 things to know\n\n1. Who is on the mediation panel?\n\nThe SC has appointed three members on this mediation panel:\n\u2022 Retired Justice FM Khafiullah: Justice (retd.) Fakkir Mohammed Ibrahim Khalifullah is a former SC judge who served from April 2, 2012 to July 22, 2016 and will head the panel. Justice Khalifullah was on the Constitution Bench of the case pertaining to commutation of the sentences of the assassins of former PM Rajiv Gandhi in August 2015. He was previously served as judge on the Madras High Court.\n\u2022 Advocate Sriram Panchu: A senior advocate, he is one of the founders of the India Mediation Chambers and has worked towards making mediation as part of the Indian legal system.\n\u2022 Sri Sri Ravishankar: He is a spiritual guru and founder of 'Art Of Living'. Ravishankar has been a proponent of mediation settlement through arbitration in the Ram Janmabhoomi Dispute\n\n2. What would be the mediation guidelines?\n\nThe SC has laid down the following guiding principles by which the mediation process would be streamlined:\n\u2022 The mediation process would be out of the public lens and would be carried out with confidentiality. Media would not be allowed print or electronic reporting of the mediation proceedings\n\u2022 The process would take place in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh.\n\u2022 The panel is permitted to make changes to its composition if the need arises and should they choose to do so\n\n3.

Where do all the parties stand on mediation?\n\nThe Nirmohi Akhara has welcomed the decision and has spoken to ANI post the decision:\n\nTheir spokesperson, Kartik Chopra, reaffirming the group's faith in the mediation process and in the SC order, stated that the Nirmohi Akhara, had, in fact, suggested the names of the three retired judges of the SC to be on the mediation panel.\n\nThe Muslim parties who are party to the dispute too have lent their support to the mediation process.\n\nPost the SC order earlier today, member of the executive committee of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) spoke to ANI supporting the mediation process.\n\nAIMIM MP from Hyderabad, Assaduddin Owaisi, welcomed the court decision, but questioned Sri Sri Ravishankar's presence on it, saying it would compromise on its neutrality.\n\nHowever, other Hindu groups have opposed mediation.\n\nSenior advocate CS Vaidyanath, appearing for the Deity Ram Lalla made these statements to PTI:\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state of Uttar Pradesh, too expressed apprehension at mediation and said that it should be carried out only if there existed a possibility of settlement. Mehta said given the nature of the case, mediation should not be a path forward. \n\n\n\nDeputy CM of Uttar Pradesh, Keshav Prasad Maurya spoke following the order today. Maurya said that the case should not be delayed, and while he welcomes a settlement through dialogue, he also cited legislative routes (ordinances and legislative procedures) to solve the issue.\n\n5. Is this the first attempt at mediation on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue?\n\nNo, but this the closest that the Ram Janmabhoomi case has reached to formal mediation amongst the disputing parties.\n\u2022 Former Chief Justice of India JS Khehar had recommended mediation and had even offered to appoint mediators for the parties in March 2017. The SC's statements can be found here.\n\u2022 Sri Sri Ravishankar (who has been appointed as one of the mediators on the current panel) had previously made an offer to intervene to reach an amicable solution in November 2016. The statement by his organisation 'Art of Living' can be read here.\n\u2022 Then the senior-most judge on the Allahabad High Court, Justice Dharam Veer Sharma had suggested mediation in September 2010, before the verdict of Allahabad High Court dividing the disputed land equally amongst the three parties.\n\u2022 There were back channel talks between the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the AIMPLB before 1992, but the demolition of the Babri Masjid laid them to rest.\n\nThe Ram Janmabhoomi case has been with the Supreme Court since 2010 after it froze the judgement of the Allahabad High Court in 2010. The Allahabad High Court then ruled to divide the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi land equally amongst three parties:\n\nThe Ram Janmabhoomi dispute started with the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 in Ayodhya, which various Hindu groups claim is the birthplace of Lord Ram (Ram Janmabhoomi).", "lang": "en"}
