The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) told us (when we wrote about this last year) that calls from landlines can be linked to an address, but calls from mobile phones will only show a general location at the time of the call.\n\nThe NPCC added that the police don\u2019t always send officers to silent calls \u201cso it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can\u2014in any way they can\u201d. Police will use other information, such as previous calls, to inform their decision on whether to send officers.\n\nWhen BT operators receive silent 999 calls, they are supposed to connect callers to a police call handler if they hear suspicious noises or a disturbance. If they aren\u2019t sure whether an emergency service is needed, the call will be transferred to the \u201cSilent Solution\u201d system. An automated message plays, asking the caller to press 55 to be put through to the police.", "lang": "en"}
