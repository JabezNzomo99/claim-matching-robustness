One such speculation took place on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll in With Chris Hayes\u201d program, where on June 29, the anchor addressed a spike in COVID-19 cases in the state.\n\nThough Hayes emphasized there was no way to confirm cause and effect, his analysis led to an incorrect theory that the rally resulted in two days of 100% positive COVID-19 tests a week later. In a later segment, Hayes clarified that the data he presented was incomplete.\n\nWe will address this claim starting with the initial misreport, followed by a look at the actual data, and then the clarification.\n\nOn June 29, Hayes reported that positive COVID-19 test rates in Oklahoma had skyrocketed. He said:\n\nAnd it comes less than 10 days after that infamous Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally where even with the arena far from full, you still had thousands of people gathered in an indoor space cheering and screaming in a city that had just seen a spike in cases and in violation of every single recommendation for safety \u2026 And while we never know cause and effect exactly, particularly in the moment, it\u2019s hard to figure out what the exact impact of that rally looks \u2026 Look at this: yesterday in Oklahoma, they tested 352 people for the coronavirus, and every single test came back positive. Today they tested another 178 people, and all those tests came back positive, too. If you can\u2019t do the math in your head, that\u2019s a 100% positive rate.\n\nAccording to data the show cited from The COVID Tracking Project on those dates, there did appear to be a 100% COVID-19 positive testing rate. On June 28 and 29 respectively, the data showed 352 and 178 tests were conducted and reported positive (see table below). This was in stark contrast to June 30 numbers that showed more than 15,000 tests had been conducted, and the number of negative cases had risen.\n\nHowever, Hayes\u2019 language led to misinterpretation. PoliticusUSA, a news organization, reported Trump\u2019s rally \u201cmay have [had] an impact on the spread of coronavirus in the state.\u201d Numerous tweets linked the two events together more directly.\n\nBut the reality was not so simple. We found some lags in the government\u2019s reporting after looking at the Oklahoma health department\u2019s daily executive order reports, which provide updated cumulative COVID-19 data for the state, and speaking with Paul Monies, a reporter with Oklahoma Watch, a non-profit investigative journalism outlet. Those lags generally mean that percentages pinned to any specific day can be problematic.\n\nEach government report \u2014 only issued on weekdays \u2014 shares data from midnight of the previous day, so the Monday report would conceivably share new information from Sunday, in addition to cumulative data. Monies suggested that many labs with COVID-19 tests were closed on weekends, or worked limited hours, so complete numbers of COVID-19 tests would be released during the regular work week in government reports. Indeed, each report indicates with an asterisk which labs were closed on weekends.\n\nThe COVID Tracking Project\u2019s reporting showed that on some weekends, negative specimens\u2019 numbers remained unchanged. For example, the government did not release reports for July 3, 4, and 5 during the Fourth of July break, so The COVID Tracking Project reflected the negative specimens\u2019 data from the July 2 report for those three days, a cumulative total of 348,789. The same lag happened on June 27, 28, and 29, where the number of negative specimens remained unchanged in reports (313,021), and The COVID Tracking Project reflected data from the government\u2019s June 26 report. In other words, reporting delays impacted both the data reported by the government and the data that The COVID Tracking Project pulled from the government.\n\nWe also noticed that the state reported large batches of negative tests on Tuesday mornings. For this reason, looking at positive percentage rates on specific days was not useful, Dillon Richards, an Oklahoma City reporter with KOCO News, told us.\n\nAll of that said, Trump\u2019s June 20 rally did violate numerous health recommendations from experts, took place when COVID-19 cases were rising in the state, and may have resulted in some positive cases. But no one has traced the increased number of cases to that one event. Oklahoma is also one of the unhealthiest states in the country, a potential factor in rising numbers.\n\nIn sum, even though the rally may have increased risk for attendees, its connection to rising COVID cases is difficult to prove. The 100% positive test rate was also misreported, and Hayes issued a clarification. We therefore rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
