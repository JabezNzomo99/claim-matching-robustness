Speaking to BOOM, Manjunath Singe, DCP, Mumbai Police clarified that the particular message is not from them and that it was circulated by some individual person.\n\nThe audio recording in Marathi, accompanying the text message, gives out the following details: \u201cA person will call you and say that they are from one of the mobile companies and that they have called for a verification of the Aadhaar card. The person on the other side will specifically speak in Hindi and will tell you to press 1 if you have an Aadhaar card after which they will ask you for your Aadhaar card number. The man in the audio claims that since everybody\u2019s bank account is linked to their Aadhaar cards, they will ask you to press one more button after which you will receive an OTP. Once you key in the OTP, all the money in all your bank accounts that are linked with your Aadhaar card will be withdrawn. After which even if you try to call the number, you won\u2019t be able to connect. Save yourselves from any such hoax calls and also save your relatives and friends from falling for such hoaxes.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
