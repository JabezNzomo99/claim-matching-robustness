The fish\u2019s range spans North America, from Canada to northern Mexico, and they like quiet streams, ponds, lagoons and small- to medium-sized lakes.\n\nTheir diet? Insects, insect larvae, small crustaceans and worms. (No humans listed.)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any credible evidence that bluegill fish prey on people, not to mention kill hundreds of them every year. Rather, news coverage of the fish is positive, and it doesn\u2019t suggest that we should fear the bluegill.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, USA Today published a piece titled: \"Easy to find and fun to catch, bluegill are America\u2019s fish.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re delicious when lightly battered and fried,\" the story says.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
