Challenger Rick Kriseman countered by saying fewer people are working.\n\n\"Unfortunately, since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg,\" Kriseman said, \"and there are less people employed in the city of St. Petersburg than there were prior to his taking office.\"\n\nWe decided to put both candidates\u2019 claims to the Truth-O-Meter. (We checked Foster's claim here and Kriseman's claim about fewer businesses here.) In this check, we\u2019ll examine Kriseman\u2019s line about fewer people working in St. Petersburg than before Foster took office.\n\nThe jobs picture for the nation has improved in recent years, and the same goes for the state. Wouldn\u2019t St. Petersburg logically follow that trend?\n\nIn short, it does.\n\nfor the city of St. Petersburg, rough as they may be, do not support Kriseman\u2019s point. The numbers are taken from the government\u2019s monthly survey of 60,000 households.\n\nFoster took office in January 2010, several months after the recession officially ended in .\n\nWhen Foster took office, just over 103,000 St. Petersburg residents were working -- lower than it had been in any point since at least 2003, according to .\n\nBut the most recent federal data for July 2013 show the number of people with jobs is up over 115,000. State data offer a more up-to-date figure, showing 116,127 employed residents for August. Granted, that\u2019s still short of the size of the city\u2019s workforce pre-recession. But it\u2019s certainly not a reduction from when Foster took office.\n\nRaymond James chief economist Scott Brown cautioned these figures are not consistent or fixed to match trends in population, \"but in general, you would expect to see some improvement because we tend to mirror the national and state economy.\"\n\n\"At the city level, especially St. Petersburg, little places like that are just slots in the overall economic cycle,\" Snaith said. \"They\u2019ve just got to ride what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re not going to be able to buck global and national swings that are just incredibly dramatic as they were in this cycle.\"", "lang": "en"}
