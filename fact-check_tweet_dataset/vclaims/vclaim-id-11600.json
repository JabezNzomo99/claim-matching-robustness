That\u2019s equivalent to just over one diagnosis every four minutes.\n\nChlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed STI\n\nChlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection (STI) in England, with 203,000 diagnoses (for people of all ages) in 2017. Genital warts was the second most common with 59,000 diagnoses, and gonorrhoea third at around 45,000. Public Health England also publishes data on the number of diagnoses of other STIs, like genital herpes and syphilis, for different age groups.\n\nAmong 15-24 year olds in England last year, there were 144,000 diagnoses of gonorrhoea and chlamydia, or about one every four minutes.\n\nIf you look at all five of the STIs named above, there were around 185,000 diagnoses in England in 2017 for those aged 15-24. That\u2019s closer to one diagnosis every three minutes.\n\nWe\u2019ve not included HIV here, as it isn\u2019t exclusively transmitted by sexual contact.\n\nIncluding diagnoses for things like HIV, shigella, scabies and other infections that aren\u2019t only sexually transmitted, there were 210,000 new diagnoses in 15 to 24 year-olds in 2017.\n\nThese figures are for diagnoses, not people\n\nThese figures aren\u2019t the same as the number of people who caught STIs last year\u2014someone might get diagnosed with the same or different STIs multiple times in one year, or get diagnosed with multiple infections at once.\n\nThere are also likely to be people with STIs who haven\u2019t been tested or diagnosed yet. Cases of some STIs (especially chlamydia) can be symptomless so it may take a while for someone to get diagnosed.\n\nThe number of diagnoses can only tell us so much about how common a disease is. To really get an insight we need to look at the rate of infection, or how many diagnoses there were per person in the population.\n\nIn 2017, there were around 1,900 chlamydia diagnoses per 100,000 15-24 year-olds in England.\n\nGonorrhoea is much less commonly diagnosed, with 244 diagnoses per 100,000 of the 15-24 population.\n\nIs it getting better?\n\nChlamydia detection rates for the whole population have dropped ever so slightly, from around 390 diagnoses per 100,000 in 2013 to 370 in 2017.\n\nThe rate has dropped slightly for the 15-24 age bracket since 2013, back then there were 2,100 diagnoses per 100,000. In 2017 there were around 1,900.\n\nThere is a national chlamydia screening programme in England, and in 2017, 1.3 million chlamydia tests were done by 15-24 year-olds, which is down 8% on the year before.\n\nFor gonorrhoea (in all age groups again), the number of diagnoses very slightly increased, from 60 per 100,000 in 2013 to 80 in 2017.\n\nFor the 15-24 age bracket, there has been an increase from around 180 diagnoses per 100,000 in 2013, to 240 in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
