A disabled youngster who begged on the streets got his legs fixed.\"The same video is being shared by many other Facebook users as well.The video has nothing to do with Delhi. The video is from Pakistan and is at least two years old.Times Fact Check analysed the video using InVid Google extension for Chrome and ran reverse-image searches on the extracted key frames. This led us to an article published on a website called 'Khabarfoori.com' which carried the same video. We translated the Arabic website to English to figure out what's written. The article basically said that the video is of a Pakistani beggar who tricks people into believing he's lost his legs.We were able to find the same video published on NBT.in on October 6, 2018.Using relevant keywords on Google search, we also found a report published on Divya Bhaskar on January 26, 2019, which said that the incident is from Pakistan's Lahore.We also found the video posted on Facebook by a user who goes by the name 'Simanta Lahon' two years ago.Times Fact Check has found the claim that the video showing a beggar tricking people into believing that he's disabled is from Delhi to be false. The video is actually from Pakistan and is at least two years old.", "lang": "en"}
