Music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang declared \u201c#TheShowMustBePaused\u201d on June 1.\n\n\u201cTuesday, June 2nd is meant to intentionally disrupt the work week,\u201d they wrote on the website named after the hashtag. \u201cMonday suggests a long weekend, and we can\u2019t wait until Friday for change.\u201d\n\nThe online movement was declared \u201cBlackout Tuesday,\u201d and social media users, including Drake, Kevin Hart and Rihanna, began posting images of black screens on their platforms. Blackout Tuesday posts quickly spread beyond the music industry to individual accounts.\n\nParticipants faced criticism early Tuesday morning, when users claimed the use of #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM hashtags diluted feeds and buried protesters\u2019 posts.\n\n\u201cIt has come to my attention that many allies are using #BlackLivesMatter hashtag w black image on insta,\u201d activist Kenidra Woods tweeted Tuesday morning. \u201cWe know that\u2019s it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message. We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!!\u201d\n\nOther users claimed posting with either hashtag defeated the point because of Instagram's algorithms.\n\n\u201cThe Instagram algorithm is merging #BlackOutTuesday posts with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag. This is obstructing vital information from being accessible to folks using the BLM Hashtag,\u201d United We Dream told its 137,000 followers. \u201cRegardless of which hashtag you use when posting, you will be unintentionally participating in the erasure of information and resources.\u201d\n\nWhen a commenter asked United We Dream how it discovered this flaw, it responded, \u201cWe tested it.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly how it works. If the (#BlackLivesMatter) hashtag was ever on the post, and later the hashtag was removed, the post still spears on the thread,\u201d an Instagram user commented. \u201cIf someone uploaded the post with the BLM hashtag they should delete and reupload the post with the right (hashtag).\"\n\nWhat do the platforms say?\n\nInstagram addressed the hashtag confusion on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"We're hearing asks from the community that posts related to Blackout Tuesday use the hashtag #blackouttuesday, and not #blacklivesmatter,\u201d Instagram tweeted. \u201cThe #blacklivesmatter hashtag aggregates important information and resources for the community.\u201d\n\nInstagram explained to USA TODAY that because the \u201cMost Recent\" section of the hashtag page shows posts reverse chronologically, a rush of new \"Blackout Tuesday\" posts can bury older #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM posts.\n\n\u201cTo confirm, we are not taking any actions that limit the reach of (protesters') posts,\u201d Instagram spokeswoman Stephanie Otway told USA TODAY.\n\nAccording to Instagram, United We Dream and the commenter are incorrect.\n\n\u201cIf you edit your post to remove a hashtag, your post will no longer be shown on that hashtag page,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, it may take up to 10 minutes for the post to be removed once you edit it. If someone uses #blacklivesmatter and #blackouttuesday in their caption, the post will appear on both hashtag pages \u2013 we are not merging the pages.\u201d\n\nMore:Trying to post a black square on Instagram using #BlackLivesMatter? It might be blocked.\n\nUnited We Dream did not return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nWe rate the claim that posting for \"Blackout Tuesday\" dilutes feeds and buries protesters' voices as PARTLY FALSE because some of it was not supported by our research. Activists and Instagram confirmed that using the #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM hashtags for Blackout Tuesday posts makes demonstrators' posts harder to find. However, Instagram is not merging #BlackOutTuesday and #BlackLivesMatter posts. When a post is edited to remove the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, it will stop appearing on the thread after 10 minutes, Instagram said.\n\u2022 For the Win \"What is Blackout Tuesday?
