The United States is a close second. They make up 16% and 15% of exports to non-EU countries respectively. This assumes exports to the UK would be the same if we weren\u2019t an EU member.\n\nMr Moynihan was actually a little generous with the number of countries he named as not having a surplus with us. Over the last ten years, on average only Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta didn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019re only analysing the statistics here. While it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re an important trading partner with the EU, it\u2019s a more complicated matter to assess what kind of trading relationship the UK would have with the EU if it leaves.\n\nThe UK is the EU\u2019s single largest export market in trade in goods\n\nIf the UK wasn\u2019t a member of the EU it would be the group\u2019s largest single goods export market, at least if we assumed that not being a member wouldn\u2019t have an effect on trade. The United States would be a close second.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the UK accounts for the majority of exports that the EU sends out. It makes up about 16% of goods that the EU exports to the rest of the world (plus the UK).\n\nCountries within the EU export a lot to other countries within the EU. If you\u2019re also counting exports to countries within the EU, Germany receives the largest value of exports.\n\nVote Leave told us Mr Moynihan was talking about trade in goods. All our data here comes from the European Commission. There are a variety of figures available for trade in services, which is why Vote Leave said this was excluded.\n\nWe\u2019re getting in touch with Eurostat to work out which figures are the best ones to use.\n\nSurpluses with Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta over the last ten years\n\nUp until now we\u2019ve been covering goods exports. John Moynihan\u2019s claim brings trade in services into the picture as well.\n\nMr Moynihan said that every country in Europe apart from Ireland, Cyprus, Greece, Malta and Luxembourg has a trade surplus with us. That means most of our neighbours sell more to us in goods and services than they buy from us.\n\nVote Leave told us the source of the claim was analysis by Business for Britain, which had looked at the average goods and services trade flows with each EU member country from 2004 to 2013.\n\nEvery country but three\u2014Ireland, Luxembourg, and Malta\u2014had a surplus with us by that measure, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change if you look at the decade to 2014.\n\nThe last two sentences were updated to clarify that we were referring to a 10 year period in our analysis of the more recent data, and that both sentences were based on data from the ONS.", "lang": "en"}
