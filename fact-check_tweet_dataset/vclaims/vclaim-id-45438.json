It is also being claimed that the old man in the video is talking about demolishing India, and they are praying for establishing a Muslim Kingdom in India. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: Video of Muslims taking oath in front of Rahul Gandhi against Hindus and Hinduism. Fact: The video was taken during Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit to Kichaucha Sharif Dargah (UP) in 2016. The man speaking in the video does not talk about Hindus or Hinduism; he prays to God for peace in the nation. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a similar video was found in the search results. The video was uploaded by \u2018Samay Live\u2019 in September 2016 with the title \u2013 \u2018Rahul Gandhi visit to Kichaucha Sharif Dargah in Ambedkar Nagar\u2019. The news articles regarding Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit to the dargah can be read here, here, and here. None of them reported about an oath taken against Hindus or Hinduism at the dargah. If any such comments were made in the presence of Rahul Gandhi, they would have been widely reported by news agencies, but no such report was found.\n\nAn extended version of the video can be seen here. On listening to the man speaking in the video, the following can be heard \u2013 \u2018Yeh toh apna apna naseeb hai sallu alaihi. Isike liye yeh bhi aaye hain. Na daulatein chahiye. Inke haath mein quwwat chahiye\u2026\u2026veer ro rahe hain, Raat aur din ek kiye huye hain, Na sone ka waqt hai na jaagne ka na chalne ka, Bas ek hi khawhish hai inkee, ke hindustaan se sitamparasti khatam hojaaye, bhai chargee khatam hojaaye. Jis amn ka paighaam aap chinnaan ki dhartee par le ke aaye the hindustan ke andar. Yeh chahte hain ki wohee amn phir hindustan ke andar aajaaye. taaqat deejiye, himmat deejiye, Quwwat deejiye. Ke firkha parasth taakatein khatam karke Gandhi paida ho\u2026\u2019 (which roughly translates to \u2013 \u2018it is our destiny. This is the purpose he has also come. He does not want riches for himself. Strengthen his hands. Courageous people of \u2026\u2026 land is crying. They have not left a stone unturned in their efforts day and night, we are not able to sleep in the night nor walk in the days. He has only one desire that divisive forces of India must be defeated. They want to finish our brotherhood. He has bought the same message of peace to the land of chinnaan as you. He wants to bring the same peace to this land and in Hindustan. Strengthen him and give him courage to defeat divisive forces and give birth to another Gandhi\u2019). In the video, the man does not talk about Hindus or Hinduism. Also, nothing was mentioned regarding establishing a Muslim kingdom in India. He prays to God for peace in the nation.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Rahul Gandhi visiting a dargah in UP is being with a false narrative that an oath was taken by Muslims in front of him against Hindus and Hinduism.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
