That story connected McConnell \u2014 the Republican senator from Kentucky who has been the majority leader since 2015 \u2014 to billionaire Len Blavatnik, a dual citizen of the U.S. and U.K., who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican and Democratic candidates and super PACs.\n\nBlavatnik began making political contributions in 1996, when he gave $1,000 each to a Republican and a Democratic candidate, and $250 to the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to campaign finance data filed with the Federal Election Commission. His donations increased over the next decade, but stayed relatively balanced between Republican and Democratic candidates and committees. He gave more than $60,000 to Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee in both 2008 and 2012. He also gave over $130,000 to the Republican National Committee in 2016.\n\nBlavatnik\u2019s company, Access Industries, gave $5.25 million to various conservative super PACs in the 2016 election cycle \u2014 including $1.5 million to the McConnell-affiliated Senate Leadership Fund.\n\nThe Democratic Coalition story doesn\u2019t mention Blavatnik\u2019s contributions to Democratic causes, but it does tie him to Oleg Deripaska \u2014 a Russian businessman who had been sanctioned by the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department in January lifted sanctions on three companies connected to Deripaska. U.S. sanctions were lifted after the companies \u201creduced Oleg Deripaska\u2019s direct and indirect shareholding stake in these companies and severed his control,\u201d the Treasury Department said.\n\nDeripaska was described as a \u201cRussian oligarch\u201d in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Deripaska allegedly received updates on then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through Paul Manafort, who was a top campaign aide for nearly five months in 2016, according to the report.\n\nBlavatnik co-owns a company that has a 26.5 percent stake in Deripaska\u2019s aluminum company, Rusal, according to reporting from Bloomberg. In April, Rusal announced plans to open a new aluminum plant in McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky.\n\nSo, it\u2019s true that a major contributor to a PAC associated with McConnell has business ties to an oligarch whose businesses recently have been released from sanctions. But it\u2019s a stretch to claim that \u201cthe biggest donor for Mitch McConnell (R: Moscow) is none other than the Russian oligarch that the GOP just lifted sanctions on.\u201d\n\nThe biggest donor to political committees associated with McConnell appears to be conservative mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who, along with his wife, gave $85 million to the Senate Leadership Fund in 2016 and 2018, according to FEC records. The couple also gave McConnell\u2019s candidate committee the maximum amount ahead of his last election in 2014, when those contributions were capped at $2,600. Super PACs, such as the Senate Leadership Fund, have no such contribution limits.\n\nAnother super PAC affiliated with McConnell, Kentuckians For Strong Leadership, has raised a total of $11.2 million since it was formed in 2013 and has not received donations from either Blavatnik or Adelson.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
