Lee And Martin Luther King Jr. On The Same Day?)\n\nHad the vice president done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. No other photos of Pence waving the Confederate flag at this event have surfaced on social media, and the White House has not put out a statement.\n\nThe image has been photoshopped. Taken in 2016, the original photo shows Pence using a selfie stick to take a picture with Republican members of Congress not long after he and President Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe verified House Republicans Twitter account tweeted out the picture on Nov. 17, 2016, with the caption \u201cUNIFIED.\u201d\n\nThe original picture was criticized by some for its lack of diversity, with the website Mashable labeling it the \u201cwhitest selfie ever.\u201d That criticism might have inspired the creation of the altered image.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
