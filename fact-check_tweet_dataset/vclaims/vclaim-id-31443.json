The claim about the image is that the man in the photo frame is a Pulwama martyr. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the photo is subjected to reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. The search result of \u2018Telugu Adda\u2019 had the image in its video and had the title \u2018Amrutha, Pranay son Nihaan Pranay 1st birthday celebrations\u2019. Many other search results that had a similar title and had the same photo in videos. They can be seen here and here.\n\nWhen searched with the text \u2018Amrutha Pranay\u2019, an article of \u2018The Hindu\u2019 was found. According to the article, on 14 September 2018, Pranay Kumar, a \u2018Dalit\u2019 was murdered by people hired by his father-in-law Maruthi Rao (a \u2018Vysya\u2019) for marrying his daughter Amrutha against his wishes. So, the man in the photo frame is \u2018Pranay Kumar\u2019 and he is a victim of honour killing.\n\nAlso, in the photographs of the CRPF jawans who have martyred in the Pulwama attack, the image of the man seen in the posted photo is not found.\n\nTo conclude, the man in the photo frame seen in the image isn\u2019t a Pulwama martyr. He is a victim of \u2018honour-killing\u2019 in Telangana. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
