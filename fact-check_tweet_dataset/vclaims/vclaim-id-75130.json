The US lawmaker said the footage showed people in Honduras receiving money that came from US billionaire George Soros. But the scene took place in Guatemala and Soros, a known Democrat, has rejected the accusation.\n\n\u201cCan you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\u201d Trump tweeted on October 18, a missive retweeted nearly 27,000 times. The Republican president\u2019s message is accompanied by a video showing two people handing out money to people in a line.\n\nOne day before Trump\u2019s tweet, Gaetz had tweeted the clip with the message: \u201cBREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!\u201d\n\nThe tweet went viral prior to November 6, when American voters went to the polls to determine make-up of the next US Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s commentary on the video was quickly picked up and portrayed as the truth by Spanish language media. On Facebook, for example, it was shared more than 3,500 times in Spanish, and hundreds of times in English.\n\nThe day Trump\u2019s tweet went viral, Open Society, the foundation Soros created, dismissed on Twitter the notion that it had any relationship with the migrant caravan.\n\n\u201cWe can save you the trouble, Congressman: Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society are funding this effort,\u201d the foundation tweeted. \u201cWe do support the historic U.S. commitment to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands. Maybe you could investigate why they feel the need to flee.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first case linking Soros to supporting migrants. In November Snopes disproved that the billionaire was funding the distribution of prepaid debit cards to refugees via the United Nations.\n\nThe video was not shot in Honduras\n\nSeveral comments on the Facebook post make it clear that the video was filmed in Guatemala, with one user specifying it was in Chiquimula.\n\nAt one point in the video the name of a store -- \u201cAuto polarizado y accesorios para carros\u201d -- is visible. A Facebook search with both terms turns up the following image confirming the video was recorded in the Guatemalan town.\n\nThe post also specifies it is located in the Las Rosas district, located in the municipality\u2019s zone five, which is crossed by a single road visible on Google Street View.\n\nAn AFP check found the exact place where the video was recorded, although the palm tree was smaller and the auto shop was still for rent.\n\nIn a search with a keyframe from the video, obtained by using the InVID tool, AFP found a Twitter thread that included reference to the video. It was posted on October 18 by Guatemalan journalist Luis Assardo.\n\n\u201cI managed to talk to locals and they told me that merchants in the area collected money and gave it to people from #CaravanaDeMigrantes,\u201d his Spanish-language tweet reads.\n\nIn a later interview with AJ+ in Spanish, Assardo said concerning money that \u201cpeople usually do not want to talk about it,\u201d due to drug trafficking issues in the region.\n\nIn the video, one of the people distributing cash has a gun tucked in the waistband of his pants. A few days later, Gaetz told The New York Times that he suspected the men handing out money were cartel members.\n\nQueried by AFP, the police chief of Guatemala\u2019s eastern region, which includes Chiquimula, said he knew of the video and had followed up on it, but said he was unable to determine who was distributing the funds.\n\nAFP journalists in Guatemala found that a local group of farmers who are linked to drug trafficking activities often distribute food, clothing and medicine.\n\nThough the origin of the money given out in the video remains unknown, the claim that it came from George Soros and his organization is unfounded -- and the video was clearly shot in Guatemala, not Honduras.", "lang": "en"}
