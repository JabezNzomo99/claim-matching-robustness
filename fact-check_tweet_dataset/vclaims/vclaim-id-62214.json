In the video, a machine is cutting out cashew-shaped objects from a white sheet. When Vishvas News investigated, we found that the machine isn\u2019t manufacturing fake cashews. It is actually manufacturing cashew-shaped snacks.\n\nThe video shared on Facebook by a video platform named Viral Watch shows a machine is cutting out cashew-shaped objects from a white sheet. It has been claimed that fake cashews are being made.

The video showed the machine from different angles and also the end product of the cashew snack.\n\nWe contacted Tushar Pandya who owns Chotiwala Foods and Machines and manufactures snacks making machines.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is the fake claim that says the machine is manufacturing fake cashews. It is a snack made of flour. The machine shows the cutting of a flour sheet in the shape of cashews. It is sold as a snack and is roasted before eating.\u201d\n\nWe scanned the profile of the Facebook user who shared the viral post.
