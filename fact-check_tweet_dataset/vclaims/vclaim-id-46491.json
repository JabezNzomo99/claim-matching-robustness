He didn\u2019t push for significant gun control laws during his presidency, but he did support two major pieces of legislation after leaving office: the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.\n\nThe Brady Bill, which instituted background checks for firearms purchases, was named after Reagan\u2019s press secretary James Brady, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt against Reagan. In 1994, he joined former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in endorsing the 10-year ban on assault weapons.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Reagan, who was a member of the National Rifle Association, ever said this quote against gun control.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Library keeps a collection of selected speeches from Reagan, going as far back as his tenure as governor of California, yet there is no record of him saying the quote in the library\u2019s digital archive.\n\n\u201cI never heard or read this from Reagan, and it certainly does not sound like him,\u201d Dr. H.W. Brands, professor at the University of Texas at Austin and Reagan biographer, said in an email to The Daily Caller. \u201cHe was not one to advocate armed resistance to America\u2019s own government.\u201d\n\nA quick Google search reveals the quote actually came from an 1850 speech written by Marx and Engels, who famously co-authored \u201cThe Communist Manifesto.\u201d They included the quote in a speech delivered to the Communist League.\n\n\u201cUnder no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered,\u201d reads the original quote. \u201cAny attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
