The report says the counterintelligence investigation, known internally as Crossfire Hurricane, was opened after receipt of information from a \u201cFriendly Foreign Government\u201d (Australia). A diplomat for that country was told by Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that \u201cthe Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clinton (and President Obama).\u201d\n\nBut, as noted, the report did document how key facts about the dossier were not disclosed. \u201cWe identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed,\u201d the report said, adding that the omissions \u201cmade it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report, actually \u2014 and especially when you look into it, and the details of the report \u2014 are far worse than anything I would have even imagined. \u2026 This was an overthrow of government. This was an attempted overthrow. And a lot of people who were in on it, and they got caught. They got caught red-handed.\u201d\n\nTrump sticks with his conspiracy theories. There is nothing in the report that supports \u201can overthrow of government.\u201d In fact, as we noted, the IG found that political bias did not factor into the start of the probe. He even turned up text messages of FBI agents hoping Trump would beat Hillary Clinton. In many ways, the IG report would have been disappointing to Trump, yet he gamely suggests it\u2019s even worse than he expected.\n\n\u201cAll of the witnesses we interviewed told the OIG that the FBI did not try to recruit members of the Trump campaign as [Confidential Human Sources], did not send CHSs to collect information in Trump campaign headquarters or Trump campaign spaces, and did not ask CHSs to join the Trump campaign or otherwise attend campaign related events as part of the investigation,\u201d the report said. The report quotes one official, Bill Priestap, assistant director of the FBI counterintelligence division, as saying the investigation \u201cwas about a foreign adversary trying to mess with our free and fair election system. We wanted to know if any U.S. persons assisted in any way. In no way was it an investigation into \u2026 the political process. \u2026 [I]t\u2019s not the FBI\u2019s role in any way to try to monitor or \u2026 investigate campaigns.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the IG report makes clear that initial FISA application was set in motion once the FBI first obtained Steele\u2019s reports. Previously, the request had been set aside, but Steele\u2019s information renewed interest in surveillance and played \u201ca central and essential role\u201d in the decision to go forward. \u201cThe FISA request form drew almost entirely from Steele\u2019s reporting in describing the factual basis to establish probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power,\u201d the report said, while not including information obtained from other sources that undercut Steele\u2019s reporting.", "lang": "en"}
