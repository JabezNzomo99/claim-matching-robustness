The text reads, \u201cNOT an overreaction\u201d, and compares the population figures of New Zealand (4.8 billion) and Ireland (4.9 million). It also says, \u201cFirst reported cases: NZ 28th March, Ireland 29th March\u201d, followed by \u201cAs at 18th April 2020, NZ: 1094 confirmed cases, 11 deaths\u201d and \u201cIreland: 14,758 confirmed cases, 571 deaths\u201d. It ends with the words \u201cNOT a political game Do it right New Zealand!\u201d\n\nThe post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and generated more than 220 shares.\n\nAs the world reels from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Ireland and New Zealand have implemented lockdown measures to mitigate the virus and its effects.\n\nAs of April 28, Ireland had recorded 19,877 COVID-19 cases with 1,159 deaths, according to its Department of Health. New Zealand\u2019s official figures show 1,472 confirmed and probable cases with 19 deaths as of the same date.\n\nThe Facebook post provides a number of statistics, starting with population figures which are roughly accurate. The estimated population of New Zealand is 4.95 million as of December 2019, according to Statistics New Zealand, compared to the post\u2019s figure of \u201c4.8 million\u201d. Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office lists the Emerald Isle\u2019s 2019 population as 4.92 million, matching the post\u2019s \u201c4.9 million\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that New Zealand\u2019s first COVID-19 case was reported on March 28 is incorrect. AAP FactCheck found that according to New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health, the first reported case was on February 28, \u201ca person in their 60s recently returned from Iran\u201d. Ireland\u2019s first case, which the post dates as March 29, was detected on February 29. The date of February 28 for NZ is also supported by a World Health Organization (WHO) report, while the UN public health body lists March 1 for Ireland\u2019s first COVID-19 case.\n\nAccording to Ireland\u2019s Department of Health, as of April 18 the COVID-19 death toll in Ireland was 571, with 14,758 confirmed cases while 11 deaths and 1094 cases were recorded in NZ on the same date, WHO data showed. These figures match those provided in the post.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck found the Facebook post to be partly false. While many of the figures in the post are correct, the dates provided for New Zealand and Ireland\u2019s \u201cfirst reported cases\u201d of COVID-19 are incorrect. Ireland\u2019s first case was on February 29, according to the country\u2019s Department of Health, not March 29 as claimed in the post. New Zealand\u2019s first case was on February 28, according to NZ\u2019s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, not March 28 as stated. Partly False \u2013 The claim of the content is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
