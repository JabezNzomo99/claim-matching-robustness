Several security personnel can be seen in the picture, but the couple seems to ignore the chaos around.\n\nThe claims along with the photo say it was clicked recently during protests over Floyd\u2019s death. Twitter user \u201cNationalist KR\u201d posted the picture with a sarcastic caption in Hindi which translates to, \u201cThis is how protests take place in America #ALLLIVESMATTER\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The photo was clicked in Vancouver, Canada, in 2011 during riots that broke out between supporters of two hockey clubs.\n\nThe picture is also being circulated on Facebook with the caption, \u201cPhotos showing two lovers, kissing during a protest in Minneapolis, Minnesota United States #This Is All of Us #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd\u201d. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found many articles on the Internet on the viral picture. As per \u201cNew York Post\u201d, the iconic photo was taken in June 2011 when riots erupted in Canada\u2019s Vancouver after the local ice hockey team Canucks lost to Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup final.\n\nAccording to \u201cCBC News\u201d, the couple was identified as Canadian Alex Thomas and her Australian boyfriend Scott Jones.\n\nIn an interview to \u201cThe Guardian\u201d, Scott had said he kissed Alex to calm her down as she was knocked over by a mob and was getting hysterical.\n\nThe picture, clicked by photographer Rich Lam, had then become the talk of the town.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that the viral post is misleading as the picture is nine years old and from Canada. It has nothing to do with protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, United States.", "lang": "en"}
