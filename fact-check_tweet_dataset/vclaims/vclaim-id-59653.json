The claim further suggests that 20 years hence, next generations will not be able to read the Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads in the original form. A post by Facebook page Vastavik Bharat has received more than 2,800 shares.\n\nThe picture is viral on Facebook with people talking about Hindu scripture being changed.\n\nA reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report in The Hindu which described the image as, \u201cStudents at Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami studying the Vedas to understand the common attributes in Islam and Hinduism. This seminary has more than 1000 books on other religions at Hyderabad.\u201d The photograph is credited to G Ramakrishnan.\n\nWe contacted Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami institute for more information on the photo. Deputy Director Mufti Omar Abedeen told us that this picture was shot in their library and is several years old. \u201cWe have a department called \u2018Mutalaya Mizahid\u2019 which means \u2018Studies of Faiths\u2019 where students are taught not only about Hinduism but also about other religions like Christianity and Sikhism. We have been doing this work for almost 20 years. We also invite scholars of other religions to teach so that the students get the best understanding of every religion.\u201d\n\nTherefore, a 6-year-old image of Muslim students studying Hinduism was shared with the false claim that they are tampering with Hindu scriptures.", "lang": "en"}
