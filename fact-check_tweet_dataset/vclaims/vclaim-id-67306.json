Rible appeared with Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) and Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and Bob Singer (R-Ocean) to discuss Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s attempt to unseat Sen. Tm Kean Jr. (R-Union) as minority leader, as well as other political topics.\n\n\"This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes,\" Rible told Aron in response to the host\u2019s question about the likelihood of Christie\u2019s success in having the Legislature approve a tax cut. Christie first floated the idea two years ago, but Democrats, who control the Legislature, have nixed the idea because they said the state can\u2019t afford it.\n\nRible\u2019s claim is neither new nor original. Christie himself has said it on multiple occasions. And like Christie, Rible\u2019s left out a few important details that we\u2019ll explain again.\n\nIt is true that Christie has produced continual balanced budgets since taking office in January 2010. But that\u2019s nothing special. State law requires every governor to do it, so it\u2019s hardly a singular, significant achievement.\n\nAnd the claim about not raising taxes is questionable.\n\nWhile the rates for corporation, income and sales taxes \u2013 the three biggest sources of revenue in New Jersey -- have not increased under Christie, his slashing of funding for tax credit programs has had the same effect as tax increases, experts have said.\n\nThe state\u2019s Treasury Department has disagreed with that assessment, particularly in the case of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which Christie cut during his first year in office.\n\nNew Jersey at one time sent checks to homeowners and certain low-income individuals with the goal for that money to be used toward tax bills. The checks \u2013 what Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said amounted to subsidies for very low-income people -- eventually became credits on their bills instead, and at lower amounts.\n\nChristie also cut two tax credit programs, the Homestead Benefit Program among them, giving recipients less than what they received previously. In some cases, some taxpayers are receiving less than half of what was once an average $1,000 rebate.\n\nState Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases.\n\nOf the 2010 EITC cut, Quinn has noted that more than 76 percent of EITC recipients that year owed no New Jersey tax.\n\nBut experts with The George Washington University, the University of Connecticut and the University of California Davis School of Law, have said funding cuts in tax credit programs are essentially tax increases because those recipients end up with less money to put toward their tax bills.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, has said it\u2019d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts.\n\n\"They have elements of both and are strictly neither,\" Joseph Henchman, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of legal and state projects, has told us.\n\nRible could not be reached for comment.\n\nRible said during a panel discussion, \"This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes.\"\n\nThere\u2019s varying degrees of accuracy here. The governor has given New Jersey balanced budgets, but the law requires it. And while Christie hasn\u2019t hiked the rates for the three biggest revenue-generating taxes in the state, he has cut some programs that experts say are essentially the same as tax increases because people have less money as a result to offset tax bills.\n\nFor these reasons, we rate Rible\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
