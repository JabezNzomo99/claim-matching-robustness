Waters disparaged the nominee for Secretary of Education without evidence.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-01-23T08:00:57Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85215", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/23/waterss-ridiculous-claim-that-betsy-devos-has-never-seen-the-inside-of-a-classroom/", "vclaim": "Some of the speakers at the Women\u2019s March on Washington repeated some dubious nostrums we have debunked in the past, such as statistics on equal pay. But this comment jumped out at us.\n\nWaters, reading from a prepared text, made these comments in the course of attacking a number of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. For instance, she charged that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the nominee for attorney general, has a \u201chistory of racism\u201d \u2014 a claim that he disputes and that we have explored.\n\nBut this attack seemed new: Betsy DeVos, the nominee for secretary of education, has never seen the inside of a classroom?\n\nWe repeatedly sought comment and explanation from Waters\u2019s staff, but they did not respond. On the face of it, it seems ridiculous. DeVos obviously once was a student \u2014 and she has four children and five grandchildren. Surely she has seen the inside of a classroom.\n\nDeVos has been attacked for not having much of a connection to public schools. She did not attend public schools, and neither did her children. They attended privately funded Christian schools, and DeVos has advocated expanding charter schools.\n\nBut DeVos has also been involved in the Grand Rapids Public School system in Michigan. \u201cI\u2019ve worked as an in-school mentor for students in the Grand Rapids Public Schools, and have had the privilege of interacting with students and their families and teachers in ways that have changed my life and my perspective about education forever,\u201d she said in her opening statement at the Senate hearing on her nomination.\n\nIndeed, Teresa Weatherall Neal, superintendent of the Grand Rapids Public School district, has praised the selection of DeVos. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for the children across the nation,\u201d Neal told MLive.com. \u201cShe has been a wonderful supporter of GRPS and our transition plan. She knows education. She knows what it is going to take in order for our kids to be helped.\u201d\n\nDeVos sparked questions about her knowledge of education issues during the contentious hearing on her nomination. But Waters goes too far when she asserts, without evidence, that DeVos has never seen the inside of a classroom. Maybe Waters believes that private schools don\u2019t count, but it\u2019s clear that DeVos has seen the inside of public-school classrooms, as well. If she was trying to say DeVos had never been an educator, she still went too far. This kind of over-the-top rhetoric earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
