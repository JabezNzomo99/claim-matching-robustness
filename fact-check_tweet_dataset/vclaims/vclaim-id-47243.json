The video is being shared in the context of the recent border clash between India and China in the Galwan valley (Ladakh). FACTLY has found that the posted video shows a firepower display by the Indian army during a military exercise (\u2018Exercise TOPCHI\u2019) at School of Artillery (Deolali) in January 2020. The same video was found to be uploaded by a YouTube user in January 2020 with the description \u2013 \u2018Upgraded Indian Army 122 mm \u2018Grad\u2019 Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher (MBRL) mounted on an Ashok Leyland Truck Firing during #ExTopchi at School of Artillery\u2019. So, when searched with the keywords, it was found that \u2018Additional Directorate General of Public Information \u2013 Indian Army\u2019 and \u2018Republic TV\u2019 have also posted regarding the \u2018Exercise TOPCHI\u2019 with similar visuals. So, the video does not represent an attack on any country.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
