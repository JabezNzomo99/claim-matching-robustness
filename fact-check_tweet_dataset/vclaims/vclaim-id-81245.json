But he did.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2014-04-04T02:19:30Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81245", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/03/targeting-of-tea-party-groups-by-the-irs-or-inappropriate-criteria/", "vclaim": "This effort at spin control took an odd turn recently when, during a congressional hearing, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen denied that the Treasury inspector general had used the term \u201ctargeting.\u201d At another point in the hearing, Koskinen said that he had \u201cnever\u201d used the phrase either.\n\nYou can see the IG is engaged in a delicate balancing act here. On the one hand, he uses the terms preferred by members of Congress to describe the investigation. But then he reverts to bland bureaucratic phrasing in his conclusions. He uses this same formula in his written testimony.\n\n\u201cThe three allegations considered during our review were proven true. The IRS targeted specific groups applying for tax-exempt status. It delayed the processing of these groups\u2019 applications, and requested unnecessary information, as well as subjected these groups to special scrutiny.\u201d \u201cThe inappropriate criteria discussed in this audit were the IRS\u2019s targeting for review Tea Party and other organizations based on their names or policy positions, a practice started in 2012, and which was not fully corrected until May 2012. Actually the practice was started in 2010 and not fully corrected until May of 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as the president responded and everyone responded to the extent that the facts show that conservative groups or liberal groups or any groups were targeted because of their political positions when they made applications,\u201d he said in response to a question from Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cThat really is intolerable.\u201d\n\nWas the phrase so toxic that it was wiped from his lexicon once he arrived at the IRS? Perhaps. But an instant report issued by his predecessor, Daniel Werfel, on June 24, 2013, also used the phrase \u201ctargeting\u201d. (See Page 9.)\n\nWe spent several days trying to get an explanation from the IRS and were asked to wait for an answer on Wednesday. As it turned out, Koskinen appeared before the National Press Club that day and took the opportunity to apparently set the record straight by acknowledging that George orally used the phrase \u201ctargeting:\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that everybody who has looked at this has said selecting organizations by their name only for special or separate or detailed processing was a mistake, should not have happened, should never happen again in the future. The IRS IG \u2014 the TIGTA \u2014 in his report, his findings were that inappropriate criteria were used in the selection process, by which he meant the identification by name only. People then have extrapolated from that, and on occasion the inspector general in public has referred to that as targeting. His findings simply said: \u201cinappropriate criteria were used.\u201d Whatever you call it, it\u2019s clear that it was a serious mistake.\n\nWe understand the public relations concern about acknowledging that the IRS engaged in targeting of conservative groups. But the cat\u2019s out of the bag, given an official IRS report has used the phrase and both George and Koskinen have used it in public testimony.\n\nThe IG\u2019s report was carefully written, but at this point, it is silly and counterproductive for Koskinen to fall back on bureaucratese \u2014 or even deny that the phrase \u201ctargeting\u201d had been used. While perhaps technically correct in terms of the report, this is a slender reed to hide behind. After all, George publicly said that all three allegations of \u201ctargeting\u201d were proven, and that using \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d was the equivalent of \u201ctargeting.\u201d That demonstrates that the term \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d is simply a euphemism. Accept that means \u201ctargeting,\u201d and move on.", "lang": "en"}
