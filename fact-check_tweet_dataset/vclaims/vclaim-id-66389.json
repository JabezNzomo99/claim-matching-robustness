President Donald Trump has promised to withhold federal funds from these cities, claiming they attract criminals and make communities less safe.\n\nThe story also claimed \"it won\u2019t be long until Trump\u2019s DHS gets a warrant for pioneers\" of communities and states with \"haven city strategies.\"\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about a comment made by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official on Fox News. The official, Thomas D. Homan, said on TV that he asked the Justice Department to look into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies, Harris said. The comment was made specifically about California elected officials after the enactment of the California Values Act, according to Harris.\n\nHarris: \"My question is whether DHS is currently working with the Justice Department to bring section 8-USC 1324 charges or any criminal charges against state or local officials.\"\n\nNielsen: \"I believe the request was made. The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. The context of this is, of course, not only putting my ICE officers at risk but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our immigration laws.\"\n\nHarris: \"So, you are aware of cases in which this code will be used to criminally charge elected officials?\"\n\nNielsen: \"I am not aware of any cases, no ma'am. I believe it was just a request to look into it.\"\n\nAt the hearing, Nielsen acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security had asked the Justice Department to look into the issue, but did not confirm, as Newsflash claimed, that they are already preparing to make arrests. The website also presented a revised version of what Nielsen said, quoting her as saying \"The Department of Justice is looking into what roads might be accessible.\" (She said: \"The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available.\")\n\nDHS referred PolitiFact to the January hearing but did not say what avenues, if any, the Justice Department had determined to take \u2014 or if it had responded to DHS\u2019 request. The Justice Department did not respond to our query.\n\nNewsflash cited the The Washington Times as the source that \"revealed\" the information. A January story on The Washington Times headlined, \"Homeland Security pursues charges against leaders of sanctuary cities.\" The story offers a more toned-down version, saying DHS \"has asked federal prosecutors to see if they can lodge criminal charges against sanctuary cities.\"\n\nNewsflash claimed, \"Trump\u2019s DHS secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders.\"\n\nWhile DHS has asked the Justice Department to look into what charges could be pursued against elected officials from sanctuary cities, DHS\u2019s top official did not go far enough to say arrests were coming. What the DHS secretary said in January was she was not aware of any criminal cases against leaders of cities with policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.", "lang": "en"}
