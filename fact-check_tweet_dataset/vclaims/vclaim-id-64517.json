It is meant to help the face mask conform to the bridge of the wearer\u2019s nose.\n\nThe video shows a medical face mask that has been torn at the top with a thin metal strip sticking out. A person off-camera narrates the short video, claiming the metal strip in the mask is killing people.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed. The antenna killer \u2013 5G antenna killer \u2013 that\u2019s inside the masks that they are telling everybody to wear,\u201d the narrator said. \u201cNow for everybody that don\u2019t speak Hebrew, this video came out in Hebrew saying they wanted to show you the number one killer inside the masks. So, we took this here out, which is a 5G antenna that\u2019s inside the mask.\u201d\n\nBut the metal strip is not a 5G antenna. Rather, it is a bendable strip of metal meant to help the mask fit better around the wearer\u2019s face, according to mask guidelines from the Illinois Department of Public Health.
