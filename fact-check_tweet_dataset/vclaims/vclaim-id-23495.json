It has since been followed by 31 users. Its post about Soho, which gained 501 reactions and 150 comments, was sponsored.\n\nThe facts: GMA Network has disputed the claim and said that Soho remains with them. She hosts GMA-7 news magazine show, Kapuso Mo Jessica Soho, and two programs on GMA News TV: State of the Nation with Jessica Soho and Brigada.\n\nThe preview link that contained the claim was manipulated. The article from the blog veggiesforthevegan.com was originally titled, \"Only French Fry Lovers.\"\n\nThe article does not contain any details about the reporter's supposed dismissal from the network. Soho was only mentioned in the first part of the blog for her TV shows and her supposed \"love [for] French fries.\"\n\nIn 2017, Facebook removed the edit link preview function as part of its \"effort to stop the spread of misinformation and false news.\" \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
