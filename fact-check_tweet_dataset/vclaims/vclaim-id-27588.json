No, that's not true: an old April Fool's joke posted to Medium in 2017 seems to have gone viral again on Facebook even though the original article was long ago deleted.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by @SciFiNews on Medium on April 1, 2017 under the title \"MacGyver Star Dead at Age 67\".
