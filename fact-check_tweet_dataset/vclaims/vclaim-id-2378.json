The average saving ratio in January to March 2017 was estimated at 1.7%\u2014the lowest ratio since records began in 1963.\n\nSavings here refers to how much of your income you put aside in savings, plus whatever you don\u2019t happen to spend from the rest of your income. So it\u2019s about how much money you end up with at the end of the month once you\u2019ve paid your bills, gone to the cinema etc. as a proportion of how much money you had coming in to start with.\n\nA fall in this number means that, on average, households aren\u2019t saving as much as they used to, and are spending more of the money they get.\n\nThe ONS points to increased consumption, increasing prices and lower wage growth to answer this. It adds that while the saving ratio is often volatile, \u201cthe underlying trend is downwards\u201d.\n\nFor any given household, low savings doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the household is in in a bad way economically. For example, a household might not be too concerned about saving if it had some certainty about its future income.\n\nHow useful are these figures?\n\nThere are limits to what these figures can tell us.\n\nFor one, the saving ratio is an average\u2014many households will be saving more than 1.7% of their income and many will be saving less or even spending more than they earn, racking up debt.\n\nThe figures also include savings from non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH), such as charities and universities, which you wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume given what it\u2019s called. The figures are likely to differ if you take these out of the picture.\n\nIn future, the ONS intends to report household and NPISH data separately, and introduce a number of other methodological changes.", "lang": "en"}
