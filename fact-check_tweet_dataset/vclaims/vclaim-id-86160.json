Twelve got Three Pinocchios, and seven got Two Pinocchios. We threw in two fact checks that got One Pinocchio and five with no ratings.\n\nThere are phony ads linking Democrats to terrorism with no evidence, an ad falsely accusing Republican leaders of plotting to end Medicare and Social Security, and an ad in New Jersey that links a sitting senator to underage prostitutes with no evidence. Some Republican candidates are even lying to voters about how many Pinocchios we gave to their opponents. (Is nothing sacred anymore?)", "lang": "en"}
