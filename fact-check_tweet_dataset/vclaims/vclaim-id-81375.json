Despite the posts\u2019 claim that the comments were made to a journalist on June 6, there is no trace of Ramaphosa making such remarks to a media outlet that day.\n\nThe president\u2019s spokeswoman told AFP that Ramaphosa never made these comments and had no public engagements on June 6 when he would have spoken to the media.\n\nThe murder of farmers, many of them white, is a highly contentious issue in South Africa.\n\nIn one Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, Ramaphosa is quoted as saying the following in response to a question about farm murders being a priority for him:\n\nThe misleading post says Ramaphosa also mentioned the \u201ctime when Donald Trump sent people to South Africa to investigate farm attacks\u201d. However, that refers to a tweet on land \u2018invasions\u2019 by Trump that received backlash by the South African government -- read this AFP report.\n\nAsked if Ramaphosa had made the remarks, his spokeswoman Khusela Diko told AFP that \u201cthe president has never said such\u201d.\n\nDiko also confirmed that Ramaphosa had no public engagements on June 6, 2019 where he could have addressed the media, as the misleading claim purports.\n\nThe post also claims that South Africa\u2019s Deputy President David Mabuza said: \u201cThey should ask the Rhodesian [sic] what it\u2019s actually like when the black government does not care about you\u201d.\n\nRhodesia was the pre-independence name of Zimbabwe.\n\nOn August 23, 2018, the same day as the Trump tweet, Mabuza spoke at the Land Summit in Bela Bela, Limpopo and discouraged the spread of \u2018falsehoods\u2019 that divide South Africans.\n\n\u201cWe would like to discourage those who are using this sensitive and emotive issue of land to divide us as South Africans by distorting our land reform measures to the international community, and spreading falsehoods that our \u2018white farmers\u2019 are facing the onslaught from their own government. This is far from the truth,\u201d said Mabuza.\n\nBut a basic internet search of the misleading Mabuza quote yielded no credible results -- just a few web pages that repeated the text of the misleading Facebook post.\n\nWhat has Ramaphosa actually said about farm murders?\n\nCritics called Ramaphosa out in September last year for saying \u201cthere are no killings of farmers or white farmers in South Africa. There\u2019s no land grab in South Africa\u201d, in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nAt the time, Diko was quoted in this news article saying Ramaphosa meant there were no \u201clarge scale killings of farmers\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that anyone would want to deliberately distort the President\u2019s remarks which were in direct response to \u2018large scale killing of farmers\u2019\u201a a characterisation everyone knows holds no truth in South Africa,\u201d said Diko.\n\nThe scale of the problem of farm attacks is highly contentious in South Africa.\n\nAfriForum, an Afrikaner rights group, announced its latest farm attack statistics during a media conference on June 4. It gave the figure as 184 attacks and 20 murders for the first five months of the year in the whole of South Africa.\n\nIn this fact-check, we debunked claims that these figures referred to attacks in the Western Cape province alone.", "lang": "en"}
