From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. Additionally, we don't know exactly how long coronaviruses can survive on surfaces. So far, what is known about the virus is that it originated in a sea-food market in the Hubei province of China. Many of those who traveled to China were infected and since then various cases of human-to-human transmission have come forward. In view of the number of cases of coronavirus all over the world, experts say that the virus spreads because of coming in contact with an infected person. According to American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it can be possible that touching your mouth, nose or eyes immediately after touching a surface or object with the virus on it can cause infection but it still can not be considered a main way of spreading virus.
