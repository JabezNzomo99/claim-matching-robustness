Over the past year the gross gambling yield from online slots has increased by 15%.\n\nIt is not clear where HuffPost got the figure of \u00a3228 million from.\n\nOther areas of online gambling have increased during the lockdown. The gross gambling yield from online poker was up \u00a36 million, from \u201cother gaming including casino\u201d was up \u00a320 million and from betting on eSports and virtual sports was up \u00a33 million between March 2020 and May 2020.\n\nThe Gambling Commission says: \u201cWe know from previous studies that engagement across a larger number of activities can correlate to higher levels of moderate-risk and problem gambling.\u201d\n\nBut in total, as HuffPost says: \u201cThe Gambling Commission found that overall, gambling was down during lockdown due to the loss of things like football.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
