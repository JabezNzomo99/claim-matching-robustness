Like Al Green, she wants to change our voting system. Wow, she\u2019s CRAZY!\"\n\nIn reality, the statement was a Fox News reporter\u2019s distorted paraphrase of comments Pelosi made in a memo to fellow House Democrats.\n\nWithin hours of Trump\u2019s tweet, a viral Facebook post shared by the page \"President Trump Fans\" started to circulate the misattributed quote.\n\nThe post displays a black-and-white image of Pelosi and attributes the same \"it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump\u2019s fate\" statement to her. Text below the quote reads: \"Ahh! So this is the reason for the fake impeachment inquiry!\"\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPelosi never said those words.\n\nDuring an 11 p.m. segment roughly an hour before Trump\u2019s tweet, Fox News chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel said on camera, \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated a memo to Democrats tonight telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump\u2019s fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation.\"\n\nBut here\u2019s what Pelosi actually wrote in the memo, which she titled, \"Dear Colleague\": \"The weak response to these hearings has been, \u2018Let the election decide.\u2019 That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\"\n\nEmanuel did not say he was quoting Pelosi directly, but his paraphrase is distorted. Pelosi said waiting for the election is dangerous because she believes the president is \"jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\" She did not say it\u2019s \"dangerous to allow voters to decide Trump\u2019s fate.\"\n\nEmanuel, Trump\u2019s tweet, and the Facebook post oversimplify and misconstrue what Pelosi wrote.", "lang": "en"}
