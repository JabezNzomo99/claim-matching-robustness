{"title": "Did Muslims Demand the Cross Be Removed From the Swiss Flag?", "subtitle": "A purported flag-burning incident in Switzerland is wanting of real facts.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-09-26T17:29:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-31985", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/muslims-cross-swiss-flag/", "vclaim": "In late September 2019, the anti-Muslim hate site Frontlines News published a bogus story reporting that \u201cMuslims in Switzerland are demanding that the white cross be removed from the Swiss national flag because as a Christian symbol it \u2018no longer corresponds to today\u2019s multicultural Switzerland.'\u201d\n\nThe story contains a thumbnail image of men holding up a flag and burning it.\n\n \n\n The image was not taken recently and it wasn\u2019t taken in Switzerland \u2014 in fact, the flag being burned is Danish, not Swiss. The photograph in question was taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Rizwan Tabassum in February 2006 in Karachi, Pakistan. According to the picture\u2019s caption, it depicts men burning a flag in response to outrage over cartoons in European newspapers depicting the Prophet Muhammad, the central figure of Islam. Generally, depicting Muhammad in images and statues is forbidden for observant Muslims.\n\nFrontlines News quotes and links to a story that was originally published by the Gatestone Institute, an anti-Muslim, non-profit organization that, as NBC News reported in April 2018, \u201cpromoted misleading and false anti-Muslim news, some of which was amplified by a Russian troll factory\u201d in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nThe Gatestone story cited by Frontlines News quotes only one source, Ivica Petrusic, who was the vice president of the Swiss social justice advocacy group Second@s Plus. Petrusic was quoted saying the cross should be removed from the flag to reflect a separation between church and state and the country\u2019s growing cultural diversity.\n\nPetrusic makes no mention of Muslim people making that demand. The only element of the story linking to Muslims is Gateway\u2019s unfounded assertion that Second@s \u201crepresents mostly Muslim second-generation foreigners in Switzerland.\u201d\n\nBecause the image took place at a different time and in a different place than Frontlines News reported, and because the underlying story originated in 2011 from an already-unreliable source, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.", "lang": "en"}
