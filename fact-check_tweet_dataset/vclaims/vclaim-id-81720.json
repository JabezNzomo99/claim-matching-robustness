Mateen killed 49 people and injured more than 50 in an Orlando nightclub June 12.\n\nThe conspiracy-minded website InfoWars posted an article with the headline, \"Hillary\u2019s State Dept. Blocked Investigation into Orlando Killer\u2019s Mosque\" on Monday, June 13.\n\nOther websites, such as The Horn News, teased a story as \"Hillary\u2019s shocking link to Orlando massacre,\" while Conservative County said Clinton\u2019s link to the Orlando shooter \"has been exposed.\" Collectively, they have been shared at least thousands of times.\n\nIs there any truth to these claims? Not according to experts.\n\nThe InfoWars article centers on the Fort Pierce Islamic Center that Mateen attended. The article claims the mosque under investigation by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in 2011, but that the investigation was shut down \"under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS\u2019s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims.\"\n\nThe InfoWars story seems to be taken directly from another right-wing website World Net Daily. But that article paints a different picture of the investigation.\n\nBoth articles are based on the account of Philip Haney, a former Homeland Security agent who says he was assigned to a unit that investigated individuals with potential links to terrorism. He wrote a book published in 2016 called See Something Say Nothing: A Homeland Security Officers Exposes the Government's Submission to Jihad.\n\nHaney described investigating an Islamic movement known as the Tablighi Jamaat (misspelled in the InfoWars article). That movement was connected to the Institute of Islamic Education, which is connected to the Darul Uloom Chicago madrassa, which has links to the Sharia Board of America. Haney said he found the Sharia Board of America also had links to the Fort Pierce Islamic Center.\n\nIn other words, the 2011 investigation Haney described didn\u2019t look directly into Mateen\u2019s mosque, like the InfoWars headline makes it seem.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Haney has made a connection like this. After the San Bernardino shootings, Haney made the same claim when speaking to Megyn Kelly on Fox News and in a column he wrote in The Hill in February.\n\n\"The two San Bernardino jihadists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, may have benefited from the administration\u2019s closure of an investigation I initiated on numerous groups infiltrating radicalized individuals into this country,\" Haney wrote in an article on The Hill.\n\nWe tried to reach Haney through his phone and also reached out to his book\u2019s publishing company. He could not be reached in either attempt.\n\nThe truth of the matter\n\nSo that\u2019s the story, and it relies almost entirely on one person\u2019s account.\n\nOne of the first holes in the InfoWars article is the misleading headline. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University's security studies program, said the headline is wrong and noted InfoWars misinterpreted the information that was taken from World Net Daily.\n\n\"It\u2019s obviously wrong,\" Gartenstein-Ross said of the InfoWars headline. \"Although, if (InfoWars) changed some words in the headline, it would match their source (World Net Daily). Then there\u2019s a further question if it\u2019s accurate or not.\"\n\nHe said that the State Department could not block a case, but it\u2019s possible it asserted pressure.\n\nOther experts we reached out to agreed that the InfoWars article doesn\u2019t add up, or at least not in the specifics Haney mentions.\n\nThe FBI has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism investigations, not Homeland Security, for which Haney worked, said Timothy Edgar, a senior fellow in international and public affairs at the Watson Institute.\n\nWhile Homeland Security does have a \"relatively small\" intelligence organization known as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Edgar said, the office has no jurisdiction to collect information or investigate cases. Point being, Haney likely wouldn\u2019t be in a position at Homeland Security to investigate a terrorism case in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the bigger problem with the claim made in the article is the way it characterizes the State Department\u2019s role in investigations.\n\nFirst, the FBI doesn\u2019t investigate entire communities like a mosque, Edgar said. It investigates specific people suspected of terrorist activity. More importantly, the State Department \"has no authority or involvement in decisions by the FBI to conduct or close investigations,\" Edgar said.\n\n\"It is simply not credible to describe a mosque as being under \u2018FBI and DHS\u2019 investigation, or that this activity was halted by the State Department or by the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,\" Edgar said.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s focus is on operations overseas, said Martin Reardon, who is the senior vice president of the Soufan Group and a 21-year veteran of the FBI. The secretary of state would have no say in domestic FBI cases, or even have an interest in activities inside the United States.\n\nFurthermore, FBI agents have to go through a number of channels before a case is closed. It\u2019s not just shut down. And even then, agents are sometimes told to do more work to assure the investigation was done properly, Reardon said.\n\nArticles claimed that Clinton as secretary of state enabled radical Islamists by shutting down an investigation of Mateen\u2019s Florida mosque.\n\nThe claim relies heavily on one account of a retired Department of Homeland Security agent that has not been corroborated by any additional source.\n\nExperts we talked to say the claims of the investigation and the purported link to Clinton and the State Department is unlikely. The FBI, not Haney\u2019s Homeland Security department, would handle a terrorism investigation. The State Department, meanwhile, would play little to no role in whether a case is opened, closed or anything else.", "lang": "en"}
