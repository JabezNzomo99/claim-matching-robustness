David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and former mayor of Providence, has joined current mayors of cities around the country to fight a gun-permit bill pending in Congress.\n\n \n\n The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., would require all states to recognize out-of-state permits for carrying concealed weapons.\n\n \n\n The House approved the bill 272 to 154 on Nov. 16, 2011. Cicilline and Rep. James Langevin, also a Democrat from Rhode Island, both voted against it. The bill is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2009.)\n\n \n\n Federal law restricts who can own or possess a firearm, and bans possession by anyone convicted of a felony. But the rules for getting a permit to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state.\n\n \n\n Nine states, including Rhode Island, don\u2019t recognize out-of-state gun permits, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns.\n\n \n\n In a Nov. 18 fundraising letter e-mailed to constituents, Cicilline attacked Republicans and \"Tea Partiers\" for supporting the Right-to-Carry bill. \n\n \n\n \"Earlier this week, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- with the enthusiastic support of Sarah Palin, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Partiers -- once again turned their backs on the 14 million unemployed Americans in our country,\" the letter says, \"and instead chose to focus their efforts on expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.\"\n\n \n\n Sex offenders? Terrorists? Child predators and abusers?\n\n \n\n \"I told you: you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\" the letter continues.\n\n \n\n Actually, we weren\u2019t sure what to believe. So we decided to check it out.\n\n \n\n The facts\n\n \n\n We focused on the second part of the statement: \"expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.\u2019\u2019\n\n \n\n The phrase \"expanding the rights\u2019\u2019 suggests that these criminals currently have the right to carry concealed weapons. But do they?\n\n \n\n Cicilline and his staff offered numerous examples, both hypothetical and real, to argue that, under the bill, criminals in each of the four categories could legally carry a concealed firearm into a state such as Rhode Island, which would amount to \"expanding their rights.\"\n\n \n\n We checked what they offered and will summarize our findings, looking at the categories separately.\n\n \n\n Domestic abusers\n\n \n\n Under federal law, anyone convicted of a crime of domestic violence, including misdemeanors, or anyone subject to a court restraining order cannot legally own or possess a firearm.\n\n \n\n Cicilline\u2019s staff provided us with information from Mayors Against Illegal Guns about four cases (in Missouri, Idaho, Florida and Pennsylvania) in which domestic abusers were granted concealed weapon permits and went on to commit murder.\n\n \n\n In three of the cases (those from Florida, Idaho and Missouri), authorities failed to enforce the federal law banning domestic abusers from possessing weapons, according to the summaries provided. In none of those cases did the abusers have the right to carry concealed weapons. So the Right-to-Carry Act can\u2019t expand a right they don\u2019t have.\n\n \n\n But in the Pennsylvania case, our research confirmed that the killer was granted a concealed weapons permit, despite a prior restraining order for domestic abuse. There were nothing to prohibit the state from granting the permit because the restraining order had been withdrawn.\n\n \n\n So in the domestic abuse category, one of the four examples that Cicilline\u2019s staff provided -- the Pennsylvania case -- supports his claim that some people with a record of domestic abuse can legally carry a concealed weapon.\n\n \n\n Child predators\n\n \n\n Adults who sexually prey on children are prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony.\n\n \n\n And sex crimes against children are almost always felonies.\n\n \n\n But the term \"child predator,\" Cicilline\u2019s staff said in a follow-up e-mail, speaks more broadly about crimes that \"lead up to or are related to child molestation.\u2019\u2019\n\n misdemeanor\n\n They referred us to laws regarding sex-crimes against minors in states such as Florida, Georgia and New Hampshire, where there are no laws preventing such criminals from getting concealed weapon permits.\n\n \n\n We believe that some of the examples Cicilline\u2019s staff provided, including a Georgia law that makes unwanted sexual touching of a 16-year-old a misdemeanor, stretch the meaning of the term \"child predator.\"\n\n \n\n But in New Hampshire, an adult who lures a child into engaging in sex for pornography -- a misdemeanor in that state -- is clearly a child predator.\n\n \n\n So that example met the test.\n\n \n\n Sex offenders\n\n \n\n Federal law prohibits sex offenders convicted of felonies from owning or possessing firearms.\n\n \n\n But Cicilline\u2019s staff noted that someone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense involving another adult would not automatically be barred from getting a concealed weapon permit in some states.\n\n \n\n In New Hampshire, for example, it\u2019s a misdemeanor for correctional officers to engage in sex with someone over whom they have authority.\n\n \n\n Ann Rice, a New Hampshire deputy attorney general, said conviction for such a crime would not automatically bar someone from getting a concealed weapon permit.\n\n \n\n In this category, we verified that the type of case cited by Cicilline\u2019s staff supports his statement.\n\n \n\n Terrorists\n\n \n\n Federal law bars anyone arrested, charged or convicted of acts of terrorism from owning or possessing a firearm. The Right-to-Carry bill clearly would not expand their rights.\n\n \n\n But Cicilline and his staff offered a broader definition of \"terrorist\" to support the congressman\u2019s claim.\n\n \n\n They said people convicted under state terrorism laws, adopted in several cases after the Sept. 11 attacks, and people on the federal government\u2019s terrorist watchlist could be considered \"terrorists\" or \"suspected terrorists.\"", "lang": "en"}
