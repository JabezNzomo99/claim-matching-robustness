It was later downgraded to a tropical storm. The caption for this particular Aug. 3 post reads, \u201cMyrtle Beach 30 minutes ago.\u201d\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image is actually digital storm artwork, not a photo of Isaias over Myrtle Beach. Brent Shavnore, an artist and former Marine, created the piece and posted it on his Instagram in May. It also appears on his website.\n\n\u201cIt is digital artwork and was created by me on May 12th \u2013 not a real photo,\u201d Shavnore confirmed to the Caller via email.

Large portions of sand dunes in North Myrtle Beach were also eroded by the storm surge, Myrtle Beach Sun News reported.\n\n\u201cThe dunes did exactly what they were supposed to do; they protected the infrastructure that is behind the dunes,\u201d U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Lt. Col. Rachel Honderd told Myrtle Beach Sun News. \u201cAnd while there is some damage down the way it is clear that no dunes failed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
