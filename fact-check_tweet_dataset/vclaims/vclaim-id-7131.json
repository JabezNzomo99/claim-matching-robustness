{"title": "Trade across the Irish Sea", "subtitle": "In 2016, the majority of Northern Irish goods trade sent outside its borders went to Great Britain.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7131", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/trade-across-irish-sea/", "vclaim": "The DUP has repeatedly made claims like this. We\u2019ve asked them for more information on where Ms Foster\u2019s figure comes from, but have so far received no response. We\u2019ve not seen any wider evidence to support that figure either.\n\nBased on the official data we\u2019ve seen, it was actually higher\u2014more like 85% in 2016.\n\nThis data looks at the weight of goods. There\u2019s no data we\u2019re aware of for the value of goods.\n\nIt also looks at trade with the UK (plus the Channel Islands and Isle of Man), rather than Great Britain. That means there might be a slight disparity in the numbers, as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are not part of Great Britain. No trade within Northern Ireland is counted in these statistics.\n\nThe claim was made in the context of a discussion about the importance of \u201cfree [trade] flow across the Irish Sea\u201d. To understand the full picture on this trade it helps to look beyond just the port of Belfast. 56% of all Northern Irish goods (in terms of value) sold beyond its borders went to Great Britain in 2016. Including trade within its borders, 21% of all Northern Irish goods sales were to Britain in 2016.\n\nWe\u2019ve not seen the evidence for the 72% claim\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the DUP where their figures come from, but have so far received no response. They have previously made the slightly different claim that \u201c73% of trade flows in and out of Belfast Harbour\u201d are to Britain.\n\n85% of goods that left Belfast port in 2016 went to the UK (plus the Channel Islands and Isle of Man). That\u2019s based on the total weight of goods. 89% of loaded goods units that left Belfast were going to the UK.\n\nLooking at goods coming both in and out of Belfast, 67% were to or from the UK (based on weight).\n\nThat\u2019s not strictly the same as goods travelling to Great Britain (which doesn\u2019t include the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, or Northern Ireland). The Department for Transport told us that this was not likely to make a significant difference in this instance.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nMs Foster made her claim in relation to the possible situation for Northern Irish trade after Brexit. Her point was that a lot of Northern Ireland\u2019s external goods sales are to Britain, and therefore it\u2019s important \u201cthat we have that free flow across the Irish Sea\u201d after Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about why free trade across the Irish Sea after Brexit is complex here.\n\nBelfast is not the whole picture\n\nBelfast was responsible for two thirds of the goods sent out of all Northern Irish ports in 2016.\n\nAcross the four major Northern Irish ports, 88% of goods (in terms of weight) went to the UK in 2016. Looking at both outbound and inbound trade in goods, 69% went to or from the UK.\n\nAlthough politicians speak of the proverbial \u201cred line down the Irish Sea\u201d, it\u2019s not only shipped goods that could be affected. Any goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain would be affected by customs controls between the two land masses, were they to be introduced.\n\n56% of Northern Irish goods which were sold beyond its borders went to Great Britain in 2016. 21% of all Northern Irish goods sales (including those sold within Northern Ireland) were to Britain in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
