As the posts\u2019 continued existence demonstrates, no one who posts the Lord\u2019s Prayer is having that content taken down. Facebook told fact checking website Lead Stories that the prayer does not violate their policies.\n\nNowhere in its community standards does Facebook mention taking down Christian, or religious content.\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from a 2016 article which claimed that all \u201cChristian themed content\u201d would be banned from the website. That article cites a Facebook representative called \u201cRiker Jepson\u201d, whose name only appears online in relation to articles making the same claim. Other similar claims, that Facebook is banning all religious content, have been circulating since at least 2014.", "lang": "en"}
