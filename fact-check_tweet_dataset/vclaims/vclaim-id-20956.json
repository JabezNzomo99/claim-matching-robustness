Other websites published the story as well, but it originated at thelastlineofdefense.org, a satirical website that we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense, May 17: Two Democrat senators made a huge mistake today when they decided to begin impeachment charges against our president under false pretenses. Under US Code Title 18 Subsection 410.91, knowingly perpetrating such an action is attempting a coup and therefore considered treason. Not just treason, either\u2026High treason. If the senators, Matt McCrosky from Vermont and Leon Pillman from Rhode Island, were to sign a full confession, which they won\u2019t, they could actually be executed for their crime. People think impeachment is something you can just do on a whim because a bunch of people say things like \u201cHe\u2019s a tyrant\u201d and \u201che hates America.\u201d You may have even heard that he sides with not just Russia but with certain terrorist groups, too.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense has a disclaimer that says: \u201cWe present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist. Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality.\u201d\n\nEven without the disclaimer, the story includes several red flags.\n\nFirst, there are no U.S. senators named Matt McCrosky and Leon Pillman. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed represent Rhode Island, and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy represent Vermont. The photo in the story published on thelastlineofdefense.org actually shows Jack Straw and Malcolm Rifkind, two former United Kingdom cabinet ministers.\n\nPlus, only the House of Representatives, not the Senate, can bring impeachment charges against the president, said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Roosevelt called the story \u201camazingly implausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be bizarre for Congress to take the decision to impeach \u2014 its most powerful weapon against the president \u2014 and subject it to prosecution,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cProsecutors work for the president, so Congress would be undercutting its authority in a very dramatic way. That\u2019s one reason why there is no such law.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Supreme Court has said that most questions about impeachment are committed to Congress and not susceptible to judicial resolution, so no court would decide whether the pretenses were false. And anything a member of Congress did in recommending impeachment would be protected by the speech and debate clause.\u201d\n\nThere also is no \u201cU.S. Code Title 18 Subsection 410.91,\u201d as the story says.\n\nTreason is defined in Article III, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which says, \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d That \u201ccan\u2019t be broadened by statute,\u201d Roosevelt explained. U.S. Code Title 18 Chapter 115 sets the penalty for treason, he said, but doesn\u2019t otherwise change its constitutional definition.\n\nTo date, only Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California has filed articles of impeachment against Trump for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt now seems likely that the President had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe,\u201d Sherman said in a July 12 statement. \u201cI believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI Director James Comey constitute Obstruction of Justice.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Al Green of Texas is the only co-sponsor of the resolution to impeach Trump, a measure that is considered to be a long shot.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201c2 Senators Just Tried To Impeach Trump And Went To jail Instead.\u201d Worldpoliticsnow.com. 23 May 2017.\n\nStryker. \u201cBREAKING: Bogus Impeachment Talk Leads To Treason Charges For Two Senators.\u201d Thelastlineofdefense.org. 17 May 2017.\n\n\u201cList of current members of U.S. Congress.\u201d Ballotpedia.org.
