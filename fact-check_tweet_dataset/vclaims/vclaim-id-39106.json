(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSpokespeople for Harvard University did not immediately reply to PolitiFact\u2019s emails asking about the post.\n\nBut news stories lend some credence to the Facebook post\u2019s claims \u2014 and provide more information that the post fails to mention.\n\nOn March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic that has infected nearly 120,000 people worldwide. More than 4,000 people have died and eight countries, including the United States, are currently each reporting more than 1,000 cases.\n\nMark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and an expert on viruses, told CBS News, among other news outlets, that 40% to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population could be infected in the coming year.\n\nThere are an estimated 7.6 billion people in the world, and an estimated 329 million in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Adults make up about three-quarters of the U.S. population.\n\n\"That is a projection,\" Lipsitch said during the March 2 interview, \"so we will find out if that\u2019s accurate as things go on. It is the best estimate that I\u2019ve been able to make based on a combination of the mathematical models that we use to track and predict epidemics.\"\n\nOther estimates are similar. The Guardian reported on Feb. 11 that 60% of the global population could be infected if the virus is unchecked. On Feb. 13, Bloomberg reported that Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization, said two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could catch COVID-19.\n\nBut the publication also quoted David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, explaining that researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread.\n\n\"The models will be refined as more information comes to light,\" he said.\n\nThe Facebook post says Harvard scientists say the coronavirus is \"spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.\"\n\nAn epidemiologist at the university has said that 40% to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population could be infected in the coming year.\n\nBut that is a projection, and other projections vary.", "lang": "en"}
