For instance, it spread rumours that Hillary Clinton was linked to a paedophile ring.\n\nAnother time, it claimed US authorities were plotting to assassinate Donald Trump.\n\nThe site is registered by Sean Adl-Tabatabai, a former BBC producer who went on to work for the conspiracy theory website of David Icke, who believes the world is controlled by predatory lizards who demand human sacrifice.\n\nThe Bob Marley article is written by Baxter Dmitry, whose other articles include fake claims that the FBI carefully deleted evidence from the Las Vegas shooting, the Pope believes Jesus has turned into Satan, and that Britney Spears had admitted to escaping from the Illuminati.\n\nSo \u2013 straight away \u2013 we know this is not a reliable source. But how can we completely debunk the Bob Marley story?\n\n1. The man in the photo is not a CIA agent\n\nIt\u2019s actually just an edited stock image. It comes from a photo-shoot by a photographer in Poland. Not America.\n\n2. Cannot corroborate he was a CIA agent\n\nEven if we ignore the picture, who is the CIA agent? The article says he\u2019s called Bill Oxley. But the internet shows up no previous records of any CIA agents by that name. If you Google him, the only thing that comes up is this article, and other websites which have copied it.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t disprove the story in itself (after all, you\u2019d expect the CIA to be secretive). But it is yet another aspect of the story which cannot be verified or substantiated. We are asked to simply believe the writer.\n\n3. The hospital has never heard of him\n\nThe article says Bill Oxley is a patient at Mercy Hospital in Maine, America.\n\nFactCheck phoned the hospital, but we were told there was no one there by that name. Nor were they aware of anyone called Oxley who had been a patient there in recent weeks.\n\n4. There are no sources\n\nThe writer doesn\u2019t say where he\u2019s getting his information from. Was he at Bill Oxley\u2019s bedside himself? Or did he hear the story from someone else? If so, who? He doesn\u2019t say.\n\nThe story claims Bob Marley was poisoned with \u201cviruses and bacteria\u201d which gave him cancer. But if you wanted to assassinate someone, this would be a really bad way of doing it.\n\nCertain virus and bacteria have been shown to increase your chances of developing types of cancer in the long term, but the research was in its infancy at the time of Marley\u2019s death and is not fully understood even now.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the report\u2019s own claims suggest it took several years to kill him \u2013 whereas other substances like ricin or cyanide would have been quick and easy. Radiation poisoning could also be effective. But trying to give him cancer would be far more difficult and far less effective.\n\nEven if the CIA had wanted to use cancer, Bob Marley had a very specific and rare type of skin cancer, making the claims even more unlikely. Killing him with a different type of cancer, like Mesothelioma, would have been easier by just exposing him to asbestos.\n\nConspiracy theories about Bob Marley\u2019s death have circulated for years. After all, unidentified gunman did try and kill him in 1976.\n\nStories and myths about his death have been popular ever since.\n\nMarley was known to distrust the CIA and wrote songs criticising the American spy agency.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true that the CIA had interests in Jamaica. Indeed, declassified files from 1970 reveal discussions about whether the US should intervene in the island\u2019s elections.\n\nThe US has also been known to secretly poison people with dangerous substances.\n\nThere are many examples of this littered through Cold War history. In the 1940s and \u201950s, for instance, radiation experiments were conducted on American schoolchildren.\n\nAround 7,000 soldiers were used as human guinea pigs for testing chemical warfare agents which continued for years. And a notorious CIA project called MKULTRA saw secret agents drugging unwitting members of the public with LSD.\n\nSo, we\u2019re not saying there are no legitimate questions about the CIA\u2019s activity. Nor can we independently prove how Bob Marley died.\n\nBut there is no evidence that any of the claims in this article are correct, as they appear to be based on nothing. It\u2019s fake news.\n\nWe have asked YourNewsWire.com to explain their story and will update this article if they respond.", "lang": "en"}
