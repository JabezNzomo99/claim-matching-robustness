No, that's not true: it is just a rehash of an old hoax story that keeps being reposted with some changes in location every few months. It is not real, it did not happen.\n\nThe latest version of the story appeared in an article published by the website CGC News on September 16, 2018 titled \"Athens, TX woman charged: claims she made cheating husband 'eat his own genitals'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 43-year old woman from Henderson County, Texas is in custody after authorities were called to a property in Athens late last night to respond to a reported domestic disturbance. Upon arrival, the officers found a confronting scene. In the master bedroom, a 49-year old man, and the husband of the accused woman, lay in a pool of blood with a gruesome wound to his groin. The man was found to have had his penis and testicles 'cleanly severed' with a sharp instrument, believed to be a knife that was found on the bedside table. The wound was dressed and the victim was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he is now listed in a serious but stable condition. Investigators searched the property, but could find no sign of the man's genitals, or his wife, who a neighbor claimed had been heard shouting and screaming at her husband earlier in the night. The wife was located later in the evening at her parent's home.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and it looked convincingly real to many people:\n\nBut we debunked the exact same hoax but set in a different location back in April 2018:\n\nAnd in three more locations in April 2017:\n\nThe site that posted it is very likely part of a network set up by the owner of the previous sites that published the hoax. His modus operandi is to keep reposting the same fakes over and over again but set in different locations, using social media to seed each version of the story.\n\nWe wrote about cgcnews.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Myrtle Beach Man Did NOT Shoot at Hurricane Florence, Did NOT Die After Bullet Ricochets", "lang": "en"}
