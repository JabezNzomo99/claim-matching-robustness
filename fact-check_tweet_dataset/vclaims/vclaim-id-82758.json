When Sanders repeated the claim at the December rally, readers asked us to look into his comparison and a subsequent explanation by @BernPress, which appeared to be a Twitter account affiliated with the Sanders campaign:\n\nNote: This is not an official account or any account associated with the Sanders campaign. We reached out to his staff to get a better understanding of his comparison, which we will examine below.\n\nBut most mortgages are 30-year loans. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.9 percent in 2015 (and it could reach 4.7 percent by the end of 2016). Although Sanders cites \u201c2, 3 percent,\u201d 30-year loans have never been as low as 2 percent. The lowest they ever got was 3.35 percent in late 2012.\n\nInterest rates for student loans are calculated in ways that are not comparable to mortgages. The student loan interest rate varies on the type of loan (undergraduate, graduate/professional, parent), additional fees, the year the loan was disbursed, and whether the loan was consolidated (and at what interest rate). Student loans disbursed between 2006 and 2015 had interest rates from 3.4 percent to 8.5 percent.\n\nYou can see just how varied the rates can be from year to year, using Table B-5 in this 2013 Congressional Research Service report. Take the Stafford loan, the most common federal student loan, as an example. The interest rate was as low as 3.37 percent in 2002-03, to as high as 8.25 percent (the cap) in the mid-1990s. Since 2006, Stafford loan interest rates have been capped at 6.8 percent.\n\nInterest rates for parent borrowers have been as high as 14 percent, said Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser for the Sanders campaign. The more loans you take out, the more interest piles up, and trying to consolidate multiple student loans into one loan drives up your rate, he said. Under Sanders\u2019s proposal, borrowers will be able to refinance or consolidate their federal student loans into interest rates of 2.3 to 3.1 percent, depending on the loan.\n\n\u201cMortgages are secured by collateral that can be seized by a lender (foreclosure) and sold. Same with an auto loan,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy. \u201cA student loan is different. A lender can\u2019t seize the education and sell it to someone else, and a lender can\u2019t put a deadbeat borrower into slavery.\u201d\n\nStudents actually can refinance their loans with private companies such as SoFi, which are offering lower interest rates than the ones the federal government offers for some low-risk borrowers, said Elizabeth Akers, a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Children and Families. Refinancing a home in the private loan market and the way the federal government underwrites loans are not analogous, Akers said.\n\nFurther, unlike mortgages, there is an income-based repayment plan option for student loans. The Education Department\u2019s Revised Pay as You Earn plan, or REPAYE, allows all borrowers to take advantage of the repayment plan regardless of their income or when they borrowed. REPAYE caps borrowers\u2019 monthly bills at 10 percent of their income for 20 years. After 20 years, the remaining debt is forgiven.\n\nUnder this program, the calculation for your monthly payment is based on your discretionary income. If your income is very low, you may not have to pay anything until your paycheck increases. REPAYE is the government\u2019s most generous student loan repayment plan, and this type of loan modification doesn\u2019t apply to mortgages \u2014 at least without ruining your credit rating.\n\nUnlike Sanders claims, most homes are not refinanced at a rate of 2 or 3 percent. And although student loan rates may reach 10 percent in some circumstances, there are much lower interest rates that are almost equal to the average 30-year mortgage rate. This is a classic example of cherry-picking two numbers to make the point you want.\n\nYet even with the cherry-picked numbers, the comparison doesn\u2019t work. Sanders says \u201cit makes no sense that students and their parents pay higher interest rates for college than they pay for car loans or housing mortgages.\u201d Perhaps \u201cit makes no sense\u201d because the two loans are so different. You pay a lower interest rate on paying for your home partly because you have a property at stake, unlike with a student loan. There is now a generous repayment plan for student loans, where you may not even pay anything for a while if you\u2019re not earning enough. You can\u2019t do that with mortgages \u2014 at least without your house getting taken away.", "lang": "en"}
