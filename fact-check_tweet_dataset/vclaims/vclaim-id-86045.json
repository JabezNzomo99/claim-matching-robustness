It would have taken at least 13 years before citizenship could be obtained.\n\nThe ad truncates her full quote, from an interview with a television station: \u201cWe need an immigration bill. And here in the state of Kentucky, it will actually help boost our economy, giving a pathway to citizenship for so many millions of Americans can have a positive impact right here in the state of Kentucky.\u201d She added that it needed to be \u201can earned path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nScott Jennings, a spokesman for the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, countered that the ad \u201cis 100% demonstrably true (as evidenced by Grimes\u2019s own voice).\u201d He provided several examples of where Grimes\u2019s statement was similar to Obama\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cWhile you are correct that she didn\u2019t author or write the immigration bill, she has clearly, on numerous occasions, supported the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens, as has Obama.\u201d\n\nThe ad cites a Heritage Foundation report for its claim that the bill would allow illegal immigrants to \u201cbecome eligible for taxpayer-funded benefits,\u201d but that report actually did not assess the bill that emerged from the Senate. That bill said that Registered Provisional Immigrants\u2014the intermediate step for illegal immigrants \u2014 will not be eligible for federal means-tested public benefits, such as Obamacare, food stamps or Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nBut here\u2019s the oddest thing about the ad. Crossroads GPS, another organization affiliated with Rove, during the 2013 debate actually ran ads calling for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, \u201cwhere they will pay a fine, prove employment and meet other requirements,\u201d as well as prohibit eligibility for welfare or Obamacare. (See the ad below.) Indeed, it even called the emerging Senate bill an \u201cimportant starting point\u201d to fixing the current system. And yet, here is an affiliated group attacking a Democrat for supporting a bill that largely meets the criteria set forth in the ad. It\u2019s enough to give politics a bad name.\n\nUpdate: There have been a number of articles that have explored the connections between Crossroads and groups such as KOC (here\u2019s another one) but Jennings argues that it is going too far to suggest Rove is involved in KOC\u2019s ad-making decisions. \u201cI see the articles you cite; I don\u2019t see in them any facts to prove that Karl Rove is in control of or is making decisions for the KOC,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ad isn\u2019t about Karl Rove, who had no hand in it, anyway. This ad is about a single issue and the fact that Grimes and Obama have the same position.\u201d\n\nGrimes certainly supports a bill that would prove a pathway to citizenship for undocumented aliens, as does Obama. Whether this is \u201camnesty\u201d is in the eye of the beholder. But this was not a bill crafted by either Obama or Grimes, but a coalition of Republicans and Democrats\u2013an unusual example of bipartisan cooperation in this period of intense partisanship.\n\nMoreover, the bill that emerged from the Senate set tough rules for that pathway \u2014 including denying access to virtually all federal means-tested benefits. In doing so, the bill largely met criteria set by donors and supporters of the very organization that is now blasting Grimes on this issue. It is bizarre and hypocritical for this group to now falsely attack Grimes for supporting a middle ground approach that its supporters once championed.", "lang": "en"}
