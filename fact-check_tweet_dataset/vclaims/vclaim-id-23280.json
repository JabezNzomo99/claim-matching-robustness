Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who recently accused the president of sexual assault.\n\nThe woman in the picture is makeup artist Jill Harth, not Carroll.\n\nCarroll made headlines last week after New York Magazine published an excerpt from her upcoming book, \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.\u201d In it, she alleges that Trump sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a luxury department store in the 1990s.\n\nThe White House has denied the allegation, calling the story \u201ccompletely false and unrealistic.\u201d Trump, for his part, claimed that he has never met Carroll.\n\nEven though Teanderthal Party could have simply pointed to a black and white photo of Trump and Carroll speaking to one another at a party, circa 1987, the page instead tries to refute Trump\u2019s claim by showing a photo of Trump and a blonde woman, ostensibly Carroll. There\u2019s just one problem: it\u2019s not Carroll in the picture.\n\nTrump is actually pictured with Harth, a woman he dated briefly in the 1990s. The photo is shown in a 2016 episode of \u201cInside Edition\u201d that profiled Harth, who has also accused Trump of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation, Harth confirmed that she, not Carroll, appears in the photo. An agent for Carroll also confirmed that it wasn\u2019t her pictured.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Carroll disputed the characterization that she was raped, saying, \u201cMy word is fight, my word is not the victim one. I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
