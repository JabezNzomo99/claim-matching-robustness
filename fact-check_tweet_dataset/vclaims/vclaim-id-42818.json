The island nation has 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases and no deaths as of press time.\n\nThe Malagasy Institute of Applied Research, which researches uses for Madagascar\u2019s traditional medicines, developed the herbal tonic, which has been distributed and sold throughout the country, per BBC News. The label on the bottle does not list its ingredients, but it reportedly derives from artemisia, a plant used in some malaria drugs, according to the AP.\n\nThe viral Facebook post claims Covid Organics will \u201cwipe out the virus at any stage within a period of six days.\u201d (RELATED: Does Hot Water With Lemon Kill Coronavirus?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Covid Organics can prevent or cure COVID-19, and medical experts have been critical of the drink. In response to the launch of Covid Organics, the World Health Organization (WHO) told BBC News in a statement that it does not recommend \u201cself-medication with any medicines \u2026 as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific evidence that this is effective has not been proven,\u201d Marcel Razanamparany, the president of Madagascar\u2019s Academy of Medicine, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that it could actually harm the health of the population, particularly that of children.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has also warned against \u201calternative\u201d remedies such as herbal therapies and teas, noting that there is \u201cno scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness.\u201d Both the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated on their respective websites that there is no known cure for COVID-19.\n\nWithout scientific evidence of Covid Organics\u2019 safety and efficacy in treating or preventing COVID-19, we rate this claim false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
