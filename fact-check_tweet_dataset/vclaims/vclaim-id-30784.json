(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching online for the quote\u2019s origins, we found no credible source crediting Murray.\n\nBarry Popik, an etymologist who studies the origins of terms, has a 2011 post on his website exploring a similar quote: \"If we lie to Congress, it\u2019s a felony and if Congress lies to us it\u2019s just politics.\" According to Popik, Ken Huber wrote that line in an editorial published in the Iosco County News Herald in 2010. Similar sentiments are older, Popkik says in the post, dating back to the late 1980s. But he doesn\u2019t mention Bill Murray.\n\nIn 2013, however, a parody Bill Murray Twitter account tweeted the quote that appears in the Facebook post, right down to the misspelling of \"it\u2019s.\"\n\n\"I AM NOT BILL MURRAY,\" reads the account\u2019s bio. \"This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.\"\n\nCorrection: This story was updated to correct the spelling of etymologist.", "lang": "en"}
