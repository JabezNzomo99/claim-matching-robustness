It now says estimates put the cost at \u00a3820 million, which comes from a recent National Audit Office estimate.\n\nThere were over 170,000 delayed bed days in June, the latest month that figures are available for. These are the number of full days each bed could have been used by another patient. 6,000 was roughly the number of people of all ages who were fit to be discharged but hadn\u2019t been on a single day at the end of the month.\n\nThe estimates for how much \u2018bed blocking\u2019 like this costs NHS ever year vary. We haven\u2019t seen any estimate as high as \u00a36 billion, but none seem to be higher than \u00a3900 million.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much bed blocking costs\n\nWe don\u2019t know where The Times got its figure of \u00a36 billion a year in costs as a result of \u2018bed blocking\u2019, and we are trying to find out. NHS England told us that it doesn\u2019t recognise that number.\n\nOther estimates from NHS England suggested that for the year ending March 2016 \u2018bed blocking\u2019 may have cost the NHS \u00a3145 million. But they say this is based on estimates from care providers, the real cost may have higher.\n\nIn fact, other estimates have produced a much larger figure.\n\nOne key report suggested the cost may be around \u00a3900 million a year. This was based on the estimate that as many as 8,500 patients a month were still in hospital beds, but fit to be transferred.\n\nThe National Audit Office also estimated the cost of treating patients aged 65 and older who hadn\u2019t been discharged might be as high as \u00a3820 million a year. They also estimated that these older patients make up around 85% of all patients who are not discharged once they are deemed fit. That\u2019s based on assuming the cost is around \u00a3300 per patient per day.\n\nBut it\u2019s not possible to estimate this precisely, according to the NAO, because of the limited data available.\n\nWaiting for care at home is the most common reason for delayed discharge\n\n19% of all people who weren\u2019t discharged from hospital were waiting for a care package to be put in place at home. This was the most common reason for not being discharged at the end of June. 17% of people were waiting to be assessed and a similar proportion were awaiting some other form of NHS care.\n\nThis is a change on the same time last year when the top three reasons for a discharge from hospital being delayed were people waiting for other NHS care, awaiting a complete assessment or because of their own or their family\u2019s choice.\n\nThere were on average 130,000 overnight beds available in NHS hospitals in England in 2015/16. The House of Commons Library have also said that the number of available beds, per person in the country, decreased by 20% between 2006 and 2012. This has been due to advances in medical care meaning fewer people have to stay in hospital and a deliberate shift towards treating more patients at home if it\u2019s possible.", "lang": "en"}
