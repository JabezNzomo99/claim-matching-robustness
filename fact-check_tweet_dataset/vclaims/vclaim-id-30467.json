Except, he wants me to pay for it. . . . Does this concern you at all?\u201d\n\n Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.): \u201cI wasn\u2019t critical of the last president or the president before that, for what they do in their off time. . . . I\u2019m not going to tell the president where he can or cannot spend his weekends.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Exchange during a town hall in Mesa, Ariz., April 13, 2017\n\nObama\u2019s $97 million over eight years: This is an estimate by the conservative group Judicial Watch, which tallied Secret Service and Air Force costs incurred during the former first family\u2019s personal travels. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the group tracked trips that were \u201cpolitical, leisurely or otherwise unnecessary,\u201d including vacations to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and travels during the 2016 campaign as Hillary Clinton\u2019s surrogates.\n\nThat is only one piece of the total price of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago visits, and it excludes Secret Service or Air Force costs. Moreover, some of Trump\u2019s trips to Mar-a-Lago are \u201cworking\u201d trips, where he conducts some official business, such as hosting foreign dignitaries at his golf club. That means they\u2019re not directly comparable to the purely leisurely trips tallied under Obama\u2019s $97 million.\n\n\u201cHis [Obama\u2019s] vacations to Hawaii cost millions of dollars,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cThe political problem with President Trump, and the accountability problem, is after a period of time, the cost will be difficult for him to be able to defend. It doesn\u2019t help that we don\u2019t know what the [total] costs are because the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security [which oversees the Secret Service] haven\u2019t gotten their act together to turn them over to us.\u201d\n\nObama took three trips to seven African countries. That\u2019s seven out of 58 countries he visited as president through both terms. President Bill Clinton visited 10 African countries, and George W. Bush visited 11. Bush visited once with his wife and two daughters, and another time just with his wife.\n\nObama took his wife and daughters on his 2013 trip to three African countries, at an estimated price tag of tens of millions of dollars \u2014 possibly the most expensive of his tenure. The federal government provided all the resources, because the options in developing areas did not meet White House standards, The Post reported. That made the trip particularly costly. Clinton and Bush made similarly resource-intensive trips.\n\nThere was a lot of interest at recent town halls about Trump\u2019s travels to Mar-a-Lago, and how much they are costing taxpayers. Yoho, responding to a constituent with some inaccurate information, did not make an apples-to-apples comparison of Trump\u2019s and Obama\u2019s travels in the town hall. Yoho noted the daily cost of $60,000 for Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago trips, vs. Obama\u2019s $97 million in travel costs over eight years. But the $60,000 represents a fraction of the costs per trip; it\u2019s just the cost to the Palm Beach County government.\n\nAnd while Obama\u2019s trips to Africa were costly (as were the Africa trips of Bush and Clinton), he didn\u2019t go \u201cquite a bit\u201d when you look at his Africa trips compared with the rest of his travels as president.
