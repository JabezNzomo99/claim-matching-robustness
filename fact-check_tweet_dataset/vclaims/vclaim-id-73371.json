This claim is false; the footage actually shows actors filming a scene for a movie in Brazil.\n\nThe video was published here in a pro-Hong Kong police Facebook group with more than 34,600 members on August 23, 2020. It has been shared more than 700 times.\n\nThe simplified Chinese characters superimposed on the video translate to English as: \u201cLook at the police officers in other countries / How helpless.\u201d The logo for Douyin, the Chinese version of the video-sharing platform TikTok, can also be seen embedded in the video.\n\nThe video\u2019s traditional Chinese caption reads: \u201cSometimes US police officers are also helpless\u201d.\n\nThe original Douyin video was published here alongside a similar claim. It was also shared here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter alongside a claim it shows police in Brazil.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes extracted from the video in the misleading post found this clip. It was published on the Instagram account for Brazilian actor Peter Brand\u00e3o on August 20, 2020. It appears to show the same scene filmed from a different angle.\n\nThe post\u2019s Portuguese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cFrom yesterday, at the recording of Rocinha, toda hist\u00f3ria tem dois lados\u201d.\n\n\u201cRocinha, toda hist\u00f3ria tem dois lados\u201d is an independent film in production in Rocinha, one of Brazil\u2019s largest favelas.\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the Instagram video (R):\n\nA closer analysis of the video in the misleading post also shows there are several camera crew standing on the street.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video\u2019s four-second mark, which shows two crew members circled in red by AFP:\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, BS Produ\u00e7\u00f5es, the producers of \u201cRocinha, toda hist\u00f3ria tem dois lados\u201d, told AFP by phone on August 21 that the video appears to have been captured during filming in Rocinha on August 19.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, the secretariat for Rio de Janeiro State Military Police told AFP by email on August 21: \u201cThe audiovisual material in question is part of a recording of a film [in Rocinha]\u201d.\n\nThe same video has also circulated in Portuguese social media posts with other misleading claims, as debunked by AFP's Brazil fact check team here.", "lang": "en"}
