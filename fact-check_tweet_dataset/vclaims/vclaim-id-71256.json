So do keep fans, air cons, fridges etc on.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Are people purposefully sneezing in the Nizamuddin mosque to spread virus?\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be misleading.\n\nThe government agencies assured that there is no need to take any precautions while turning off the lights.\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) in a tweet clarified that there is \u2018no need to worry as adequate protocols/arrangements are in place to handle the variation in demand when people switch off their lights for #9Baje9Minutes\u2019.\n\nHence, the above information proves that the viral forward is False.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
