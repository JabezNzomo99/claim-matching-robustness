That\u2019s not what Comey said.\n\nComey actually said there was evidence that Clinton knew she was receiving classified information, but that he could not prove it \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in court.\n\n\u201cI do not believe there\u2019s evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew she was receiving classified information in violation of the requirements, but there is evidence of that,\u201d Comey testified on July 7.\n\nRep. Xavier Becerra, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, made his remarks on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Aug. 7 during an exchange with host Chris Wallace. The two clashed over whether the FBI director contradicted Clinton\u2019s public statements about sending classified emails on her private server.\n\nWallace showed a clip of Rep. Trey Gowdy questioning Comey during a House Oversight Committee on July 7. Gowdy asked Comey, \u201cSecretary Clinton said, \u2018I did not e-mail \u200bany\u200b classified \u200bmaterial\u200b to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material.\u2019 Was that true?\u201d Comey replies, \u201cThere was classified material e-mailed.\u201d\n\nWallace, Aug. 7: Congressman, Comey directly contradicted what Clinton had been telling the American people for a year. Becerra: But, Chris, what you don\u2019t also show is that Director Comey said that she had no knowledge of some of those so-called classified e-mails because they were either not marked or they were not classified at the time or they were incorrectly marked. And so, he did come out and say \u2014 you don\u2019t show that, but he did come out and say that she did not know. Wallace: They were marked and more importantly, he said that there was classified material that she had emailed. Becerra: But she did not know it. Otherwise, if there had been the intention to send classified emails, then the FBI would have pursued this much further. And so I think you\u2019re trying to make more of this than what there is. Wallace: She didn\u2019t say, \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to send classified material.\u201d Wallace: She said \u2014 that isn\u2019t what she told the American people. She said there was no classified material. Becerra: Chris, she has made it clear that looking back at this, she would have done it differently, that she did make some mistakes, but that she never intended to send classified information over emails, and the FBI investigation confirms that. And so, while we may want to make more of it, the fact is the FBI has said we should move on and get to real important matters of the country.\n\nBecerra goes too far when he claims that Comey said Clinton \u201chad no knowledge\u201d that any emails contained classified information, and that \u201cthe FBI investigation confirms\u201d that \u201cshe never intended to send classified information over emails.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, Comey said at a July 5 press conference that more than 2,000 of the 30,490 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in December 2014 contained classified information, including 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. He also said, \u201ca very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information.\u201d\n\nIn his July 7 testimony, Comey clarified that those three additional emails had \u201cportion markings\u201d indicating that they contained classified information, but he acknowledged under questioning from Rep. Matt Cartwright that they were not properly marked and therefore could have been missed by Clinton. He said those three emails were marked as classified with the letter \u201cC\u201d in the body of the email.\n\nBecerra\u2019s office referred us to Comey\u2019s July 7 testimony, specifically to Comey\u2019s responses to questions from Cartwright, a Democrat, and Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican. But Comey was very careful in his testimony \u2014 as he was in his July 5 press conference \u2014 to make it clear that there was evidence that Clinton and her staff knew or should have known that classified information was housed on an unsecure server, but that there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d to pursue a criminal prosecution.\n\nFirst, we will take a look at what Comey said at his press conference.\n\nComey, July 5: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton\u2019s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later \u201cup-classified\u201d e-mails). None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government\u2014or even with a commercial service like Gmail. Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked \u201cclassified\u201d in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.\n\nComey elaborated two days later, when Rep. Buck asked Comey if Clinton knew she received classified information. Comey balked at providing a yes or no answer.\n\nBuck then asked if Clinton intended to retain classified material on her server, and Comey again responded that \u201cthere is evidence of that,\u201d but not \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \u2014 the legal standard needed for a successful prosecution:\n\nRather than saying Clinton had \u201cno knowledge\u201d that her emails contained classified information, Comey actually said there was evidence that she knew she was receiving and storing classified information, but that he could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.", "lang": "en"}
