The black home ownership rate was 42 percent for the third quarter of 2017, and there have been 86 quarters since 1994 that had higher rates than that, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nThe president raised the issue of black home ownership during a Make America Great Again rally in Pensacola, Florida, where he urged neighboring Alabamians to vote for Republican Roy Moore in the Dec. 12 special U.S. Senate election. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers \u2014 including one as young as 14 \u2014 when he was a younger man in his 30s.\n\n\u201cSo get out and vote for Roy Moore,\u201d Trump said of the former state judge, who has denied the allegations.\n\nAt one point in the rally, Trump spotted a \u201cblacks for Trump sign.\u201d\n\nThe audience roared with approval. But hold the applause.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our request for evidence to support the president\u2019s claim. But we checked with the National Association of Realtors for the best home ownership statistics, and it referred us to census data \u2014 which we summarized above.\n\nThe Census Bureau website provides 95 quarters of home ownership data since 1994. After we sorted the census figures, the 42 percent black home ownership rate for the third quarter of 2017 clocked in at 87th.\n\nThe highest rate during that nearly 24-year span was 49.7 percent in the second quarter of 2004. The lowest rate was 41.2 percent in the third quarter of 1995.\n\nIn fact, the most recent third quarter rate isn\u2019t even the highest this year, let alone \u201cin the history of our country.\u201d The rate was 42.7 percent in the first quarter and 42.3 percent in the second quarter, so if anything there has been a slight downward trend in 2017.\n\nThe Census Bureau also has decennial census data on home ownership by race dating to 1950. The black home ownership rate was higher in 1980 (44.4 percent) and 1990 (43.4 percent) than in the most recent quarter. It was lower in 1970 (41.6 percent) and 1950 (34.5 percent). There was no rate provided for 1960.\n\nClarification, Dec. 12: The third quarter rate came in 87th out of 95 quarters, making it the 87th highest, or ninth lowest, rate. We originally mistakenly said it was the 87th lowest.", "lang": "en"}
