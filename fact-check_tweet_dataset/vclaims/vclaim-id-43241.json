Lori Thornton-Macrander, whose individual post about the mushrooms has been shared over 3,000 times said, \"If you read (the post), you can tell it's a joke.\"\n\nWhile created as a joke, there is no guarantee that everyone who viewed the post got that message.\n\nAnd in a separate posting of the false information, users in the comments were unsure if joking about the virus was appropriate.\n\n\"Sorry I suppose humor is helpful to deal with stress but I\u2019m not ready to joke about this virus yet,\" one person wrote.\n\nThe information in this viral post has been rated false. The CDC has not issued a warning about morchella mushrooms and the post was intended to be a joke.", "lang": "en"}
