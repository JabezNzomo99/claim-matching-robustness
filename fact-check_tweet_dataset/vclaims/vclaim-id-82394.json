Demonstrations against similar restrictions occurred elsewhere in Europe and Canada that day, according to CBC News.\n\nIn recent days, multiple Facebook users shared an aerial photo of a large crowd, claiming it was taken during the Berlin protest. The caption for this particular post reads, \u201cNow that\u2019s people power! Germany.yesterday! Merkals (sic) days are over.\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo was taken in July 1997 by aerial photojournalist and pilot Robert Gahn. It appears on the website of his Germany-based photo agency, where the caption, translated to English, identifies it as a scene from the 1997 Love Parade music festival in Berlin.\n\nThe Love Parade, an annual electronic dance music event held in Germany, last occurred in 2010, when 21 people were killed and over 500 others were injured in a stampede, The Guardian reported. It was permanently cancelled after the tragic incident, according to The Telegraph.\n\nA German court ended a trial about the 2010 Love Parade incident without a verdict in May, citing the statute of limitations expiring in July and restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, The Associated Press reported.", "lang": "en"}
