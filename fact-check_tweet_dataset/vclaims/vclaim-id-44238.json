In the video, Kejriwal can be seen in a vehicle surrounded by people while there a scuffle on the road. The viral video claims that a person was mishandled by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during Kejriwal\u2019s roadshow and the CM watched as a mute spectator.\n\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted this video claiming that a man was lynched at a Kejriwal roadshow. This comes in the backdrop of a person protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act thrashed at Amit Shah\u2019s rally allegedly for chanting anti-CAA slogans.\n\nA user @GatimaanBharat claimed that AAP workers \u201clynched\u201d a man in front of Kejriwal. He tweeted, \u201cAAP workers mob lynching a man in front of Kejriwal. Kejriwal just watches. Never asks his followers to stop even once. Kejriwal is practically presiding over a mob lynching. #\u0936\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u092c\u093e\u0917_\u0915\u093e_\u092d\u0902\u0921\u093e\u092b\u094b\u0921\u093c (Hashtag translation #ShaheenBagh_Debunked).\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another Twitter user with the handle @bpjIndia shared the viral video along with the same text on January 31.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Malviya reshared a video by one \u2018Amit Raina\u2019 posted on May 8, 2019, which proves that the incident is not recent.\n\nThe video in question is from May 4, 2019, incident when Kejriwal was slapped during a rally at Moti Nagar, New Delhi. The viral clip does not show the slap but its aftermath. The Hindu\u2019sreport from the day said, \u201cMr. Kejriwal who has been carrying out roadshows across the Capital ahead of Lok Sabha elections was standing in his open roof vehicle when the incident happened. In a video, a man in a red t-shirt and black pants can be seen climbing on the vehicle\u2019s bonnet and attacking the CM and abusing him. The man is then pulled down by the crowd.\u201d\n\nOn May 4, Hindustan Timesuploaded a video which captured this event. It\u2019s noteworthy that the music played in Hindustan Times report and viral video is the same.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search on Twitter and found that Times of India journalist Raj Shekhar Jha tweeted a video about the incident on May 4, 2019.\n\nAlt News analysed the viral video and Jha\u2019s video. In both the videos, two men (highlighted in red), one in a blue shirt and the other in a white shirt, can be spotted.\n\nIn conclusion, the viral video is from a 2019 incident where Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was slapped during a roadshow and AAP supporters and workers brutally thrashed the attacker. It has gone viral ahead of Delhi assembly elections set to be held on February 8.", "lang": "en"}
