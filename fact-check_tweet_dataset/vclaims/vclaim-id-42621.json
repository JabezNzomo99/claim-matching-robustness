Nevertheless, screen grabs of it continue to circulate widely on other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cCORONAVIRUS LOOPHOLE!!!!\u201d reads the screen grabbed tweet. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have insurance and can\u2019t afford to take the $3,200 test for the virus ($1,000 with insurance), DONATE BLOOD. They HAVE to test you for the virus in order to donate blood. Tell your friends! Tell your family!!!!!\u201d\n\nPotential donors and the donated blood itself does go through a series of tests for infectious diseases but, according to spokespeople from America\u2019s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross, screening for COVID-19 isn\u2019t part of that process. (RELATED: Did The Vatican Confirm Pope Francis Has The Novel Coronavirus?)\n\n\u201cWe do a whole range of testing on blood donations as required by the FDA, but screen or testing for coronavirus is not happening,\u201d Kate Fry, chief executive officer of America\u2019s Blood Centers, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThere is no test to screen blood donations for the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses,\u201d American Red Cross spokeswoman Greta Gustafson told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s important to emphasize that there is no data or evidence that this coronavirus can be transmitted by blood transfusions, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion transmission for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe American Red Cross has requested that people refrain from donating blood for 28 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 or coming into contact with someone who has the virus or is suspected to have it. Individuals who have recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea should also postpone their donations for 28 days, according to the American Red Cross.\n\nHealthy individuals who meet blood donation criteria are eligible and encouraged to give blood, the American Red Cross website states.\n\nCoronavirus tests consist of at least one swab from the nose and one swab from the throat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tests come at no charge, but patients may have to pay for related medical services, like diagnostic scans and hospitalizations, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe Twitter account that originated the claim in the Facebook post later issued a correction, saying, \u201cI realize I tweeted something earlier that I didn\u2019t research or thought would go anywhere and at a desperate attempt to help people who can\u2019t afford the medical bills associated with testing for the virus, tweeted out misinformation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
