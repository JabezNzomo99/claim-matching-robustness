The official Twitter handle of \u2018Dalit Congress\u2019 has also posted the photo with the same claim. But, FACTLY has found that the photo is not related to the current lockdown. Also, the photo was taken in Bangladesh and not in India. The same man can be also seen in a video posted by \u2018UkhiaNews.com\u2019 in 2017. In the description of the video, it can be read that he is a Rohingya who entered Bangladesh. While it is true that migrants are facing a lot of problems due to the current lockdown in the country, the photo is not related to India.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
