But the image has been doctored from a photo in which the actress was pictured holding a sign supporting the opposition.\n\n\n\nThe photo was shared here on Facebook on April 30, 2019 and has been shared more than 400 times since then.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe photo shows retired actress Cynthia Patag, known in the Philippines for her comedic roles. This is her Facebook page.\n\nShe is pictured holding a sign which states: \u201cJunk!!!. Otso Diretso!!.. No to Liberal Party!!.. Now!!!...\u201d\n\n\u201cOtso Diretso\u201d is a reference to a slate of opposition candidates contending the May 13 midterm elections in the Philippines. Here is the slate\u2019s official website.\n\nHere is a recent press release from the Philippines Commission on Elections about the country's upcoming polls on May 13.\n\n\u201cLiberal Party\u201d refers to the main opposition group in the Philippines. Here is its official website.\n\nThe same photo was also shared on Facebook here.\n\nBut the photo has been doctored from an original image in which the actress was pictured holding a sign supporting the Otso Diretso opposition candidates.\n\nThis image was published on her official Facebook page on April 29, 2019.\n\nBelow is the photo:\n\nIn a combination of Tagalog and English, the caption in the original Facebook post states: \u201c8 DAYS TO GO! VOTE EIGHT STRAIGHT (MATHGRAD), MY LOVES! FIGHT! \u201d\n\nIn the photo, the text on the poster translates to English as: \u201cVOTE STRAIGHT OTSODiRETSO (MATH GRAD). Makalintal. Alejano. Tanada. Hilbay. Gutoc. Roxas. Aquino. Diokno. Let\u2019s bring Straight Eight to the Senate. FIGHT!\u201d\n\n\u201cMath grad\u201d refers to the phrase which is composed from putting together the first letter of the names of the candidates listed on the sign.\n\nThe same group of candidates are listed in the same order on the Osto Diretso website here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the candidates:", "lang": "en"}
