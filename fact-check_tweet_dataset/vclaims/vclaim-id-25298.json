Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: Brother and sister from Itaunja in UP were beaten by a group of Muslims when the brother stopped the Muslims from raping his sister. Fact: The siblings were beaten by a group of people but it is not a case of attempt to rape. According to the Lucknow Police, a street fight led to assault on the siblings. Also, there is no communal angle attached to this incident as both the assaulters and victims are Muslims. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news regarding this issue on Google, it was found that the Lucknow Police has tweeted on this issue. According to the tweet of the Lucknow Police, a scuffle between children playing in front of a house escalated when parties from both sides got involved in the fight. In the fight, a group of people (Usman, Shakeel, Yunus, and Islam) assaulted the siblings (Shah Rukh and Shabnam), who can be seen bleeding in the video. A case has been filed by the siblings at the Itaunja Police Station.\n\nAccording to the tweet of the Lucknow Police, the fight did not start when the brother stopped the assaulter from raping his sister. It is a street fight which got escalated. The cases under which the assaulter were booked can be seen in the tweet (IPC Sections 308, 323, 504, 506). The information on the entire episode can be read in the Dainik Jagran article on this issue.\n\nSome of the posts on Facebook had a description that they will support all the Hindu brothers and sisters implying that the victims are Hindus. The description mentions the names and religion of the assaulters but does not mention the details of the victims to attach a communal angle to the incident. As all of them (assaulter and victims) are Muslims and hence there is no communal angle attached to the incident.\n\nThe Lucknow Police have also tweeted the photos of the arrest of four assaulters.\n\nTo sum it up, a scuffle between children turned into a fight between the two sides. There is no communal angle to the incident.\n\nDid you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
