One appears to show an explosion.\n\n\"Approximately half an hour ago Iran attacked US Base in Iraq,\" the page wrote in its caption.\n\nThe images were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) They have been shared more than 15,000 times.\n\nThe photos don\u2019t show the missiles that hit the Al Asad and Erbil bases in Iraq on Jan. 7. Using reverse image searches, we traced the images to three old missile strikes by Iran and Israel.\n\nThe top photo depicts an Oct. 1, 2018, strike by Iran against the Islamic State in Syria. Its source is the Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nThe photo on the bottom-left of the Facebook post shows a June 18, 2017, attack by Iran also against the Islamic State in Syria. It\u2019s a handout that Iran\u2019s state TV gave the European Pressphoto Agency.\n\nThe photo on the bottom-right of the Facebook post depicts the impact of a Nov. 15, 2019, Israeli missile strike in the Gaza Strip. Its source is the AFP.\n\nBelow is footage that Iran has released from its Jan. 7 strike in Iraq. There were no reported casualties.\n\nThe Facebook posts are inaccurate. We rate them False.", "lang": "en"}
