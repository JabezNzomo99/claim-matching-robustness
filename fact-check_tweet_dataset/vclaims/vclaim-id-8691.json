But his reasons for his decision did not square with the facts:\n\u2022 Trump said \u201cthere was nothing to investigate,\u201d because the FBI \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything\u201d about the location, time and years of the accusations against Kavanaugh. That\u2019s not true. Christine Blasey Ford, for example, provided an approximate time and location of the alleged attack and the names of four people who were at the party.\n\u2022 Trump also said such allegations are \u201cnot for the FBI\u201d to investigate, inaccurately quoting former Sen. Joe Biden as saying of the FBI, \u201cThey don\u2019t do this.\u201d Actually, Biden, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, and the Bush administration agreed to refer a sexual harassment allegation against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas to the FBI.\n\nTrump made his remarks on the eve of dueling testimony by Kavanaugh and Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe president, who was wrapping up a visit to the United Nations, was asked numerous questions about accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh while he was in high school and college. Three women have made separate accusations \u2014 including Ford, who has told the committee that Kavanaugh \u201cphysically and sexually assaulted\u201d her in high school in the early 1980s.\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange that Trump had at the press conference:\n\nReporter, Sept. 26: Mr. President, thank you very much. Of course, what you\u2019re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh before the Judiciary Committee. In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas\u2019s background investigation \u2014 not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation. When these allegations were raised, why didn\u2019t this White House do the same thing? And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other? Trump: Well, the FBI told us they\u2019ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn\u2019t know the location. They didn\u2019t know the time. They didn\u2019t know the year. They didn\u2019t know anything. And it\u2019s like, where do you go? Also, it\u2019s not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, \u201cThey don\u2019t do this.\u201d And he said it very clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the president\u2019s claim that there was nothing for the FBI to investigate.\n\nThe president said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the location. They didn\u2019t know the time. They didn\u2019t know the year. They didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d That is not true in Ford\u2019s case.\n\nOf the three accusers, Ford has given the most detailed account of her allegations.\n\nIn a July 30 letter to the Sen. Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said the alleged attack occurred in a \u201csuburban Maryland area home\u201d in the \u201cearly 1980s\u201d when both Kavanaugh and Ford were in high school. She told the Washington Post in a Sept. 16 article that it occurred in the summer of 1982 at a house in Montgomery County, not far from the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase.\n\nIn an update to the Senate judiciary investigation posted on Sept. 23, the committee states that it \u201clearned the identities of the four other individuals Dr. Ford claimed were at the party when the incident took place.\u201d The committee identified them as Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser.\n\nAll this is more than enough information for the FBI to reopen its background investigation of Kavanaugh \u2014 if directed to do so by the president.\n\nThat is exactly what happened in the fall of 1991, when Anita Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment when the two worked together at the Education Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the early 1980s.\n\nTrump made reference to that case when he inaccurately quoted Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Thomas confirmation hearings.\n\nThe Thomas confirmation hearings began on Sept. 10, 1991, and continued through Sept. 20, 1991, without any public knowledge of Hill\u2019s accusations. NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg broke the story when she interviewed Hill for an Oct. 6, 1991, broadcast.\n\nIn her report, Totenberg included a statement from the White House saying it learned of the accusations on Sept. 23, 1991.\n\nBiden and his staff, as Totenberg\u2019s report mentioned, came under criticism at the time for what some perceived as a slow response to Hill\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201cBy the time Clarence Thomas was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee the week of September 10, Hill had contacted the staff of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman, Joseph Biden. She says that while Biden\u2019s staff seemed interested, it was not until 10 days later, after repeated calls from her, that she was interviewed by the FBI,\u201d Totenberg said in her Oct. 6, 1991, report.\n\nIn an Oct. 8, 1991, floor speech, Biden said that it wasn\u2019t until after the Sept. 20, 1991, hearing that he was able to get Hill\u2019s permission to have the FBI investigate her allegations.\n\nSetting aside Biden\u2019s response time, there is no doubt that the committee chairman at the time was involved in the decision to refer Hill\u2019s charges to the FBI.\n\nOn Oct. 5, 1991, the White House issued a statement that said the White House and committee jointly agreed to direct the FBI to conduct a \u201cfull, thorough and expeditious investigation,\u201d according to an Oct. 6, 1991, story in Newsday (available on Nexis).\n\nWhat Biden Actually Said\n\nAlso, Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican, defended the committee chairman, Biden, and the committee members in an Oct. 8, 1991, floor speech. Simpson called criticism that the committee did not take Hill\u2019s charges seriously \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cwholly without foundation.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Biden gave a fiery defense of his actions when the confirmation hearings resumed on Oct. 11, 1991. Some Republicans, including current Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, have referred to Biden\u2019s remarks that day as justification for not referring the accusations against Kavanaugh to the FBI. Trump did, too, but he misquoted Biden in doing so.\n\nIn answering the question about why he did not refer the allegations to the FBI, Trump said, \u201cAlso, it\u2019s not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, \u2018They don\u2019t do this.\u2019 And he said it very clearly.\u201d\n\nThat is not what Biden said.\n\nIn remarks directed at \u201cmy pontificating colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike,\u201d Biden said it\u2019s not the FBI\u2019s job to draw conclusions or make recommendations to the committee. The FBI turns over its material to the committee for its consideration, Biden said.\n\nBiden, Oct. 11, 1991: And the last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn\u2019t understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case reach a conclusion, period, period. So, Judge, there is no reason why you should know this. The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say he said, she said, and they said, period. So when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions. They do not make, as my friend points out more accurately, they do not make recommendations.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Biden said that \u201cno one has proved a pattern\u201d of sexual harassment against Thomas. \u201cIf there is not a pattern, to me that is probative. That has some dispositive weight. No one has proved a pattern here of anything. We are not finished yet. But no one has proved a pattern,\u201d he said.\n\nA deadlocked Senate Judiciary Committee moved Thomas\u2019 nomination without recommendation to the full Senate for a vote. In the final floor vote, Biden voted against Thomas, who was approved 52 to 48.", "lang": "en"}
