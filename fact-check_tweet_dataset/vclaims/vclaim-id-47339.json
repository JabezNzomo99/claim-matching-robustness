The claims are false; vaccine candidates go through three phases of clinical trials, are carefully monitored for adverse effects, and multiple doctors told AFP vaccines are safe.\n\n\u201cDr. Judy Mikovits explains why the Covid vaccine may kill 50 million Americans this fall,\u201d reads the text over a thumbnail of a video shared on YouTube and on Facebook in Canada and the US.\n\nIn it, Mikovits claims: \u201cIf they were successful in mandating it (a COVID-19 vaccine) for everyone, at least 50 million Americans would die, probably from the first dose.\u201d\n\nThe full interview from May 8, 2020 with Christina Aguayo of America\u2019s Voice, an online network, was removed from YouTube for violating the platform\u2019s community guidelines, but AFP Fact Check found this short clip which remains easy to download and reshare.\n\nMikovits gained widespread attention in 2009 with a seemingly breakthrough study on chronic fatigue syndrome. The paper was later retracted when the findings could not be replicated.\n\nShe was also briefly jailed on charges of theft from the laboratory that performed the ill-fated study.\n\nMikovits\u2019s false claims about the novel coronavirus first went viral in May 2020 with the release of a video called \u201cPlandemic.\u201d Social media platforms struggled to fully remove the 26-minute film, after it was found to contain harmful misinformation. AFP fact-checked \u201cPlandemic\u201d here.\n\nThis subsequent interview made three separate false claims which are investigated here.\n\nGretchen Snoeyenbos Newman, assistant professor of infectious disease at Wayne State University, called this claim \u201ca wild assertion without basis and without any data to support it.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearchers who specialize in studying and developing vaccines, their first consideration is always safety,\u201d she said.\n\nAFP has reported that there are more than 100 vaccine candidates for COVID-19, including from researchers in Canada and the US.\n\nThe possible vaccines are first tested in labs and then on animals. Successful candidates can then move on to three phases of clinical trials.\n\nEmily Smith, an epidemiologist who is an expert in designing clinical trials, said: \u201cThe first phases of vaccine development are focused entirely on safety and people are not taking shortcuts here.\u201d\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website explains: \u201cDuring Phase I, small groups of people receive the trial vaccine. In Phase II, the clinical study is expanded and vaccine is given to people who have characteristics (such as age and physical health) similar to those for whom the new vaccine is intended. In Phase III, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety.\u201d\n\nSmith, an assistant professor of public health at George Washington University, said: \u201cWe insist on safety and this is a process that we always use.\u201d\n\nAlthough scientists are racing to provide a safe and effective vaccine to put an end to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Smith said the process is not being sped up in the clinical trials.\n\n\u201cThe part where we\u2019re catching up on time is largely related to the manufacture of vaccines,\u201d she explained.\n\nTara C Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, agreed.\n\n\u201cEven with an \u2018accelerated\u2019 timeline, rigorous testing for safety and efficacy is still being conducted,\u201d she told AFP by email.\n\nClaim: \u201cNobody should get a vaccine of any kind if they want to be healthy.\u201d FALSE\n\nSnoeyenbos Newman called vaccines \u201cthe safest public health intervention that we do,\u201d adding that they had \u201cradically changed our relationship with infectious disease.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that the measles vaccine alone has saved 17.1 million lives since the year 2000.\n\nSnoeyenbos Newman, noting her parents\u2019 generation was the first to be protected from annual poliovirus outbreaks, said: \u201cBefore we had vaccines, epidemic and pandemic disease was a regular part of our lives.\u201d\n\nShe credited successful vaccination campaigns for Americans living without the fear seasonal infectious disease, but noted this has changed with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cCoronavirus is really for us a demonstration of what a vaccine-free world looks like.\u201d\n\nClaim: A five-year moratorium on all vaccines is necessary for safety testing. FALSE\n\nBoth Kent State\u2019s Smith and Wayne State\u2019s Snoeyenbos Newman said this is false.\n\nSmith explained: \u201cAll vaccines that are currently in use have an extensive history of testing for safety, some dating back many decades (such as measles and polio which were developed in the middle of the 20th century).\n\n\u201cVaccines are one of the safest pharmaceutical products out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of a blanket moratorium on vaccine development is not only without basis in any sort of scientific consensus, or political consensus, but also incredibly dangerous to the millions of people around the world who are infected by infectious diseases for which we are currently developing vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth Canada's Biologic and Radiopharmaceutical Drugs Directorate reviews the safety and efficacy of all vaccines before they are released to the public. To obtain authorization companies must prove, \u201cthe benefits of the vaccine outweigh any identified risks.\u201d\n\nIn the US, this process is overseen by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAfter the vaccines are approved for wide use, they are carefully monitored.\n\nCanada and the US require reporting of all adverse events following immunization. The most recent report from Canada is available here. Data from the US can be downloaded here.\n\nGeorge Washington University\u2019s Smith said: \u201cEven a single side effect, when it comes to vaccines, are carefully monitored.\u201d\n\nThis CDC graphic explains the process for maintaining vaccine safety in the US, assuring patients that vaccine recommendations may change if safety monitoring reveals new information on vaccine risks.\n\nVaccines are a regular source of misinformation. AFP Fact Check has investigated misleading posts about the use of potassium chloride in vaccines, the ingredients of the flu shot, as well as numerous claims about high profile advocates of vaccination, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
