The claim is false; the video has circulated online since February 2019 in reports about a protest by health sector workers over non-payment of their salaries.\n\nThe 1:48 seconds video was published in this Facebook post on August 12, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 12,000 times.\n\nThe post's caption says: \"The situation in Jammu and Kashmir today on Eid al-Adha. Pray for Kashmir .. Kashmir is bleeding.. Or may Allah destroy these unjust people and drown them?\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe video has been shared elsewhere on Facebook here and here, and here on Twitter with the same claim.\n\nBut the claim is false; the video actually shows a protest by health department employees in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar over non-payment of their salaries in February 2019.\n\nA Google reverse image search using keyframes from the video led to a video published here on the YouTube channel of local media outlet Jammu and Kashmir News Observer on February 12, 2019.\n\nThe video in the misleading footage matches the February 2019 YouTube video from 0:09 to 1:57.\n\nThe video description says: \u201cThe Jammu and Kashmir police on Tuesday foiled the protest rally of National Health Mission Employees who tried to march towards Polo View in Srinagar. The employees are on strike for the last 27 days demanding regularisation of their services.\u201d\n\nBelow are screenshots of the video from the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video of the February 2019 protest (R):\n\nAnother video of the rally was published here on the YouTube channel of a local Urdu language media outlet on February 12, 2019.\n\nMultiple other media outlets also reported on the protests, for example here and here.", "lang": "en"}
