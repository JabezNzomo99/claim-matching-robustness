Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasn\u2019t an accident.\n\nWe already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered. Now, we\u2019re looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryant\u2019s death was planned.\n\n\"After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobe\u2019s personal helicopter crashes only a day later,\" the Jan. 26 post says. \"LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBA\u2019s 3rd highest scorer in history. The \u201833\u2019 is significant. The \u20186\u2019 is significant. And I\u2019ve been speaking on the importance of the \u201844\u2019 ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl.\"\n\nIt goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryant\u2019s birthday, before concluding: \"This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOn Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryant\u2019s all-time scoring record. Playing against the Philadelphia 76ers that day, James finished with 29 points, bringing his career total to 33,655, according to the Washington Post. Bryant finished his career with 33,643.\n\nBryant tweeted his congratulations that night: \"Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims.\n\nRather, Bryant\u2019s plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopter\u2019s manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post. The investigation will look at weather data, radar information air traffic control communications, maintenance logs and the pilot\u2019s record.\n\nWe rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
