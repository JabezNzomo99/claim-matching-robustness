But are you ready? Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s a first. But Saudi Arabia \u2014 and other countries, too, now \u2014 but Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing to help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the president said, \u2018Well, the reason I\u2019m taking the troops out of Syria is because I promised them at campaign to bring the troops home.\u2019 My question to him was, \u2018Is Saudi Arabia home? Is Saudi Arabia home? Why are our troops going to Saudi Arabia if you promised to bring them home?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, the Saudi Arabians are paying for it.\u2019 Really, we\u2019re putting our troops in harm\u2019s way for Saudi Arabia because they\u2019re paying \u2014 it just didn\u2019t add up.\u201d\n\nThe administration announced Oct. 11 that it was sending to Saudi Arabia an additional 3,000 troops, along with about four dozen Air Force fighters and Patriot antimissile batteries, in response to attacks on Saudi oil facilities that U.S. officials blame on Iran. \u201cThe United States is raising the costs of Iran\u2019s revolutionary adventures while increasing incentives for pragmatism to prevail,\u201d said Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran.\n\nWhat caught our attention is that the president claims that Saudi Arabia will pay all of the costs \u2014 \u201c100 percent\u201d \u2014 of the deployment, including \u201cthe cost of our soldiers.\u201d Some critics have charged that Trump is turning U.S. troops into mercenaries, available to the highest bidder. Since the president has a long history of inflating what he has supposedly negotiated from Saudi Arabia, we thought we would investigate.\n\n\u201cWhen the military first moved to Prince Sultan Air Base in 1996 after Khobar, I helped negotiate the deal,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official who is now at the Brookings Institution, referring to the Khobar Towers bombing. \u201cThe Saudis agreed to pay for building barracks and other infrastructure for the base, which was their property of course, but made the necessary accommodation suitable for the U.S. Air Force, RAF [Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force] and French aircrews. They did not reimburse any expenses.\u201d\n\nAnthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \u201cThere is no formal definition of \u2018burden-sharing,\u2019 and it can include providing facilities and services to the U.S. for free or at a discount, buying arms, barter deals, and direct or indirect cash transfers. There also is no standard reporting or audit requirement, and some programs are classified. Accordingly, the president can say just about anything \u2014 as he does in exaggerating U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that the Saudi government paid for a large part of U.S. operations in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War. \u201cIt also often pays late but sometimes pays in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also may be so concerned about the increasing tendency of the U.S. to withdraw or fail to act that it will try to lock down U.S. support by paying some form of bonus.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Oct. 22: Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper visited Prince Sultan Air Base and told reporters the Saudis were engaged in \u201cburden-sharing.\u201d He described that as \u201csomething that we expect of all of our partners and allies, whether it\u2019s Asia or Europe, is to help share the cost, share the burden of either housing, hosting our troops on their land or supporting them in deployments, whatever the case may be.\u201d\n\nAfter years of listening to Trump, we suspect that there may be some truth here but that it\u2019s highly exaggerated. It\u2019s certainly fishy that no one in the administration appears willing to explain what, if anything, has been negotiated. And we certainly can\u2019t accept it on the basis of the president\u2019s rhetoric, which has proved so wrong about his deals with Saudi Arabia in the past.", "lang": "en"}
