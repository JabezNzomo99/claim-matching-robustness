In justifying the move, Putin said that residents of these \u201crepublics\u201d were \u201cgenerally deprived of any civil rights.\u201d\n\nPutin did not mention his own government\u2019s culpability in creating the deadly conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has resulted in the human rights problems to which he referred.The territories the Russian president referred to have not been under Ukrainian government control since the spring of 2014, when Russia used military force to establish the so-called \u201crepublics\u201d in Donetsk and Luhansk. Polygraph.info has documented how Russia initiated the war in 2014 and, according to international authorities, continues to exercise control over part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas.\n\nThere have been human rights complaints on the Ukrainian government-controlled side, but these mainly concern the issue of requiring pensioners to move to government-controlled territory in order to receive their pensions -- a side effect of cutting the occupied-territories off from the banking system. Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that even Ukrainian courts had found these rules to be \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d but that authorities refused to comply with their rulings on the matter.\n\nHowever, Putin could not reasonably claim pensions as a reason for his action on Russian passports, because Russia\u2019s Pension Fund later announced that recipients of these passports would not be eligible to collect any pensions unless they permanently relocated to Russia.\n\nThe day after signing the law, Putin was asked about it during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Vladivostok. He told reporters that the measure wasn\u2019t designed to \u201cprovoke anyone,\u201d and pointed out that countries such as Hungary and Romania had also given out passports to people of their respective nationalities living outside their borders. According to Putin, no one had a \u201cnegative reaction\u201d to these cases. There are several problems with this defense, however.\n\nFirst of all, some countries reacted negatively to the actions Putin cited.For example, last October, Ukraine expelled a Hungarian consul for giving out Hungarian passports. Secondly, Russia has a history of distributing passports to citizens of other countries for geopolitical ends. The most commonly-cited example involved the two breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2008, then-President Dmitry Medvedev partly used defense of Russian citizens to justify going to war with Georgia. Thus, there is a fear that Putin will use \u201cpassportization\u201d in Donbas as a pretext for open military intervention there and possibly in other parts of Ukraine.\n\nAnother question about Putin\u2019s claim is that neither the new legislation, nor the Russian law on citizenship to which it refers, mention Russian ethnicity, or any ethnic group at all. The Russian government\u2019s official position is that the territories of the so-called \u201cDonetsk and Luhansk\u201d people\u2019s republics are in fact Ukrainian territory, that the conflict is a \u201ccivil war\u201d or internal matter for Ukraine, and that Russia, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is not a party to the conflict. These contradictory positions beg the question of to whom exactly Putin would be granting passports, and for what reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that a Russian passport is no guarantee of basic civil rights. In the World Report 2019, published this past January, HRW found grave violations in Russia, ranging from torture in the prison system to crackdowns on freedom of speech and religion. Polygraph.info has covered the persecution in Russia of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, whose church is banned, as well as restrictions on freedom of speech. Recently, a Russian citizen was fined for insulting Putin online. Taking this into account, it is at best misleading to offer Russian passports to residents of these Russian-controlled \u201crepublics\u201d in Ukraine as a guarantee their human rights.", "lang": "en"}
