But the screenshot apparently was a joke.\n\nAlthough Biden\u2019s actual interview covered a range of topics, from race to the controversy over Ukraine to climate change, it did not breach the topic of corn dogs or corn dog sticks. The same Twitter user who posted the corn dog tweet was behind another hoax in 2019 that led many to believe that Twitter users would receive a notification if someone sent their tweet in a direct message.\n\nThe quote above was not a part of the Times interview \u2014 we found no evidence that it\u2019s real in any context. Yet some social media users shared it in earnest, perhaps because it included a question from \u201cKK,\u201d the initials of Times\u2019 Deputy Editorial Page Editor Kathleen Kingsbury, who led the real interview. The credulous reaction by some also could be explained by the fact that Biden has a bit of a reputation for meandering commentary.", "lang": "en"}
