Gretchen Whitmer, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, cheer, hug and hold hands all while flanked by rows of people holding their phones up to capture the moment.\n\n\"Last night at the DNC!! Hypocrites! Can we get back to living now???\" one person who shared the image wrote.\n\n\"Mask?\" another poster wrote. \"Only you SHEEP need masks! No 6ft distance or masks here! They all must be immune to covid!\"\n\n\"Not a mask in sight, Governor,\" wrote another person who shared the images. \"Tell me again why you are trying to force Michigan to wear one.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There were only 34 confirmed cases in the United States at that point.\n\nOn March 2, the U.S. surgeon general asks people not to stockpile masks.\n\nOn March 10, the state\u2019s department of health and human services identified the first two presumptive-positive COVID-19 cases in Michigan. Whitmer declared an emergency.\n\nOn March 12, Whitmer ordered the state\u2019s schools to close for three weeks.\n\nOn March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. Whitmer issued a press release that day about a temporary ban on large gatherings and urged people to stay 5 feet away from each other in public settings.\n\nOn March 16, Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, theaters and casinos to close, and she restricted gatherings to less than 50 people.\n\nOn April 24, more than a month after Biden\u2019s campaign rally, Whitmer signed an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces.\n\nThis Facebook post, though, suggests that the politicians in the photos are flouting the restrictions that the state has imposed on residents to try to stop the spread of COVID-19. In reality, the rally happened before such limitations existed.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Sen. Cory Booker is from New Jersey.
