In the video, Modi is seen sitting on a sofa, while some people are taking his body measurements and clicking his pictures. The post is attributed to a Right to Information (RTI) reply.\n\nThe post by Facebook user Alok Tewari was shared more than 16,000 times.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is of March 2016. At that time, a team from London's Madame Tussauds museum had visited the PM's residence to take his body measurement for his wax statue. We couldn't find any RTI reply which reveals charges by Modi's beautician.\n\nAmong others, the video was put up by the official Facebook page of Gurugram Congress, which again was shared by more than 2,000 users.\n\nAFWA found that the extended version of this video was uploaded on the YouTube channel of Madame Tussauds.\n\nThe viral posts attributed the claim to an RTI reply. But even after thorough scanning, we couldn't find any RTI reply or news report which says that Modi's beautician charges Rs 80 lakh per month.\n\nWe, however, found an RTI reply which discussed Modi's wardrobe expenses. This report says that the PM bears his wardrobe expenses.\n\nThe misleading post also went viral in October last year. Boomlive and other fact checkers had debunked the fake news at that time.", "lang": "en"}
