It originated from a satirical website.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to know the quote is fabricated by looking at the headline on Facebook, which reads:\n\n\"John Elway Lays Down The Law: \u2018Kneel On My Field And You\u2019re Fired On The Spot\u2019\"\n\nOther websites, such as Prep-101.com and Conservative Republic, copied and pasted the fabricated story without a disclaimer that it was made up.\n\nPeople commenting on those pages also seemed to have no idea that the story wasn\u2019t real.\n\nOne person wrote: \"Way to go John Elway for standing up for the flag national anthem if they don\u2019t want to stand fire them on the spot way to go to John Elway every team should do that.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Haven\u2019t watched NFL since this kneeling started and nothing was done about it. Thank you MR. Elway wish more would do this.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe story originated on a satirical website called \"PotatriotsUnite.com,\" which states on its \"about us\" page that it\u2019s part of the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense network of satire sites and says everything on its website \"is fiction.\"\n\nWhile Elway said in 2017 that he believed in standing for the national anthem, he posted a statement on Twitter on June 5, 2020, saying he felt it was time to join this \"important conversation,\" following the death of George Floyd and the worldwide protests against police brutality.\n\n\"The way the players amplify the voices that need to be heard is more important than ever,\" Elway wrote. \"I fully support them using their platform and influence in a positive way to create change.\"\n\nThat was the same day NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a video message that the league would embrace the rights of players to protest racism peacefully.\n\nElway never said that he would fire players if they kneeled during the anthem.
