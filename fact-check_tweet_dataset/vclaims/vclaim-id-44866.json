The image was taken from a thumbnail for a video on the conservative website the Daily Wire and shared as if real.\n\nThere have been many images \u2014 some old, others old and manipulated \u2014 used to push misinformation about the protests against police brutality and racial injustice that have erupted across the country.\n\nIn the latest example, a meme on Facebook and Instagram is spreading an image purportedly showing the Lincoln Memorial, specifically the Lincoln statue, blanketed in graffiti. Among the messages visible in the image are \u201cBLACK + BROWN LIVES MATTER\u201d and the hashtag \u201c#BLM.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lincoln Memorial,\u201d the meme reads. \u201cHis head damaged and Defaced.\u201d It further claims \u201c[t]he Media is trying to hide this picture from you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The photo was deliberately doctored and the vandalism in question didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThat photo is a hoax,\u201d Mike Litterst, a spokesman for National Mall and Memorial Parks, a part of the National Park Service, told us in an email.\n\nWe traced the photo back to the conservative website the Daily Wire, where \u201cThe Michael Knowles Show\u201d used it as a cover image for the video of its June 4 episode.\n\nAmong other targets, the episode railed against the recent protests and was titled \u201cWith Malice Toward All\u201d \u2014 a play on President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural address, which contained a line beginning, \u201cWith malice toward none, with charity for all.\u201d (Knowles \u2014 beginning at 27:40 \u2014 reads the line and accuses the \u201cleft in America today\u201d of having \u201ccompletely reversed it.\u201d)\n\nKnowles confirmed in an email to us that the image was created for his show.\n\n\u201cThe image you\u2019re referencing did indeed come from the artists who create the thumbnail images for my show. Every day, my show is uploaded to our channel with artistic images, usually of the comedic or outrageous variety,\u201d Knowles said. He cited other examples of such images, including a \u201cmuscular, shirtless President Trump as Hercules wrestling a bull.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would seem the drawing of a ridiculously defaced Abraham Lincoln statue, partially beheaded, was taken by someone on the Internet, cropped, stripped of the context of our show, and passed off as real,\u201d Knowles added.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously explained, National Mall and Memorial Parks did show in a May 31 tweet three instances of vandalism that occurred during protests the night before \u2014 including vandalism at the base of the Lincoln Memorial. It was nowhere near the Lincoln statue, and the spray paint only read, \u201cYall not tired yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only graffiti at the Lincoln Memorial was at the bottom of the steps at street level, far away from the statue (and it has been removed already),\u201d Litterst said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Daily Wire. 4 Jun 2020.\n\nNational Mall and Memorial Parks (@NationalMallNPS). \u201cIn the wake of last night\u2019s demonstrations, there are numerous instances of vandalism to sites around the National Mall. For generations the Mall has been our nation\u2019s premier civic gathering space for non-violent demonstrations, and we ask individuals to carry on that tradition.\u201d Twitter. 31 May 2020.", "lang": "en"}
