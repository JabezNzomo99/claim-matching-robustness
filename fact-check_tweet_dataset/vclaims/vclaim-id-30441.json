Trump claimed Ossoff \u201cwill raise your taxes,\u201d but we could find no evidence of Ossoff proposing any broad-based tax increases, such as an income tax hike.\n\nWe don\u2019t typically fact-check claims on Election Day, but in this case Trump sent out the tweets on the morning of the April 18 election.\n\nIn an election that some view as an early report card on the Trump presidency, polls showed Ossoff leading all candidates in the race for Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, a special election to replace Republican Tom Price, who was tapped by Trump to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThere are five Democrats, 11 Republicans and two independents running in what is known as a \u201cjungle primary.\u201d If one candidate does not achieve 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will square off in a runoff election on June 20. Trump has recorded robocalls for Republicans in an effort to deny Ossoff from obtaining 50 percent (it is unlikely Ossoff will reach that threshold, according to FiveThirtyEight.com).\n\nWe asked the White House press office what support it has for Trump\u2019s claim that Ossoff \u201cwants higher taxes,\u201d but we did not hear back.\n\nOssoff\u2019s campaign website makes little mention of taxes, saying only that he \u201cwill work in Congress to reduce the tax burden on small businesses and simplify small business tax filing.\u201d\n\nIn a written Q&A with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the paper asked what changes candidates would make to the tax system, and Ossoff said he would seek to simplify the tax code, and that \u201cin order to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.\u201d\n\nOssoff, April 17: A country reveals a lot about its character by the tough choices it makes to balance the books. Any reform to the tax code should include aggressive simplification to ease compliance and improve profitability and competitiveness of American enterprise. The benefits of tax reform should not only flow to the largest organizations that have extraordinary access to congressional committees, but also to small and medium-size businesses and new ventures that have more difficulty raising capital, developing products, and competing with established firms. And in order to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.\n\nWhen addressing health care, Ossoff also told the newspaper that he favors \u201csmall business tax credits\u201d and would repeal the medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOssoff\u2019s campaign also provided to us supplemental answers Ossoff gave to the Brand Bank Forum, in which he talked about cutting some $500 billion in federal spending to \u201creduce the tax burden on middle-class families and small businesses, and simplify small business tax filing.\u201d\n\nWe could find no evidence of Ossoff proposing any broad-based tax hikes, such as Trump suggested.\n\nIn addition to the White House press office, we also reached out to the conservative Club for Growth \u2014 which has been active in the race \u2014 as well as the Republican Party of Georgia, to find out what taxes Ossoff planned to hike, but we did not hear back. We will update this item if we do.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement that Ossoff is \u201cvery weak\u201d on immigration is a matter of opinion.\n\nFor the record, Ossoff has said he supports a comprehensive immigration bill that would strengthen enforcement along the southern border and provide a \u201cpath to legal status\u201d for some of the 11 million immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally. That generally has been the position of most Democrats in Congress and some prominent Republicans \u2014 including President George W. Bush and the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain.\n\n\u201cAmerica needs a strong border policy that protects American citizens and American jobs,\u201d Ossoff says on his website. \u201cWe should welcome those strivers who, like our own forebears, seek the opportunity to work hard, play by the rules, and build better lives in America.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, Ossoff addressed his views on illegal immigration.\n\nSuch a plan would result in some people who now live in the U.S. illegally to remain here legally, but it would not \u201callow illegal immigration,\u201d as Trump had said about Ossoff in an earlier tweet.", "lang": "en"}
