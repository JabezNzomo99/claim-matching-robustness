No, that's not true, illegal imigrants will not be getting insurance with this money because it won't be taken away in the first place. The claim is fake news spread via an image posted on a Facebook page specifically designed to upset and troll conservatives and Trump supporters.\n\nAn image of former President Obama with following text superimposed was posted to a Facebook page named \"America - Love It Or Leave It\":\n\nThe post was published on April 14, 2018 (archived here) with no extra text to accompany the image.\n\nHowever the Facebook page that posted it has following description in its about tab:\n\nShould you doubt that, you can read the full text of the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act here, since that is the full name of what is commonly refered to as Obamacare. We weren't able to locate any article 54 but the entire act does not even contain the word \"undocumented\" anyway as far as we were able to determine.\n\nThe Facebook page in question belongs to a network of Facebook pages and websites that troll conservatives and Republicans under the guise of satire. The owner and main writer of the network of sites is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, thelastlineofdefense.online and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
