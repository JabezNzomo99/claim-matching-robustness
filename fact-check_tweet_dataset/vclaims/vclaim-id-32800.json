The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said a vaccine at best won\u2019t be ready for \u201ca year to a year-and-a-half\u201d and won\u2019t be available for the current epidemic.\n\u2022 So far, the fatality rate for COVID-19 has been about 2-3%, higher than the influenza fatality rate in the United States of about 0.1%. But in talking about those rates, the president made confusing remarks that left a false impression that \u201cthe flu is much higher\u201d than the coronavirus rate.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, falsely claimed this week that the influenza fatality rate was \u201cright around 2% as well.\u201d It\u2019s not.\n\u2022 In making a comparison to a past outbreak, the president correctly noted that Ebola is far more deadly than the novel coronavirus. But he neglected to mention that Ebola can only be transmitted via bodily fluids and is harder to catch.\n\nThe president made these claims in a Feb. 26 press conference, in which he said Vice President Mike Pence would lead the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Wolf and Kudlow, who is now a member of the administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, spoke earlier this week.\n\nThe outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year. It has now sickened more than 82,000 people and killed more than 2,800. The virus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, is fairly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus but is a new pathogen. See our Q&A on the virus for more information.\n\nTrump repeatedly downplayed the potential for more COVID-19 cases in the U.S., and even suggested, falsely, that the number of American cases would fall.\n\nReferencing the 15 known cases detected in the U.S. at the time of the press conference \u2014 a tally that does not include an additional 45 repatriation cases \u2014 Trump said, \u201cthe 15, within a couple of days, is going to be down to close to zero. That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nLater, after being asked about the CDC\u2019s recommendation for schools and other institutions to dust off their preparedness plans, Trump again suggested that the case total was in decline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we\u2019re going down, not up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going very substantially down, not up.\u201d\n\nTrump is likely thinking of people with COVID-19 getting better, thereby dropping the total, but that\u2019s not how the CDC counts cases. The CDC reports cases cumulatively, and does not subtract cases if a person recovers, so the case count will never be zero.\n\nMore important, public health officials had been saying for days, including during the same press conference, to expect more American cases.\n\n\u201cOur aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, speaking minutes before Trump referred to a falling number of cases. \u201cHowever, we do expect more cases, and this is a good time to prepare.\u201d\n\nThe day before, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, also said in a telebriefing that the agency fully anticipated seeing community spread of the virus within U.S. borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore,\u201d she said, \u201cbut rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, conveyed different odds of that possibility in the press conference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d he said in response to a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cIt probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared.\u201d\n\nIn the telebriefing, Messonnier noted that while the agency has been planning for a respiratory illness similar to COVID-19 for years, and is better prepared than two decades ago, \u201cwe are never going to ever be able to be so completely prepared that we\u2019re prepared for any inevitability.\u201d\n\nLess than an hour after the press conference concluded, the CDC announced that the 15th case the president mentioned may be the first case of community spread in the U.S. The patient, a woman who is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, had not traveled to an area with a known outbreak, nor did she have contact with anyone known to be infected.\n\nOthers in Trump\u2019s circle have previously oversold the effectiveness of U.S. efforts at containment. In a Feb. 25 CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said, \u201cWe have contained this. I won\u2019t say [it\u2019s] airtight, but it\u2019s pretty close to airtight.\u201d\n\nShortly before his comments, Messonnier had given the telebriefing in which she said the agency expected the novel coronavirus to spread within the U.S. She had also been warning about that possibility for weeks, calling it \u201clikely\u201d as early as Feb. 12, despite relatively few cases.\n\nWhile Kudlow may have been looking at the number of cases and the fact that there hadn\u2019t yet been demonstrated community spread in the U.S., it was misleading for him to suggest that containment had already occurred or was \u201cclose to airtight.\u201d\n\nIn addition to minimizing the threat COVID-19 poses in the U.S., Trump left the misleading impression that a vaccine will soon be available. He said the U.S. is \u201cfairly rapidly\u201d developing a vaccine, and will have it ready \u201cin a fairly quick manner.\u201d\n\nLater in the press conference, he returned to the development of a vaccine.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t say how quickly, but Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it will take \u201ca year to a year-and-a-half\u201d to develop a vaccine and that hopefully one would be ready if the coronavirus reemerges next year.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year,\u201d Fauci said at the president\u2019s press conference. \u201cHowever, if this virus, which we have every reason to believe it is quite conceivable that it will happen, will go beyond just a season and come back and recycle next year. If that\u2019s the case, we hope to have a vaccine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U.S. is working quickly on developing a vaccine. \u201cWe have a number of vaccine candidates and one prototype,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal, the drugmaker Moderna Inc. sent a potential vaccine to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for initial testing, which hopefully would occur within about two months.\n\n\u201cThe institute expects by the end of April to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers, testing whether two doses of the shot are safe and induce an immune response likely to protect against infection, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said in an interview,\u201d the Journal reported on Feb. 24. \u201cInitial results could become available in July or August.\u201d\n\nThe next day, at a press conference, Fauci said the prototype is going through the regulatory process and could be in a human trial within a month to a month and a half \u2014 if there are no unexpected glitches. But the \u201cphase one trial\u201d is just the first step in a process that even at \u201crocket speed\u201d will take a year to a year-and-a-half to result in a vaccine.\n\nAt the president\u2019s press conference, Fauci went through a similar time frame for how long it could take if everything goes right.\n\n\u201cSo, although this is the fastest we have ever gone, from a sequence of a virus to a trial it still will not be any applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year-and-a-half,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cNow, that means two things. One, the answer to containing is public health measures. We can\u2019t rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year. However, if this virus, which we have every reason to believe it is quite conceivable that it will happen, will go beyond just a season and come back and recycle next year. If that\u2019s the case, we hope to have a vaccine.\u201d\n\nTrump made some confusing remarks that wrongly suggested the flu fatality rate is \u201cmuch higher\u201d than the rate for COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease. The flu fatality rate is about 0.1%, while the fatality rate for COVID-19 has been about 2-3%.\n\nChad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also got the facts wrong on this in a Feb. 25 Senate hearing. Wolf said the COVID-19 fatality rate was \u201cunder 2%\u201d or \u201cbetween 1.5 and 2%,\u201d and then falsely said the influenza rate was \u201cright around 2% as well.\u201d\n\nIn the Feb. 26 press conference, the president first agreed with a reporter\u2019s correct figures on the fatality rates but then said, \u201cThe flu is much higher.\u201d Here\u2019s the exchange:\n\nThe reporter then said, \u201cThere\u2019s more people who get the flu.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s what the president meant, but his comments may have left a false impression with the public. (We asked the White House for clarification on Trump\u2019s remarks, but we haven\u2019t yet received it.)\n\nThe fatality rate for COVID-19 has fluctuated as the disease has spread. In late January, the worldwide fatality rate was 2%, but as of Feb. 27, the figure would be 3.4%, with 82,550 cases confirmed and 2,810 deaths.\n\nA report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Feb. 24 by researchers with China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3% among 72,314 cases in mainland China, with higher fatality rates for the elderly (8.0% for those age 70 to 79 and 14.8% for those 80 and older).\n\nDavid Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told us that the figures may not accurately show the danger of the virus, because the disease is still running its course for many patients. Also, if more people have been infected but haven\u2019t had their illnesses confirmed, the fatality rate could be lower. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, the case fatality rate may be around 1%, Fisman told us in an email for our January Q&A on the new coronavirus.\n\nSo far, many more people are infected by influenza each year in the United States alone than have been infected by the new coronavirus worldwide. In 2018-2019, 35.5 million people had flu symptoms in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death. That would put influenza\u2019s fatality rate at 0.13% to 0.14%.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump was also asked about the potential conflict between his criticism of the Obama administration during the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak, prompting him to make an incomplete comparison between the two viral diseases.\n\nTrump gave a similar defense of his actions two days before when he was in India.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s remarks, the Ebola virus was well known in 2014, as the first recognized outbreak was in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nLater, he returned to the higher fatality rate.\n\n\u201cI know, but the level of death with Ebola \u2014 you know, at the time, it was a virtual 100%,\u201d Trump said. He added that for COVID-19, \u201cit\u2019s very much the opposite. You\u2019re talking about 1 or 2%, whereas in the other case, it was a virtual 100%.\u201d\n\nAs we have just discussed, the true case fatality rate of COVID-19 isn\u2019t yet known, but appears to be between 2-3%, with higher rates of death among the elderly. Ebola virus disease \u2014 the official name for the disease caused by the Ebola virus \u2014 as the president says, is much deadlier, but it\u2019s not \u201ca virtual 100%.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemics in Africa had a range of case fatality rates, including 28% in Sierra Leone, 45% in Libera and 67% in Guinea. The majority of cases at that time occurred in those three countries. The case fatality rate for the West African epidemic was about 40%.\n\nTrump is also conveniently leaving out another key distinction between the Ebola and the new coronavirus: the method of transmission. While the new virus is thought to spread primarily through respiratory droplets from sneezing or coughing, the Ebola virus requires direct contact through a bodily fluid, such as blood, saliva, vomit or semen. That makes it much harder to catch than the new coronavirus \u2014 and also much easier to contain.\n\nIn 2014, just two people \u2014 a pair of nurses who treated a man traveling to Dallas from West Africa \u2014 ever contracted the Ebola virus in the U.S. The remaining nine people who were treated for Ebola in the U.S. were infected in Africa, with the majority being medical workers. Two people in total died, including the first travel case who infected the nurses and a health worker evacuated for treatment.\n\nTrump also highlights the fact that with Ebola, there were no treatments for the 2014-2016 outbreak. That\u2019s true, but that\u2019s also largely the case for the new coronavirus. Other than supportive care, there are no FDA-approved treatments for COVID-19, although there are some promising experimental antiviral drugs. One of these, oddly enough, was originally developed to treat Ebola infection.", "lang": "en"}
