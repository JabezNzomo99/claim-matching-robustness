It is being claimed that the video is from Mumbai.\n\nThe caption on the posts read: \u201cVehicle suspension testing machine successfully installed by BMC in Mumbai!\u201d\n\nMore such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Picture of 2015 Tianjin explosion being shared as recent\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the above claims and found them to be false. The first red flag was a billboard in the video which was written in a foreign language.\n\nWe then took keyframes from the video and searched them through the Google Reverse Image Search. We came across several websites with similar-looking characters as the billboard. When we input them in Google translate, the result was shown as Chinese.\n\nSo, we Googled \u2018China roads potholes\u2019 and came across the same video by World News Today on YouTube from July 2020. It was the exact video and had no mention of Mumbai.\n\nAdditionally, we also Googled the logo in the bottom right of the video and it translated from Chinese to \u201cBrother Xiaoqiang 123\u201d.\n\nHence, it is clear that the video does not in anyway show Mumbai roads.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
