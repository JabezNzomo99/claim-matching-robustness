Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A Congress poster in Wayanad (Kerala) misspelt Rahul Gandhi name as \u2018Rahul Gandu\u2019. Fact: The photo of the poster has been taken in Telangana, not Kerala. Also, the photo has been photoshopped. In the actual photo, it can be seen that Rahul Gandhi name has not been misspelt. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\n\n\nIf the leaders in the poster are clearly observed, it can be found that they are Telangana Congress leaders (Sudheer Reddy at the bottom right and Uttam Kumar at the top right), not Kerala Congress leaders. So, the poster is from Telangana, not Wayanad (Kerala). When the posted picture is run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a Telugu article published last year on this issue can be found in the search results. So, this image has been in circulation before Rahul filed his nomination in Wayanad. According to that article, the picture was photoshopped to change the name \u2018Gandhi\u2019 to \u2018Gandu\u2019. The original photo can be found in that article. Also, on the official Facebook account of Sudheer Reddy, a video posted last year shows the same flexi, in which the name was found to be correctly spelt.\n\nTo sum it up, Rahul Gandhi\u2019s name was not misspelt on the Congress Poster. The image has been photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
