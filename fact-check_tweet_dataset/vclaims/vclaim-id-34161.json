It doesn\u2019t apply \u2013 and doesn\u2019t make sense \u2013 in the congressional impeachment inquiry, nor in any potential impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nThe complaint about hearsay is one example of how both political parties are trying to draw analogies between the impeachment process and a criminal trial \u2013 for political reasons, not legal ones.\n\nLegally speaking, what\u2019s called the hearsay rule is one of several rules that govern what evidence can be introduced in a trial.\n\nEssentially, the rule says that a witness cannot testify about something someone else said outside the courtroom as proof that the out-of-court statement was true. For example, if Deirdre is on trial for murdering Victor, Walter is not allowed to testify that \u201cEsmerelda told me that she saw Deirdre shoot Victor\u201d as proof that Deirdre actually shot Victor.\n\nThere are a few reasons not to allow this, but a significant one is that in a criminal trial, a defendant must be able to cross-examine the accusers. The only legal approach in this situation would be to call Esmerelda to testify herself about what, if anything, she saw Deirdre do. That would allow Deirdre\u2019s attorney to cross-examine her, asking, for example, about how clearly she saw it, whether she had any reason to lie or exaggerate, or if she misspoke when she named Deirdre as the shooter.\n\nThis rule applies to trials and related proceedings in federal courts.\n\nBut Congress is not a court, and no rules of evidence apply to its activities, including impeachment. This is not a technical distinction: It\u2019s a foundational part of the constitutional structure.\n\nNot useful in an investigation\n\nEven if the analogy between the impeachment inquiry and a criminal proceeding were appropriate, the hearsay rule doesn\u2019t apply to the analogous phases of a criminal case.\n\nPolice can and often do investigate rumors or secondhand accounts of possible criminal conduct. Their goal is to collect evidence that can be presented at trial, but during their investigation they\u2019re free to collect and use information to advance their inquiry that wouldn\u2019t be admitted in court.\n\nThe same is true in grand jury proceedings. To obtain an indictment from a grand jury, prosecutors need only show it is likely that a crime has been committed. They are free to rely on evidence that wouldn\u2019t be admissible at trial to make their case.\n\nRules of evidence and procedure envision an adversarial process in front of a neutral arbiter \u2013 two lawyers arguing before a judge or jury \u2013 who has no prior knowledge of, nor any interest in, the dispute. That\u2019s clearly untrue of an impeachment or other inquiry in Congress, where there is already likely to have been lots of testimony and discussion, as well as political maneuvering.\n\nThe hearsay rule doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of a congressional hearing. Major revelations in the current impeachment investigation have included information about discussions witnesses had with other people who had not yet testified. That includes when Ambassador Bill Taylor told Congress that an aide of his overheard a conversation between President Donald Trump and Sondland.\n\nThat testimony opened a new line of inquiry for House members to follow as they gather evidence to help them decide whether to impeach the president.\n\nIf the case proceeds to a trial in the Senate, the only rules governing the proceeding are Senate rules \u2013 which a majority of senators can vote to change at any point.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who would serve as the presiding judge, could choose to enforce federal rules of evidence, including the hearsay rule \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear if he would. In any case, the senators could overrule him either wholesale or in particular situations. And the senators would likely know many \u2013 if not all \u2013 of the facts that would be excluded. Voting on impeachment is fundamentally political, not legal, so they could still base their decision on information not introduced during the trial.\n\nImpeachment is not a criminal trial and the president has fewer procedural rights than a criminal defendant would. This is as it should be, in my view; public office is not a right or entitlement, and the public interest heavily outweighs the president\u2019s private interests in impeachment proceedings. The only punishments for impeachment are removal from office and, potentially, disqualification from future office-holding. Anything more would require an actual criminal proceeding, from which hearsay evidence would be excluded.\n\nBut politicians may see benefits in conflating the two different systems \u2013 either to argue that they are providing a fair and fact-based hearing, or to claim that the whole affair is biased and illegitimate.\n\n[ You\u2019re smart and curious about the world.
