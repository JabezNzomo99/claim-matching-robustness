After all, the New York Times headlined its article on the 2019 budget: \u201cWhite House Proposes $4.4 Trillion Budget That Adds $7 Trillion to Deficits.\u201d So how does a budget that adds $7 trillion to the deficit actually reduce the deficit by $3 trillion?\n\nWe originally intended to ignore the budget, which was largely made irrelevant by the congressional budget deal reached a week earlier. But this kind of spin simply cannot be ignored \u2014 and if we were confused, we imagine our readers were confused as well.\n\nThere is a standard table in every federal budget labeled S-2. This is where an administration tallies the 10-year deficit impact of its various proposals on the budget, measured against a baseline of spending and revenue if nothing had been changed. In other words, it is a wish list, with few items ever enacted.\n\nThe S-2 table in the 2019 budget actually tallies up to $3.631 trillion worth of spending cuts. But if you remove the interest on debt saved from these proposals, it\u2019s really $3.312 trillion. White House officials said they reduced it further, to $3 trillion, in public statements to reflect the spending deal reached with Congress the week before.\n\nBut Congress decided to bust through the sequester caps and add $128 billion to domestic programs for the next two years. So the budget is $212 billion behind on that item. There\u2019s no way President Trump will ever catch up.\n\nMoreover, some items on the list, such as phasing down funding for overseas contingency operations and disaster spending, probably were going to happen anyway. Just those two items add up to $808 billion over 10 years, or 25 percent of the claimed savings.\n\nThis proves our point. Trump had a wish list in 2018, with a big number, and virtually none of it happened. In the previous year, there was a similar list that included such as ideas as repeal and replace Obamacare ($250 billion in savings) and the twopenny plan ($1.4 trillion). A big item on the 2018 list \u2014 reform Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance program ($616 billion) \u2014 does not even make a repeat appearance.\n\nIn fact, in going through the S-2 tables of 10 years of budgets, we found that Obama in 2017 offered proposals that were estimated to produce bigger deficit savings in raw dollars \u2014 $3.640 trillion \u2014 than Trump is claiming this year. Obama exceeded Trump\u2019s number by $9 billion \u2014 yes, a rounding error \u2014 but it calls into question the statement we originally got from OMB.\n\nNot to get too granular, but since officials are already conceding that the savings in the 2019 budget are really $3 trillion, not $3.631 trillion, it\u2019s actually smaller than the $3.563 trillion claimed in the 2018 budget. So Mulvaney continues to be wrong.\n\nWhite House officials are congratulating themselves for concocting a wish list of spending cuts that will never be enacted. The numbers look big over a 10-year horizon, but already they are out of date. Meanwhile, the fiscal position of the United States slipped in the past year because of a bonanza of tax cuts and spending increases. Moreover, even if one accepted the figures, it\u2019s not the largest such estimate as officials claim.\n\nWe wavered over whether these statements were worthy of Three or Four Pinocchios. These are numbers in a government document, after all. But what tipped us to Four Pinocchios was that these claims were made in service of a budget plan that allows for soaring deficits, even after adopting economic growth far outside the economic mainstream. That\u2019s more than spin \u2014 it\u2019s spin that\u2019s whistling past the graveyard.", "lang": "en"}
