The posts purport to contrast the locations in years before Rodrigo Duterte was elected president in 2016 with their improvements since he came into office. The photos have been shared in a misleading context; the posts contain inaccurate descriptions about when and where the photos were taken.\n\nThe photos were shared in this Facebook post published on April 8, 2020. The post has been shared almost 140,000 times.\n\nThe post includes four sets of photo collages. It purports to highlight the comparisons of four locations in the Philippines before and after Duterte\u2019s presidential election victory in May 2016.\n\nThe same photos were also shared on Facebook here, and on Twitter here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe photos have been shared in a misleading context.\n\nThe first photo juxtaposition is overlaid with text that reads: \u201cManila Bay\u201d, referring to a harbour off Manila, the capital of the Philippines.\n\nThe \u201cBefore Duterte\u201d photo shows a garbage-filled bay while the \u201cDuring Duterte\u201d one features a scenic sunset viewed from a clean beach.\n\nA combined reverse image and keyword searches on Google found both photos were taken during the Duterte administration.\n\nThe purported \u201cBefore Duterte\u201d photo was published in this December 2019 report by Philippine newspaper The Philippine Star and described as showing the aftermath of Typhoon Ompong at Manila Bay.\n\nThe typhoon hit the country in September 2018, during Duterte\u2019s presidency.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the miscaptioned image (L) and the Philippine Star photo (R):\n\nThe \u201cDuring Duterte\u201d photo appears in this 2019 report by Philippine news network GMA News about cleanup operations at Manila Bay.\n\nThe second photo collage is described as showing the Pasig River, which runs through the Manila metropolitan areas.\n\nThe photos, however, do not show the Pasig River; instead, they show Estero de Binondo, a creek near Manila\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the miscaptioned photos (L and C) and their corresponding location on Google Street View (R):\n\nThe third set of photos compares old Philippine National Railways (PNR) trains, purportedly in operation before Duterte\u2019s presidency, with new trains that were in operation during his administration.\n\nBut the old trains seen in the \u201cBefore Duterte\u201d photos remain in operation to date.\n\nA closer inspection found the train in the top left-hand corner bears the number 919, while the one in the top right is numbered 5001.\n\nBoth are \u201cstill operational,\u201d Joseline Geronimo, PNR operations manager, told AFP in a text message on June 4, 2020.\n\nThe \u201cDuring Duterte\u201d photo previously appeared in this 2019 Jakarta Post report about the delivery of new PNR trains from an Indonesian manufacturer.\n\nThe fourth photo comparison is overlaid with text that states: \u201cBoracay\u201d, which is an island known for its beaches and resorts in central Philippines.\n\nThe purported \u201cBefore Duterte\u201d photo of an algae-laced beach was in fact taken while Duterte was in office. The second photo showing a pristine beach has actually circulated in online posts before Duterte was elected president.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the first photo published in this report by Philippine media ABS-CBN, which states it was taken on March 22, 2018, during Duterte\u2019s presidency.\n\nAnother reverse image search using TinEye found the \u201cDuring Duterte\u201d appears uncredited in several web pages before Duterte\u2019s election victory in 2016, for example in 2014 here and in 2015 here.\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison between the photos in the misleading posts (L) and their corresponding photos traced through reverse image searches (R):", "lang": "en"}
