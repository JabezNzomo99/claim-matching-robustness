This has now slipped to 7.1% in 2016-17, according to this reply to the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) on April 5, 2017.\n\nConsumer price index-based inflation saw a steady decline from 10.2% in 2012-13 to 9.5% in 2013-14, 5.9% in 2014-15, 4.9% in 2015-16 to 4.5% in 2016-17, according to volume 2 of Economic Survey 2016-17.\n\n2. Claim/Promise: In 2016, Modi claimed the government had completed the work of 'One Rank, One Pension' policy for soldiers.\n\nReality: Promise kept but final installment not paid and some grievances unresolved\n\nIn November 2015, the government issued orders for implementation of the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme, which ensures the same pension for each rank with similar length of service and benefits of future enhancements passed on to past retirees of the Indian army. By April 2017, Rs 8,792 crore was released to 2.1 million defence forces pensioners/ family pensioners as arrears in three installments. Another installment is due for payment in August 2017.\n\nThe Justice Reddy committee, which was appointed to look into anomalies arising from the implementation of OROP, submitted its report in October 2016. The government is currently reviewing the recommendations of the committee.\n\nSome ex-servicemen associations have been demanding changes in the methodology for fixation of pension, periodicity of revision and coverage of future pre-mature retirees (PMR), according to to this reply to the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) by the ministry of defence on August 11, 2017.\n\n3.

Claim/Promise: In 2016, Modi said the government would give a 20% pension increment to freedom fighters and their families.\n\nThe government is giving family pension to eligible dependents of freedom fighters under the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980, administered by the ministry of home affairs.\n\nThe pension for ex-Andaman political prisoners/spouses increased around 21% from Rs 24,775 to Rs 30,000 in August 2016, and for freedom fighters who suffered outside British India/spouses category from Rs 23,085 to Rs 28,000, according to this reply to the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) on March 15, 2017.\n\n5.

Claim/Promise: In 2015, Modi said cooking gas subsidies deposited in bank accounts saved the government Rs 15,000 crore.\n\nThe implementation of Pratyaksh Hasthantarit Labh (PAHAL) or direct benefit transfer scheme for transfer of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy resulted in saving an estimated Rs 14,818 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 6,443 crore during 2015-16, according to the Annual Report 2016-17 of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nThe government plans to eliminate subsidy on LPG, Mint reported on August 1, 2017.
