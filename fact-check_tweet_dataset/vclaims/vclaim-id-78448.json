Buono is Christie\u2019s likely challenger in the November gubernatorial contest.\n\nAs pictures of Corzine and Buono flash on screen during the ad, a narrator intones, \"Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2 billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled.\"\n\nThis ad is like others from the governor\u2019s re-election campaign that try linking Buono with Corzine: strong on bluster, weak on context. While the ad doesn\u2019t come right out and blame Buono for these increases, the implication is there.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the start of Corzine\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe Democrat became governor in 2005 and served one term before being defeated by Christie.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how Corzine \"teamed up\" with Buono since she was already on her third term as a state senator when he was first elected to state government. Further, the chairmanship of legislative committees is determined by the president in the Senate and the speaker in the Assembly \u2013 not the governor. Also, Buono was neither Corzine\u2019s Senate president nor his lieutenant governor, which would have made them more of a \u2018team.\u2019\n\nNext, let\u2019s review the increases mentioned in the ad.\n\nIn 2006, Corzine proposed increasing New Jersey\u2019s sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, claiming the hike would generate more than $1 billion in revenue and help close a $4.5 billion budget gap. Buono was one of 22 senators to approve the increase, which went into effect that July.\n\nThen came creation of the fiscal year 2007-2008 budget, which was proposed at $33.4 billion -- the largest state budget in history to date. Each of Christie\u2019s budgets since he\u2019s been in office has been below that total.\n\nBuono became chair of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in January 2008 and served through 2009, meaning she led that panel in reviewing and editing a budget before submitting it to Corzine for approval. Buono voted in favor of the budget. Corzine had final approval over it.\n\nAnd the situation is similar for the ad claim about 23 increases in taxes and fees during the two years that Buono chaired the Senate budget panel. Among the votes that Buono supported: increasing the cigarette tax, increasing the vehicle registration fee by $7, and increasing the income tax rate in various brackets.\n\nSo Buono has responsibility for these increases since she voted in favor of them, but she\u2019s not the only legislator to do so.\n\nThe ad also is correct that state debt increased more than $13 billion during the two years of Buono\u2019s chairmanship. But Christie calling her out for that is disingenuous since state debt has climbed an additional $13 billion from 2010 -- Christie\u2019s first year in office -- to 2012, according to the State Debt Report for Fiscal Year 2012.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s look at unemployment figures for the period cited by the ad: January 2008 to January 2010.\n\nLooking strictly at raw numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed in New Jersey more than doubled from 208,729 in January 2008 to 442,441 two years later.\n\nBut Christie\u2019s team forgot something: New Jersey was deep in the recession, which the U.S. Bureau of Economic Research has defined as beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009. Employment losses continued mounting in the months after the recession ended. Consequently, one New Jersey senator can\u2019t bare the full blame for an economic collapse that gripped the state and nation for several years.\n\n\"As the architect of Jon Corzine\u2019s budgets, Barbara Buono was central to those disastrous policies that brough New Jersey to the brink of catastrophe,\" Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts said in a press release that he referred us to about the ad.\n\n\"Governor Christie's blatantly misleading claims are laughable,\" Turner said in an e-mail. \"Senator Buono voted for commonsense measures to hold lawbreakers accountable, including fees to reduce the cost of collecting child support, tougher fines against polluters and increased penalties for improperly storing explosives. With more than 400,000 people unemployed and property taxes up nearly 20 percent, it's no surprise that he has resorted to purposely distorting Senator Buono's record.\"\n\nA Christie TV ad claims, \"Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2 billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled.\"\n\nMost of the ad\u2019s claims are correct but imply that Buono is to blame for things such as a sales tax increase, billions in debt and skyrocketing unemployment in two years \u2013 during a recession, to boot. All of these resulted from the collective actions of a legislative body \u2013 not one person. Also, sharing a political affiliation and chairing a committee didn\u2019t necessarily make Buono and Corzine a \u2018team.\u2019 Therefore, we rate the ad Half True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
