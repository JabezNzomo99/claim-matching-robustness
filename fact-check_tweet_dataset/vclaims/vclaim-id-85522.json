There needs to be evidence that the person impeded corruptly \u2014 that they knew it was wrong but did it anyway, with corrupt intent. It\u2019s about the mental state of the person.\n\nThat\u2019s a high bar, and corrupt intent is not a black-and-white matter. In the absence of conclusive findings by the special counsel, there are many unanswered questions about whether what we know so far could build an obstruction of justice case. Based on the facts available so far publicly, there is not yet a case for obstruction of justice, said Kenneth Starr, the special counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, in a recent CNN interview.\n\n\u201cObstruction of justice is really a very hard crime to make out. It\u2019s not just, you want the investigation to go away, you suggest the investigation goes away,\u201d Starr said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take really affirmative action. \u2026 And you know what, that\u2019s a good thing for all of us. Crime should be difficult to prove.\u201d\n\nExecutive privilege applies narrowly, and it can only be used in certain circumstances, such as protecting confidential or sensitive communications or matters of national security. Basically, the president can have private, frank conversations with his advisers to carry out his duty as president in an informed way. This privilege doesn\u2019t apply to matters of political expediency.\n\nThis continues to come up in news coverage, as former and current federal officials are being called to testify in public hearings about matters they discussed with the president. For example, before Comey\u2019s June testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, there were questions as to whether Trump could invoke executive privilege to block Comey from testifying. Of course, at the time, Comey was a private citizen after being fired from his job by Trump, so Comey would have been free to testify even if Trump did assert this authority.\n\nThe Constitution lays the grounds for impeachment as \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d but \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is not clearly defined. Based on the legal and historical interpretation of the word \u201chigh,\u201d the word can be used to describe the position of the person holding high public office (i.e., president, vice president, federal judges) \u2014 not the severity of the crime or misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cIt is not the role of this Office [of Independent Counsel] to determine whether the President\u2019s actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate; those judgments are, of course, constitutionally entrusted to the legislative branch,\u201d according to the Starr report of the Clinton investigation.\n\nThe Starr report found 11 possible grounds for Clinton\u2019s impeachment, all having to do with Clinton\u2019s false statements under oath about his sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was accused of repeatedly lying under oath to a grand jury, in his civil deposition, and even to his own lawyer, investigators found. Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998, and tried to obstruct justice, investigators found.", "lang": "en"}
