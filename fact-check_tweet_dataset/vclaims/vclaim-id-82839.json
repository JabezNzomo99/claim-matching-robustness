He was interested in a Catholic because the so-called \u201cCatholic seat\u201d had been vacant for a number of years and Francis Cardinal Spellman, the archbishop of New York, had pressed him earlier that year to appoint a Catholic the next time there was a vacancy.\n\nIt turned out there were only a handful of Catholic Democrat jurists on state courts who were under the age of 62. The White House was more focused on whether Brennan was a practicing Catholic\u2014even checking with his parish priest to make sure he attended mass regularly\u2014than on whether he was really a conservative. He actually was quite liberal, as would become apparent during his 34 years on the Supreme Court. Cardinal Spellman received one of the first calls from the White House about the choice, but he was not happy with the selection after all.\n\nBy Sept. 27, just 20 days after Minton\u2019s announcement, Eisenhower was ready to make a decision. He even dropped a hint at a news conference: \u201cWhen you come to the Supreme Court, my people look up the record of every sitting judge that they can find, district courts and circuit courts in the Federal and all of the supreme court justices in the states.\u201d\n\nOn Sept, 29, a Saturday, Brennan met with Ike at the White House for a conversation that lasted all of 20 minutes. (Brennan was flabbergasted to learn he was being offered a Supreme Court position; he thought he was being asked to join a judicial task force.) Eisenhower told him he would announce the appointment on Monday, but Brennan could tell his family in the meantime.\n\nBut as Brennan was completing the calls, Eisenhower decided he would simply announce the appointment that day. The news media was called in, and that was that. (Brennan failed to tell his wife that the announcement had been moved up two days, and so she was stunned to find the house surrounded by reporters.)\n\nWermiel said Eisenhower always intended to make a recess appointment \u2014 he had already appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren through the maneuver \u2014 but he moved up the announcement in part because he was afraid it would leak. Wermiel, in the biography of Brennan, also suggests the political calendar played a role \u2014 a Monday announcement would have interfered with a planned campaign swing. Moreover, Eisenhower knew that Stevenson was just about to take a high-profile campaign trip through the Catholic sections of the Northeast, including Brennan\u2019s home state of New Jersey.\n\nBecause of the recess appointment, Brennan could immediately begin serving on the court, which was about to start a new term. Eisenhower officially nominated Brennan in January, and he was confirmed in March, again with little controversy. (Eisenhower did receive some angry letters from citizens who were upset he appointed a Catholic \u2014 or did not appoint a Republican. But Catholic voters were pleased.)\n\nTaylor Foy, press secretary for the judiciary committee, says the GOP letter is accurate because Brennan was neither nominated by the president nor considered by the Senate during the 1956 presidential election year: \u201cHe was recess appointed. A freshly re-elected President Eisenhower submitted William Brennan\u2019s nomination to the Senate in January of 1957, a hearing was held, and Brennan was eventually confirmed in March of 1957\u2014all of which occurred following the presidential election in 1956.\u201d\n\nBut it is difficult to completely dismiss the Brennan case as precedent. Eisenhower placed a new Justice on the Supreme Court just weeks before the election even though the government was divided. Moreover, there was virtually no controversy about his right to do so, even though it is clear that political considerations played a role in Brennan\u2019s selection.", "lang": "en"}
