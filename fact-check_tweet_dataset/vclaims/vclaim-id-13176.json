March 20, 2019.\n\nDuring a live TV election debate, Premier Berejiklian said her government was reducing cost of living pressures on households and families by making sure NSW has the cheapest energy bills in Australia. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the premier\u2019s claim that NSW had the lowest energy bills in Australia.\n\nAAP FactCheck found no evidence to support the premier\u2019s claim.\n\nWhile five different national and international reports differed on which Australian state or territory has the least expensive energy bills, none awarded NSW the title as the cheapest.\n\nA St Vincent de Paul and Alviss Consulting National Energy Market 2018 annual report, funded by Energy Consumers Australia, compares the long-term price of electricity and gas across all states and territories from July 2009 to July 2018 as estimated annual bills. The report showed in 2018 that NSW had the third most expensive electricity with the Northern Territory being the cheapest followed by ACT and Tasmania. In 2018 Victoria had the cheapest gas followed by NSW. [2]\n\nAn Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) 2018 annual report, which compared electricity price trends in Australian states, found Victoria had the cheapest retail electricity bills followed by NSW and Queensland in 2017/2018. The AEMC report, titled Residential Electricity Price Trends, predicted these three Victoria-NSW-Queensland positions would remain unchanged through to 2020-21.\n\nThe AEMC annual reports are prepared at the request of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council. On page 74 the AEMC report included \u201cfuture developments that have been announced and could affect the future trend in residential retail prices in New South Wales\u201d. Under \u201cclean energy initiatives to reduce power bills\u201d it stated \u201cthe NSW government is delivering a range of new programs to provide clean and affordable energy for the people of NSW. These programs will assist households and businesses to save money on their energy bills.\u201d [3]\n\nAnother 2018 comparison of countries and regions with the cheapest electricity prices, based on figures from Finnish research and advisory firm VaasaEtt and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), ranked West Australia as having the cheapest, ahead of Queensland second and Victoria third, NSW was fourth and South Australia was the most expensive. [4]\n\nA 2016 comparison of Australia\u2019s household electricity prices by Australian economics consultancy CME Carbon + Energy Markets MarkIntell showed ACT had the cheapest electricity prices followed by Tasmania, West Australia and Queensland. NSW was the fifth most expensive with Victoria and South Australia being the dearest. [5]\n\nA year later in 2017 another CME comparison showed Victoria has cheapest electricity prices followed by Queensland and then NSW. [6]", "lang": "en"}
