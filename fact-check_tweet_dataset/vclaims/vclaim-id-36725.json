While he couldn\u2019t remember exactly where it came from, he said that he was 100% sure it was real and shared a similar example of this \u201cspaghetti\u201d burl pattern:\n\nWhile burl is a tree deformity, it can come in some beautiful patterns that makes it valuable to wood workers. Here\u2019s Hunski Hardwoods description of burl on its website:\n\nA burl is a tree growth in which the grain has grown in a deformed manner. It is usually found on the trunk, at the base of the tree, and sometimes underground in the form of a rounded outgrowth. It is caused by some kind of stress, such as injury, virus, fungus, insect infestation or mold growth. Burl wood is the wood that is harvested from that growth, and it holds hidden treasures of unusual design. Burls result in a uniquely patterned wood, which is highly prized for its beauty. It is valued and sought after by artists, furniture makers and sculptors. Burl wood can be found in many tree species and is used in making furniture, different types of veneer, inlays, turning wood, gun stocks, music wood, and other household items.\n\nOne reason this image may have drawn skepticism is that it is reminiscent of a famous April Fool\u2019s Day joke pulled by the BBC in 1957, when the respected news outlet put out a video report about an annual spaghetti harvest:\n\nWhile the recent tree picture may be reminiscent of the famous \u201cspaghetti tree hoax,\u201d the picture did not originate with the BBC. This is a genuine photograph of burl wood beneath the bark of a burned tree.", "lang": "en"}
