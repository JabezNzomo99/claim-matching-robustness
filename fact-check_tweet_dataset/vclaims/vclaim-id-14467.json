The fake poll has been attributed to the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). The post gives an estimation of the seats that will be won by the BJP in the Rajasthan elections. The particular post also says, \"Narendra Modi has single-handedly rescued Rajasthan for the BJP from the jaws of defeat.\"\n\nClick here to view the archived version of the post.\n\nA Twitter handle Rishi Bagree with a large following of right-wing sympathisers shared this post as well on Twitter with numbers changed from November. His tweet got more than 2,000 retweets and 6,000 likes. However, Bagree has not attributed the poll to BBC, and neither mentioned the source of the opinion poll.\n\nThis is not the first time Rishi Bagree has been caught sharing fake news. In the past, Bagree has been called out by BOOM many times. Click here, here and here.\n\nBOOM spoke to a senior editor at BBC, who called it fake. We were asked to refer to their statement published on The BBC Hindi website.\n\nThe article says, \"Posts like this viral on social media are fake. BBC has not done any such opinion poll or survey. According to the company\u2019s policy, BBC never does any such survey before the elections.\"\n\nThis is not the first time fake polls claiming BJP's win have emerged on social media. During the Karnataka elections earlier this year in April-May, there were many such fake polls viral on social media. One of the polls even had the same pattern and had an attachment of BBC's link to it. BOOM had debunked the viral message then.\n\nNot only this, but there were other fake polls that were viral at that time which BOOM had debunked. Click here, here and here to read about those polls.\n\nEditor's Note: The handle @rishibagree mentioned on Twitter that he never attributed the opinion poll to BBC. We have amended the story to reflect his clarification. However, the numbers mentioned in his tweet are similar to the numbers mentioned by those attributing the poll to BBC.", "lang": "en"}
