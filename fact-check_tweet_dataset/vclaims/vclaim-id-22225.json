As a result, he said, \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got enough hospitals. We haven\u2019t got enough doctors. We haven\u2019t got enough facilities.\u201d\n\nWithout \u201cfundamental reforms,\u201d Farage said, the NHS is at a \u201cbreaking point.\u201d\n\nAnd he issued this warning for Americans: \u201cThe big, big point is this: when the state gives benefits to people, any attempt in the future to reform it or take those benefits back becomes politically impossible. \u2026 If you [Americans] were to introduce universal health care, paid for essentially out of taxes, you would never, ever be able to remove that.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Trump tweeted this:\n\nIndeed, some Democrats are pushing for universal health care. In September, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, introduced the Medicare for All Act of 2017, which would broaden Medicare into a universal health insurance program. It was cosponsored by 16 Democratic senators. And a majority of House Democrats signed on as co-sponsors of the Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act, introduced by Democratic Rep. John Conyers earlier last year.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s tweet suggests those \u201cmarching in the UK\u201d were opposed to the universal health care system there. That\u2019s not accurate.\n\nThe BBC reported that thousands demonstrated in London on Feb. 3, \u201ccalling for more government support for the NHS.\u201d\n\nThe groups behind the rally, The People\u2019s Assembly and Health Campaigns Together, put out a joint statement responding to Trump\u2019s tweet. They said the demonstrators wanted \u201cto show their love for the principles of universal and comprehensive care free at the point of use, paid for through general taxation.\u201d They were protesting, they said, against British government policies they view as trying to \u201cmove us more to an American-style system which is widely acknowledged to be one of the most expensive, inefficient and unjust healthcare systems in the world.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Assembly and Health Campaigns Together, Feb. 5: The NHS has existed since 1948 in the UK after the devastation of the second world war. The British population demanded the right to have access to healthcare which they deserve as human beings which is absolutely affordable when the right political decisions are made. It has been a shining example to the world of what can be achieved when we put the needs of the collective good over the interests of a few wealthy individuals. Unfortunately, our current government have been persuaded to increasingly adopt policies which represent those of your Government, they have decided to move us more to an American-style system which is widely acknowledged to be one of the most expensive, inefficient and unjust healthcare systems in the world. This is why our NHS is currently struggling and why leading Professors including Professor Stephen Hawking are bravely battling politicians who wish to turn it into a system like yours. This is what our demonstration was about on Saturday 3rd Feb and tens of thousands of British people want to show their love for the principles of universal and comprehensive care free at the point of use, paid for through general taxation. We don\u2019t agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric. No thanks.\n\nA New York Times story notes that \u201cbudgetary austerity\u201d in the U.K. has limited the growth of health spending to below the historical norm. As a result, \u201cPatients often wait months, even for essential procedures. Waiting rooms are often crowded,\u201d the Times wrote. That has soured some on the system, though public satisfaction with the NHS remains high.\n\nThose protesting in Britain recently weren\u2019t advocating scrapping the system; they were advocating higher government funding. According to the Times, the protesters in Britain chanted, \u201cKeep your hands off our N.H.S.\u201d Images of the protest from the BBC and published by The Guardian show demonstrators carrying signs that read, \u201cMore Staff, More Beds, More Funds\u201d and \u201cSave Our NHS.\u201d\n\nIn July 2017, the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based nonpartisan research foundation that promotes improved health care access and quality, issued a report comparing the health care system performance of 11 high-income countries, using indicators for care process, access, administrative efficiency, equity and health care outcomes. The U.K. was tops overall in the performance rankings. The U.S ranked last.\n\nEric Schneider, senior vice president for policy and research at the Commonwealth Fund and the study\u2019s lead author, said he could not comment on the specifics of Trump\u2019s claims. But he said the Commonwealth Fund report \u201cshows that overall the health systems of the United Kingdom and several other high income countries achieve higher performance than the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike several other high-income countries, the U.K. spends a lower percentage of its GDP on health care than the U.S.,\u201d Schneider told us via email. \u201cAll health systems, even those that are well designed and organized, may find it difficult to perform at a high level if they are insufficiently funded.\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s tweet, Britain\u2019s health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Twitter that while he disagreed with some of the claims made by those who participated in the march, \u201cnot ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover.\u201d\n\nHunt added that while \u201cNHS may have challenges\u201d he was \u201cproud to be from the country that invented universal coverage \u2013 where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC News, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, also responded to Trump\u2019s tweet, saying, \u201cUnfortunately, respectfully, we suggest that tweet got the wrong end of the stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, in fact, people in this country don\u2019t want to ditch our NHS,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cnot withstanding what we\u2019ve said today, they want to keep it and strengthen it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
