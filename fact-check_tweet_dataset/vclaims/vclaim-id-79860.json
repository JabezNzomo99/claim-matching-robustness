The companies have pledged support for racial equality initiatives, but haven\u2019t specified Black Lives Matter as a beneficiary.\n\nBogus claims about major corporations donating hundreds of millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter have been circulating on social media, but they appear to be based on faulty reporting by Fox News host Lou Dobbs in July.\n\nDobbs showed a list purporting to include \u201cFortune 500 companies who\u2019ve pledged to BLM\u201d during the July 16 edition of his show on the Fox Business Network. The list claimed that Bank of America would give $1 billion; PepsiCo, $400 million; Walmart, $100 million; Apple, $100 million; and Comcast, $100 million.\n\nThe following day, Dobbs issued a correction on his show and posted this statement on both Twitter and Facebook: \u201cThe large amounts of money were not for Black Lives Matter but rather pledges of investments to address economic and racial inequality. We apologize to each of these companies for our mistake and we apologize to you for the error.\u201d\n\nBut pictures of the original list continued to be shared online after the correction, and the individual claims have been separated and shared in several different, viral social media posts. One such post has been shared 29,000 times on Facebook, while Dobbs\u2019 correction on that platform was shared 367 times. The correction got roughly the same number of shares on Twitter.\n\nOne popular text post aimed at Bank of America gave a nod to the boogaloo movement, a right-wing extremist ideology that stokes fear about impending civil war. Referring to the $1 billion promised by Bank of America, it said: \u201cThat\u2019s war money ladies and gentleman [sic]. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nAnother widely shared post aimed at PepsiCo called on consumers to boycott the company, saying, \u201cPEPSI JUST GAVE BLM A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS\u2026.PLEASE BOYCOTT PEPSI !!\u201d\n\nWhile each of the companies mentioned has pledged to give the listed amounts to support various racial equality initiatives, none has specifically mentioned Black Lives Matter as a beneficiary.\n\nClick the links below to see the announcements made by each company:\n\nAlix Ekstrom, a spokeswoman for Pepsi, confirmed to FactCheck.org that the brand hasn\u2019t made any such donation. \u201cPepsi has not contributed to the Black Lives Matter organization,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nWilliam Halldin, a spokesman for Bank of America, explained in a phone interview with FactCheck.org that the company tends to donate to nonprofits that deliver specific programming.\n\nAlso, separate from the new, four-year, $1 billion initiative, Bank of America has a policy of matching employee donations to qualified nonprofits with 501(c)(3) tax status, Halldin said. As we\u2019ve explained before, Black Lives Matter uses ActBlue Charities, a registered 501(c)(3), to collect donations. So, it\u2019s possible that Bank of America has given money to Black Lives Matter through the matching program, which Halldin described as \u201cemployee-driven.\u201d\n\nJennifer Rodriguez, a Walmart spokeswoman, said in an email to FactCheck.org, that the company plans to support organizations over the next five years that deal with the financial, health care, educational and criminal justice systems.\n\n\u201cThe donations are still in development and, at this time, no particular one organization has been selected,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some of these companies have given money to Black Lives Matter through matching employee donation programs that are unrelated to the recently announced donation plans, as Halldin described. It\u2019s also possible that some of them may end up giving money to Black Lives Matter in the future. But it\u2019s not true that any of them gave Black Lives Matter the large sums of money that they\u2019ve recently allocated to address racial equality.\n\nBlack Lives Matter didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
