Trump often smears those who challenge him. He has a long-running feud with the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d husband-and-wife team of Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\n\nBut it remains astounding to see the president make a thinly veiled murder accusation devoid of evidence. Many of the 18,000 false and misleading claims in our Trump database feature overheated rhetoric. Few of them rise to these vicious heights.\n\n\u201cMorning Joe\u201d airs on MSNBC from 6 to 9 a.m. on weekdays. The hosts have been hammering the administration\u2019s dysfunction in the face of the covid-19 pandemic, with Scarborough often taking Trump to task for \u201ca blizzard of lies.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the hosts also zeroed in on Trump\u2019s contentious exchange with a CBS News reporter at a news conference Monday. Brzezinski and Scarborough both called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cracist.\u201d They ran a segment criticizing the Justice Department\u2019s unusual move to drop the criminal case against Michael Flynn, a former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. They interviewed Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who said of Trump: \u201cHe can\u2019t handle women, particularly strong women, and we know that Trump is xenophobic, and it comes out time and again.\u201d\n\nTrump first lobbed this conspiratorial charge at Scarborough in November 2017. The president is referring to the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, a 28-year-old aide who worked for Scarborough when he was a Republican member of Congress representing Florida\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nThe circumstances of Klausutis\u2019s death have spawned conspiracy theories, but authorities never suspected foul play. Her death is not an unsolved mystery or a cold case waiting for answers. Klausutis\u2019s death on July 20, 2001, was ruled accidental and the police concluded there was no reason to further investigate. A police investigator told The Post in 2017 that authorities had left \u201cno stone unturned.\u201d PolitiFact has given Trump\u2019s claim its worst rating, \u201cPants on Fire.\u201d\n\nThe medical examiner, Michael Berkland, determined that an abnormal heart rhythm caused Klausutis to lose consciousness and fall, fatally striking her head. She was discovered in Scarborough\u2019s office in Fort Walton Beach, lying on her back with her head near a desk, according to a police report.\n\nThe Fort Walton Beach police report from Aug. 6, 2001, noted that the medical examiner had determined that Klausutis died as a result of an acute subdural hematoma. The police report cited a letter from Berkland, stating that the injury was the result of trauma from a fall as she lost consciousness from \u201ca probable cardiac arrhythmia secondary to valvular heart disease.\u201d The day before she was found dead, Klausutis told a colleague she was not feeling well, according to the police report. She also told a mail carrier she was not feeling well.\n\nTrump in his tweet asked why Scarborough had left Congress so \u201cquickly and quietly,\u201d implying a connection between Klausutis\u2019s death and Scarborough\u2019s resignation. In fact, the death occurred almost two months after Scarborough announced his resignation. Klausutis was looking for a new job when she died, and Scarborough was in Washington.", "lang": "en"}
