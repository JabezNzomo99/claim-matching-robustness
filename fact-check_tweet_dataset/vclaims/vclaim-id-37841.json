The two ways are: \u201c1. Colored side out if you\u2019re sick and do not want to spread your germs around. 2. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you\u2019re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in\u201d. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Two ways of wearing a surgical mask: Colored side out if you are sick and White side out if you do not want to become sick. Fact: There is only one way of wearing a three-layered surgical mask. The colored side of the surgical mask should face outwards. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched regarding the ways of wearing a surgical mask, no information was found regarding the ways mentioned in the post. In an article published by \u2018The Strait Times\u2019, in September-2019, it can be read that \u2018there is only one way to wear the good quality surgical masks that most people are familiar with \u2013 with the colored side facing outwards\u2019. Also, in the document released by the \u2018Centre for Health Protection\u2019, it can be read that, \u2018in general, the colored side/the side with folds facing downwards of the surgical mask should face outwards with the metallic strip uppermost\u2019.\n\nAlso, a similar suggestion can be seen in the \u2018wiki How\u2019 article on \u2018How to Put on a Medical Mask\u2019.\n\nSome videos by the experts on how to wear the surgical mask can be watched here and here. The Health Promotion Board of Singapore also released posters on its Facebook page explaining how to wear a mask.\n\nTo sum it up, there is only one way to wear a three-layered surgical mask: Colored-side outwards.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
