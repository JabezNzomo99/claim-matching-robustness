His wealth and charitable donations to such causes appear to have made him a popular target for online conspiracy theories over the years.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros ex-Nazi billionaire Has Sworn to \u2018Destroy the USA,'\u201d alleges one Facebook post. \u201cHe OWNS Antifa, most of the members of congress, Black Lives Matter, and Acorn to name a few of his Anti-American organizations. He also paid for all of the \u2018spontaneous\u2019 protests the day after Trump was elected.\u201d\n\nOpen Society Foundations denied all these claims about Soros, telling Reuters via email that they are \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cdo a disservice to the very bedrock of our democracy, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe claim that Soros is a former Nazi has previously circulated, despite there being no truth to it. Soros would have been officially too young to join the Schutzstaffel during the Nazi occupation of Hungary and, as a Jew, would not have met the \u201cAryan\u201d heritage requirement. To survive during the Nazi occupation, his family forged government documents to hide their Jewish identities, according to BBC News.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence of Soros ever saying he wants to \u201cdestroy the USA.\u201d It appears to stem from a fake quote \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve made it my life\u2019s mission to destroy the United States\u201d \u2013 that has been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers.\n\nSimilarly, the post\u2019s claim that Soros \u201cOWNS Antifa, most of the members of congress, Black Lives Matter, and Acorn\u201d is baseless. (RELATED: Is Gretchen Whitmer The Niece Of George Soros?)\n\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is \u201can umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations,\u201d according to the Associated Press. The movement lacks official leaders and is organized into local cells, making the claim that Soros owns it dubious.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is a \u201cmember-led global network of more than 40 chapters,\u201d according to the Black Lives Matter Global Network website. The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) appears to be similarly grassroots-based. While Open Society Foundations has donated to them in the past, the DCNF found no evidence that Soros \u201cOWNS\u201d either.\n\nThe notion that Soros owns members of Congress also doesn\u2019t hold up. Members of Congress receive financial contributions from a large number of individuals and organizations. Campaign finance law limits the amount of money Soros, the Open Society Foundations and the Soros Fund Management, as well as others, can donate to politicians.\n\nThe claim about the protests the day after President Donald Trump got elected appears to reference the popular but baseless theory that Soros pays protesters. Check Your Fact and other fact-checkers have debunked such a notion, and the Open Society Foundations has as well.\n\n\u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros,\u201d the Open Society Foundations tweeted. \u201cClaims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
