The Mitt Romney campaign seized on the tweet as an apparent apology to extremists before all the facts were known about what had happened in Libya. In its rush to jump on the fast-moving story, the Romney campaign badly conflated the two things \u2014 and then made itself the focus of attention, instead of the administration\u2019s policies or its handling of the crisis. The Romney campaign earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nWas the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya planned?\n\nSept. 17, 2012: Then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice earned an instant Two Pinocchios for her statements on the Sunday news shows, arguing that \u201cextremist elements\u201d had joined in what she called a demonstration that began \u201cspontaneously\u201d in response to another demonstration in Cairo \u201csparked by this hateful video.\u201d As we put it: \u201cThe administration obviously wants to play down the possibility of a planned attack because that would raise broader questions about whether U.S. intelligence and embassy security in Libya were adequate. But Rice\u2019s comments strain credulity, especially after Libya\u2019s president declared without a doubt that the attack was planned.\u201d Administration officials sharply disputed these conclusions, especially the awarding of any Pinocchios. But the gap between Rice\u2019s statements and other information publicly available at the time made a Pinocchio rating appropriate. Over time, Rice\u2019s remarks that Sunday, five days after the attack, would come back to haunt the administration.\n\nFrom video to terrorist attack: a definitive timeline of administration statements on the Libya attack\n\nSept. 27, 2012: The Fact Checker compiled the first detailed timeline showing how administration statements had evolved on the Benghazi incident. For political reasons, it was in the White House\u2019s interest to not portray the attacks as a terrorist incident, especially one that took place on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Instead, the administration kept the focus on what was ultimately proved to be a political red herring \u2014 anger in the Arab world over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube. With key phrases and message discipline, the administration was able to conflate an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Egypt \u2014 which apparently was prompted by the video \u2014 with the deadly assault in Benghazi.\n\nOct. 17, 2012: The Benghazi tragedy led to one of the most memorable moments of the Obama-Romney debates. Here, we untangled their dispute over whether Obama had quickly called it a \u201cterrorist attack.\u201d Obama was correct that, in the day or two after the attacks, he did use phrasing such as \u201cact of terror,\u201d though it was vaguer than he implied in the debate. Moreover, he then dropped the phrase and for at least a week the administration pushed a narrative that characterized the attacks as a spontaneous reaction to the video, rather than terrorism. Romney, meanwhile, was correct that it took at least two weeks for Obama to forthrightly call it a terrorist attack.\n\nMcCain\u2019s claims about Susan Rice\u2019s comments on the Libya attack\n\nHillary Clinton and the Aug. 16 cable on Benghazi security\n\nIssa\u2019s absurd claim that Clinton\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019 means she personally approved it\n\nApril 26, 2013: Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, claimed that Clinton \u201coutright denied security in her signature in a cable, April 2012.\u201d Issa presented this as a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment, suggesting Clinton had perjured herself before Congress, but his claim relied on an absurd understanding of the word \u201csignature.\u201d Workers in the communications center put the secretary of state\u2019s signature on every cable from Washington, even if the secretary happens to be on the other side of the world at the time. There is no evidence Clinton was aware of this request for additional security \u2014 or this cable. Issa earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nThe Benghazi hearings: What\u2019s new and what\u2019s not\n\nAn alternative explanation for the Benghazi talking points: Bureaucratic knife fight\n\nMay 10, 2013: This analysis first suggested that the core reason for the evolution of the talking points was a bureaucratic battle between the CIA and the State Department. We informed readers that although the ambassador was killed, the Benghazi \u201cconsulate\u201d was not a consulate at all but essentially a secret CIA operation which included an effort to round up shoulder-launched missiles. U.S. officials had been constrained in discussing that fact, as the administration could not publicly admit that most of the Americans in Benghazi were involved in a secret CIA effort that had not even been formally disclosed to the Libyan government. State Department officials objected to the talking points, initially drafted by the CIA, as an effort by the spy agency to pin the blame for the tragedy on the State Department. (Here\u2019s a good explainer on the e-mails in question.)\n\nObama\u2019s claim he called Benghazi an \u2018act of terrorism\u2019\n\nMay 14, 2013: The president tried to rewrite history by claiming \u201cthe day after it happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\u201d But he had actually said \u201cact of terror\u201d\u2014 in vague terms, usually wrapped in a patriotic fervor: \u201cNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\u201d In fact, immediately after the Rose Garden statement the day after the attacks, Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and acknowledged that he had purposely avoided the using the word \u201cterrorism.\u201d (CBS did not release this clip until after the election.) There were other occasions when the president ducked questions about whether this was an act of terrorism. The president earned Four Pinocchios for his effort at revising history.\n\nMay 16, 2013: Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) suggested there was not enough security in Benghazi because Republicans had cut the budget for embassy security funding. But this claim was not credible and highly partisan. Democrats had also short-changed the State Department budget (compared to presidential requests), but funding for embassy security generally had increased significantly in recent years. Moreover, over the course of many hearings into the matter, State Department officials had told Congress that a lack of funds was not an issue. Instead, security was hampered because of bureaucratic issues and management failures. In other words, given the internal failures, no amount of money for the State Department likely would have made a difference in this tragedy. Boxer earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nThe White House claim of \u2018doctored e-mails \u2026 to smear the president\u2019\n\nHas anyone been \u2018fired\u2019 because of the Benghazi attacks?\n\nMay 22, 2013: The Fact Checker looked into a claim by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) that \u201cno one had been fired\u201d over the Benghazi affair. In December 2012, the State Department had announced that four top State Department officials were being dismissed from their posts. At the time of Paul\u2019s remarks, the officials still were on administrative leave, a netherworld of professional limbo, as their cases were reviewed. We initially rated this as \u201cverdict pending,\u201d but then Paul was proved right when State announced in August (when most of Washington is away) that the officials had been returned to active duty and would face no further disciplinary action. Paul thus ended up earning a coveted Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nIssa\u2019s \u2018suspicions\u2019 that Hillary Clinton told Panetta to \u2018stand down\u2019 on Benghazi", "lang": "en"}
