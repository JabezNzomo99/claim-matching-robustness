No, not exactly: a clickbait site running stories about health and nature in order to attract visitors copied an old article that had been circulating for some time on such sites but it contains several inaccuracies. Some of them make the story less bad while others unfortunately make it worse.\n\nThe story went massively viral via a version published on January 27, 2019 on Healthy Food House titled \"Two Whales Found Dead In Germany, Stomachs Full Of Plastic And Car Parts\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLast January, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on shores around the North Sea, which is an area too shallow for the marine wildlife. Yet, the details of their necropsy were released recently, and the findings disturbed scientists. A press release from Wadden Sea National Park in Schleswig-Holstein reported that the stomachs of many of the whales were full of plastic debris, including pieces of plastic litter, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a 70 cm piece of plastic from a car. While some believe that the whales consumed them thinking they were food, like squid, others maintain that this is mainly caused by the humanity's shocking disregard for marine life, which has led to high amounts of plastic in the oceans. Robert Habeck, environment minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, said: \"These findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. Animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, leading them to think the events described took place in 2018 or even 2019:\n\nFirst of all, the obvious contradiction: the headline speaks of two whales but the first paragraph says 29. Unfortunately the second number is the true one. But the events did not take place recently (like last month or last year) but in 2016. And not all the whales were found in Germany, in fact the strandings happened in Germany, France, the U.K. and The Netherlands:\n\nThe iconic picture with the two dead whales illustrating the story was actually taken in Skegness in the U.K. as can be seen in this article:\n\nOr here, in a local report:\n\nWHALE UPDATE: Dead whales are moved to Central Beach in Skegness TUESDAY 2.15pm: Work is underway to unite the three dead sperm whales in Skegness on Central Beach.A spokesman for East Lindsey District Council - the authority responsible for the removal of the carcasses - said the one that had beached at Lagoon Walk had moved in the tides overnight and was now covered in sand to stop it moving again.The others are being towed and pushed with a bulldozer from Gibraltar Point to Central Beach, ready for disposal.\n\nThe press release that is talked about in the article can be found here:\n\nIt does indeed say large amounts of plastic garbage were found in the stomachs of four of the thirteen whales that had stranded in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany but that this did not cause their deaths.\n\nSome of the bits of plastic were pictured in this Instagram photo of one of the researchers:\n\nSo there was definitely one Ford engine cover in there, but it is a matter of interpretation if this constitutes \"car parts\" or just a single \"car part\".\n\nWhat does seem clear though: this article has appeared around a dozen times so far on different websites that don't seem to care too much about accurate reporting as long as the clicks keep coming.", "lang": "en"}
