The law \u201cwill last as long as the risk of contagion of the coronavirus exists,\u201d and the use of the solution is \u201cvoluntary not mandatory,\u201d the Senate said.\n\nConsuming chlorine dioxide solution \u201cwill help the population have an alternative to face the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d as a \u201cmeans to prevent or treat the infection and the consequences caused by the Coronavirus,\u201d the Chamber of Deputies press release says.\n\nWhat is chlorine dioxide, and why is it dangerous?\n\nThe chemical has been used for decades in strictly regulated doses to decontaminate surfaces and disinfect water supplies. However, it\u2019s never been recommended as a medicine. To the contrary, as disinformation about its value as a COVID-19 treatment spreads during the pandemic, public health officials worldwide warn of the dangers and life-threatening consequences of drinking chlorine dioxide.\n\nIn the U.S., the substance approved by the Bolivian Congress is known as a Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS), and its production and distribution are prohibited under U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations because it poses a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to people\u2019s health.\n\nThe American Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSD) profiles chlorine dioxide as a substance hazardous for human health. The profile, based on peer-reviewed scientific studies, describes chlorine dioxide as a highly reactive yellow to reddish-yellow gas that decomposes rapidly in air.\n\nIn water, or any water-based compound (such as MMS and the Bolivian solution), chlorine dioxide quickly breaks down to form two other chemicals \u2013 chlorite and chlorate ions.\n\nThere have been no studies on humans, according to the ATSD, but animal tests found that chlorine dioxide compounds cause cancer, birth defects and delays in brain development.\n\nWhen these chemicals enter the human body in concentrations higher than 0.8 milligrams per liter, people will experience signs of toxic poisoning, such as irritation of the skin, throat and stomach. Those indicate damage to internal organs, the ATSD profile states.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, among the proven health effects of chlorine dioxide and chlorite are damage to the cardiovascular system, acute liver congestion and death. Some prolonged animal studies showed that chlorine dioxide and chlorite can alter DNA and the reproductive system.\n\nThe action by Bolivian lawmakers came despite warnings from the country\u2019s health ministry, which in June cited \u201cserious risks\u201d from consuming chlorine dioxide. At least five people have been poisoned after taking the substance in La Paz, the capital, the ministry said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Miraculous Mineral Solution\u2019, does not correspond to a drug and does not have a sanitary registration \u2026 that supports its safety, quality and efficacy to heal COVID-19. Therefore, its production, import, distribution, commercialization and use in our territory is illegal,\u201d the health ministry statement said.\n\nWhether the legislation authorizing the use of chlorine dioxide becomes law is now up to the country\u2019s interim president, Jeanine Anez. According to CNN, Anez is likely to stand by the health ministry\u2019s guidance and veto the legislation.\n\nHowever, according to Business Insider, an interim president has no constitutional right to veto legislation but can send the bill back to the Congress for further deliberation. The publication also reports that at least two people have died in the U.S. from consuming MMS.\n\nOn Aug. 5, Anez canceled the school year for Bolivia\u2019s 2 million children due to the coronavirus pandemic. Anez herself was infected and recovered from COVID-19 in July.\n\nAs of Aug. 11, Johns Hopkins University and Medicine data showed that Bolivia had more than 91,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and nearly 4,000 deaths from the disease.\n\nThe infections have overwhelmed the nation\u2019s health system, with police collecting hundreds of dead bodies abandoned on the streets and entrepreneurs building mobile crematoriums.\n\nBolivia has been experiencing political and socio-economic turmoil, with the nation divided between the interim administration and opposition-dominated Congress, which is controlled by supporters of socialist Evo Morales, who resigned as Bolivia\u2019s president in November 2019 after 13 years in office.\n\nMorales stepped down in the face of mass protests and the nullification of his election victory following allegations of manipulation and irregularities.", "lang": "en"}
