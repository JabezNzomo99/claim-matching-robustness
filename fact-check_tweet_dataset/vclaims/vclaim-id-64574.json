The claim is misleading; the footage was shot in 2019 during an unrelated protest in France; the comments made in the video were disowned by the French organisation which organised the protest.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on June 20, 2020. It has been viewed more than 4,800 times.\n\nThe 22-second footage shows a black man addressing the camera in English: \u201cIf you want to do xenophobia, ok, right, start to kill white people, start to kill Chinese people, start to kill Asian people, don\u2019t kill your brother.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s lengthy caption, written in traditional Chinese, purports to detail the writer\u2019s personal experience living in the US as an Asian person. It reads in part: \u201cDo you know who is the most discriminated against by black people in America? Asians! Asians are victims in most of the robbery, theft and murder.\n\n\"Black people have killed 15 cops, including two black cops, in this movement, injuring countless others. They remain innocent after all the destruction, robbery, arson and murder, but we are guilty if we don't show support.\n\n\u201cThis riot began in Minnesota, where there were originally no black people.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota \u201criot\u201d mentioned in the post refers to nationwide demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism in the US in May and June 2020. The protests were staged after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in the US state of Minnesota on May 25, 2020, as AFP reported here.\n\nThe video was also shared in June and July 2020 here and here on Twitter; here on YouTube; and here on Weibo with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the video was previously published here on Twitter on September 8, 2019, by French organisation Association L\u00c9A. The group, which changed its name to \"Fight For Equality in Anti-Racism\" in December 2019, describes itself as \"anti-racist\" and says it focusses on \"anti-white racism\".\n\nThe caption translates from French to English as: \u201cLDNA supporters call for the killing of whites and Asians in South Africa. We strongly condemn this call to murder and genocide. We demand the immediate intervention of the State to stop the activities of this hate group @CCastaner\u201d.\n\nA subsequent keyword search found this September 7, 2019, report by the French branch of RT, a Russian state broadcaster.\n\nThe report is entitled \u201c\u2018Start by killing white people\u2019: Has the LDNA called for racial crime in South Africa?\u201d. It states the speech in the video in the misleading post was recorded during a demonstration in front of the South African Embassy in Paris on September 6.\n\nThe rally was held following a spate of xenophobic violence in Johannesburg, as reported by AFP here.\n\nA keyword search on Facebook found this statement from the group LDNA, or Ligue de d\u00e9fense noire africaine, published on September 8, 2019.\n\nIn the statement, LDNA apologised for the incident and said it had removed the video in the misleading post from its Facebook page because it did not \"endorse\" the man's comments.\n\n\u201cStatements made in English by a sympathising brother who is not an LDNA member are in no way acceptable, and we do not endorse them because in the LDNA's commitment to defend the rights of our community, we call for respect for everyone,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe video in the misleading post was filmed outside the South African Embassy in Paris, as seen on Google Street View here.", "lang": "en"}
