Moreover, we found that the verified page of the National Crime Investigation Bureau had taken to Facebook to bust the claims conflating the identities of the two young girls.\n\nThe post also said that the NCIB\u2019s Darbhanga team had spoken to Kumari to confirm this and quoted her as saying, \u201cI have received calls from many people, but I am fine. Preparing for a cycle trial right now. I don't even know the victim (name withheld).\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the post also attached a photo that Kumari had sent of herself from a few days ago, as evidence that she was very much alive and okay.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that while there has been a death of a young girl, it is not the same girl as the cycling hero. Two completely unrelated girls\u2019 identities are being conflated on social media.", "lang": "en"}
