Thank you to everyone who sent us quotes for checking via Twitter using the hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA, on Facebook or by email.\n\nInequality, class and social mobility in Australia were key issues discussed on a recent episode of Q&A.\n\nSocial researcher and author Rebecca Huntley noted an uptick in the idea of \u201cthe undeserving poor\u201d in Australia \u2013 particularly where homeless people are concerned.\n\nHuntley noted the perception held by some that homeless Australians are simply \u201cnot working hard enough\u201d.\n\nChallenging that narrative, Huntley said \u201cabout 30% of those homeless people have a job\u201d.\n\nIs that right?\n\nIn response to The Conversation\u2019s request for sources, Huntley provided data from the Census of Population and Housing: Estimating homelessness, 2016 report, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in March 2018.\n\nHuntley also pointed to the article: \u201cThe rise of homelessness and hunger\u201d, written by Mike Seccombe and published in The Saturday Paper, and the website of \u201cEverybody\u2019s Home \u2013 A National Housing Campaign\u201d.\n\nThe definition of homelessness in the Census is probably broader than community perceptions about homelessness \u2013 that is, that all homeless people are sleeping rough on the streets. People who are couch surfing or living in their car or living in overcrowded accommodation may well fit into this definition. They may also be working in the gig economy or getting work here and there (the double whammy of insecure work and insecure housing is quite terrible). What the Census 2016 data show is that there are people with post compulsory education, with various levels of work and hours worked across all categories of people living in insecure housing arrangements.\n\nBased on the best available data, Rebecca Huntley\u2019s statement that \u201cabout 30% of \u2026 homeless people have a job\u201d is correct.\n\nAccording to Census 2016 data, about 30% of people who were recorded as being homeless on Census night (using the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of homeless) were also recorded as being in the work force.\n\nWhat does it mean to be \u2018homeless\u2019?\n\nWhen we talk about \u201chomelessness\u201d, many of us would think about people \u201csleeping rough\u201d on the street. This is arguably the most severe and literal form of homelessness. But the state of being homeless is more complex than that.\n\nUnder the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) definition, a person can be considered homeless if their current living arrangement:\n\u2022 is in a dwelling that is inadequate\n\u2022 has no tenure, or if their initial tenure is short and not extendable, or\n\u2022 does not allow them to have control of, and access to space for social relations.\n\nThe ABS presents its estimates of homelessness using these groupings:\n\u2022 People living in improvised dwellings, tents or sleeping out\n\u2022 People in supported accommodation for the homeless\n\u2022 People in other temporary lodgings, and\n\nOn the night of the 2016 Census, more than 116,000 people were counted as being homeless. This includes both children and adults. The estimates of the employment rate include only those age 15 and over.\n\nThis may be a conservative count, because some groups of people may be underenumerated (under counted) in the Census.\n\nFor example, the ABS notes that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 are \u201cmore likely to be both underenumerated and over represented in the homeless population\u201d, and that:\n\nIn the Census data, people are counted as being employed if they are of working age (age 15 and over) and:\n\u2022 employed but away from work.\n\nHowever, not all people age 15 and over who were experiencing homelessness were counted in the Census labour force statistics. For some people, no information was recorded.\n\nIf we calculate the known employment rate for homeless people (using the ABS definition of homelessness outlined above), we find that around 30% are employed, as Rebecca Huntley said on Q&A.\n\nBut the employment rate among homeless people could be higher.\n\nThat\u2019s because we don\u2019t have employment information for all homeless people. In the Census statistics, there are large numbers of people for whom information on employment status is missing, or not stated.\n\nOverall, we don\u2019t have records of the employment status of about 18% of the total homeless population.\n\nAlso, many people experiencing homelessness could be in situations where they wouldn\u2019t be expected to work. For example, full-time students or the elderly.\n\nThis makes 30% likely to be the lower bound.\n\nIf we assume that the employment rate of those with missing information is the same as those with recorded information, the employment rate would increase to 36%. If we also excluded full-time students and the elderly from these statistics, the rate would be even higher.\n\n\u201cSleeping rough\u201d, or sleeping on the street, is arguably the most severe form of homelessness.\n\nPeople sleeping rough are the group with the highest proportion of missing information on labour force status. The known employment rate for people sleeping rough is 10%.\n\nIf about half of the people with missing information were employed, the rate would go up to 30%. My assumption for this group is that most of those people with missing information are not employed.\n\nSo for those sleeping rough, the employment rate is probably closer to 10-15%.\n\nThe employment rate for people in supported accommodation is also likely to be around 10-15%. These two groups are those usually considered when a more literal definition of homelessness is used.\n\nBut as outlined in this FactCheck, the state of being \u201chomeless\u201d is more complex and wide ranging than that.\n\nAnother useful data set on homelessness and employment is the Melbourne Institute\u2019s Journeys Home survey, of which I was the Deputy Director.\n\nThis longitudinal survey, which began in 2011 and concluded in 2014, included 1,682 people in Australia flagged by Centrelink as either \u201chomeless\u201d or \u201cat-risk of homelessness\u201d.\n\nThe survey also included a group of income support recipients who were not flagged as homeless, but who had characteristics similar to those who had been homeless.\n\nThe overall rate of employment among all respondents was 27%. Of those who were homeless, 19% were employed.\n\nIn our study, however, we did not include those in overcrowded accommodation as being homeless. (These people are identified as being homeless in the Census).\n\nThis highlights the importance of the definition of \u201chomelessness\u201d used when considering the characteristics of the homeless population.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that just because someone isn\u2019t employed doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to be employed, or aren\u2019t seeking employment. Being homeless is a significant barrier to gaining \u2013 and retaining \u2013 a job. \u2013 Rosanna Scutella\n\nI agree with the verdict of this FactCheck that the overall rate of employment among people experiencing or being at-risk of homelessness is in the vicinity of 30%.\n\nI would add that findings from my research using the Journeys Home data reveal that homelessness is more strongly associated with difficulty in retaining employment than with finding employment. \u2013 Neha Swami\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit was the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
