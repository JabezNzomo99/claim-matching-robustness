They measure disability using a survey, and changed the questions slightly in 2012/13 to bring their measure of disability in line with the Equality Act 2010 definition.\n\nThe questionnaire changes were relatively minor and the DWP said there is no reason to expect they had a major effect on the data. Indeed from 2011/12 to 2012/13 the prevalence of disabilities was stable despite the questionnaire change.\n\nSince 2012/13 the proportion of working-age adults with a disability has risen from 16% to 19%. The proportion of all people with a disability is 22%, which has also been slowly increasing. Mobility is the most common impairment, affecting just over half of all disabled people.\n\nMental health impairments have become more common in the past two years, affecting 20% of disabled people in 2014/15, up to 24% in 2016/17. Among working-age adults with a disability, it is the second most common impairment.", "lang": "en"}
