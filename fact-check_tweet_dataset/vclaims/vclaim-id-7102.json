In reality, the reason Trump was left so many vacancies is that Republicans virtually stopped confirming federal judges appointed by Obama during his final two years as president.\n\nIn speeches, interviews and tweets, Trump regularly boasts about the number of confirmed federal judges as a sign of his success. Just as often, Trump criticizes Senate Democrats \u2014 and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in particular \u2014 for \u201cobstructing\u201d or \u201cslow-walking\u201d his judicial appointments.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\u2022 At an Oct. 16, 2017, press conference: \u201cBut something that people aren\u2019t talking about is how many judges we\u2019ve had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges. We have \u2014 tremendous \u2014 right now under review; the Democrats are holding them up beyond anything \u2014 beyond comprehension, they\u2019re holding them up. I mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy \u2014 terrible policy \u2014 and perhaps they\u2019re not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction. So I looked at some of these numbers, between the judges \u2014 and I want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges.\u201d\n\u2022 In a March 14 tweet: \u201cHundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history!\u201d\n\u2022 In remarks at the NRA\u2019s Leadership Forum on May 4: \u201cIn my first year, I nominated, and the Senate confirmed, more circuit judges than any new administration, by far, in history. And we will have the all-time record very soon.\u201d\n\u2022 At an April 28 rally in Michigan: \u201cWe\u2019re appointing judges like I guess never before has anything happened like what we\u2019re doing on great conservative Republican judges. We\u2019re setting records and by the time we finish, I think we will have the all-time record.\u201d\n\u2022 In an April 26 interview on Fox News: \u201cChuck Schumer and the group take, you know, years to approve them \u2014 years. We have judges that are waiting. Top of the line people. The best people in our country and by the way, they\u2019re going to be approved, but they take them out until the very, very end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know, they can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Schumer said during a press conference on May 15. \u201cThey can\u2019t brag that they put in more judges than anybody else and then, at the same time, say they\u2019re not getting \u2014 they\u2019re being obstructed. So they ought to figure out where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nOn May 2, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service released a report, \u201cU.S. Circuit and District Court Nominations During President Trump\u2019s First Year in Office: Comparative Analysis with Recent Presidents,\u201d that provides some historical context.\n\nCRS Finding: Trump had the most circuit court confirmations of any first-year president since at least Harry Truman.\n\nThe report found that in his first year, Trump nominated 19 people to the U.S. circuit court of appeals, 12 of whom were confirmed during his first year; and he nominated 49 people to U.S. district court judgeships, six of whom were confirmed in Trump\u2019s first year.\n\nThe 12 circuit court confirmations is the most for any first year president dating to at least 1945, CRS said.\n\nA Los Angeles Times analysis concluded, \u201cOne year into his presidency, Donald Trump is among the most successful presidents when it comes to appointing federal judges.\u201d The analysis found Trump ranked sixth out of 19 top ranking presidents for the highest number of federal circuit and district court judges appointed in their first year.\n\nCRS Finding: Trump\u2019s judicial nominees were confirmed more quickly than Obama\u2019s.\n\nAccording to CRS, in Trump\u2019s first year it took an average of 115 days and a median of 109 days between nomination and confirmation. (Median is the midpoint, meaning half took more than 109 days and half were less.)\n\nThat\u2019s a relatively long wait time by historical standards, but it\u2019s less time \u2014 by average and median \u2014 than for those appointed by Obama in his first year. (Both Trump and Obama enjoyed a Senate majority from their own party in their first year.)\n\n\u201cOf the four Presidents included in the table, President Trump\u2019s first-year nominees had the second longest average and median number of days from nomination to confirmation (President Obama\u2019s nominees had the longest average and median \u2014 137 and 130 days, respectively),\u201d the CRS report said.\n\nThe CRS report also notes that, \u201cThe average and median number of days from nomination to confirmation for President Trump\u2019s first-year nominees represent a departure from the upward trend in the length of time first-year nominees waited to be confirmed during the previous three presidencies. Specifically, it is the first instance over the past several presidencies in which the average and median wait times from nomination to confirmation of a President\u2019s first-year nominees were both shorter than the average and median wait times of his immediate predecessor\u2019s first-year nominees.\u201d\n\nCRS Finding: Half of Trump\u2019s circuit court nominees were approved in less than 100 days \u2013 the highest percentage of any president since Bill Clinton.\n\nIt also marks the first time since 1993 that at least half of a president\u2019s first-year circuit court nominees were confirmed in less than 100 days, CRS noted. Six of Trump\u2019s 12 circuit court nominees were approved in less than 100 days, but none of Obama\u2019s three and only two of Bush\u2019s six were approved that quickly, the report found.\n\nThe wait times for district court nominees have been decidedly longer for Trump. Two district court nominees, Dabney L. Friedrich and Scott L. Palk, waited 173 and 171 days, respectively, the longest wait times since 2001 in a president\u2019s first year.\n\nRussell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Governance Studies Program and president of the Governance Institute, provided us more up-to-date data on Trump\u2019s federal court nominees.\n\nAs of May 16, Trump had 21 circuit judges confirmed, including two earlier this week, Wheeler said. The median from nomination to confirmation of the circuit court judges was 131 days. Trump has had 17 district court judges confirmed with a median confirmation length of 180 days.\n\nAt the same point in his presidency, Obama had 16 district confirmations with a median length of 125 days. The median for his nine circuit confirmations was 218 days, Wheeler said.\n\n\u201cThe important point is that median days to confirmation have been increasing steadily [for presidents leading up to Trump],\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cSo far, Trump confirmations have been quicker.\u201d\n\nCRS Finding: A higher percentage of Trump\u2019s district court nominees were less qualified than Obama\u2019s, while the percentage of qualified circuit court judges was about the same.\n\nCRS made several other observations about Trump\u2019s federal court nominees compared to his immediate predecessors.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s 19 nominees for circuit court judge, 84 percent received a rating of well-qualified by the American Bar Association. That\u2019s about the same percentage as Obama\u2019s (83 percent). However, among Trump\u2019s 49 district court nominees, just 53 percent were rated well-qualified (compared to 86 percent from Obama).\n\nCRS also found more general opposition to Trump\u2019s nominees by Democrats. \u201cFloor consideration of U.S. circuit and district court nominations during the first year of the Trump presidency frequently involved the use of the cloture process to reach Senate confirmation,\u201d CRS wrote. A cloture motion is used to limit debate and requires three-fifths, or 60 votes, to pass. In Trump\u2019s first year, CRS said \u201ccloture was used for each of the 12 circuit court nominations that received a final up-or-down vote and for 5 of the 6 district court nominations that received a final vote. In contrast, during the first years of the other three presidencies included in this report\u2019s analysis, the cloture process was used once to reach an up-or-down vote on a circuit or district court nomination.\u201d Even so, as we said, Trump\u2019s nominees took less time to be confirmed than Obama\u2019s. \u201cAdditionally,\u201d CRS wrote, \u201cthe confirmation of nominees always occurred by roll call vote (rather than by unanimous consent or voice vote) and, for most circuit court nominations, was marked by a relatively high number of \u2018nay\u2019 votes among Senators not belonging to the President\u2019s party.\u201d We should also note that Trump usually couches his complaint about Democrats obstructing judicial nominees with a more general complain about Democrats slow-walking all of his government appointees. A joint project of the Partnership for Public Service and the Washington Post tracks roughly 600 \u201ckey executive branch nominations through the confirmation process.\u201d According to the project\u2019s data, as of May 17, the Senate had confirmed 426 of his appointments, with another 195 pending. The average time to confirm was 85 days \u2014 18 days longer than Obama\u2019s and longer than for former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. But, as we wrote in \u201cWho\u2019s to Blame for Slow Confirmations?\u201d in October, Trump and the Democrats both share some blame for the longer confirmation process under Trump. Trump also revises history when he talks about the number of vacancies on the federal court he inherited from the Obama administration. Here\u2019s how Trump put it during a fundraiser in Missouri on March 14. Trump, March 14: So I come and there\u2019s this whole pile of papers on my desk \u2013 these are federal judges, these are applications. I said, \u201cHow many do we appoint?\u201d \u201c145.\u201d \u201c145!\u201d Because for two years, two and a half years, almost none were appointed by President Obama. So I say thank you, President Obama. Two weeks later, Trump expounded on the same topic during a speech in Ohio. Trump, March 30: You know, when I got in, we had over 100 federal judges that weren\u2019t appointed. Now, I don\u2019t know why Obama left that. It was like a big, beautiful present to all of us. Why the hell did he leave that? Maybe he got complacent. But now we have about 145 federal district judges. We have 17 court of appeals judges. And as I said, we have the one Supreme Court justice. But think of 145 district judges. That\u2019s world-changing, country-changing, USA-changing. And we\u2019re going all out. We have unbelievably talented, smart, great people being put in those slots. But we were left a present. I never said this before. It was like the gift from Heaven. We were left judges. They\u2019re the ones that judge on your disputes. They judge on what\u2019s fair on the environment and what\u2019s not fair; where they\u2019re going to take your farms and factories away, and where they\u2019re not. Amazing. It was the gift. Thank you very much, President Obama. We all appreciate it. Thank you. What happened? How did he do that? How did he do that? When Trump took office, in January 2017, there were 112 federal judicial vacancies. By the end of the year, that number had grown to 144. And was at 146 as of May 18. That\u2019s a high number, and according to the Federal Bar Association it is \u201cstraining the capacity of the federal courts to administer justice in an adequate and timely manner.\u201d But is Obama to blame for the high number of vacancies? No, it was not the result of complacency by Obama, as Trump suggested, but rather resistance to Obama\u2019s judicial nominations from Senate Republicans who took over a majority during the last two years of Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cOn the matter of obstruction, consider why Trump has so many vacancies to fill: because Republicans, when they took control of the Senate in 2015, practically stopped confirming judges,\u201d Wheeler, from Brookings told us. \u201cThey confirmed 18 in those two years. In the final two years of Reagan\u2019s eight years, with Democrats in the Senate majority, 83 confirmations. With Clinton, in final two years, with Republicans in the majority, 73. In Bush\u2019s final two of eight years, with Democrats in the majority, 68.\u201d We should also note that Republicans blocked Obama\u2019s attempt to fill a Supreme Court opening. Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in March of 2016, but the Senate Republicans refused to consider his nomination. In early January 2017, just before Trump took office, there were 59 federal court nominees pending. That\u2019s why Trump inherited so many vacancies.", "lang": "en"}
