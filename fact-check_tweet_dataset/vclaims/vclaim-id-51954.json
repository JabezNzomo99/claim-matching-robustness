Individuals cannot apply for food stamps through that number and must meet certain income and resource criteria to be eligible for them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Emergency Response Act into law on March 18. That law aimed in part to relieve the economic burdens of Americans whose livelihoods have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic, including earmarking funds for SNAP benefits, among other measures, according to The New York Times.\n\nA viral Facebook post alleges that any person who calls a specific number can receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, saying, \u201cIf u don\u2019t get food stamps call this number 18556354370 and sign up they are giving it to everyone.\u201d\n\nThe phone number connects callers to a toll-free helpline operated by the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS). Cletisha Lovelace, associate director of public affairs at VDSS, told the Daily Caller that individuals cannot apply to receive food stamps through it, however.\n\n\u201cApplicants must meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify for food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,\u201d Lovelace said in an email. \u201cApplications should be submitted online at commonhelp.virginia.gov or through their local department of social services, not through the phone number listed.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website notes that applicants must meet certain income and resource limits to qualify for food stamps.
