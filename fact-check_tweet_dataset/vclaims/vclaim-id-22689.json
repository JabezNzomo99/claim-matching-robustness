The motorcycle was registered under the name of Pragya Thakur.\n\nIn the charge sheet filed by ATS, it was mentioned that the motorcycle was given by Thakur to Ramchandra Kalsangar. He, along with Sandeep Dhange (also known as Sandeep Dange), implemented the attack. Further, as per the charge sheet, Thakur also facilitated the procurement of explosives to the duo through another accused.\n\nIn 2011, the case was then transferred to the NIA on the orders of the then UPA government. The Bombay High Court had decided to grant her bail in April 2017, for which it had two reasons. First, it raised questions over whether or not the evidence showed there was a prima facie case against Thakur, and noted that the evidence cited didn\u2019t point to her alone. Second, it took into consideration Thakur\u2019s medical condition \u2013 she had informed the court she had cancer (read a separate fact check on that here).\n\nWhat is crucial to note though is that the Bombay High Court expressly clarified that what it said in the bail order was applicable only in relation to Thakur\u2019s bail plea. The order specifically said that the trial court should not be influenced by these observations.", "lang": "en"}
