This would be a punishable offence, asserts the message. DMA was passed in the Parliament in 2005.\n\nThe complete forward reads, \u201c*Tonight 12(midnight) onwards Disaster Management Act has been implemented across the country. According to this update, apart from the Govt department no other citizen is allowed to post any update or share any forward related to Coronavirus, it being punishable offence.**Group Admins are requested to post the above update and inform all in the group.* Stay home ..Stay safe.\u201d\n\nOn WhatsApp, it is being forwarded with a link of a Live Law report and requests all \u2018group admins\u2019 to close groups for two days or else police can book people under Sections 68, 144 and 188.\n\nA read through the Live Law article itself suggests that the message promotes false information. Here\u2019s what the title of the article says \u2013 \u2018Centre Seeks SC Direction That No Media Should Publish COVID-19 News Without First Ascertaining Facts With Govt.\u2019\n\nThe article talks about the central government seeking a direction from the top court that no media outlets publish any COVID-19 related news \u201cwithout first ascertaining facts from the mechanism provided by the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsidering the very nature of the infectious disease which the world is struggling to deal with, any panic reaction by any section of the society based upon such reporting would not only be harmful for such situation but would harm the entire nation. It is, therefore, in the largest interest of justice that when this court has taken cognizance, this court is pleased to issue a direction that no electronic/print media/ web portal or social media shall print/ publish or telecast anything without first ascertaining the true factual position from the separate mechanism provided by the Central government,\u201d read the affidavit, as reported by Live Law.\n\nThe complete affidavit in question uploaded by Live Law can be read here. The following excerpt from the affidavit makes a reference to the Disaster Management Act: \u201cIt is submitted that such an act of creating panic is also a criminal offence under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. However, an appropriate direction from this Hon\u2019ble Court would protect the country from any potential and inevitable consequence resulting from a false alarm having the potential of creating panic in a section of the society.\u201d\n\nOn April 2, the Supreme Court ordered the media to \u201crefer to and publish the official version\u201d about COVID-19 developments is in the spirit of the provisions of the Disaster Management Act of 2005, reported The Hindu. However, the article further states, \u201cHowever, the Act, on the other hand, does not contemplate an arrangement whereby the media \u2013 print, electronic and social media \u2013 first ascertain the \u201cfactual position\u201d from the government side before publishing or airing \u201canything\u201d on COVID-19.\u201d The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had pressed for such a directive from the Supreme Court on March 31 in the \u201clarger interest of justice.\u201d\n\nLive Law tweeted about the misinformation circulating in its name.\n\nFurthermore, the legal news portal called out the false news in a separate article: \u201cThe report has no connection with the fake message. It is clear from a bare perusal of the report that it does not convey the news as sought to be spread through the fake message.\u201d\n\nThe fact-check wing of the Press Information Bureau (PIB) also tweeted about the misinformation and additionally provided Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act. It is noteworthy that the Act specifically talks about offences and penalties for promoting false claims and false warnings that lead to panic.\n\nTherefore, the viral message concerning the Disaster Management Act is misleading. The Act does not bar people from posting \u201canything\u201d about coronavirus. Furthermore, the Live Law article was shared along with the viral message to give credibility to the false claim. It is noteworthy that the centre had invoked the Epidemic Act 1897 and the DMA earlier in March. The step was taken to prevent the spread of the viral infection. Provisions of the legislation allow for the detention of people or any vessel that come from international shores and are seen as a potent threat.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 5,000 and more than 150 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 14 lakh confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.
