Joe Rwamirama, 48, from Kampala, Uganda says boffins have launched a study into the chemical properties of his unique trouser toxin. The odd job man says no one in his home village has ever contracted malaria because his powers knock out insects over a six mile radius. If true, that would make his fallout zone larger than that of the atomic bomb which destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\u201d\n\nThe Sun\u2019s article also included purported quotations from a \u201clocal barber\u201d and a \u201clocal chief\u201d:\n\n\u201cLocal barber James Yoweri said: \u2018He is known all over the city as the man who can kill mosquitoes with his farts. When Joe is around we all know that mosquitoes will vanish. He is respectful of people around him and will only fart when there are mosquitoes around which bring malaria. His farts gets rid of this disease.\u2019\n\n\u201cA Local chief who knew Joe, when he was growing up as a child, said he took him in to live with him during the malaria season and claimed no one nearby caught the disease. The chief said: \u2018I heard about Joe\u2019s gift and I took him in to help mop out the mosquitoes infesting our surroundings. He respectfully drops these bloomers and it helped eradicate the insects. He does his thing and they drop \u2013 like flies.'\u201d\n\nSimilar stories were published by other U.K. tabloids the Daily Mirror and Daily Star, and in several countries around the world, including Denmark, Germany, Croatia, Ecuador, and India. BBC Somali and the New Zealand Herald also published stories on \u201cJoe Rwamirama\u2019s\u201d legendary flatulence, as did the U.S.-based websites Barstool Sports and RedState.\n\nHowever, the entire episode was a hoax. The Rwamirama story first emerged on Dec. 9 on the website Ihlayanews. The site\u2019s header contains the disclaimer \u201cnuusparodie waarvan jy hou,\u201d which is \u201cnews parody you like,\u201d in the Afrikaans language. We have previously examined several articles labeled as satire, which emerged from the same website. The Ihlayanews Facebook page carries the following disclaimer, clearly labeling Ihlayanews.com \u201ca news parody and satire website\u201d:\n\n\u201cPosts on this page and ihlayanews.com website may contain traces of truth. We do all we can to make sure the articles are complete fiction. All articles in our website are meant for mature audience with a dark sense of humour. If you feel offended in any way by our articles and you want to fight, please send us a place and time. Ihlayanews.com is a news parody and satire website.\u201d\n\nThe Rwamirama hoax was picked up by the Nigerian websites Newsbreak and Talk of NAIJA, and from there, spread among more mainstream websites in the U.K., Europe, India and New Zealand. Many of the reports mentioned in this fact check, including the original Ihlayanews piece, used the same image, giving readers the clear impression that it showed Rwamirama:\n\nIn reality, that photograph was taken by the photographer Olivia Acland in the Democratic Republic of Congo and published by Reuters news agency in July 2019. The photograph\u2019s original caption read: \u201cA health worker checks the temperature of a man as part of the ebola screening upon entering the General Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, July 15, 2019.\u201d\n\nWhile all of the news organizations and websites mentioned above were taken in by what turned out to be a hoax, The Sun engaged in the greatest measure of embellishment in their retelling of the false story.\n\nFirst, the tabloid greatly expanded the purported range of Rwamirama\u2019s flatulence, taking the (non-existent) \u201csix-meter radius\u201d from the original (fake) Ihlayanews article, and increasing it more than a thousandfold, to a \u201csix mile radius,\u201d which authors Nick Parker and Chris Maximim breathlessly compared to the impact range of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb.\n\nSecond, despite the fact that the story was a hoax, the Sun managed to obtain additional comments on Rwamirama\u2019s purportedly powerful flatulence, attributing two separate direct quotations to a \u201clocal barber\u201d identified as \u201cJames Yoweri\u201d and an unnamed \u201clocal chief.\u201d Either Parker and Maximim were taken in three times over by including what they thought were quotes from two additional authentic sources, or they made those sources up.\n\nAfter Newshub reported that the story was a hoax, the New Zealand Herald deleted their original article. However, as of Dec. 12, every other report cited in this fact check was still available online.", "lang": "en"}
