It includes a photograph of him with the name \u201cBarry Soetoro\u201d and the words \u2018Foreign student\u2019 underneath in capital letters.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\u200b\n\nOne post reads: \u201cWell well well.... look whats surfaced. Lets see how long it takes for it to be taken down. Until then, share the [expletive] out of it!\u201d Lower down, it says: \u201cFacebook is taking this photo down left and right. Make it go viral!\u201d\n\nA Google search shows that this false claim has been circulating for years. Snopes reported in 2012 that the ID card with the number shown in the image belonged to a student named Thomas Lugert ( here ).\n\nThe photo of the original ID appears on a blog that Lugert wrote about his experience at Columbia University ( archive.vn/TU4et ). The word \"student\" in Lugert\u2019s ID has been altered to \"foreign student\" in the claim. \u200b\n\nID cards like the one shown in the claim weren\u2019t introduced by Columbia until 1996 ( here ). Obama graduated with the class of 1983 ( here ).\n\nThe photograph of Obama used in the claim is from a book about his life. It can be seen on the cover of \"Barack Obama: The Story\" by David Maraniss ( here ).\u200b\n\nSoetoro was the last name of Obama\u2019s Indonesian stepfather Lolo. It may have been used in the claim to make him sound more foreign ( here ) \u200b\n\nObama served two terms as U.S. president, from 2009 to 2017. In 2011, he took the rare step of publishing his long-form birth certificate to prove that he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and rebut conspiracy theories \u2013 backed at the time by Donald Trump, among others - that he was not born in America and therefore ineligible under the constitution to be president. ( here ). Trump abandoned the \u2018birther\u2019 claim in 2016 after promoting it for five years ( here ).\n\nFalse. The image purporting to be Barack Obama\u2019s \u2018foreign student\u2019 ID card is a fake.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
