This was broadly the finding of a Public Health England (PHE) review into five specific types of medication\u2014although the figures were for adults in England rather than all people across the UK or Great Britain.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all of these people have an addiction or dependency on these drugs, in fact PHE specifically said it wasn\u2019t possible to say how many people had a dependency based on the data. This was generally correctly reported by the media, but the social media headline used by the Daily Mail \u00ad\u00adsaying that \u201cone in four people is hooked on prescription drugs\u201d (which wasn\u2019t repeated in its article), is incorrect.\n\n11.5 million people received at least one prescription for a drug that could cause dependency\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) published the findings of a review into five different classes of prescribed medication. These were benzodiazepines (mainly prescribed for anxiety and insomnia), Z-drugs (prescribed for insomnia), gabapentinoids (for neuropathic pain), opioid pain medications and antidepressants.\n\nUsing data from prescriptions, it found that around a quarter of adults in England (or 11.5 million people) had received a prescription for at least one of these medicines in 2017/18 and then had that prescription dispensed.\n\nOn the whole, PHE found that \u201cPrescriptions for antidepressants and gabapentinoids are increasing, but prescriptions for opioid pain medicines are decreasing, after rising for many years. Prescriptions for benzodiazepines continue to fall, and those for z-drugs have more recently started to fall.\u201d\n\nIt also says that \u201cIt is difficult to determine the prevalence of dependence on, or withdrawal from, the medicines covered in the review from any available data sets, but the data on the duration of prescribing suggests that dependence and withdrawal are likely to be significant issues\u201d.\n\nSo although these drugs have the potential to cause dependency, this is not always the case.", "lang": "en"}
