Also, there is no indication the Education Minister has made any such announcement.\n\nMost of Ghana\u2019s students are currently at home due to COVID-19 restrictions except for final year Senior and Junior School students and University students who the government cleared to resume classes in June 2020 to complete their academic terms and sit for their exit examinations.\n\n\u201cFrom Monday, 15th June 2020, the decision has been taken, after engagement with the Teacher Unions, whose co-operation I salute, to re-open schools and universities to allow for final-year junior high, senior high and university students to resume classes ahead of the conduct of their respective exit examinations. Indeed, final year university students are to report to their universities on 15th June; final year senior high school (SHS 3) students, together with SHS 2 Gold Track students, on 22nd June; and final-year junior high school (JHS 3) students on 29th June. JHS 3 classes will comprise a maximum of thirty (30) students; SHS classes a maximum of twenty-five (25) students, and University lectures will take place with half the class sizes,\u201d President Akufo-Addo announced on May 31, 2020.\n\nHowever, some website publications claim the Minister for Education, Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has announced that all Ghanaian students are returning to school in September 2020.\n\nWebsites such as AddressGhana.com, Mediaghananews and Hardtruthgh.com that have published the stories claim that the minister said the decision was taken following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe green light for the resuming of all Ghanaian students has finally been shown, as students ranging from basic school to tertiary are to return back to their respective classrooms on Tuesday, 8th September 2020\u2026.According to the minister, since all restrictions as far as the pandemic is concerned has been lifted, it has also become necessary for schools to also resume. He went on to say, with the easing of the restrictions, these students will be seen all over the place, which wouldn\u2019t be better off than them being school,\u201d excerpts of the report read.\n\nThe claim has been shared on some pages on social media.\n\nGiven that most students are currently at home due to COVID-19 restrictions, such a major announcement would be expected to be widely reported by credible media websites. However, Dubawa did not find the report on any major website.\n\nThe Ministry of Information has denied reports of schools resuming next month.\n\n\u201cThe ministry will like to state categorically that aside from final-year students who are in school, the public should disregard reports going round that all other students would go to school in September,\u201d the Chief Director of the Ministry of Education (MoE), Mr Benjamin K. Gyasi, said.\n\nAlso, the Ghana Education Service (GES), an agency under the Ministry which superintends over all basic and pre-tertiary affairs, said it has not issued any statement to that effect.\n\nCassandra Twum Ampofo, the Public Relations Officer of Ghana Education Service (GES), told Dubawa that the GES does not have any specific date yet as to when schools will reopen.\n\n\u201cFor school reopening, we have not issued any statement out there. We don\u2019t have any specific date as to when schools will reopen,\u201d she said.\n\nOur further checks showed that the publication was first made by Hardtruthgh.com.\n\nAfter browsing through the website, we found that it had been stated at its \u201cabout us\u201d section at the bottom of the home page that they describe themselves as \u201cGhana\u2019s leading Satire and Parody portal.\u201d\n\nThe publication contains no element of parody or satire but clear falsehood deliberately created to misinform the public.\n\nWe, therefore, find the claim to be false.\n\nThe journalist produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Citinewsroom.com to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
