Most of these videos on one panel show the viral video of a person jumping around on a bed and on the other panel show people reacting in shock.\n\nWe also found the same video on Twitter with the caption saying, \"Last video of SSR. Full depression\"\n\n\n\nA search on TikTok led us to the original video posted by a US based content creator on his TikTok account. The video was posted in April as a funny sketch by Ben Esqueda about being single.\n\nThe video was posted by Ben Esqueda a US based content creator popular on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Esqueda captioned his video as, \"When you fall in love in your dream but then wake up to an empty bed\" with the video description saying, 'I can't believe I woke up to this'. It shows Esqueda jumping around on the bed and throwing pillows and the bed cover.\n\nThe video was posted on April 9, two months before Rajput's death.
