The claim is false; the WHO denied issuing the report; as of May 2020, health experts have said there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a vegetarian diet prevents infection from COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was made in a text graphic published on Facebook here on March 14, 2020.\n\nThe Hindi text translates to English as: \u201cNot a single vegetarian has contracted coronavirus in the entire world: WHO Report. Amazing Sanatana Dharma. Hail Hindutva.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe terms \u201cSanatana Dharma\u201d and \u201cHindutva\u201d both refer to aspects of Hinduism, which promotes a vegetarian diet.\n\nSimilar claims were also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\n\u201cThe WHO has not made such a statement,\u201d Supriya Bezbaruah, the WHO\u2019s India representative, told AFP via WhatsAPP on May 2, 2020.\n\nDr. R.V. Asokan, the secretary general of the Indian Medical Association, also refuted the claim about vegetarians being protected against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no truth in this claim. There is no medical evidence that non-vegetarian food is in any way related to covid death susceptibility,\u201d he told AFP by phone on May 5, 2020.\n\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in early 2020, health experts have stressed that people should maintain a healthy diet to avoid a weakened immune system due to poor nutrition.\n\nThe WHO states here and here that meat, if properly prepared, can be consumed during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
