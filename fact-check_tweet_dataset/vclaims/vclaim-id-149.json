In fact, an extra \u00a310,000 has been made available by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to MPs\u2019 office costs budget, in order to cover the additional expenditure of setting up remote working for MPs and their staff as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak (here).\n\nThe posts were shared as an image on Facebook. Text is overlaid on a photo of Health Secretary Matt Hancock and reads: \u201cNHS workers risking their lives refused any pay rise. MPs awarding themselves \u00a310,000 extra expenses to \u2018work from home\u2019.\u201d The reference to NHS pay likely relates to a 2017 amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech proposing an end to a public sector pay cap. It was voted down in the House of Commons (here , here.\n\nMembers of Parliament have not had control over their expenses budget since 2010, when IPSA was established (here) as an independent body with responsibility for setting MPs\u2019 salaries and expenses. On March 19, 2020, the IPSA informed MPs that it was implementing a series of measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak. These measures included a \u00a310,000 increase to the office costs budget, an increase in the credit limit of MPs payment card to \u00a310,000 from \u00a34,000 (here) and changes to the claims process and the staff absence budget. The office costs budget can include computers, printers, postage, office furniture and utilities, and covers MPs and their staff. Office cost rules are set by the IPSA (here).\n\nAn IPSA spokesperson told Reuters: \u201cMost MPs\u2019 staff moved at very short notice from being based in Westminster, or in a constituency office, to working from home. Many staff were not set up for home working, nor for supporting constituents remotely. This additional funding is to help them make that transition, while they deal with a huge increase in workload from distressed constituents as a result of coronavirus issues.\u201d\n\nFalse: MPs cannot award themselves expenses, which are set by an independent body. An extra \u00a310,000 has been allocated to each MP\u2019s office costs budget in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
