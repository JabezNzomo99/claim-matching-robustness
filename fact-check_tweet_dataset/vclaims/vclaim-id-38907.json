It comes as the coronavirus outbreak in Italy has sickened some 3,089 people and killed some 107 others.\n\nBut the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports about the pope contracting the novel coronavirus. Nor does a press release confirming a coronavirus diagnosis for the pope or his aides appear on the Vatican\u2019s website.\n\nThe Vatican has denied the claim and described Pope Francis as having a \u201cslight illness\u201d without giving further details. Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, told reporters that \u201cthere is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition.\u201d\n\nThe 83-year-old pontiff, who lost a lung to an illness as a young man, made his first public appearance since his \u201cslight illness\u201d on March 1, according to Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
