Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Priyanka Gandhi has said- \u2018if anyone attacks Pakistan without a proper reason, then their army will destroy them\u2019. Fact: Priyanka Gandhi hasn\u2019t made any such comments. Information from no credible source was found to authenticate the claim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen googled to check if Priyanka Gandhi has made such comments, no results with relevant information was found. If she had really made such statements, owing to their sensitivity, they would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. But no news agency has reported anything about Priyanka Gandhi making such statements.\n\nThose statements attributed to her are in circulation on social media since the past 2-3 days. When one visits Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s official Twitter account to check if she has said anything about the Pakistan army in the past 3 weeks, it was found that she hasn\u2019t tweeted anything about it. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, Priyanka Gandhi hasn\u2019t made those statements about Pakistan Army. False quotes are being attributed to her.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
