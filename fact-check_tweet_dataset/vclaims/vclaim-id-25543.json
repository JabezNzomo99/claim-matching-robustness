The claims are false; both men were arrested on corruption charges.\n\nThis photo was published on Facebook on August 8, 2019 and shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nThe Urdu-language text across the top of the image reads: \u201cThe person who placed anti-Pakistan banner in Islamabad, turns out to be president of the youth wing of Noon League in Gujranwala, Saqib Bajwa and he did it because Maryam Safdar asked him. Suspect has confessed.\u201d\n\nNoon League refers to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the country\u2019s main opposition party. Maryam Safdar is the daughter of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Gujranwala is city in eastern Pakistan.\n\nThe caption references current Prime Minister Imran Khan, Sharif\u2019s political opponent. It reads in part: \u201cNawaz League, you will be screwed badly, it\u2019s beyond your imagination. @ImranKhanPTI we are with you. Bhutto may be pardon, but @MaryamNSharif people should not be forgiven.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe same photo appears alongside similar claims in other Facebook posts here, here and here, on Twitter here, and on Urdu-language news websites here and here.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, posters appeared in Islamabad carrying a quote from Indian lawmaker Sanjay Raut advocating a policy of \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d -- or \u201cUndivided India\u201d -- a political philosophy that calls for neighbouring countries including Pakistan to be incorporated into Indian rule.\n\nImages of the banners spread on social media, for example this post on Twitter.\n\nThe posters carried a screenshot of this tweet in romanised Hindi by Indian news agency ANI.\n\nTranslated from romanised Hindi, the quote from Raut reads in part: \"Today we have taken Jammu and Kashmir. Tomorrow will take Balochistan and PoK\" it says, referring to Pakistani occupied Kashmir.\n\nRaut\u2019s comments advocate for the Indian annexation of the portion of Kashmir administered by Pakistan, as well as the southern Pakistani province of Balochistan.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the poster taken from Twitter:\n\nLater on August 6, Islamabad deputy commissioner Muhammed Hamza Shafqaat tweeted in Urdu that authorities had arrested men for putting up the posters in the Pakistani capital.\n\nTranslated from Urdu, his tweet says: \u201cThe banners were taken down about seven hours ago. The men have also been arrested. The printing press has also been sealed. Further investigation is underway.\u201d\n\nBut the two men in the photograph shared in the misleading social media posts were not arrested for erecting the posters.\n\nThe same photo appeared in the Urdu-language daily Khabrain on August 7, 2019. It identifies the men as a clerk and a facilitator next to two officials from the Anti-Corruption Department in Punjab province.\n\nThe men were accused of taking a 10,000 Pakistani rupee ($62) bribe and arrested in Dera Ghazi Khan, according to the report.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article published in Daily Khabrain.\n\nTranslated, the Urdu headline reads: \u201cClerk and facilitator arrested taking 10,000 rupees bribe. Money recovered, suspects sent to lockup.\u201d\n\nPunjab Anti-Corruption Department inspector Malik Majeed confirmed to AFP by phone on August 9, 2019 that the two men were arrested on corruption charges.\n\n\u201cI know the photo was misused and was taken out of context but I can confirm that the men in the picture are the clerk and his facilitator whom we have arrested after a raid in Dera Ghazi Khan.\u201d he said.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo carried in the Daily Khabrain article (L) and the misleading post (R).", "lang": "en"}
