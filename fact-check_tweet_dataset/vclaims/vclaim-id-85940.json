The same survey later also earned Portman\u2019s colleague Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) a \u201cPants on Fire\u201d rating from PolitiFact.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this survey that it is hard to know where to begin, but here\u2019s a quick refresher course. We became interested in the Chamber\u2019s \u201c2nd Quarter Small Business Outlook,\u201d conducted by Harris Interactive, when various Republican lawmakers claimed that it showed that 74 percent of small businesses would fire workers and cut hours because of the health care law. But\u2019s here\u2019s what went wrong:\n\u2022 None The survey pretended to have a statistical margin of error, but it was really created through two on-line surveys that greatly limited the ability to generalize the results to all small businesses.\n\u2022 None The Chamber failed to disclose that 83 percent of small businesses surveyed said they would not be affected by the employer mandate, meaning any results that were reported were based on a subsample of just 17 percent.\n\u2022 None Once the possibility of multiple answers are accounted for, it turned out just 4.5 to 8.5 percent of small business executives surveyed said they will reduce hours or full-time staff in response to the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cWe accurately quoted the study,\u201d said Caitlin Dunn, Portman\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThe Chamber never provided us with any corrections, so we used this widely accredited source. It also reflects what he has heard from business owners across Ohio.\u201d\n\nDunn also pointed to another survey, by Public Opinion Strategies for the Chamber of Commerce and International Franchise Association, that shows that about 64 percent of small business franchise owners (such as owners of fast food and retail stores) believe the law will have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on their business. (The figure was lower \u2014 53 percent \u2014 for non-franchise owners.)\n\nWe won\u2019t get into the weeds of this study\u2019s methodology, but this is not the same thing as what Portman asserted on television. \u201cNegative impact\u201d is relatively vague and, on specific questions, the results were not nearly as significant. Just 12 percent of non-franchise owners (and 31 percent of franchise owners) have reduced worker hours, while 12 percent of non-franchise businesses (and 27 percent of franchises) had replaced full-time workers with part-time workers.\n\nThere are certainly a number of anecdotal examples concerning the impact of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses, but as we have repeatedly noted, the actual data is still inconclusive. It will take some time before analysts can truly document the impact, especially if the administration keeps delaying portions of the employer mandate.\n\nIn the meantime, if a lawmaker is going to repeat the results of a Four-Pinocchio poll, he or she is going to earn Four Pinocchios. The Chamber of Commerce also should be ashamed that the same survey still sits, uncorrected, on its Web site, even though it appears the Chamber no longer issues this survey on a quarterly basis.", "lang": "en"}
