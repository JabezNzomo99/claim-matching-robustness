K. Srinivas (Vice President, Bharat Biotech) taking Bharat Biotech\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine (\u2018COVAXIN\u2019 or BBV152 COVID vaccine) first dose as part of the human clinical trials. The vaccine was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) \u2013 National Institute of Virology (NIV). On its official website, Bharat Biotech mentioned that \u2018the vaccine received DCGI approval for Phase I & II Human Clinical Trials and the trials will commence across India from July 2020\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: Bharat Biotech has clarified that the photo is related to \u2018a routine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff\u2019. Also, on the \u2018Clinical Trials Registry \u2013 India (CTRI)\u2019 website, it can be seen that \u2018Date of First Enrollment (India)\u2019 for the BBV152 COVID vaccine begins on 13 July 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched about the photo, it was found that Bharat Biotech has already clarified regarding the photo. Bharat Biotech has tweeted that the photo is related to \u2018a routine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff\u2019.\n\nMore details regarding the experimental vaccine can be found on the \u2018Clinical Trials Registry \u2013 India (CTRI)\u2019 website. On the website, it can be seen that \u2018Date of First Enrollment (India)\u2019 for the BBV152 COVID vaccine begins on 13 July 2020. Also, talking to NDTV recently, Dr Krishna Ella (Chairman and MD of Bharat Biotech) said, \u2018Most of the clearances are coming through and probably, in 10 days human trials should start\u2019. So, as on 04 July 2020, doses are not given to any human.\n\nAlso, on the CTRI website, it can be read that the healthy volunteers will receive intramuscular doses (\u2018Route of administration: Intramuscular injection\u2019) of BBV152 vaccine formulations.\n\nBut, the process in the posted photo does not represent intramuscular injection. The difference between various types of injection can be seen in the picture below:\n\nFor example, the visuals related to administering of Moderna\u2019s mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1273) dose (another experimental anti-COVID-19 vaccine) to a woman can be watched here. On the US government\u2019s Clinal Trials website, it can be seen that mRNA-1273 dose is also given as an intramuscular (IM) injection.\n\nTo sum it up, the posted photo does not show Bharat Biotech Vice President taking COVAXIN (experimental COVID-19 vaccine) first dose.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
