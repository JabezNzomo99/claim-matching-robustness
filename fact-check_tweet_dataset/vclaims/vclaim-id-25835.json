Talked about his many battles of near death, but was never in Vietnam. Total Phony!\u201d (There\u2019s no evidence for these claims, as Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero or talked about any battles in Vietnam.)\n\n\u201cLook at some of these people asking the questions [about Kavanaugh], okay? Look at Blumenthal. He lied about Vietnam. He didn\u2019t just say, \u2018Hey, I went to Vietnam.\u2019 No. No. For 15 years, he said he was a war hero, he fought in Da Nang province. We call him \u2018Da Nang Richard.\u2019 \u2018Da Nang\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s his nickname. \u2018Da Nang.\u2019 He never went to Vietnam. And he\u2019s up there saying, \u2018We need honesty and we need integrity.\u2019 This guy lied when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. He lied. I don\u2019t mean a little bit. And then, when he got out \u2014 he actually dropped out of the race, and he won anyway because Democrats always win in Connecticut. He won very close, probably the closest ever. And when he got out and when he apologized, he was crying. The tears were all over the place. And now he acts like, \u2018How dare you?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an interview for the initial Times article, Blumenthal acknowledged misspeaking about his record on several occasions. On May 18, 2010, the day after the Times published its article, Blumenthal held a news conference and said: \u201cOn a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that, and I take full responsibility. But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country. I served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and I am proud of it.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had lied, Blumenthal said at the news conference, \u201cI did misspeak on a few occasions out of hundreds that I have attended, whether events or ceremonies.\u201d Blumenthal\u2019s staff pointed out that he had described himself as \u201csomeone who served in the military during the Vietnam-era in the Marine Corps\u201d at the same 2008 event where he later said he served \u201cin Vietnam.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)", "lang": "en"}
