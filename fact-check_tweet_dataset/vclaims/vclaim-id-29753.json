Back then, the picture was said to show the skies over California, where a huge wildfire was then burning in that state.\n\nWhat we found was that the picture was snapped by a meteorologist and actually captured a sunset somewhere over Hawaiian waters, and that the red tinting was a natural atmospheric phenomenon that had nothing to do with fires of any sort:\n\nWe rate the newer variation of this meme likewise \u201cMiscaptioned\u201d because the photograph in question is unrelated to either Australia or bushfires, as claimed on social media.\n\nHave you seen other variations of this claim? Let us know.", "lang": "en"}
