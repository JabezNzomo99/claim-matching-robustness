The post shares a photo claiming it to be of Sushant Singh\u2019s alleged girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty with Maharastra CM Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s son Aditya Thackeray who is also a minister in Maharastra. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The women in the image along with Aditya Thackeray is not Rhea Chakraborty, she is actress Disha Patani. The image was clicked when the duo went for an outing back in June 2019 and several news portals reported the same. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we ran a reverse image search of the photo in the post, we found several news articles reporting the image. According to these news articles, the woman in the image along with Aditya Thackeray is Disha Patani, a Bollywood actress and the picture was clicked when the duo went on an outing back in June 2019. The news articles reporting this can be read here and here.\n\nWhen we compare images of both Disha Patani and Rhea Chakraborty with that of the women in the car with Aditya Thackeray, we can conclude that the woman in the car is indeed Disha Patani.\n\nThe above post is being shared in the context of an FIR filed by Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s father K.K. Singh against Rhea Chakraborty for abetment of suicide.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman in the image with Aditya Thackeray is not Rhea Chakraborty.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
