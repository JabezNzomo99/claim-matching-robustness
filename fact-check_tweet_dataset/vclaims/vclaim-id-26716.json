Please be ready at all costs, it was been (sic) proven by Digos veteran seismologists,\u201d the post read, which was attributed to the NDRRMC.\n\nThe post got over 1,000 shares as of writing. It was flagged by Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s dashboard tool that identifies potentially dubious posts spread on the platform.\n\nThe facts: The NDRRMC did not announce such warning. Rather, they published on their official website and social media accounts that these messages are hoaxes and should not be believed.\n\n\u201cThe NDRRMC does not send messages of that sort. Currently, there is no technology that allows the prediction of earthquakes. Your NDRRMC will NEVER send baseless messages that will only spread fear among our people,\u201d the NDRRMC said.\n\nThe council added that the emergency alert and warning messages they send to the public come from surveillance or warning agencies such as the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).\n\n\u201cThe NDRRM Operations Center did not receive such advisory from Phivolcs nor did the Council request transmission of the same by the telcos to their subscribers,\u201d the NDRRMC added.\n\nOn October 16, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck the area of Tulunan, North Cotabato. Nearly two weeks after, another magnitude 6.6 earthquake hit the same area and affected other parts of Mindanao, killing at least 6 and injuring around 50 people. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
