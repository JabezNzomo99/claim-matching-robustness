The following quotations are but a few examples of King\u2019s statements on the topic:\n\n\u201cAnd one day we must ask the question, \u2018Why are there forty million poor people in America? And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.\u2019 When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I\u2019m simply saying that more and more, we\u2019ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society \u2026\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can\u2019t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You\u2019re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism.\u201d\n\nOne quote meme circulated via social media attributes the following similar statement to King:\n\nAlthough this quotation is congruent with other documented expressions by King on the subject of capitalism, it is not found in any of his writings, nor in any transcripts of his speeches or public statements.\n\nThis quotation originated with a reminiscence published in \u201cMy Song,\u201d the 2011 memoir of singer/actor Harry Belafonte. In that memoir, Belafonte \u2014 who had first met King in 1956 \u2014 described his last meeting with the civil rights leader, which took place at Belafonte\u2019s apartment in New York on March 27, 1968, just a week before King was assassinated in Memphis:\n\nDuring that after-party talk, Belafonte wrote, the following conversation took place:\n\nAs usual, Martin was late. He always packed too much into his schedule, trying to do it all. This time a stop in Newark, New Jersey, had left him shaken. He\u2019d met with Amiri Baraka, better known as LeRoi Jones, the playwright, essayist, and poet, who had formed a group called New Ark. Baraka identified himself as a black nationalist, and now openly advocated violence. He\u2019d been arrested for carrying a gun during the previous summer\u2019s riots in Newark, and with his new group he was threatening to disrupt the city again. Martin had tried to reason with him, with no success. Baraka and his followers had denounced Martin bitterly. They\u2019d scoffed at nonviolence, and vowed to tear Newark down in a matter of days. Martin was concerned that if Newark did blow, it would distract attention from the Poor People\u2019s Campaign and much that the movement had already accomplished. None of this, however, Martin revealed when he walked in, because our gathering included journalists \u2014 The New York Times\u2019s Tom Wicker and Anthony Lewis, among them. He wanted to stay on point, not muddy the message. As on the eve of Birmingham, we wanted to see media interest as much as raise money. I sensed Martin\u2019s mood, but saw him push it away. Instead, with all the passion he could muster, he talked up the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Only when the journalists and paying guests had left did Martin let his feelings show with the inner circle who remained. Bernard Lee, Martin\u2019s personal secretary and bodyguard, was there that night; he was never far from Martin\u2019s side. So was Andrew Young, the future mayor of Atlanta. Stan Levinson was long since back in the circle; his exile had ended when Bobby Kennedy stepped down from being Attorney General. Clarence Jones, Martin\u2019s lawyer and another of his closest confidants, was there. [My wife] Julie was there, too, her feet tucked up under her, a glass of vodka in her hand. Her opinions were sought and valued whenever the group met in our apartment. Martin poured his customary Bristol Cream, but skipped the routine of seeing how much remained. His collar open, his shoes off, he sipped pensively at the oak bar, Andy [Young] and Stan and Clarence on either side of him, me as host behind the bar. At first, Martin stayed on the subject of the evening. He spoke so quietly that Bernard, lying on a sofa behind him, soon fell asleep. But as he talked about Washington, and what he hoped to accomplish, be grew increasingly agitated. \u201cWhat bothers you, Martin?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you in such a surly mood?\u201d \u201cNewark,\u201d Martin said, and proceeded to tell us of his unnerving visit with Amiri Baraka. \u201cBeyond what an eruption in that city would mean, how it would take us off-course. I\u2019m just so disturbed at what I\u2019m hearing more and more. Somehow, frustration over the [Vietnam] war has brought forth this idea that the solution resides in violence. What I cannot get across to these young people is that I wholly embrace everything they feel! It\u2019s just the tactics we can\u2019t agree on. I have more in common with these young people than with anybody else in this movement. I feel their rage. I feel their pain. I feel their frustration. It\u2019s the system that\u2019s the problem, and it\u2019s choking the breath out of our lives.\u201d In the pause that followed, Andy replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Martin. It\u2019s not the entire system. It\u2019s only part of it, and I think we can fix that.\u201d Suddenly, Martin lost his temper. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear from you, Andy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough from you. You\u2019re a capitalist, and I\u2019m not. And so we don\u2019t see eye to eye \u2014 on this and a lot of other stuff.\u201d It was an awkward moment. Martin was really angry. But I understood the subtext. Deep down, Andy was ambivalent about the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. All the other goals that we had set for ourselves up to this moment were tangible. Almost all of them were focused on justice. But when it came to economics, the goals were more complicated, the lines more blurred. Andy didn\u2019t believe that all the victims came from the same level of experience. He felt that there was a critical difference between poor whites and Hispanics, on one hand, and poor blacks on the other. This disparity, he felt, could make the Poor People\u2019s Campaign a rocky journey. The tension peaked. \u201cThe trouble,\u201d Martin went on, \u201cis that we lived in a failed system. Capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level.\u201d Taking a sip from his glass, he continued, \u201cThat\u2019s the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we\u2019re going to have to change the system.\u201d\n\nWe find little reason to doubt the substance of this quotation, as Belafonte was undeniably a friend and associate of King\u2019s, he related the circumstances surrounding the conversation with King in a detailed, first-person account, and the words he quoted are consistent with thoughts King expressed on many other occasions.\n\nHowever \u2026 human memory is a fragile thing, and we have to consider how accurately Belafonte (the sole source for this quote) might have reproduced King\u2019s words when relating them in his memoir more than 40 years later \u2014 especially given that by Belafonte\u2019s own admission, news reporters and others who might have taken note of King\u2019s words that evening had departed before King made the statement in question. Does this passage describe a reconstruction of events made from personal memory long after the fact, or was the event documented at the time it occurred in some other form?\n\nWe\u2019ve sent an inquiry to Belafonte\u2019s co-author, Michael Shnayerson, to see if he can shed any light on the nature of this recounting and will update this page accordingly if additional information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
