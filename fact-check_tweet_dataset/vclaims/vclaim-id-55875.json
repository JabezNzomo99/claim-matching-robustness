Publicly available video shows that some people present during the incident that resulted in Floyd\u2019s death wore masks.\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, even after Floyd repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t breathe, according to video of the incident. His death has prompted protests across the country.\n\nBaseless claims related to Floyd\u2019s death have circulated on social media in recent weeks. In this case, multiple Facebook users claim his death was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic because nobody in footage of the incident appears to be wearing masks.\n\nHowever, that claim doesn\u2019t hold up. A review of publicly available video shows that former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane, who has been charged in Floyd\u2019s death, and at least one other officer were wearing face masks. EMTs who helped load Floyd into the ambulance wore masks, a bystander video shows.\n\nFactCheck.org also reported that a firefighter who arrived on the scene after the ambulance left had a mask.
