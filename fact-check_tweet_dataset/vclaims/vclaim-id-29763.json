The posts included a claim the spiked prices were set by a BP petrol station in New South Wales as deadly bushfires raged in Australia. But a spokesperson for the petrol station told AFP the product's price tag and description contained significant errors; Mount Franklin told AFP it does not sell water in 300ml bottles.\n\nThis image was published on Facebook on January 1, 2020. It has been shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nThe post's caption states: \u201cSEND IT VIRAL BP Service Station at Termeil. Over 100 homes lost and thousands evacuated in that area and this is how BP treat them.\u201d\n\nThe photo in the post was embedded in another Facebook post, which states in its caption: \u201c24 x 300ml Water is well priced at Termeil petrol station, get it before it goes\u201d.\n\nThe BP petrol station that sold the bottles of Mount Franklin, a Coca-Cola Amatil-owned brand, is located in Termeil along the Princes Highway.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe photo was shared online as Termeil, a village located on the southeastern coast of the Australian state of New South Wales, was hit by a bushfire that burned more than 260,000 hectares in the region as of January 3, according to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS).\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the NSW RFS warning for the Termeil area on January 3:\n\nWildfires in Australia have killed at least 24 people, destroyed more than 1,500 homes and burned more than eight million hectares of land since September 2019, in an unusually early and intense fire season, AFP reported here on January 6, 2020.\n\nThe photo was shared in several other Facebook posts seen here, here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nA spokesperson for the BP petrol station told AFP the sign pictured in the posts was written in error by a junior staff member.\n\nThe spokesperson added the sign was hung on New Year's Day due to a \u201csilly human error.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to inform you that it was big misunderstanding that spread so fast negatively. My junior employee displayed water of 24pk 300ml Mount Franklin for $48. He forgot to put 2 times and also 600ml,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in an email to AFP on January 2. \u201cIt was crazy busy yesterday with lots of people queuing up. It was a typo error and a silly human error.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also said the wrong price tag was taken down as soon as \u201cwe realised that there was lot of chaos on this\u201d and a correct price tag was displayed.\n\n\u201cIt's so heartbreaking when people call you greedy when you are actually trying to help in this difficult time. On behalf of my employee I'm taking responsibility,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBelow is a photo provided by the spokesperson showing the updated prices:\n\nThe photo shows signs attached to packs of Mount Franklin water, which read respectively: \u201c1 X (24PACK) MOUNT FRANKLIN WATER 600ML 1 FOR $29.99 (24 BTL)\n\nThe photo sent by the store owner shows corresponding interior decor to those posted to the petrol station\u2019s website, including a blue counter, a freezer featuring the logo of Australian ice-cream brand Streets and wooden flooring with pattern that runs parallel to the counter.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo provided by the petrol station spokesperson via email (top left) and three images of the store posted to the station\u2019s website with corresponding features circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe petrol station spokesperson also emailed AFP a second image, which shows a billing and delivery note addressing BP Termeil. The owner said the page shows all the Mount Franklin products sold at the store.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the invoice:\n\nThe note listed the following Mount Franklin products: 24-pack 600 ml still water, 24-pack 450 ml lightly sparkling, 24-pack 450 ml lightly sparkling berry, 24-pack 450 ml lightly sparkling lime and 8-pack 1.5 l still water.\n\nAll of the above products are listed on the Mount Franklin website as of January 6, 2019. The site does not list any water for sale in 300ml bottles.\n\nIn an email to AFP on January 3, a Mount Franklin spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not produce Mount Franklin in 300ml bottles.\u201d\n\nThe erroneous pricing that caused outrage online is far higher than market prices for similar bottle sizes and cases.\n\nFor instance, supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles sell a 20-pack of 500 ml Mount Franklin bottled water at around $9, and office supplies chain Officeworks prices a 24-pack of the brand\u2019s 400 ml water bottles at around $25.", "lang": "en"}
