The claims are false; the names of far fewer servicemen -- 13,300 -- are written on the memorial and the religion of those who died is not noted, according to the Commmonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which maintains the India Gate.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on June 28, 2019 with a photo of MP Asaduddin Owaisi. It has been shared more than 21,000 times after being published by a page called \u201cAIMIM India\u201d, which has 240,000 followers.\n\nOwaisi is an MP with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) political party in India. On its official page, the party says it works to \u201cprotect and promote the rights of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis, Other Backward Classes (OBC), other minorities and all other underprivileged communities in India.\u201d\n\nThe Hindi-language text in the graphic translates to English as: \u201cThere are 95,300 names of freedom fighters inscribed on Delhi's India Gate...\n\n Muslims - 61935\n\n Sikhs- 8050 \n\n OBC (Other Backward Class) 14480\n\n Dalits 10777\n\n Upper castes 598 \n\n and Sanghi 0 \n\n And some shameless people call Muslims traitors when their own history is spying for the British.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAn identical message -- without Owaisi\u2019s image -- was published with Hindi language text on Twitter and Facebook, for example here and here in July 2019.\n\nThe claim is false. The India Gate memorial is dedicated to 70,000 troops of British India who died between 1914 and 1921 -- many in the First World War. There are \"13,300 Commonwealth servicemen commemorated by name on the memorial\", according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC).\n\nThe CWGC also provides the details of soldiers who died here.\n\nBelow is an AFP photo of the India gate:\n\nThe CWGC About Us page says one of the organisation\u2019s principles is that \u201cthere should be no distinction made on account of military rank, race or creed.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the page with that principle outlined in red.\n\nThe post was previously fact checked by the Times of India newspaper here.", "lang": "en"}
