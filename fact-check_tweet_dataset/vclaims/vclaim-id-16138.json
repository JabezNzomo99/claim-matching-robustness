Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is accusing his Democratic opponent Jason Kander of trying to manipulate elections while Kander served as Missouri\u2019s secretary of state.\n\n\"On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections,\" Blunt's ad said.\n\nThe appellate court determined that the second bullet point of Kander\u2019s statement was misleading. In his language, Kander doesn\u2019t mention that although the fee would begin at 67 cents, it would increase annually by 3 percent or more, depending on the rate of inflation.\n\nThe appeals court reviewed an initiative petition that sought to require in-home service providers receiving reimbursement from the state through MO HealthNet, Missouri\u2019s Medicaid provider, to pay a percentage of their revenue to the workers who provide the services. That compensation would be through wages and benefits.\n\nThe court determined Kander\u2019s ballot language to be insufficient because Kander did not reference MO HealthNet by name. The court also said Kander erred because he categorized \"personal care attendants\" as \"employees\" in his language.\n\nIn March 2014, Natalie Vowell filed a declaration with the secretary of state\u2019s office to run as a state House candidate in the 78th District in the August primary election. Kander\u2019s office initially approved the request. But in May, Kander\u2019s office sent a letter to Vowell questioning her ability to run. By ending the Keystone XL Pipeline project, President Joe Biden \u201cimperiled one of Donald Trump's most significant achievements, which was that we had achieved American energy independence.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Kander said voter registration records indicated Vowell had not been a qualified Missouri voter in the two years leading to the election, as required by law. The letter said Vowell would not be on the ballot unless she provided documents proving she was a registered Missouri voter during those two years.\n\nBut the appellate court said Vowell\u2019s eligibility was irrelevant. Instead, the case was a matter of whether the secretary of state had the authority to investigate the qualifications of candidates.\n\nThe court said in its ruling that Missouri statutes do not grant the secretary of state the power to investigate. Kander\u2019s role was ministerial, the court said. He was only responsible for making sure the potential candidate\u2019s \"paperwork is in proper order and was timely filed.\" Blunt claims judges had to stop Kander from \"manipulating\" elections. \"Manipulating\" is a strong word, especially when it is used to characterize the nuances and brevity of language the Missouri secretary of state must use to summarize lengthy legislation and constitutional amendments for voters. We consulted experts who noted that crafting ballot language is part of Kander\u2019s job as the secretary of state. Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California Davis, said Kander \"was exercising a governmental function that he had every right to exercise, though he may have \u2018crossed the line\u2019 between permissible and misleading ballot titles.\" But Elmendorf said Kander\u2019s actions \"are very different than accepting bribes, stuffing ballot boxes, or trying to prevent people from voting by threatening them or giving them misleading information about the location of polling places.\" Richard Reuben, an MU law professor, said though it\u2019s possible Kander purposely tried to mislead voters, the court\u2019s rejection of his ballot language \"does not necessarily imply ... malevolent intent.\" \"It would not be surprising for an opposing politician in a close race call to get hyperbolic in calling such error manipulation,\" Reuben said. \"Such is the nature of politics.\" Blunt claimed, \"On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections.\" This claim is misleading. Courts did object in three cases to decisions Kander made as secretary of state. But the specifics of those cases are much more nuanced than Blunt lets on. And the claim that Kander tried to manipulate the election is, at best, unproven. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
