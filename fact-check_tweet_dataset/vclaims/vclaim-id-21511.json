To buy a suppressor, more popularly known as a silencer, one must meet a number of requirements that result in a nine-month approval process (including submitting fingerprints and a photograph) and a $200 tax stamp. (A silencer generally costs hundreds of dollars, and can easily top $1,000.) The legislation would make buying a suppressor as easy as buying a firearm (with an instant background check), and do away with the tax stamp and federal registration.\n\nWe obviously take no position on whether this proposed law would be good or bad, but we were curious about this pair of tweets. Americans for a Responsible Solution (ARS), in its tweet, further noted that the law \u201cwould make it easier for active shooters to inflict serious harm on our communities without being detected by trained law enforcement professionals.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re not sure why the group would say that ear plugs protect hearing \u201cbetter\u201d than suppressors.\u201d It seems the answer is that they are about the same, give or take two or three decibels. And if that\u2019s the case, ARS is especially wrong to claim that legislation to make it easier to buy such devices \u201cdoes nothing to protect hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t necessarily talking about being out in the middle of the woods deer hunting where it is extremely quiet. Instead, gun crimes often occur in cities and in other very noisy places,\u201d said Marc Brumer, a Gillibrand spokesman. \u201cThe shots would be heard by law enforcement or witnesses at the gun\u2019s typical decibel level, but they often cannot be heard when a silencer is added. There are many sounds in cities that are far louder than a gunshot masked by a silencer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn regard to gun silencers, it is more accurate to call them suppressors, as they suppress the impulsive sound of gunfire, not wholly eliminate it,\u201d said Ralph Clark, the chief executive of ShotSpotter. \u201cWe have successfully if not inadvertently detected confirmed suppressed gunfire within our existing deployments. Although we have not formally tested the theoretical impact to our system, we intend to do some targeted testing in the near future. We believe we will have various options ranging from increasing our sensor array density to developing software/firmware to address the detection of suppressed gunfire if it were to become a widespread issue.\u201d\n\nBut the firearm in the video is not a high-powered weapon; it has been supplied with subsonic ammunition that is even advertised as requiring no hearing protection. (\u201cGreat for backyard plinking and introducing youth to the shooting sports.\u201d) It would not be considered a semiautomatic weapon and in fact in the video the firearms enthusiast, Dan Abraham, says \u201cnow it won\u2019t cycle, so you have to cycle it on your own.\u201d That\u2019s certainly a very different situation than a standard AR-15 round, which can only to be reduced to 132 decibels with a suppressor.\n\nThe Violence Policy Center, which opposes the proposed law, can point to only a handful of examples of silencers being used in violent crimes, including a case in Milwaukee last year in which undercover FBI agents sold a silencer to a man said to be planning a mass attack. \u201cThe data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence, and is a minor problem,\u201d says a 2007 study cited by the Violence Policy Center. But that could also be the case because silencers are so time-consuming to obtain.\n\nWe can understand the irritation of gun-control advocates about legislation with a benign-sounding name such as the Hearing Protection Act. Clearly the main impact of the measure would be to loosen restrictions on the purchase of suppressors that have been in place for decades. It would be better called the Paperwork Reduction Act, especially because the use of suppressors does not mitigate the need for hearing protection.\n\nIt\u2019s debatable that ear plugs protect ears better than a suppressor \u2014 and meanwhile, no self-respecting gun owner would use an AR-15 rifle without ear protection, even if he or she had a suppressor. Certainly the two in combination would provide better ear protection than one type alone, especially because the NRR of earplugs in regular use is probably overstated. So ARS\u2019s tweet is rather misleading.\n\nIn the meantime, although the popular name of this accessory is a silencer, foes of the law such as Gillibrand should not use misleading terms such as \u201cquiet\u201d to describe the sound made by a high-powered weapon with a suppressor attached. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but finally tipped to Three. There is little that\u2019s quiet about a firearm with a silencer, unless one also thinks a jackhammer is quiet.", "lang": "en"}
