It claims this will pay for new \"seven-day NHS\" services, as well as giving the NHS the money it needs in order to maintain existing services in the face of rising demand, provided it implements its own efficiency savings.\n\nExperts doubt this is possible, saying that the NHS will struggle to maintain existing services under current funding plans, let alone expand seven-day services.\n\nSeven-day services weren\u2019t factored in when the NHS originally calculated it may need this money.\n\nWhere \u00a310 billion comes from\n\nThe story starts in 2013, when NHS England said it faced a funding gap of \u00a330 billion by the end of the decade, even if government spending kept up in line with inflation. So it needed that much more, above inflation, to deliver care to a growing and ageing population, assuming it made no efficiency savings itself.\n\nIt was clear at the time this money was about \u201ccontinuing with the current model of care\u201d.\n\nA year later the NHS laid out plans for how it might handle this gap. One ambitious option was the NHS itself would find \u00a322 billion in savings, leaving the other \u00a38 billion to be filled by the government. The plans did mention a seven-day NHS, but this particular sum of money didn\u2019t factor that in.\n\nThe Conservatives said in their 2015 election manifesto they would provide that \u00a38 billion in government, and expect the other \u00a322 billion in savings from the NHS. The Nuffield Trust, writing in our election report, said this still left unanswered questions on funding:\n\n\u201c\u00a38bn is the bare minimum to maintain existing standards of care for a growing and ageing population \u2026\n\n\u201cimproving productivity on this scale [\u00a322 billion] would be unprecedented\u201d\n\nThe new Conservative government followed through on the commitment and started claiming it was giving \u00a310 billion, giving the NHS what it asked for, and more.\n\nActually it's not as generous as it sounds, as the \u00a310 billion counted the last year of the previous parliament, which wasn\u2019t covered by the NHS\u2019s spending options anyway. The NHS was still set to get \u00a38 billion over the course of this parliament.\n\nIt\u2019s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that for the \u00a38 billion to be sufficient, it needs to see \u201ccontinuing access to social care\u201d and \u201cenhanced effort on prevention and public health\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u00a38 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. It excludes areas outside of NHS England, such as public health and social care, where spending is expected to fall overall.\n\nThat means total health spending in England\u2014including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England\u2014will only rise by \u00a34.5 billion over the same period, according to healthcare think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation, and The King\u2019s Fund.\n\nThere are doubts over whether this will be enough\n\nThe government says that the \u00a310 billion\u2014or \u00a38 billion\u2014will also cover delivering new seven-day NHS services.\n\nBut the Department of Health confirmed to us that it\u2019s the same pot of money as was suggested in NHS England\u2019s plans to cover its funding gap.\n\nFunding expanded seven-day services with this money as well isn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nEarly evidence suggests that seven-day NHS services will come at a cost to hospitals, although the NHS says we need to treat these figures with caution as they\u2019re based on estimates from a small number of hospitals.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King\u2019s Fund all said in response to the government announcement that under these plans the NHS will \u201cstruggle to maintain services, let alone invest in new models of care and implement seven day services\u201d.\n\nWe added in the paragraphs explaining that the government's \u00a38 billion commitment was not all of what the NHS asked for.", "lang": "en"}
