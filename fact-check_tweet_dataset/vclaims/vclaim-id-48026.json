The claim is false; the photos show cleaners in Hong Kong before June 2019, when mass pro-democracy demonstrations broke out in the city.\n\nThe photos were published here in a Facebook post on October 7, 2019.\n\nThey were published by a page with more than 232,000 followers.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared more than 800 times.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nText in English superimposed above the images states: \u201cThese are the unsung heroes of Hong Kong. Night after night, they put our streets back in order cleaning up the city after a day of chaos. There's nowhere in the world they work as efficiently as these 'cleaner bees' in Hong Kong. They have my utmost respect (heart emoji)\u201d.\n\nAll three photos show cleaners in Hong Kong; the top one shows a group taking a break; the bottom left photo shows a group sweeping a street in the Causeway Bay shopping district; the bottom right image shows a single cleaner with rubbish bags.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cAfter the future pillar of our society have fun causing damage, our \u2018useless old people\u2019 are left to clean up the mess that is Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe three photos were also published either separately or together on Facebook here, here, here and here; on Weibo here, here and here; and on an online forum here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; reverse image searches on Google found all three photos appeared online before June 2019, when mass pro-democracy demonstrations broke out in Hong Kong.\n\nThe photo of a group of cleaners taking a break was included in this article published by Hong Kong newspaper The South China Morning Post (SCMP) on January 10, 2019.\n\nThe photo is credited to Felix Wong, a photographer for SCMP.\n\nIts caption states: \u201cA study by Oxfam Hong Kong and Chinese University found that Hongkongers needed to earn at least HK$54.70 an hour to ensure a basic standard of living.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by SCMP:\n\nThe second photo of a group of cleaners sweeping a street was published by the Associated Press here.\n\nThe photo was captured by photographer Vincent Yu. Its caption states: \u201cWorkers sweep after police cleared barricades and tents on a main road in the occupied areas at Causeway Bay district in Hong Kong Monday, Dec 15, 2014. Hong Kong police pulled down barricades Monday and folded up tents at the third and final pro-democracy protest camp, putting an end to demonstrations that have blocked traffic in the southern Chinese city's streets for 2 1/2 months.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on the AP website:\n\nThe photo was captured here near Yee Wo Street in the shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\nHong Kong saw weeks of pro-democracy protests in 2014, which were dubbed the \u201cUmbrella Revolution\u201d. Here is a 2016 AFP retrospective article about the movement.\n\nThe third image of a single cleaner with rubbish bags was published in this November 13, 2016, article by Hong Kong news site Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nThe photo, used as an illustrative image, was credited to Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily. Its caption states: \u201cStreet cleaner.\u201d\n\nThe article\u2019s headline states: \u201cThe exploited: Inadequate regulation puts outsourced workers at risk of labour abuses.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by Hong Kong Free Press:", "lang": "en"}
