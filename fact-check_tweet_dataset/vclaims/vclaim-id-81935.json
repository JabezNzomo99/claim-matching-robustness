He believes other countries benefit from our trade practices, while the United States suffers.\n\nThe trade deficit is how much more goods and services the United States imports than it exports, Trump says it\u2019s too high.\n\n\"Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly \u2014 think of this, think of this \u2014 our trade deficit is $800 billion last year alone,\" Trump said in July 21 remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \"We\u2019re gonna fix that.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s phrasing is a little off, but he\u2019s got the idea right.\n\nThe country\u2019s overall trade deficit in 2015 was about $500 billion, according to Census data, but that figure includes both goods and services.\n\nTrump mentioned the trade deficit in goods, which includes all manufactured products, oil and agriculture products. The trade deficit in 2015 for just goods was $763 billion. Not quite $800 billion, but reasonably close.\n\nThe reason the overall trade deficit is smaller than just the goods trade deficit is because the United States exports more services than it imports.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the highest the goods trade deficit has ever been. It ranged from $782 billion in 2005 to $832 billion in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, however, that current figures actually understate the size of the goods trade deficit because oil prices have been abnormally low, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank supported in part by unions.\n\n\"It\u2019s a large deficit,\" Scott said. \"And it needs to be reduced.\"\n\nTrump said, \"Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly \u2026 $800 billion last year alone.\"\n\nIn 2015, the goods trade deficit was $763 billion. Trump is pretty close.", "lang": "en"}
