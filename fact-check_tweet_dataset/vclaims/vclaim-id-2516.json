Theresa May has quoted the latest estimate correctly, but it should be treated with caution.\n\nMental health services are paid for by a wide range of different organisation. When NHS England asked them to estimate how much they planned to spend on mental health services last year, the answer was \u00a311.7 billion.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how much of that \u00a311.7 billion was actually spent on mental health. There have been discrepancies in the past between planned spending on mental health and what actually happened.\n\nWe may know the answer in the future. This year, Clinical Commissioning Groups are moving to open-book accounting. They\u2019ll be able to show where the planned spending actually went.\n\nIs \u00a311.7 billion a record figure? Since the estimates are fairly uncertain, we\u2019re not sure how accurate or meaningful this is. We\u2019re looking into it.", "lang": "en"}
