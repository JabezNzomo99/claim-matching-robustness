Shortly after taking office, the president signed an executive order that aimed to put this policy into effect. The order also said the cost of any new regulation should be offset by eliminating regulations with the same costs to businesses.\n\nIn any case, Trump\u2019s claim is that he\u2019s cut more regulations than any president in history. The conundrum is how to measure that. We consulted with several regulatory experts and they said there was no clear way to do so and no consistent records have been kept. But there are some possible metrics.\n\nAlmost immediately, various presidents began to express concern about excessive regulation. Jimmy Carter in 1978 issued an executive order that introduced the idea of minimizing costs. Carter\u2019s 1980 Economic Report of the President observed that \u201ctools like the regulatory budget may have to be developed\u201d to \u201cmake certain that the first problems addressed are those in which regulations are likely to bring the greatest social benefits.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is worth recalling that important segments of the economy, such as the airline, trucking and railroad industries, were deregulated in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The deregulatory push ultimately led Congress in 1995 to mothball the 108-year-old Interstate Commerce Commission, the nation\u2019s first regulatory agency. Such actions are not be easily identified by counting regulations that are eliminated \u2014 and arguably may have greater economic impact than repealing individual rules.\n\nBut other metrics are even more problematic. Experts frowned on the idea of counting pages in the Federal Register \u2014 though they are down for Trump just as they were for Reagan. That\u2019s because a costly rule can run 20 pages or 200 pages, depending on the degree to which the agency responds to public comments, the scope of its regulatory impact analysis, and the complexity of the process or action targeted by the rule. In many cases, the rules of compliance are outlined in \u201cguidance documents,\u201d and not within the published final rule. So page-counting tells you virtually nothing.\n\nFinally we should note that Trump did take advantage of the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which he used to roll back 14 rules that Obama issued at the end of his administration. The time limit for using the law expired in May, but it had only been used once before, under Bush.\n\nWe asked the White House for evidence of Trump\u2019s claim and received this statement from an OMB spokesman: \u201cAs far as we are aware, no previous administration has deregulated or withdrawn as many anticipated regulatory actions as this one in this short amount of time, which we expect will result in $0 in net regulatory costs on the economy.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Nov. 8: Patrick McLaughlin, an economist at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University, crunched some numbers for The Fact Checker concerning the increase in \u201cregulatory restrictions\u201d in the Code of Federal Regulations. His computer program searches for words that create binding obligations or prohibitions, such as \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d and \u201cmay not.\u201d His research shows that Trump, thus far, has a slower increase in such restrictions than any other recent president in their first year in office. However, it\u2019s not zero, or even negative, but closer to 1 percent.\n\nTrump may have grounds to brag, but his claim cannot be easily verified. There is no reliable metric on which to judge his claim \u2014 or to compare him to previous presidents. Something is clearly happening on the regulatory front, as demonstrated by the number of withdrawn rules. But it\u2019s too soon to evaluate Trump\u2019s record \u2014 or for the president to make such sweeping claims. We can\u2019t award Pinocchios or a Geppetto, so we will leave this unrated.
