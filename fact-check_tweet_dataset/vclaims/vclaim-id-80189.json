Indonesian space and meteorological officials said the lower-than-average temperatures were in fact a regular occurrence during the dry season as colder air gets pushed up from the southern hemisphere.\n\nNews portal TIMES INDONESIA published an article on July 6, 2018 with a headline that translates as: \u201cIndonesia is getting colder because of the aphelion phenomenon.\u201d It gave no sources for the claims made in the report.\n\nOn the same day a Facebook post, which has since been liked more than 1,000 times, repeated the claim and warned that the colder weather may trigger health problems for babies and elderly people.\n\nAn English translation of the post says: \u201cPlease wear thicker clothes. Many people are wondering why it\u2019s getting colder in recent days. The answer is that our earth is at its aphelion point.\u201d\n\nEarth did reach its aphelion point on July 6 but it is not the reason for the temperature drop, says Thomas Djamaluddin, head of Indonesia\u2019s space and aeronautics agency.\n\n\u201cThe cooler temperature...happens because during the current dry season wind blows in from the southern hemisphere which is experiencing winter,\u201d he says in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThe change in distance between the sun and earth is not significant in influencing temperature changes on the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\nIndonesia\u2019s meteorology, climatology and geophysics agency agreed, saying in a statement that cooler temperatures during dry season are a regular occurence, without any link to aphelion.\n\n\u201cThe cooler temperature phenomenon is a natural phenomenon that usually happens during the peak months of the dry season, between July and August,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe question about aphelion causing cooling weather crops up frequently on the Internet. The website accuweather gives a similar answer to the Indonesian experts in this post.", "lang": "en"}
