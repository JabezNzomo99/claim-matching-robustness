The claim is false; the images are all digital illustrations which have circulated online long before the mission\u2019s launch on July 22, 2019.\n\nChandrayaan-2 (in English, Moon Chariot 2) is India\u2019s second lunar exploration mission, which launched on July 22, 2019. Here is an AFP report about the launch.\n\nOne image was published here on Twitter on July 27, 2019. The caption states: \"Chandrayan 2 photo\".\n\nIt shows what appears to be an astronaut in a spacesuit next to a lunar rover, with a distant view of Earth in the background. Below is a screenshot of the image:\n\nBut Chandrayaan-2 is an unmanned mission.\n\nThis picture is actually a composite image based on a colourised 1972 photo of Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt, taken by crewmate Eugene Cernan. The photo is shown below:\n\nThe photo appears on the NASA website here with the caption: \u201cThe image shows Schmitt on the left with the lunar rover at the edge of Shorty Crater, near the spot where geologist Schmitt discovered orange lunar soil. Forty five years later, Cernan and Schmitt are still the last to walk on the Moon.\u201d\n\nBelow is a side by side comparison of part of the image from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the original photo (R):\n\nAnother reverse image search found the top half of the image in the misleading Twitter post was extracted from this image created by graphic artist Hana Gartstein.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day website, dated March 2, 2007:\n\nThe second image was published on Facebook here on July 28, 2019.\n\nThe caption states: \"First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayan 2 - What an eye-catching visual it is\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image is in fact a screenshot from an animated video produced by NASA in 2005 which shows the effect of magnetic fields on visual phenomena.\n\nIt was previously circulated alongside a claim that it depicted the aurora borealis phenomenon from space. This claim was debunked by Snopes in March 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image shown in the misleading post (L) and a screenshot of the NASA video (R):\n\nThe image appears at the one minute five second mark of the video from NASA published on its official YouTube channel here.
