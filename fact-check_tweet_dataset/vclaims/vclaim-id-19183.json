The photo is being shared in a misleading context; the image was actually taken in Srinagar in 2018 when a civilian was killed during a \u2018cordon and search operation.\u2019\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on August 10, 2019 and has been shared more than 3,000 times since.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption of the post translates to English as: \u201cThis has become the situation of Kashmir that people carrying the dead bodies for funerals are also being shot at by pellet guns. What kind of a free Kashmir is this, brother.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same photo and claim were shared in other posts on Facebook, for example here and here, and on Twitter here and here.\n\nOn August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked disputed Kashmir\u2019s special status, granted by Article 370 of the Indian constitution. Here is an AFP video report on the issue.\n\nBut the photo does not show the current situation in Kashmir.\n\nThe image was first published here on a news website called \u201cThe Citizen\u201d September 27, 2018.\n\nThe picture, taken by Kashmir-based photojournalist Basit Zargar was, the report says, taken in September 2018 when protests and clashes broke out after a 28-year-old civilian was killed in Noorbagh area of Qamarwari in Srinagar after Indian forces opened fire during a \u2018cordon and search operation.\u2019\n\nThe photo was also published here on October 18, 2018, on an Urdu-language blog, where the image has a watermark of the photographer\u2019s name and the date.\n\nThe image used in the misleading posts also contains the watermark, which has been blurred.\n\nIn September 2018, authorities imposed curfew in the region and also suspended mobile Internet services, according to local and international media reports, for example here and here in September 2018.", "lang": "en"}
