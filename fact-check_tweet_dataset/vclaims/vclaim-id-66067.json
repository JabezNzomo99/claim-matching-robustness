John Faso, R-Kinderhook, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo could do a better job managing the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nHe has proposed legislation to shift Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Counties outside New York City pay close to $2.3 billion in Medicaid costs annually. Faso says the state could handle the expense if Cuomo cut costs elsewhere or lowered Medicaid spending, which topped $28 billion last year according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy analysis group. That\u2019s more than Texas and Florida combined.\n\n\"We now have about one-third of New York\u2019s population on Medicaid,\" Faso said. \"Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment. I look upon that as a failure.\"\n\nNew York is one of 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded income eligibility for Medicaid, an option under Obamacare.\n\nThat opened the door for those who may have been unable to get health insurance otherwise.\n\nBut is Faso right that a third of the state\u2019s population is on Medicaid?\n\nAbout 6.4 million people received Medicaid benefits in New York as of April 2017, the most recent count from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe agency includes enrollees in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which insures children from families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to buy insurance.\n\nThe state\u2019s population is 19.74 million, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau numbers.\n\nThat makes Faso right: 33 percent of the state\u2019s population is enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nNew York has the second-highest Medicaid participation rate in the country. New Mexico ranked first with almost 38 percent on Medicaid.\n\nNew York ranked highest before the Obamacare expansion with almost 29 percent of the state\u2019s population on Medicaid in 2013.\n\nFaso said a third of New York\u2019s population is on Medicaid.\n\nThe latest federal data supports his claim: One of every three New York residents is enrolled in Medicaid.", "lang": "en"}
