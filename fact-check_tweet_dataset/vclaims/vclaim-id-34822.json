Let\u2019s try to check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Sri Lankan Muslims are demolishing mosques and are converting into Hinduism. They are saying that they finally realized the hatred present in Islam. Fact: Muslims in Sri Lanka are demolishing a mosque because it was built using foreign funds and the site where it was built was actually allotted for a children library. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image, Sri Lankan newspaper articles with similar images were found in the search results. According to an article in the \u2018Ada Derana\u2019, Muslims in Kekirawa demolished a mosque but not to convert into Hinduism. They demolished the mosque because it was built using foreign funds and was on a site previously allotted for a children library. Also, there was already a mosque in the village so they did not want an additional mosque. The demolition of the mosque is not related to hatred towards Islam or conversion into Hinduism. So, the post tries to mislead people by twisting the reasons behind the demolition of the mosque.\n\nTo sum it up, Mosque was demolished because it was foreign-funded, not because Muslims got converted into Hinduism.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE Lite series.", "lang": "en"}
