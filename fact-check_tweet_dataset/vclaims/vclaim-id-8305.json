Among them is The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% peeling solution, which produces an exfoliating face mask.\n\nThe blood-red color comes from what the company describes as \u201ca studied Tasmanian Pepperberry derivative.\u201d\n\nThe result is a thin layer of red solution smeared on to the user\u2019s face, giving an appearance identical to the photographs in Cruz\u2019s post.\n\nThe images on the left are taken from the \u201cblood sisters\u201d hoax, while the four images on the right are taken from YouTube reviews of The Ordinary peeling solution:\n\nThe \u201cblood sisters\u201d hoax is not to be confused with the so-called \u201cVampire facial,\u201d a beauty treatment popularized by Kim Kardashian, which involves a dermatologist drawing blood from your veins, using a centrifuge to separate out what\u2019s called \u201cplatelet-rich plasma,\u201d and then injecting that into your face.", "lang": "en"}
