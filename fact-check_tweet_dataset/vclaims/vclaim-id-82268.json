We went from 8.1 percent unemployment December before I took office to last month we nearly cut that in half at 4.4 percent, well below the national unemployment rate. We\u2019re going to continue to aim high both in our state. And if I was the candidate for president of the United States, I\u2019d aim high as well there.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott Walker ran for Wisconsin governor in 2010, his promise to create 250,000 jobs by 2015 became his mantra, repeated in nearly every interview and ad. He failed to fulfill it, but that has not stopped him from touting jobs and employment figures on the presidential campaign trail five years later.\n\nWe at The Fact Checker are critical of politicians claiming success in positive employment trends, which usually can\u2019t be traced to a policy or decision of a single individual. Nonetheless, this is one of Walker\u2019s major talking points, so we explored it. What happened to Wisconsin\u2019s employment figures during Walker\u2019s governorship?\n\nWalker had called 250,000 jobs \u201cmy floor, not my ceiling\u201d and \u201ca minimum, just a base.\u201d But now, on the campaign trail, he emphasizes it as a \u201cbig bold goal.\u201d He points instead to the decrease in the state\u2019s unemployment rate, increase in the labor participation rate, and how they compare to the national average.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data confirm that more than 140,000 private sector jobs have been created since he took office. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate did decrease from 8 percent when Walker took office in January 2011 to 4.6 percent in July 2015. The 4.6 percent is the lowest level since 2008 (the national average as of July 2015 is 5.3 percent).\n\nBLS officials warn against comparing state averages to national averages. For one, state averages are seasonally adjusted individually on the state level, so the numbers do not add up to the national level. Each region may have unique factors that affect employment and labor force participation trends. Wisconsin was among the lowest-ranking Midwestern states in its percentage growth of private sector jobs in 2014.\n\nWisconsin traditionally has had a lower unemployment rate than national average, and a comparable or higher labor participation rate than the national average. Wisconsin\u2019s labor force participation rate was higher than the national average even before Walker became governor. And the Wisconsin unemployment rate consistently has been lower than the national average since 1985. So while Walker touts the figures as a success, it is not a trend out of the ordinary or unique to his term.\n\nThe unemployment and labor force participation figures come from the BLS Current Population Survey, which is the household survey and includes self-reported employment and people who work on family farms. That can skew the Wisconsin numbers because of the industries related to farming, said Menzie Chinn, economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also reported that among the reasons for the unemployment rate decreasing under Walker was that some unemployed people either gave up searching for a job or went back to school, and disappeared from the overall pool of jobless people.\n\nIn 2011, Walker replaced the state commerce department with a public-private economic development agency, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., to stimulate job creation in the state. But the agency has become enveloped in financial and operational problems. Numerous audits and news reports have found ineffective and inappropriate policies, and that it failed to follow legal requirements. Earlier this year, the agency disclosed that it had again failed to track how loans and grants, funded by taxpayer money, were being spent by their recipients.\n\nWhile Walker uses the jobs, unemployment and labor force participation statistics to show his success as governor, he has shifted his rhetoric in recent interviews on exactly whose role it is to create jobs: \u201cI think most of us believe our cities and towns and people create jobs, not the government.\u201d\n\nWalker cites figures from BLS data on the number of new jobs created, and the rate of unemployment and labor force participation. However, the context in which he uses these figures exaggerate the progress under his term and deflect from his failure to keep a major campaign promise.\n\nHis characterization that the Wisconsin unemployment rate is \u201cfar lower\u201d and the labor force participation rate is \u201cfar higher\u201d than national rate is misleading. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate is not quite one percentage point lower than the national average, and labor force participation rate is roughly five percentage points higher than the national average. Even if state-versus-national comparisons were kosher \u2014 and they are not, according to BLS \u2014 the trends Walker highlights are not unique to his term as governor. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate was lower than national, and its labor force participation rate was higher than national, since before he took office.", "lang": "en"}
