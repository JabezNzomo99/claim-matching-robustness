We\u2019re knee-deep in a presidential election.\n\n\"There\u2019s a reason for having this tradition of not nominating somebody in the middle of a presidential election, because it gets so political. I agree with that precedent, and there is a precedent for that.\"\n\nIt\u2019s relatively rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur in the months leading up to a presidential election.\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s office could not provide any examples in which a president did not make a nomination during a presidential election year.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any, either -- though, to the contrary, we did find a number of instances in which such a nomination was made.\n\nLet\u2019s note that when it comes to filling Supreme Court vacancies, presidents decide when to nominate, and the Senate decides when to consider the nomination. Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands on confirming a nominee before putting someone forward. But formally, the timing for the first step is up to the president.\n\nWe found five instances over roughly the past century in which there was a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year and the president made a nomination.\n\nTechnically, there was not a vacancy, but Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations in June 1968, five months before the election.\n\nJohnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.)\n\nJohnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas\u2019 place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated.\n\nIn October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a \"recess appointment\" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957.\n\nA February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese notes there were also presidential election-year nominations made to the Supreme Court in the 1800s.\n\nRyan said: \"There is a precedent\" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court \"in the middle of a presidential election.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur during a presidential election year -- the last time was in 1940, although there were also two election-year nominations in 1968.\n\nBut we could find no instances in which a president faced with a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year did not make a nomination. It occurred five times between 1912 and 1940, and each time the nominee was confirmed.", "lang": "en"}
