This is how Democrats kill Free Speech. Tell Facebook this is not acceptable in a FREE Society!!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere is no evidence that supports the claim that Facebook is censoring pro-Trump posts so they cannot be shared. The platform\u2019s algorithm may downgrade posts to show up lower in newsfeeds if the content is rated false by third-party fact-checkers, such as PolitiFact and others, but it does not remove the option for users to share the post if they come across it.\n\nThe warning message began to appear in spring 2018 after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared in congressional hearings to answer questions after a data leak shared more than 50 million Facebook users\u2019 private information without their permission. During those hearings, a heated exchange took place between Zuckerberg and Sen. Ted Cruz when Cruz accused Facebook of suppressing conservative content.\n\nBut when searching through content with public settings, we could not find posts that didn\u2019t include a share button, regardless of the nature of the post.\n\nBrendan Nyhan, a political scientist and media critic who studies public misinformation and fake news, said he hadn\u2019t come across this particular claim in his research. And technology researcher Ben Decker, who specializes in investigating digital disinformation efforts, told PolitiFact that the Facebook claim \"plays into a much larger adversarial narrative about how big tech \u2018censors conservatives,\u2019\" that he has detected. But Decker also referenced a Snopes article from earlier this year that rated the statement false.\n\nFacebook spokesperson, Lauren Svensson, also told us the claim is inaccurate.\n\n\"There\u2019s no validity to this, Svensson wrote in an email. \"If someone is not seeing a \u2018Share\u2019 button on a post, it could be because the original poster has set the privacy of that post to \u2018Friends only\u2019 or a narrower audience.\"\n\nA Facebook Help Center article that explains how to share posts on news feeds expands on this:\n\n\"Keep in mind that you can't share posts to people who weren't part of the original audience (example: a post shared with \u2018Friends\u2019 can\u2019t be shared with \u2018Public\u2019).\"", "lang": "en"}
