The NRA doesn\u2019t need to buy influence: It\u2019s powerful because it\u2019s popular.\"\n\nWe found that Stephens\u2019 characterization, while accurate, doesn\u2019t reflect the true scope of the organization\u2019s political heft.\n\n\"Assessing the NRA's political spending solely by its donations to congressional candidates leaves millions in spending out,\" said Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks transparency and influence in politics and policy.\n\nFor this report, we drilled further into the NRA\u2019s political spending \u2014 including lobbying and outside spending in races \u2014 to offer a more comprehensive view of its influence in Washington.\n\nDirect candidate contributions are not the whole story\n\nThe claim of $3.5 million in donations is based on credible data, but narrow.\n\nThe Washington Post database summarizes NRA contributions to current members of Congress, searchable by state and lawmaker, going back to 1998. (The Post database revised its total for NRA contributions to $4.23 million on its last update on Oct. 5, the same day Stephens\u2019 column was published.)\n\nThe Post structured its database in a way to make it easy for readers to search for how much their representative or senator received from the NRA.\n\nThat means the database won\u2019t allow searches for NRA donations to previous members of Congress who were serving for a portion of that almost 20-year period. If you include these members, the amount of contributions increases substantially.\n\nThe Post\u2019s focus on members of Congress also means it doesn\u2019t include NRA donations to candidates for federal offices other than Congress, or to parties or party committees.\n\nIf you add together all of the NRA\u2019s contributions to candidates, parties and leadership political action committees between 1998 and 2016, it comes to more than $13 million, according to calculations from the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 database.\n\nThat\u2019s more than three and a half times larger than their direct contributions to current members of Congress.\n\nNRA spends millions more intervening in campaigns and lobbying\n\nThe NRA\u2019s biggest chunk of spending on politics came from \"outside spending,\" consisting largely of \"independent expenditures\" \u2014 efforts \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\" Often these take the form of campaign ads, but they are carried out without coordinating with the candidates they are supporting.\n\nThis type of spending vastly outpaces what the NRA spent on giving to candidates directly. The NRA spent $144.3 million on outside spending, such as independent expenditures, during that period.\n\nIn addition, the NRA since 1998 has reported spending a cumulative $45.9 million on federal lobbying, both for its in-house operations and the outside consultants it has retained.\n\nIf you add it all up -- candidate and party contributions, independent expenditures, and lobbying -- the NRA has spent $203.2 million on political activities since 1998.\n\nIn this pie chart, the red slice consists of the NRA\u2019s spending for candidate contributions alone.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the breakdown on a year-by-year basis. (Again, note the red bits.)\n\nAll told, the $3.5 million figure accounts for just 1.7 percent of everything the NRA spent on politics.", "lang": "en"}
