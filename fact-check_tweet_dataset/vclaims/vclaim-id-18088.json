Clinton was serving as secretary of state during the intervention.\n\n\"With respect to Libya, again, there\u2019s no difference between my opponent and myself,\" Clinton said. \"He\u2019s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population. I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives. We did not lose a single American in that action.\"\n\nClinton went on to say that she continued to believe that it was \"the right decision,\" even though many have second-guessed the decision given the country\u2019s later instability, including a significant presence by ISIS.\n\nAfter the forum, Trump supporters rushed to criticize Clinton\u2019s comment that \"we did not lose a single American in that action,\" arguing that the four Americans who lost their lives in a terrorist attack on a U.S. complex in Benghazi should be counted.\n\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted, \"#ICYMI Hillary Clinton said last night, \u2018We did not lose a single American in Libya.\u2019 Really.\" Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer echoed this line, tweeting, \"Really? @HillaryClinton said we \u2018didn't lose a single American in Libya\u2019. She does know #Benghazi is in Libya right? #NBCNewsForum.\"\n\nMany readers asked us to check Clinton\u2019s statement. It's unusual for us to see a statement where our rating would rely almost entirely on interpretation, but where the facts are not in dispute. So we will lay out the history and let readers decide for themselves.\n\nWere any U.S. lives lost during the military action?\n\nThis is the easy part: No American lives were lost in the Libyan campaign.\n\nAs the seven-month campaign ended in late October 2011, the Associated Press reported that NATO warplanes had flown 26,000 sorties, a quarter of which were flown by U.S. aircraft, mostly in support roles such as air refuelling and surveillance. European allies and four partner nations conducted most ground attacks.\n\n\"The NATO intervention in Libya lasted from March to October 2011, and no Americans were killed in that action,\" said Alan J. Kuperman, who teaches at the University of Texas-Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs and authored the book Constitutions and Conflict Management in Africa.\n\nThe closest the U.S. military came to a battlefield casualty in Libya occurred on March 21, when an Air Force F-15 crashed in eastern Libya with Maj. Kenneth Harney and Capt. Tyler Stark on board. They were rescued and did not suffer significant injuries. That followed the downing of an unmanned Fire Scout drone helicopter.\n\nSo, by referring to \"that action\" -- the seven-month NATO intervention -- Clinton is correct. No U.S. military lives were lost on the battlefield.\n\n\"She was very clear that her claim was with respect to the initial military action, not subsequent events,\" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. \"Her comments (addressed) avoiding ground combat casualties, not embassy security. If she had said, \u2018We have not lost a single American in Libya,\u2019 then there would be grounds for criticism, but that is not what she said.\"\n\nWhat Clinton is leaving out\n\nThe problem, experts say, is that Clinton\u2019s framing is so narrow that it verges on misleading.\n\n\"The intervention had the consequence of turning Libya into a failed state, which led to much harm, including the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012,\" Kuperman said.\n\nThe attack by armed Islamic militants on U.S. facilities in Benghazi resulted in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department communications specialist Sean Smith, and a pair of CIA contractors, Glenn Doherty and Tyrone Woods.\n\nIn the forum, Clinton used \"a very narrow definition, one custom-built to define away any of the larger problems with the Libyan intervention,\" said Ted Bromund, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. These problems, in his view, include stretching the operative United Nations resolution to enable regime change rather than just civilian protection, and a relative loss of focus by the United States after the combat phase ended.\n\nSuch developments helped turn Libya from \"an exceptionally tyrannical and murderous regime to a failed state with a large and violent Islamist presence,\" Bromund said.\n\nWhen we contacted the Clinton campaign, they emphasized that she had clearly said \"in that action\" -- referring to the military operation -- and dismissed the criticism by Conway and Spicer as misquotes of what she said.\n\nBut as we noted above, her statement is numerically accurate -- while also so narrowly framed as to be misleading.\n\nClinton said that \"with respect to Libya \u2026 we did not lose a single American in that action.\"\n\nShe cited deaths during the \"action,\" which means the NATO military operation. On that score, she accurately said that no Americans died during the seven-month military action. However, the critics have a point that framing it this way ignores a broader look at the consequences of the administration\u2019s decision to intervene in Libya.", "lang": "en"}
