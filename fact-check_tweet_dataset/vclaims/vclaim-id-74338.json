(In rare cases, it might be correct for certain medical respirators, known as N95 masks in the US and FFP2 masks here in the UK.)\n\nWe\u2019ve written elsewhere about the evidence on whether masks reduce the chance of spreading or contracting Covid-19.\n\nThe Facebook posts describe people inhaling too much carbon dioxide (causing a condition called hypercapnia), supposedly as a result of wearing masks.\n\n\u201c[The claim that wearing masks can give someone] hypercapnia is malicious misinformation,\u201d says Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham. \u201cSurgeons wear masks for hours doing some operations.\u201d\n\nPaul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, conducted a review of the evidence on mask-wearing in April. He told Full Fact: \u201cWe spent some time looking for evidence of harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are studies that show, with an N95 mask, some people have an elevated blood carbon dioxide level, and some also reduced oxygen level, so there is an element in truth in that. That does not apply to ordinary surgical masks, and it sure as heck doesn\u2019t apply to other types of face covering.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
