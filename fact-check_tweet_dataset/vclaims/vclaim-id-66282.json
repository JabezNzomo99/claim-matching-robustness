You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here.\n\nBad punctuation aside, the story offers no additional context or evidence of this celebrity feud actually happening. It just repeats the faked Roberts\u2019 quote from the headline and ends with a question: \"Do you stand with Julie?\"\n\nAfter the question, the story contradicts Roberts\u2019 quote by including a YouTube video at the bottom of the article that shows Roberts speaking in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at a rally in 2016.\n\nWe\u2019ve actually seen this fabricated quote before. In January, we debunked a claim that said Sandra Bullock told Hillary Clinton the same thing.\n\nThis headline is pure click-bait clutter, so we rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
