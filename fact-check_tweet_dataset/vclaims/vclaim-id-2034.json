{"title": "Government funding for the rail industry", "subtitle": "How does taxpayer support for privatised rail compare with funding for the old British Rail?", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2034", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/government-funding-rail-industry-bbcqt/", "vclaim": "This is the right order of magnitude. Figures we\u2019ve seen indicate it\u2019s now about three times what it was at the end of the 1980s, although these don\u2019t include loans to Network Rail.\n\nBritain\u2019s privatised railways have been getting around \u00a35 billion on average in government support over the last five years. In the last five years of the 1980s\u2014the earliest period we have figures for before privatisation\u2014it was an average of \u00a31.6 billion in today\u2019s money. As the chart above shows, government support can vary a lot from year to year, often because of big one-off projects, which is why we\u2019ve used five-year averages. The figures for 2015/16, for example, include \u00a3800 million to build London\u2019s new Crossrail line, and in 2016/17 the figures include over \u00a3800 million for HS2.\n\nGovernment support for the rail industry isn\u2019t the same thing as public spending on rail. In 2016/17 as much as \u00a315 billion was spent on railways in total. Part of that seems to be down to how Network Rail\u2014the government-owned manager of the railway\u2014is funded. The government paid \u00a35.7 billion worth of loans to Network Rail in 2016/17, which isn\u2019t included in the government support figures.\n\nNetwork Rail used to be considered a private sector company, but it\u2019s now classed as public sector, and so now borrows money directly from the government.\n\nThe context of the discussion was about whether railways should be nationalised, as was suggested in the leaked draft of Labour\u2019s manifesto. But we can\u2019t draw too many conclusions about what effect privatisation has had on costs from these figures. For a start, we\u2019d want to know what might have happened to government support if franchising had never happened. Going into detail on that is outside the scope of this factcheck.\n\nIt\u2019s still worth bearing in mind that we\u2019ve never been using the railways more, and this clearly has an impact on the amount of funding the system needs to cope.", "lang": "en"}
