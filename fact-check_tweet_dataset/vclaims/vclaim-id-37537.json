They will think of something good for you. Only one mosque has been demolished, let 2-3 more be brought down too.) Several other usual suspects also tweeted the video, including Delhi MLA Kapil Mishra and Rishi Bagree.\n\nOn Facebook, the clip attracted nearly 3 lakh views from the page Shivraj Singh Chouhan Fans Clube. It was also circulated by NAMO TV, I Support Yogi and I Support Narendra Bhai Modi Bjp.\n\nAlt News found that the video of Azam Khan asking Muslims to vote for BJP and not BSP is two years old.\n\nThis was also reported by Amar Ujala on February 23, 2017. According to the news organisation, the SP leader made the statement in Narendralaya, Faizabad ahead of UP assembly elections. Khan was reportedly enraged after seeing blue flags hoisted on Muslim homes. Lashing out at voters, he said, \u201cyou might as well vote for BJP than BSP\u201d, and left the podium.\n\nThe aforementioned statement sounds more like a gibe than Khan literally urging Muslims to cast their votes in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It is to be noted that his statement was immediately followed by the words \u2013 \u201cOne mosque has been demolished, let 2-3 more be brought down too.\u201d\n\nA two-year-old video is now being circulated as Azam Khan advocating for the BJP despite the recent alliance of known political rivals SP and BSP. The Times of Indiareported on January 14 that BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi had circulated the video, and many, including BJP MP Farrukhabad Mukesh Rajput, mistook it as a recent affair.", "lang": "en"}
