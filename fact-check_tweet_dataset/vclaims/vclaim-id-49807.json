Text below states the picture was taken in World War II.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that the field is mined and that if the donkey was free to wonder (sic) as it pleased, it would likely detonate a charge and kill everyone,\u201d the text says.\n\nIt continues: \u201cthe moral of the story is that during difficult times the first ones you have to keep under control are the jackasses who don\u2019t understand the danger and do as they please.\u201d\n\nThere are other examples of the post shared in Australia, including here, here and here, with total shares coming to more than 1,200 and views to more than 1.2 million.\n\nThe claimed \u201cmoral of the story\u201d in the post is a message about controlling dangerous behaviour that may threaten others and is not the subject of this fact check. However the photograph does not depict the situation described. The story behind the photograph of the soldier carrying the donkey is well-documented. It was taken not during World War II but rather in Algeria, in 1958 during the Algerian War of Independence. The conflict was waged against French colonial rule 13 years after World War II ended, and resulted in the formation of the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria in 1962.\n\nThe photograph featured on the UK on Friday 19 September in 1958. The accompanying article says a French Foreign Legionnaire who had a \u201ctender heart\u201d rescued the starving young donkey from the \u201csun-baked Algerian valley\u201d.\n\nThe rescued donkey was named Bambi by the troops of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion in 1958, according to , a site dedicated to documenting the history of this unit of the French Army. Britain\u2019s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sent a letter to the legion for their troops\u2019 \u201cdemonstration of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe real story behind the photo of the piggy-backed donkey has also been examined by fact checkers at and . Snopes refers to a passage by Douglas Porch in his 1991 book \u201cThe French Foreign Legion: A Complete History of the Legendary Fighting Force,\u201d that says the donkey was nurtured back to health by the soldiers, who made it their unit\u2019s mascot.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post misrepresents the photograph. While the claimed \u201cmoral of the story\u201d may appeal to common sense, the photo it claims to be based on is not from World War II and does not depict a soldier carrying a donkey through a minefield. Instead it is a photo taken in Algeria 13 years later of a soldier who is indeed carrying a donkey but only because he is rescuing the animal.
