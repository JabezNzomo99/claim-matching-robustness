No worries, he said.\n\n\"Because I\u2019m fast,\" he joked in a May 18 interview on NBC\u2019s Today. \"They can\u2019t catch me.\"\n\nThis should be obvious: We are not saying that running is a Zika prevention method. (Here are some actual steps to take to avoid being bitten.)\n\nBut we were curious whether Bolt really would outpace the mosquito. (People already have tried to figure out if Bolt can beat a cheetah. He can\u2019t.)\n\nBolt currently holds both the 100 meter and 200 meter world records at 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively. That corresponds to 23.35 miles per hour for the 100-meter dash, and 23.31 miles per hour for the 200-meter dash.\n\nBased on how he\u2019s performed in all past races listed by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Bolt\u2019s average speed is 21.65 miles per hour. Even at his slowest, when he clocked 48.28 seconds at the 400-meter in 2001, he was still running at 18.53 miles per hour.\n\nThe New York Times did an excellent job breaking down Bolt\u2019s prowess in this video from the 2012 Olympics.\n\nSo Bolt runs \u2014 in short bursts \u2014 around 22 miles per hour.\n\nHow does that stack up against mosquitoes?\n\nMany mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti.\n\nFemale aegypti mosquitoes (the ones that bite) are estimated to have a cruising speed of 0.5 to 1.5 meters per second.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of 1.12 to 3.35 miles per hour \u2014 a fraction of Bolt\u2019s speed, even at his slowest.\n\nIn that sense, it\u2019s not a contest.\n\nUntil you factor in stamina. Bolt runs short distances, while the mosquitoes are in it for the long haul. Researchers have documented lady aegypti flying continuously for two to nine hours, with an average of 2.2 hours. So Bolt, or really anyone, would have to run more than 7.37 miles in that time frame to outpace the mosquito.\n\nKenya\u2019s Dennis Kimetto, Bolt\u2019s world record counterpart in the marathon world, ran 26.219 miles in 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He\u2019d leave the mosquito nearly 20 miles behind with that pace.\n\nBolt and Kimetto would have a lot more to worry about if the Zika vector was a desert locust or earworm, which have respective average air speeds of 21 and 17 miles per hour. But for now, Zika-carrying mosquitoes can\u2019t catch up to either man.\n\nThe Olympic champion and world record holder clocks an average speed is 21.65 miles per hour in his races, with 23.35 miles per hour at the high end and 18.53 miles per hour at the low end.\n\nFemale A. aegypti mosquitoes, the main vector for Zika, cruise between 1.12 and 3.35 miles per hour. That\u2019s a lot slower than Bolt, though the mosquitoes fly for much longer than Bolt sprints.\n\nDon\u2019t try this, people. (But if you do, send us a video!)", "lang": "en"}
