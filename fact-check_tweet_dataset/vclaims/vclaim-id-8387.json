If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!\"\n\nDrug trade and policy experts generally agree a border wall likely would not have the impact Trump envisions, we found in a previous report.\n\nThis time around, we decided to take a look at Mexican security. Was Mexico just rated the most dangerous country in the world?\n\nWhile there are multiple ways to measure danger, there is no single ranking for the most dangerous country in the world. The White House did not repond to our inquiry on the record.\n\nMexico does rank first or third for the number of journalists killed for doing their jobs. However, it is out-ranked by other countries in other lists, such as countries\u2019 homicides per capita.\n\nThe only way Mexico falls first is if we only consider the International Press Institute\u2019s number of journalists who were killed in 2017. The global journalism network tallied at least 14 journalists killed in Mexico in its December 2017 report.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists confirmed six cases of murder in retaliation for the journalists\u2019 work, placing Mexico third for killings worldwide and first after conflict zones. The number of journalists killed in Mexico with confirmed motives reached a historical high in 2017, the committee found.\n\nNot so much for the broader public\n\nOutside of journalism, Mexico scores high on danger levels, but not first.\n\nThe Institute for Economics and Peace produces an annual Global Peace Index report, which measures the world\u2019s most peaceful countries using 23 qualitative and quantitative measures of safety, security, ongoing domestic and international conflict, and militarization.\n\nRead inversely, the countries at the bottom of this list could be considered the \"least peaceful.\"\n\nMexico was ranked 22nd from the bottom of that list. Syria was worst.\n\nFrank Zimring, a crime expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said the two most useful measures of danger are the homicide rate of a country and the rate of some index of reported crime.\n\nComparing crime across countries is difficult and discouraged due to disparities in legal definitions, incident reporting and data collection.\n\nThe main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations\u2019 Office of Drug Control. The figures don\u2019t include war-related killings and deaths from internal conflicts, which are generally far higher than intentional homicides.\n\nMexico was 10th on the list in 2015, and El Salvador was first. There were 16 intentional homicides for every 100,000 people in Mexico, whereas El Salvador had 109 per 100,000 population. (The United States, by the way, was 54th.)\n\n\"While Mexico has a significant problem of violence, it is manifestly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,\" Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry retaliated in a press release about Trump\u2019s tweet. \"According to UN figures for 2014 (the most recent international report), Mexico is far from being one of the most violent countries. In Latin America alone, other countries have homicide rates higher than Mexico's (16.4), which is far below several countries in the region.\"\n\nThe most recent year, however, did see Mexico\u2019s highest homicide count since the government began counting in 1997: 29,168 homicide cases in 2017, Mexico\u2019s interior ministry told the Associated Press.\n\nThat places it slightly above the regional average, according to Eric Olson, the deputy director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin American program.\n\n\"To maintain that Mexico is the most violent country in the world would be a very subjective claim, and to say it\u2019s the most homicidal is certifiably wrong,\" Olson said.\n\nTrump tweeted a similar claim in June: \"Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria.\"\n\nThe source of that claim was a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies that said Mexico\u2019s 2016 intentional homicide total, 23,000, was second only to Syria. After the statistic garnered heavy media attention, a press release revealed a \"methodological flaw\" in their fatalities calculation, which spokeswoman Anais Auvray said researchers are working to fix.\n\nRegardless, the report measured the gross number of homicides, which have little comparative value. For context, in 2015 the United States had half the homicide rate as Mexico, yet recorded 15,696 intentional homicides, to Mexico\u2019s 20,762, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe report also excludes other violent Latin American countries, like Brazil, which do not fit the institute\u2019s criteria for armed conflict.\n\n\"The Armed Conflict Database and Survey do not measure homicides on either an absolute or per capita basis,\" a June 23, 2017, news release said. \"We estimate deaths directly related to conflict. We do not provide an assessment of the levels of violence in any country.\"\n\nTrump tweeted that Mexico is \"now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world.\"\n\nThat is the case for journalists, according to two groups that track retaliatory murders. But it is not true for the risk to the broader public, which is not mentioned or clarified in Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\nExperts offered homicide measures as the best measure of a country\u2019s security. By that token, Mexico ranked 10th in the United Nations\u2019 homicides measures in 2015. Mexico\u2019s homicide count reached a record peak last year, according to government statistics.\n\nWhile certainly a cause for concern, that\u2019s doesn\u2019t make Mexico the \"number one most dangerous country.\"\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
