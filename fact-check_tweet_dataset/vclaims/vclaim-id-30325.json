The claim is false; the video has circulated in media reports about Sikh protesters taking to the streets in May 2016 to demonstrate against a Hindu nationalist party in northern India.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook published on December 25, 2019. It has been viewed more than 2,900 times.\n\nIn the clip, a large group of men wearing Dastars, a style of turban worn by some Sikhs, can be heard chanting slogans as they march across a bridge wielding swords and sticks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \"No policemen seen during a protest rally against NRC in Punjab today.\"\n\nNRC is an acronym for the National Register of Citizens, a government-kept record of all Indian citizens, implemented in India\u2019s northeastern state of Assam. The register was criticised after almost two million people were found to have been omitted in its August 2019 release, effectively stripping the state's large minority of Muslims of citizenship, as reported by AFP here on September 2, 2019.\n\nThe video was also shared in posts here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here and here on Twitter with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least May 2016 in reports about a protest unrelated to the NRC.\n\nThe reports stated the protest was called by Sikh organisations in response to a Hindu nationalist party's proposals for a public gathering in the northern Indian city of Amritsar.\n\nA Google reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the video using digital verification tool InVID found the same clip published here on YouTube on May 25, 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of two frames from the video in the misleading posts (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nProtesters in the video can be heard chanting \u201cLong live Khalistan\u201d 35 seconds into the video. Khalistan is the name of the proposed separate country that Sikh separatists seek to create in the Punjab region of India.\n\nThe video caption reads: \"Live From Beas (Shiv Sena not Come to Amritsar)\".\n\n\u201cBeas\u201d refers to the Beas River, which ends in the Indian state of Punjab.\n\nA further Google keyword search found this news report on the protest published here by English-language newspaper Hindustan Times on May 25, 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Hindustan Times report:\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cEven as Hindu right wing Shiv Sena had called off its Lalkar Rally about three days back, Sikh hardliners assembled at the proposed site - the Beas bridge - on the National Highway -1 on Wednesday to challenge them.\n\n\u201cAmid heavy security arrangements, Sikh radicals from across the state started gathering on the bridge early morning. They raised slogans against the Shiv Sena and the state government.\u201d\n\nThe same protest was also covered by other Indian media, including Indian English-language daily newspapers The Times of India and The Tribune, in May 2016.", "lang": "en"}
