The claim is false; the video shows a Mandarin version of a patriotic song that was originally composed in the Indonesian language in 2009; the country\u2019s national anthem is still \u201cIndonesia Raya\u201d.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on July 1, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as:\n\n \u201cNow Indonesia has had a new national anthem \u2018JAYALAH INDONESIAKU\u2019 \n\n One Archipelago... One Nation... One Language... That's Indonesia...\n\n \u2018Thank you...\n\n Thank you...\n\n Thank you to NEW Indonesian Heroes\u2019\n\n \u2018Hope the Spirits of the Heroes Who Defend this Country Will Be Peaceful in Heaven, ALLAH. \n\n Amen\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe 3-minute, 37-second clip shows a music video for a Chinese song. It also displays the lyrics of the song in both Indonesian- and Chinese-language subtitles.\n\nThe same music video has also been shared on Instagram here, and Facebook here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nThe video had been shared more than 4,000 times on Facebook before the post was deleted. The archived post can be accessed here.\n\nThe claim is false; the song in the music video is a Chinese-language version of an Indonesian patriotic song originally entitled \u201cJayalah Indonesiaku\u201d, which means \u201cBe Prosperous, My Indonesia\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese-language version of the song has circulated online since at least 2012; the original Indonesian-language version was composed in 2009.\n\nReverse image searches on Google using a keyframe from the video found the Chinese-language version of the song was published on YouTube here on September 28, 2012.\n\nAccording to this online catalogue by the Indonesian National Library, the audio recording of the original Indonesian-language version of \u201cJayalah Indonesiaku\u201d, written by Soe Sien Ming and Thung Cu Lan, was published in 2009.\n\nThe music video for the original Indonesian-language version of \u201cJayalah Indonesiaku\u201d was published here on the official YouTube channel of recording company Gema Nada Pertiwi (GNP), on August 18, 2010.\n\nBoth the Chinese- and Indonesian-language videos list Soe Sien Ming and Thung Cu Lan as the song\u2019s composers and contain some identical clips.\n\nThe Chinese-language video has the GNP logo at the beginning of the footage.\n\nGNP is a music-recording company based in Jakarta that was founded in 1970. The company says it began to focus on traditional music, pop music and patriotic songs in 1985.\n\nA GNP executive told AFP by telephone on July 16, 2019, that \u201cthe Chinese version of the song was produced at the same time with the Indonesian version in 2009\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese version had been made to introduce Indonesia because the Indonesian version would not be understood in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said they produced the Chinese-language music video.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s national anthem is stipulated in the country\u2019s constitution, which can be accessed here.
