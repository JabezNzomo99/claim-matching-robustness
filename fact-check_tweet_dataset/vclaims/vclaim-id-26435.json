It has been viewed more than 286,000 times and shared more than 14,000 times.\n\nThe 10-second clip shows a woman and a man standing in front of an elevator. At the six seconds mark, the man punches the woman in the face, knocking her to the ground. The man can then be seen grabbing an object which has fallen next to the woman's head.\n\nThe simplified Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cEveryone please try to help by sharing this, and mobilise the power of the internet to find this evildoer. Thanks everybody. Let\u2019s not let our friends, families or children become the next victim.

The woman was hit by an unidentified man while she was waiting for the elevator. The young woman lost consciousness and the man bent over, most likely to rob her.\n\n\u201cThe whole incident only lasted a few seconds. The man took her phone and disappeared. It appears that the attack took place in the M3 apartment block in Cetate district. It occurred around 6 pm Saturday, November 17.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of three moments in the video in the misleading post (L) and the Adev\u0103rul video (R):\n\nRomanian Police on November 20, 2018, published this statement about the incident.\n\nThe relevant part of the statement translates to English as: \u201cOn November 19, 2018, officers from the Alba County Police criminal investigation unit identified a 33-year old resident as a robbery suspect.\n\n\u201cThe man is accused of hitting and stealing the phone from a young woman, aged 20, who was waiting for the elevator in the hall of an apartment building in Alba Iulia.\n\n\u201cHe will face the Alba County Courthouse today, November 20, and prosecutors will decide on the appropriate legal actions against the suspect.\u201d\n\nThe incident was also reported here by Romanian TV channel Pro TV, here by Romanian newspaper Libertatea and here in English by online news website The Romania Journal.", "lang": "en"}
