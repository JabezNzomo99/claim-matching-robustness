At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses.\n\n \n\n Reagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign\u2019s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice. \n\n \n\n Sears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him.\n\n \n\n Gingrich\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan\u2019s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire.\n\n \n\n Staffers left Gingrich\u2019s campaign under very different circumstances.\n\n \n\n News accounts said Gingrich\u2019s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a \"rebellion.\"\n\n \n\n On-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign.\n\n \n\n The departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich\u2019s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn\u2019t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich\u2019s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw.\n\n \n\n Former staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich\u2019s longtime spokesman, and the campaign\u2019s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides. \n\n \n\n Schoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn\u2019t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign.\n\n \n\n \"To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he\u2019s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he\u2019s got very few appearances in July,\" Scoenfeld said. \"You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful.\"\n\n \n\n Tyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke.\n\n \n\n There are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam. \n\n \n\n Gingrich\u2019s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany\u2019s. The primaries are still eight months away.\n\n \n\n Reagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich\u2019s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff.\n\n \n\n At the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that \"campaigns go up and down.\"\n\n \n\n On Fox News, his point that he had \"exactly the same\" problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery.\n\n \n\n Reagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich\u2019s campaign is in a rut.\n\n \n\n Reagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not.\n\n \n\n Reagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich\u2019s left him because they thought he wouldn\u2019t do what it takes to win.\n\n \n\n Gingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained. \n\n \n\n Gingrich might wish he had Reagan\u2019s problems. But on this one he deserves a Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
