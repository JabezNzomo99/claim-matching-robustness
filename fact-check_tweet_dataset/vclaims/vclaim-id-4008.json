Except that the humour didn\u2019t last long. Soon enough, Pratik Sinha of Alt News tweeted a close-up of the doctored and the actual headline (\u2018Modi, Xi to meet 6 times in 24 hours\u2019) to show that the \u2018t\u2019 and the \u2018e\u2019 in \u2018mate\u2019 were larger than the \u2018t\u2019 and the \u2018e\u2019 in \u2018meet\u2019.\n\nThe morphed picture was easily verifiable. One only had to pick a copy of TOI from their living room or office reception and check it. But caution and giving benefit of the doubt to the erring is a thing of old. However, let\u2019s give benefit of the doubt to the users who shared the image. They obviously didn\u2019t believe that the leaders of the two most populated countries in the world would draft a mating schedule, but they probably believed that TOI made the typing error. Too busy to read? Listen to it instead. Typing errors and proof-reading oversight are, after all, very human possibilities and it\u2019s not completely illogical to think that \u2018meet\u2019 could have been misspelt as \u2018mate\u2019. Read some of The Quint\u2019s fake news-busting stories here.\n\nWhen Opinion Decides The Veracity Of News But were users really driven by logic? Hardly. Far from logic or common sense, our personal viewpoint \u2013 whether an informed opinion or unreasonable bias \u2013 is the primary factor that helps us decide whether or not a piece of information is true. In other words, truth is \u2018what we want to believe\u2019 irrespective of whether such \u2018truth\u2019 exists or not. Those sharing the doctored image were guided primarily by their personal views about the Times Group, and the prime minister. This is not to say their views are unreasonable or not based on facts. It\u2019s not off the mark to believe that the Times Group, especially its TV channel Times Now, falters on journalistic duty; or that the prime minister practises discriminatory politics and doesn\u2019t deliver on his promises. Given their opinions, the users were quick to believe that indeed TOI did commit the headline blunder, especially the kind that ends up being a joke on Modi. And thus, at the click of their ready fingers, they ended up doing what their bete noir \u2013 the right-wing \u2013 does best, which is spreading fake news. No, Times of India Didn\u2019t Say Modi and Xi Will \u2018Mate\u2019 in Wuhan\n\n\u2018Opinions Cannot Come Before Facts\u2019 Those who pride themselves in holding informed or fact-based opinions must remember that opinions cannot, must not, come before facts themselves. Opinion cannot exist without truth; it must always settle for the lesser role. But humans are still humans. The heart often overpowers the mind, and thus opinion overtakes truth itself. It is this human weakness that the fake news industry thrives upon. All industries \u2013 whether automobile or pornography \u2013 exist because there is a human need or desire for them. It is also a human desire or need to be fed with information we want to consume, irrespective of its factuality. It is this logic which governs the Facebook algorithm \u2013 the kind of posts we engage with are the ones that end up on our newsfeed. If people want to believe that UNESCO declared Modi to be the \u2018best prime minister\u2019, fake news websites/pages will give it to them. If people want to believe that an Arab prince said \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 on stage, fake news videos will give it to them. If people want to believe that Rs 2,000 notes come embedded with electronic chips, fake news websites/pages will give it to them. If people want to believe that a Saudi cleric gave a fatwa that a man can eat his wife when he is hungry, a fake news website will provide such \u2018news\u2019. Indeed, in the last example, it\u2019s not just our cultural/religious biases, but also our fetish for the outlandish that comes into play. It\u2019s redux Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not (only Ripley\u2019s reported real eccentricities). Reading about others\u2019 incredible vices makes us feel good about ourselves, our culture, our religion. Sharing fake news is thus a reflection of not only one\u2019s biases, but also one\u2019s insecurities.\n\nIndeed, such is the power of human bias and insecurities that political parties use fake news as a tool to swerve public opinion in their favour. The more fertile ground for dispensation of falsities is WhatsApp, where encryption makes it difficult to be caught spreading fake news, let alone originating it. \u2018Fake news\u2019 is an oxymoron \u2013 news, by its very definition, is the reporting of facts, or the truth. How can a fact also be fake? Fake news should be called a rumour as it is just that \u2013 a rumour. But it\u2019s a rumour that is presented as news, in all seriousness, with headlines, place and date if it is published online, or with a trained voice reading the \u2018news\u2019 if it is recorded. This \u2018news-like\u2019 veneer lends the rumours a stamp of authority and credibility. Fake news is not new, of course; it\u2019s been the buzzword since the NDA came to power in 2014. But four years is a long time, and fake news has grown (for lack of a better word) in style and reach. First, it has let go of its news-like veneer. Now, a low-quality video shot on mobile or an ill-drafted message on WhatsApp passes as fake news. In the case of Asifa\u2019s gangrape, there was a WhatsApp message about a Muslim raping the girl and dumping her in a temple. Those who wished to believe this falsity shared the message despite the Delhi Forensic Science Laboratory report establishing that the DNA samples recovered from the girl\u2019s body matched those of the accused. Webqoof: From Kathua to Kerala, Fake Stories of April \u201818 Busted\n\nNow Liberals, Too, Use Fake News To Drive Home Their Point The second, and perhaps, more worrying change is the neutralisation and thus normalisation of fake news. Fake news is the forte of the right-wing; the NDA and its supporters have long been exaggerating Modi\u2019s position in the world and painting minorities in a negative colour. But of late, the left-liberals too have taken to sharing doctored images in order to drive home their ideological point. For instance, when nationwide protests erupted over the brutal gangrape of Asifa, images of two men wearing T-shirts with \u2018Justice for Asifa\u2019 written on them at the Istanbul airport went viral. The images were doctored, as exposed by Hoax Slayer, but were widely shared among those opposed to the BJP. The example of the TOI doctored image followed soon after. When exposed to be untrue, many users remarked, \u201cit was fun as long as the joke lasted\u201d or \u201cthis gives the BJP a taste of its own medicine.\u201d Vineet Jain, Times Group owner, however, wasn\u2019t amused and threatened on Twitter: \u201cTrolls delete your defamatory posts. We are watching you, compiling your names & coming after you.\u201d His rage is understandable, but one wishes he had instructed TOI to exercise caution when it published a blog by Francois Gautier in which the author falsely claimed that medieval French thinker Nostradamus predicted the coming of Narendra Modi in India. When exposed by AltNews, the blog post was first removed and then republished as \u201csatire\u201d. Times Now also carried a fake video of Arab columnist Sultan Sood Al Qasmi saying \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 during PM Modi\u2019s visit to the UAE. The channel wrongly claimed that the person in the video was Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, before it was corrected by Dubai-based daily Gulf News. Indeed, part of the success of \u2018fake news\u2019 is that it has been endorsed by a careless mainstream media that doesn\u2019t do the basic job of fact-checking before relaying it to a larger audience. Remember the \u2018chip-embedded Rs 2000 note\u2019 being reported by Aaj Tak and Zee News?", "lang": "en"}
