Baka lang hindi mo alam kaibigan (In case you don\u2019t know, my friend),\u201d Sonza posted on his Facebook account on July 16, 2019.\n\nThe facts: Data from the National Statistical Institute of Iceland and the World Health Organization (WHO) show that \u201cdiseases of the circulatory system\u201d \u2013 not drug overdose \u2013 are the leading cause of death in Iceland.\n\nStatistics Iceland, the center for the official statistics in the country maintained by the National Statistical Institute of Iceland, said in December 2018 that diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms were the main causes of death in the last 20 years. These diseases take up 33.8% (circulatory system) and 28.9% (neoplasms) of the total causes of death in the country.\n\nThis reflects the official data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Diseases of the circulatory system include deaths due to cardiac arrest, cardiovascular syphilis, and other unspecified disorders of the circulatory system according to the WHO statistical classification of diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cmental and behavioral disorders,\u201d which cover deaths due to substance abuse, only rank 13th based on latest available data from WHO. This category covers a broad type of complications including disorders due to use of alcohol, opioids, cannabinoids, sedatives or hypnotics, cocaine, hallucinogens, tobacco, and volatile solvents.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte reacted to this, saying the Nordic island nation does not understand the situation in the Philippines, and that the Icelanders \"only eat ice.\u201d But there's more to Iceland than ice. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
