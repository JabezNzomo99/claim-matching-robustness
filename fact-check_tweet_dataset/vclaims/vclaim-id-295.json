This claim is false.\n\nThe video's title is \u201cBill Gates advocating for church gatherings to never return, it is getting clearer\u201d, implying the existence of a possible conspiracy ( here ). The video has had over 340,000 views as of May 15, 2020.\n\nThe 29-second clip posted on YouTube stems from an extended interview Gates gave to \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on April 2, 2020 ( here ).\n\nAt no time during the nearly half-an-hour interview does Gates refer to churches, or church gatherings, nor does he advocate for church gatherings to \u201cnever return\u201d. Just after the 17-minute mark, Gates does mention the possible need to limit or prohibit large gatherings of people until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available.\n\n\u201cBut what does opening up look like?\u201d he says. \u201cWhich activities have, like schools, have such benefit, could be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low? And which activities like mass gatherings, may be in a certain sense more optional? And so until you\u2019re widely vaccinated those may not come back at all.\u201d\n\nWhat Gates calls for during the interview is the temporary suspension of activities to prevent the spread of the virus, but his remarks are taken out of context and do not target churches or religious organizations.\n\nAt around the 7:40 mark in the interview, Gates says: \u201cThere will be a point where we have the vaccine and we\u2019re going completely back to normal. And we\u2019ll go somewhat back to normal if we do the right things, not even that long from now.\u201d\n\nBill Gates has been the target of numerous conspiracy theories and unfounded claims on social media since the beginning of the global health crisis. Reuters recently debunked a false claim about Gates presenting a vaccine for religious fundamentalists to the Pentagon ( here ) as well as a claim about Gates wanting to \u201cmicrochip\u201d people ( here ).\n\nFalse. In an interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Bill Gates warned about the possible need for the prohibition of \u201clarge gatherings\u201d until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available. At no time during the interview did he refer to churches, or church gatherings specifically, nor did he advocate for these to \u201cnever return\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
