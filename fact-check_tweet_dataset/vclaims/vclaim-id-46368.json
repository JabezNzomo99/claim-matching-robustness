Several people alleged that this was the result of paranormal activity. Former cricketer Akash Chopra tweeted (archive) the video and wrote, \u201cApparently this happened somewhere in UP. Received via WA. Who\u2019s exercising?? Man shrugging??\u201d This video has been viewed 1.8 lakh times, retweeted 1,300 times and liked 5,300 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nOther than this, the video was widely shared on Twitter and Facebook claiming that it was shot in Japani Park in Rohini Nagar, New Delhi. A Facebook page \u2018The Irritated Indian\u2019 posted (archive) this video on June 12 claiming the same. The video has been viewed 95,000 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe video was also shared with the claim that it was from Rajouri Garden, New Delhi.\n\nSome users even posted the clip on Twitter and Facebook saying it is from Jhansi. People were also warned to not visit this park after sunset.\n\nThe claim that the machine moved due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d is unsurprisingly false. Putting excessive oil and grease in machines reduces friction causing move for a long time even if a little force is applied. The Additional SP of Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Srivastava, said in a tweet that some mischievous elements intentionally made this video to share false news on social media. Rahul Srivastava also tagged Jhansi police in his tweet. Later, a video was shared from the handle of Jhansi police regarding the same incident. City\u2019s Circle Officer informed that the police visited the site to enquire about the incident and found that it was due to excess oil and grease that the machine was moving for a long time after just a push. Jhansi police also tweeted a video in which a policeman pushes the machine and it starts moving on its own.\n\nSeveral media houses published reports after the video went viral, and debunked the claim that a supernatural power was behind moving the park equipment. A guard from Kanshiram Park, Jhansi was quoted in a report by Aaj Tak. He said that he has been working in the park for the past eight years and has never experienced any such event.\n\nFurthermore, Alt News got in touch with Inspector Sanjay Kumar Gupta of Sipri Bazar Police Station. Sanjay Kumar told us, \u201cThe machine got so free after oiling and greasing that it moved for quite some time when pushed once. The machine eventually stopped moving after it gradually slowed down. Even if somebody pushes it with a finger, the machine starts moving again. There is no other angle to this incident. Children sometimes playfully claim that the machine is moving on its own. Somebody took a video and shared it on social media.\u201d\n\nAkash Chopra had raised suspicions about the incident in his tweet but he later shared another video when the truth came out. In the second video, a man is seen busting the lies spread on social media and denying claims of any \u201cghosts\u201d. To prove this, he pushed the equipment from both the sides which caused the machine to move. The man in the video says that some people spread false news to defame the park but there is no reality to these claims.\n\nA SIMILAR VIDEO WAS SHARED WITH CLAIMS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY\n\nThis is not the first time that a video of a moving machine has been shared with claims that it had links with paranormal activities. A similar video was posted by Facebook page \u2018JeDdah YOuth\u2019 on January 13, 2020, claiming that a park in Dubai was possessed by ghosts. This video was viewed 13,000 times as of this writing. The video was also shared on Twitter.\n\nWhat is the truth of this video?\n\nA Twitter handle \u2018@hoaxeye\u2019 shared a post from an Instagram account \u2018kuwaitup2date\u2019. In this post, one can clearly see the reality of the moving machine. A person pushes the machine a little and it can be seen moving on its own for quite some time. This proves that all the claims about the machine being possessed by ghosts are false.", "lang": "en"}
