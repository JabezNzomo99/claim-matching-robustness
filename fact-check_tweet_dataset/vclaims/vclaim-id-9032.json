It\u2019s the only supermarket to publish figures on its food waste.\n\nThe figure doesn\u2019t include waste produced by Tesco\u2019s suppliers, or food bought from Tesco and wasted by households.\n\n59,400 tonnes of food is the same as 119 million meals, if you define a meal as 500 grams of food and drink.\n\nWould this look like a meal to you? On average, women in the UK aged between 19 and 65 eat about 2500 grams of food a day, whilst men eat about 3000 grams. Weight-wise, it\u2019s about the same as a 500ml bottle of coke.\n\nAs an aside, the different types of food wasted probably don\u2019t match the proportions you would eat them in. Nearly four-tenths of Tesco\u2019s food waste, by weight, comes from its in-store bakeries. You probably don\u2019t eat that much from that part of the store.\n\nNot all food waste is simply thrown away. For example, Tesco sells about 30% of its bakery waste to become animal feed, and the rest to companies that produce energy and fertilisers. The company says it hasn\u2019t sent any food waste directly to landfill since 2009.\n\nSome kinds of food waste are harder to avoid than others. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) suggests that all food waste by UK retailers is avoidable in theory, but only 44% could practically be avoided by 2025. We don\u2019t know exactly how much of Tesco\u2019s waste was avoidable.\n\nLast year, Tesco produced the equivalent of about 20% of the food waste produced by all UK grocery retailers in 2014, according to WRAP\u2019s estimates, whilst holding about 30% of the UK grocery market. This comparison doesn\u2019t include food sent to become animal feed because although Tesco defines it as food waste, WRAP doesn\u2019t.\n\nIf we include food sent to become animal feed, Tesco\u2019s food waste equalled about 25% of that produced by all UK grocery retailers in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that those 59,400 tonnes of food waste makes up only a small proportion of the food that is wasted in Tesco\u2019s supply chain or after it\u2019s been sold.\n\nSupermarkets produce a relatively small proportion of the UK\u2019s food waste through their own operations. Households throw away just under half of the UK\u2019s food and drink waste, according to WRAP\u2019s estimates, whilst food manufacturers waste about a quarter. Grocery retailers and wholesalers, which includes supermarkets, account for less than a fiftieth of the total.\n\nTesco runs programmes designed to reduce food waste by its suppliers and customers. And it\u2019s signed the Courtauld commitment to help reduce food waste across the UK food industry as a whole.", "lang": "en"}
