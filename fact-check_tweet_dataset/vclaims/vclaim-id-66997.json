But the claim is false; authorities have dismissed the unfounded rumour, which originated from a website that publishes click-bait content. A prosecutor also confirmed that all cases against Onwuamadike are ongoing.\n\n\u201cA Lagos High Court has sentenced notorious kidnap kingpin, Chikwudubem Onwuamadike, also known as Evans, to death,\u201d reads an Instagram post published by popular Nigerian entertainer Samuel Oguachuba, otherwise known as Samklef. \u201cThe court gave this judgement on Monday (sic).\u201d\n\nThe viral post was shared alongside a video clip showing a screengrab of the same claim published on Samklef\u2019s blog. It has been viewed more than 22,000 times on Instagram since August 19, 2020.\n\nThe claim has circulated on several social media platforms in Nigeria, including on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as on several news sites such as Jamyco and GistMania -- both known for spreading misinformation. AFP Fact Check recently debunked false articles from the websites here and here.\n\nThe rumour about Onwuamadike\u2019s death sentence also emerged amid reports that Nigeria has reintegrated 601 \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram fighters into society. Critics demanded justification from the government for pardoning ex-insurgents, despite repeated killings, while purportedly sentencing kidnappers to death.\n\nNigerian police arrested Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike -- also known as \u201cEvans\u201d -- on June 10, 2017, at his Lagos home. He faces multiple counts in three courts and five separate trials.\n\nAFP Fact Check attended one of the trials in Lagos on August 27, 2020, where Onwuamadike appeared with alleged accomplices Joseph Emeka, Chiemeka Arinze and Udeme Upong.\n\nThey have been charged with attempting to kidnap prominent Nigerian transporter Vincent Obianodo; murders of his police aide and driver; attempted murder; conspiracy to commit a felony, namely kidnapping; and sale and transfer of firearms, according to the court registrar\u2019s office. They have pleaded not guilty and the trial was postponed to September 17, 2020, after a day of witness cross-examination.\n\nDetails obtained by AFP Fact Check show that in the second of his five trials sitting in the same court, Onwuamadike stands accused alongside Victor Aduba, a dismissed Nigerian military officer, of the alleged kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms. Both have pleaded not guilty and the case has also been postponed to September 17, 2020.\n\nIn fact, all criminal cases involving Onwuamadike are ongoing -- none have proceeded yet to judgement and sentencing, said Y.A Sule, a member of the prosecuting team who spoke to AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe director of public affairs for the Lagos justice ministry, Kayode Oyekanmi, also dismissed the rumour of Onwuamadike\u2019s death sentence as untrue.\n\n\u201cThe news about Evans is FAKE,\u201d Oyekanmi wrote in a text message to AFP Fact Check. \u201cNo truth to it at all.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, no credible news outlet in Nigeria has reported on Onwuamadike being sentenced to death.\n\nUsing the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check found that the false article was first published on August 17, 2020, on a website called Observer Times.\n\nIt ran with a click-bait headline, which reads: \u201cBreaking: \u202aBillionaire Kidnappers, Evans To Die by Hanging\u201d, but the body of the article does not actually go on to say that he was sentenced to death.\n\nRather, the text says the suspected kidnapper \u201cmay get life imprisonment or death penalty sentence\u201d because the law in Lagos prescribes this punishment for offences involving kidnapping and forceful extortion.\n\nWhile the referenced law indeed exists in Lagos state, the article\u2019s author did not cite any source reporting that Onwuamadike had been convicted, let alone sentenced to death.\n\nThe Kidnapping Prohibition Law of 2017, under which Onwuamadike is being tried, imposes a penalty of life imprisonment for suspects found guilty of kidnapping, and the death penalty when their victim dies in the course of a kidnapping.\n\nIn other social media posts (archived here and here), an image of five people who appear to be crying accompanies a claim that it shows Evans\u2019 family members weeping following the word of his purported death sentence.\n\nHowever, this is false. The image has been circulating online since at least June 17, 2017, in articles reporting that Onwuamadike\u2019s wife had asked Nigerians for forgiveness on behalf of her husband.\n\nThe story was widely published by Nigerian daily newspapers, including Vanguard and Daily Trust.", "lang": "en"}
