{"title": "The half-a-trillion NHS", "subtitle": "Adding up five years\u2019 worth of spending on the NHS to get a really big number doesn\u2019t tell us very much.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1839", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/half-trillion-nhs/", "vclaim": "Half a trillion\u2014or \u00a3500 billion\u2014 is underselling it a little. Spending on the NHS in England is expected to be almost \u00a3550 billion in today\u2019s money from 2015/16 to 2019/20.\n\nThat\u2019s if you add up planned spending in each of those five years. While this generates an impressively big number, it\u2019s not necessarily that meaningful. If talking about your salary, would you say \u201cI get paid \u00a320,000 a year\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be paid \u00a3100,000 over a five-year contract\u201d?\n\nApart from anything else, the amount of money spent doesn\u2019t say anything about whether it\u2019s going to the right places or keeping up with the demand on the health service.\n\nHealth experts from the Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King\u2019s Fund say current spending plans aren\u2019t enough to maintain standards of care, meet rising patient demand and deliver new services such as the so-called \u201cseven-day NHS\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken down the NHS spending figures here.", "lang": "en"}
