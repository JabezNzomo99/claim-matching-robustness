The caption attached to the video is \u2013 \u201c\u0938\u091a\u093f\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u092f\u0932\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0938\u0941\u0930 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092c\u094b\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092f\u0941\u0935\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942\u091c\u093c (All young friends, watch what Sachin Pilot\u2019s father-in-law is saying. Breaking news.)\u201d\n\nSeveral individual users have widely circulated the video. From the account of one Subhash Jatre, it has over 1 lakh views and nearly 5,000 shares. Multiple right-wing pages have also shared the video (1, 2) with the identical narrative.\n\nAlt News found that the video has been circulated on Twitter as well. A user followed by PM Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office has also circulated the video.\n\nThe oldest instance of the video we could find on social media was December 4.\n\nThe man in the video is NOT Sachin Pilot\u2019s father-in-law, Farooq Abdullah\n\nSachin Pilot is married to Sara Abdullah, the daughter of J&K National Conference chief and ex-Chief Minister of J&K Farooq Abdullah, which makes Pilot his son-in-law. Sara was married to him in 2004.\n\nThe man in the viral video bears no resemblance to Abdullah, as seen in the collage below.\n\nThe video of a person whose identity we are yet to ascertain (and will update the article when we do) was viral as Sachin Pilot\u2019s father-in-law praising PM Modi. Since the conclusion of the recent assembly elections, misinformation targetting the Congress has surged. Earlier, a false claim of Sachin Pilot blackening the poster of PM Modi was viral on social media. In many other instances of misinformation, claims of Pakistani flags and pro-Pakistan slogans raised in Congress rallies were widely in circulation.", "lang": "en"}
