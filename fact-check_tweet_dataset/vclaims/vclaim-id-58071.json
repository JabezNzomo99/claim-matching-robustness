The post is attributed to UNICEF. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading. Though it is a good practice to keep a sanitizer along and clean your hands but there is no evidence that coronavirus stays in hands for 10 minutes. Also, the viral post is falsely attributed to UNICEF.\n\nThe viral post on Facebook reads: Coronavirus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, so putting a sanitizer in the pocket meets the purpose of prevention.

We did not find any message on UNICEF\u2019s website that coronavirus stays in hands for 10 minutes.\n\nWe spoke to Ms. Alka Gupta, Communication Specialist at UNICEF India regarding the viral message. She said: \u201cThis information is not from UNICEF and should not be attributed to the organization. Thanks for bringing to our attention.\u201d\n\nThe message is falsely attributed to UNICEF.\n\nAs per WHO, studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\n\nThere is no evidence proving that coronavirus survives in hands for 10 minutes as stated in the viral post.\n\nWHO recommends to always clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a page named TheKaam.com.

The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed. Remember to check the date when the fact-check you are reading was published before sharing it.\n\nConclusion: The viral post attributed to UNICEF claiming that coronavirus survives in hands for 10 minutes is misleading. Though it is a good practice to keep a sanitizer along and clean your hands but there is no evidence that coronavirus stays in hands for 10 minutes. Also, the viral post is not issued by UNICEF.", "lang": "en"}
