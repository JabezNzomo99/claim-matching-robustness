An increase in coal supplies from the U.S. would threaten those Russian imports.\n\n\u201cUkraine lost coal from Donbas due to the blockade,\u201d TASS quoted Medvedchuk as saying in a Facebook post \u201cThis is a period of decline and total dependence on Washington.\u201d\n\nKyiv imposed the blockade on Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region after local separatists seized enterprises, including coal plants, in the region.\n\nLate last month, emphasizing that a \u201cgolden era of American energy is now underway,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s said that Ukraine had raised the need for \u201cmillions and millions of metric tons\u201d of coal.\n\nCommenting on the statement, Medvedchuk said: \u201cPerhaps for the U.S. this is indeed a \u2018golden era,\u2019 but for Ukraine, where \u2018reformers\u2019 shut down coal mines en masse and destroy the coal sector, this is a period of decline and total dependence on Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile faulty, Medvedchuk\u2019s logic is nonetheless revealing and is as much about geopolitics as it is about business. The numbers prove the claim of Ukraine\u2019s \u201ctotal dependence\u201d on the United States for coal to be bogus.\n\nIn January and February 2017, Ukraine imported $247.24 million worth of coal from Russia (69.1%), $65.4 million (18.3%) from the United States, $20.45 million (5.7%) from Kazakhstan, and $24.51 million (6.9%) from others. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has undermined coal and general production, raising the need for more imports.\n\nNotably, the share of Ukraine\u2019s coal imports from Russia actually increased by 14% year on year during the same period, in part contributing to almost a doubling of the amount Ukraine spent on coal imports since 2016.\n\nInterestingly, RIA Novosti, another Russian state news agency that also quoted Medvedchuk\u2019s comments, admitted that Russia remains \u201cthe largest coal suppler for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe numbers support this conclusion. But, in the context of Medvedchuk\u2019s comments and his alleged pro-Russia lobbying, they also point to Russia\u2019s interest in retaining its geo-economic position vis-\u00e0-vis Ukraine and ensuring it has economic leverage over Kyiv. One source of such leverage are the Russia-backed separatists, who seized numerous enterprises, including coal mines, in Donbas.\n\nMeanwhile, some observers, including Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, suspect that Russia may be planning to resell Donbas coal to Ukraine at higher prices.\n\nAll of these circumstances have prompted Kyiv to seek alternatives to Russian coal, including coal imports from the United States. Just days after President Trump said Kyiv had told Washington it needed \u201cmillions and millions of metric tons\u201d of coal, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced that Ukraine would buy two million tons of coal from the state of Pennsylvania with the first delivery of 120,000 tons set for August.\n\nThose numbers will hardly tip the scales vis-\u00e0-vis Russia: indeed, according to the Russian energy ministry, Russia plans to supply Ukraine with about 10 million ton of coal in 2017.\n\nStill, the expected delivery of U.S. coal is viewed as an important step for Ukraine as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian coal imports while the coal-producing Donbas remains under the control of Moscow-backed separatists. Besides the United States and South Africa, Ukraine is also looking to import coal from Australia and seeking to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix, as it needs to phase out \u201cextremely old and inefficient\u201d coal mines and plants.", "lang": "en"}
