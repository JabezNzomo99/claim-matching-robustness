But this clip is from when he was subtly disagreeing with the president for touting the theory that anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine could be an effective treatment for covid-19. Fauci kept noting that despite some anecdotal reports of success, there was no clinical evidence that the drug would work, even though Trump called it a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not totally sure what the president was referring to,\u201d Fauci told reporters after Trump kept tweeting about hydroxychloroquine. \u201cMany of the things out there are what I have called \u2018anecdotal reports.\u2019 They may be true, but they\u2019re anecdotal \u2026 The president is talking about hope for people.\u201d He added that as a medical professional he first wanted to know whether scientific evidence showed the drug was safe and effective.\n\nNewsom was referring to the federal government\u2019s help with the docking of the infected cruise ship Grand Princess. Unlike some other governors, Newsom has tried not to be openly critical of Trump. \u201cWhen things haven\u2019t gone as expected, Newsom has opted against stoking the mercurial president\u2019s fires,\u201d the Los Angeles Time reported. \u201cOn Saturday, the governor traveled to San Jose to praise the work of a Silicon Valley energy company that is refurbishing ventilators. And he mentioned \u2014 somewhat subtly \u2014 that some 170 devices the federal government sent to Los Angeles County aren\u2019t usable in their current form.\"\n\nHer voice starts with an image of Trump in the Rose Garden from his March 13 news conference, where he said he had no responsibility for the slow ramp-up of testing but did take credit for the relatively low death count of 40. \u201cWe have 40 people right now,\u201d he said. \u201cForty. Compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount.\u201d (By the time the video was released two weeks later, the death toll was over 1,500.)\n\n\u201cI mean, look, this is just coming back to where this conversation started after the news conference. I hear what Sanjay is saying about Tony Fauci giving, you know, a little bit more wiggle room than others. But if you look at the big picture, this was remarkable from the president of the United States. This is a nonpartisan, this is an important thing to note and to applaud from an American standpoint, from a human standpoint. He is being the kind of leader that people need at least in tone today and yesterday, in tone that people need and want and yearned for in times of crisis and uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the president was 100 percent sincere in saying that he wanted to work together in partnership, in a spirit of cooperation. I can tell you the actions he has taken evidence that. His team has been on it. I know a team when they\u2019re on it, and I know a team when they\u2019re not on it. His team is on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Today, you heard a wonderful announcement from the FDA, and I just want to give a shout-out to Steve \u2014 Dr. Hahn \u2014 and the folks at the FDA, where about \u2014 where several hundred of my Commissioned Corps officers work. You\u2019re right, Mr. President, they are tireless. They\u2019re doing things that have never been done before to bring the most \u2014 most prudent advances to the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we inherited a broken, old \u2014 frankly, a terrible system. We fixed it and we\u2019ve done a great job. And we haven\u2019t been given the credit that we deserve \u2014 that, I can tell you. But the one that really deserves the credit are the American people because they are doing things that nobody thought they would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did hear one story this morning, Mr. President, about a senior named Geneva Wood. She actually is at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington. She is not only a grandmother, she is a great-great-grandmother. Ninety years young, and she tested positive for the coronavirus on March 6th. But by all accounts, she\u2019s doing well and she wanted America to know there is hope. And her strength and her enthusiasm is truly an inspiration to the nation. As the president said many times, we\u2019re going to get through this and come out stronger than ever before. And we\u2019ll get through this as Americans, together.\u201d\n\nWe flagged these examples to the Trump campaign and received this response from Trump campaign spokesman Zack Parkinson: \u201cPresident Trump has taken unprecedented action to combat the coronavirus, mobilizing the entire U.S. government to stop the spread of this disease and save American lives. As he has made clear, this fight is not only about providing medical supplies, tests, and assistance to those who need it, but also about coming together as a country and delivering a message of hope to the American people that we will prevail. Many Governors, public health experts, and even media commentators have recognized that leadership, as the Trump campaign\u2019s ad shows.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
