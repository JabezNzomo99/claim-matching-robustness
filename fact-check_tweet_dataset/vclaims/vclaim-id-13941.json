This is the latest video doing rounds on social media. The over one-minute clip shows a man cautioning people against Rahul Gandhi who has bought three extravagant buildings in Italy with India\u2019s money and gets paid in hefty rent.\n\nThe clip is massively widespread on Facebook.\n\nFrom a Facebook page Mera Bharat Mahan, the video received over 1.5 lakh views and nearly 13,000 shares. It was posted on April 27, 2019. \u201c\u0907\u091f\u0932\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u092f\u0940 \u092a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0941 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0908 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u094b \u0913\u0930 \u0926\u0942\u0938\u0930\u094b \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0913 (Truth about Pappu from Italy. Watch and make others watch too),\u201d reads the accompanying caption. In the video, the man can be heard saying in Gujarati, \u201cRajiv Gandhi\u2019s son, Pappu, that\u2019s his building. He purchased this building after looting the entire country. I am in Italy and this is Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi\u2019s building. Pappu makes money while sitting in India through these three buildings. His business is giving these properties for rent. He has looted India. Finish Pappu and throw him out of India. Jai Sri Krishna. I am in Italy.\u201d\n\nThe video was viral in both Hindi (keywords \u2013 \u092c\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0921\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940) and English (keywords \u2013 Pappu Italy buildings).\n\nIt is also circulating on Twitter.\n\nRBI director S Gurumurthy was among those who retweeted the video.\n\nThe buildings showcased in the video are a part of a city square \u2013 Piazza Castello \u2013 in Turin, Italy. The square-shaped landmark houses museums, theatres and palaces, including the Royal Palace of Turin built in the 16th century. Several of the architectural complexes are world heritage sites protected by the UNESCO.\n\nThe collage below shows the Google street view of the Royal Palace in Piazza Castello, juxtaposed with a screengrab of the palace as seen in the viral video.\n\nThe photomontage below shows the approximate location where the viral clip was shot.\n\nThere are also abundant videos on YouTube of the Piazza Castello, where the same architectural complexes are visible.\n\nA ludicrous claim made its way into social media and was given life by many who believed it to be true. The absurdity of the allegation alone raises doubts. Had Rahul Gandhi owned such extravagant property in Italy, the news would\u2019ve made headlines in India. The lack of media reports on his \u201cenormous wealth\u201d is the first clue of its falseness.", "lang": "en"}
