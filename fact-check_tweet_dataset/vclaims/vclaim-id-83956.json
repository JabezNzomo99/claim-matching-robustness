The article cited a police official and two witnesses. (Thousands protest in Indian Kashmir over new status despite clampdown)\n\n\"A large group of people gathered in Srinagar\u2019s Soura area, a police officer said, in violation of orders that prohibit the assembly of more than four people. \" - Reuters reported.\n\nThe figure of 10,000 protesters was attributed to the unnamed police official.\n\nBOOM could not independently confirm the strength of the rally but images and videos from Friday show the crowd was sizeable.\n\nThe BBC on its part too has faced an online backlash for its coverage of Kashmir. At the heart of the uproar is a video which has also been tweeted by BBC's South Asia Bureau Chief.\n\nThe 2.13 protest montage opens with visuals of protesters scurrying and taking cover as firing can be heard in the background. No security forces are visible in any of the frames. Some of protesters appear to be carrying sticks. It is not clear who is responsible for the firing.\n\nThe video also shows a large number of demonstrators walking peacefully through a market area.\n\nAnother scene shows protesters holding a white banner which says, \"Abrogation of Article 370 is not acceptable for us Jammu Kashmir.\"\n\nHowever, supporters of the India government have used clips from the same video and have pointed out to protesters carrying Pakistan flags, Azad Kashmir flags, the flag of a terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed and a poster of slain terrorist Zakir Musa to claim that the video was shot in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\n\nMeanwhile the news agency has defended its coverage of Kashmir.\n\nQatar-based Al Jazeera too has come under fire for its reporting on Kashmir. On August 9, the news agency reported Indian troops had fired live rounds to disperse thousands of protesters in Srinagar.\n\nAl Jazeera's correspondent in New Delhi said protesters were met with live fire, tear gas, and rubber coated steel bullets. (Watch the video below)\n\n\n\nThe visuals accompanying the link show similar footage to that from the BBC's video.\n\nBOOM reached out to BBC and Al Jazeera about the videos, earlier in the day but did not receive a reply till the time of publishing.\n\nHowever, using open source data BOOM was able to independently geo-locate some of the protest footage used by the two news agencies and verify that the visuals are not old.\n\nBOOM looked through the Associated Press's (AP) photo archive from August 9, 2019 and found similar images to the frames seen in BBC and Al Jazeera's videos.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from BBC's video.\n\nAnother photo in AP's archive shows the same shop corner visible in Al Jazeera's video.\n\nIn order to locate where the videos were shot we looked for prominent and unique landmarks in both videos.\n\nBOOM found that portions of a mosque (green dome, two white and green minarets) were visible in both BBC and Al Jazeera's video.\n\nWe first looked for mosques in Soura, Srinagar which looked the same and zeroed in on the Jenab Saeb Masjid in Anchar, Soura, Srinagar.\n\nWe were able to locate the mosque on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a picture of the mosque uploaded by a user in May 2019.\n\nA glimpse of the same mosque can be seen in another Al Jazeera video that was uploaded to YouTube on August 10. (Watch at 27 seconds) It is not clear when the footage was shot.", "lang": "en"}
