The post, which features an article here published by bipartisanreport.com, has over 125 shares and 1221 reactions, as of February 7, 2020.\n\nThis claim isn\u2019t quite true. The article which states that Fox News host Laura Ingraham \u201claughed at Gaetz\u2019s letter\u201d is referencing an interview (publicly available youtu.be/zQdjKON3LhE) Ingraham had with Gaetz on February 6 2020, in which Gaetz talked about his plan to file an ethics probe against Nancy Pelosi. In the article, the Bipartisan Report misquoted Ingraham claiming that she said:\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a formal record because it\u2019s a copy of the speech that the President signed... This is cute, but it\u2019s not going to work\u201d.\n\nThis is an incomplete quote which makes it sound as if she meant these statements herself. She was actually quoting others in both cases. This is what she said:\n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have the majority of the house. I heard today that, \u2018well it is not really a formal record, because it is a copy of the speech the President signed\u2019. I\u2019ve heard some murmurs that \u2018this is cute but is not really going to work\u2019.\u201d\n\nIngraham did not laugh at Gaetz\u2019s letter or his actions nor during the rest of the clip, as suggested in the Facebook post and text of the article. She did say that the copy of the speech \u201cis not really a formal record\u201d and that the filing of an ethics complaint is \u201ccute but is not really going to work\u201c, but she said so quoting what she had heard, not as statements of her own.\n\nTherefore, this Facebook post is false, as Laura Ingraham did not laugh at Matt Gaetz for filing an ethics complaint against Nancy Pelosi, nor did Fox News. The featured article is partly false: while it is referencing an authentic interview and Gaetz really is prosecuting Pelosi for ripping up the SOTU speech, Ingraham never laughed at Gaetz\u2019s letter as suggested, and her words were taken out of context.\n\nPartly false: Gaetz is attempting to prosecute Pelosi, but Fox News did not laugh at him", "lang": "en"}
