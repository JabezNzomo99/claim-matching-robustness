These claims are false.\n\nThe post here reads: \u201cOveruse of hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial soaps will lead to an increase of MRSA (flesh eating) bacterial infections. Overuse of face masks will weaken the immune system making those who wear them suseptible (sic) to viral and bacterial infections. Staying inside lowers Vitamin D levels in the body making those who stay inside more suseptible to viral and bacterial infections. You have been warned!\u201d\n\nDr David C. Hooper, Chief of the Infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told Reuters the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water does not in any way increase the risk of bacterial infections of any type.\n\n\u201cTheir use in fact decreases the risk (of bacterial infections) and is the mainstay of reducing transmission of bacteria in healthcare settings as well as the home,\u201d he said via email. Hooper explained that MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ( here ) and other bacteria from the skin can be actually removed with hand hygiene. \u201cWhat they (the posts) are saying is the opposite of what is true,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMRSA is a type of bacteria that is resistant to some antibiotics and can cause serious infections of skin and bloodstream. It is commonly present on skin without causing infection but when there are breaks in the skin it can cause infection,\u201d Hooper added.\n\nAmidst the new coronavirus outbreak, keeping the hands sanitized is one of the main preventive measures recommended by health authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO) ( here ) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team has previously debunked misinformation on face masks weakening the immune system, visible here .\n\nHealth authorities, including the CDC, recommend the use of masks as a way of strengthening social distancing ( here ) to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nReuters recently debunked a misleading claim that face masks cause hypercapnia, an excessive build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood ( here ).\n\nThe social media post also says that staying inside lowers Vitamin D levels, making people more vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections.\n\nThis claim has more substance, as people are less exposed to sunlight \u2013 an important source of Vitamin D, which helps maintain a healthy immune system - if they stay indoors.\n\nHowever, Hooper said the likelihood of any substantive increase in the risk of infections from less sunlight exposure would be \u201cquite small, relative to the importance of social distancing\u201d amidst the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201cA well-balanced diet and limited outdoor exposure should be adequate (to produce Vitamin D), but supplements are widely available if people are concerned\u201d, Dr Aaron Michael Milstone from John Hopkins University told Reuters via email.\n\nHooper added that sunlight exposure can still occur in settings of social distancing. \u201cPeople can still be outside as long as they distance themselves 6 ft from other persons and can wear masks when closer\u201d.\n\nTo maintain a healthy immune system, Harvard Medicine recommends following general health guidelines, such as eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough sleep ( here ).\n\nFalse. The use of hand-sanitizer or soap and water does not increase the risk of bacterial infection. Face masks are recommended as a way of strengthening social distancing, and do not weaken the immune system. It is unlikely that a lack of Vitamin D caused by staying at home will significantly increase the risk of infections, and in any case there are ways to boost your Vitamin D levels that don\u2019t require exposure to sunlight.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
