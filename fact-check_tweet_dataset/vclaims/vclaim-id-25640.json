A Twitter user @krupashanker was among those who shared the image. This tweet drew over 1,200 likes at the time of writing this article. @krupashanker is followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office.\n\nIn fact, several others who are followed by Goyal\u2019s office have circulated the same photograph with an identical claim.\n\nFrom what it seems, the claim has found a place on WhatsApp and Facebook as well.\n\nThe building atop the hill is not a church but an office of Seshachalam Biosphere Reserve under the government of Andhra Pradesh. A cross visible on top of the building isn\u2019t a Christian cross but a pole with CCTV cameras. A ground report by Telugu media outlet Bharat Today debunks the false social media claims.\n\nThe complete broadcast by Bharat Today can be viewed here.\n\nSimilarities between the viral photograph and the building featured on Bharat Today broadcast are evident.\n\nA photograph of a building of the forest department on Tirumala Hills, Andhra Pradesh was shared as a church. Alt News had recently debunked another piece of misinformation targeting the southern state \u2013 a video of a ruckus at a temple in UP was shared as \u201cChristian police manhandling Hindu devotees at Tirumala.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
