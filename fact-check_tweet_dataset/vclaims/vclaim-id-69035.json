That included the economic growth effects of the tax cuts.\n\u2022 The CBO\u2019s latest long-range forecast predicted lower revenues than it had before passage of the tax cut law. In the 2018-28 period, the government would collect $884 billion less than the CBO previously forecast.\n\u2022 Economists, including a member of CBO\u2019s Board of Economic Advisers, could not identify the source in CBO reports that supported Kudlow\u2019s claim.\n\nThe central argument for tax cuts is that with lower rates, companies will invest more in plants and equipment, which will make workers more productive. And individuals will have more incentive to work because Uncle Sam will get a smaller slice of their paychecks.\n\nA growing economy will, the argument goes, make up for the money the government would have collected through higher tax rates.\n\nIt would be a big deal if the CBO agreed with this argument. The agency is the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress.\n\nThe problem for Kudlow is that the CBO hasn\u2019t.\n\n\"I am quite familiar with the CBO analysis and have no clue what Larry Kudlow is talking about,\" said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley and a member of CBO's board of economic advisers.\n\nThe CBO pointed to its April 2018 report. It devoted an appendix to the tax law alone. In this key table below, the section on \"macroeconomic feedback\" is where the CBO puts its estimate of how higher economic growth from the tax cuts is expected to increase revenues.\n\nTax analyst Nicole Kaeding at the conservative Tax Foundation said Kudlow had exaggerated. Citing the table, she said the CBO expects the tax cuts to reduce deficits by a total of $461 billion over 11 years.\n\n\"This is well below the $1.5 trillion in static cost of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" Kaeding said.\n\nThe foundation ran its own analysis that assumed the economic impact would be greater than the CBO predicted. It still came up short.\n\n\"We estimated a net cost of approximately $450 billion,\" Kaeding said.\n\nOverall, the CBO estimated that the tax cuts would add $1.8 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nHarvard University economist Greg Mankiw, former chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, told us, \"I do not know what numbers Larry (Kudlow) is referring to.\"\n\n\"A reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth,\" Mankiw told PolitiFact in 2017.\n\nThat is pretty much what the CBO estimated.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though the tax cuts don\u2019t juice the economy.\n\nThe CBO said they would boost growth by 0.3 percent in 2018 and by 2022, the level of GDP would be a full 1 percent higher than it would have been. The trouble is, the growth alone doesn\u2019t close the revenue gap, and with deficits higher than they would have been, interest rates would also edge up as government borrowing rose.\n\nHigher interest rates means Washington will pay more for its borrowed money. That further undercuts the ability of tax cuts to pay for themselves.\n\nWe reached out to the White House and did not hear back.\n\nKudlow said the CBO agreed that \"the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP.\" The CBO reports do not reach that conclusion.\n\nThe CBO pointed to its analysis showing the growth impact of the tax cuts reducing deficits by a bit less than a third of the cost of the tax cuts themselves.\n\nEconomists who know the CBO\u2019s work told us the congressional budget forecasters did not say what Kudlow asserted.", "lang": "en"}
