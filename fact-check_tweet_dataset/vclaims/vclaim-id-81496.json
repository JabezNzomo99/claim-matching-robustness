The claim going around with these images is that a pig died after giving birth to a human like baby.\n\nA YouTube video with a voiceover in Marathi claims that a man had sex with a pig and the weird looking creature is its offspring. The video further claims the incident took place in South Africa.\n\nNot only this but there were other images of one more such sculpture going around earlier this year claiming it to be found in Kerala and that it was a new form of life which existed thousand of years ago.\n\nFactchecker Check4Spam tweeted that the same hoax is going around in Switzerland as well and is circulating in French.\n\nBoth these creatures are actually a figment of someone's imagination. Artist Laira Maganuco from Italy is the creator of both the sculptures. She not only makes such sculptures but also sells them online. We found her Facebook profile which clearly mentions that these were not real life creatures but art works made of silicon.\n\nBOOM reached out to the artist and will update its story upon hearing back from her.\n\nSo called human-pigs and other bizarre creatures are staple for social media.
