The claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include the \u2018halal\u2019 stamp; an Islamic food standards authority in Malaysia where the tinned pork is made said the product had not been certified halal.\n\nThe photo was uploaded in this Facebook post on July 12, 2019, and shared more than 450 times after being posted by a page called \u2018Revive Australia\u2019, which has more than 18,000 followers.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cHalal certified pork. Anyone still not sure halal is a scam?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nHalal refers to the dietary standard in Islam, which prohibits Muslims from consuming certain food, including pork.\n\nThe label on the tinned pork in the misleading post includes a doctored stamp for the Malaysian halal certification.\n\nThe image has also been shared on Twitter here and here, as well as here on US based website Quora with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the tinned pork pictured in the misleading posts has never been issued halal certification.\n\nA Google reverse image search found an almost identical photo here on the website of Malaysian food importer Ing Lee Trading, without the halal stamp.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the image on the Malaysian food importer\u2019s website (R):\n\nThe Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) denied having issued halal certification to the particular pork product in this statement published on its website and in this post on its official Facebook page in 2016.\n\nThe statement translates to English states, in part: \u201cIn reference to the picture that has gone viral, JAKIM would like to assert that it has never produced halal logo for a HARAM product like the picture that is being circulated. The result of JAKIM\u2019s investigation at two locations (Miri & Kuching) as informed by the complainant revealed that the product is NOT in the market.\n\n\u201cJAKIM does not rule out the possibility that it is a picture that is purposefully edited by putting the halal logo there. If true, JAKIM strongly condemns the act because it can create prejudice and slander towards the Malaysian Halal Certification.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Malay-language statement:", "lang": "en"}
