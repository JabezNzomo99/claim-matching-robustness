On Wednesday, he used the recent White House report on climate change to charge that Koch Industries is \u201cone of the main causes\u201d of climate change.\n\nU-Mass. \u201cranked Koch Industries as one of the nation\u2019s biggest air and water polluters, period. In one year Koch Industries released 31 million pounds of toxic air,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHow much is that? It\u2019s more than Dow Chemical, Exxon Mobil and General Electric combined emitted. They are the champions.\u201d\n\nActually, the report lists Koch Industries at 24 million metric tons of greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent emissions), which puts the company at 27th on the list, responsible for 0.36 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Exxon Mobil landed in 14th place, with 39 million tons, Dow Chemical was 44th with 15 million tons and GE was not on the list. Combined, those companies actually had more than double the emissions of Koch Industries.\n\nSo does one-third of 1 percent in the United States make a company \u201cthe champions\u201d and \u201cone of the main causes\u201d of global climate change? Perhaps that\u2019s a judgment call, but the Koch brothers\u2019 contribution shrinks even further when seen in global context \u2014 to about 6/1,000th of a percent. That\u2019s because there are many companies overseas that are far bigger polluters.\n\nCarbon emissions, of course, build up over time. Another study, by Richard Heede of Climate Mitigation Services, identified the 90 leading producers of carbon dating back to 1750. (The Guardian newspaper created a terrific interactive graphic that illustrates the impact of different companies from around the globe.)\n\nOnce again, Koch Industries does not make the list. Heede, in an interview, said that Koch did not qualify because it does not actually extract fuel from the earth, such as petroleum or coal, but is simply involved in derivative functions, such as refining and transport. From his perspective, Koch Industries\u2019 impact on climate change was relatively minimal. \u201cThey are not an original extractor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fact is that Koch Industries is one of the leading U.S. carbon emitters, and there is no doubt that the carbon emissions for which they are responsible have contributed to climate change and the dangerous and often deadly consequences that result. We can argue over whether being 27th out of many thousands of companies qualifies as \u201cmajor,\u201d but we would argue that it does. The overall point of Senator Reid\u2019s speech was true: Climate change is real and the Koch brothers \u2014 who as co-owners of Koch Industries are two of the leading U.S. emitters of the carbon emissions that cause climate change \u2014 are spending millions to mislead the public and muddy the existing scientific consensus in order to increase their profit margins. The Koch brothers have been very clear that they want free rein to pollute as much as they want and emit as much carbon into our atmosphere as they want while the rest of us suffer the consequences.\n\nRegular readers know that The Fact Checker has often faulted politicians who deny the science behind climate change. But that does not give license to people on the other side to make exaggerated claims.\n\nIn making the case against the Koch brothers, Reid claimed that they are \u201cone of the main causes\u201d of climate change, saying those words twice. Then he inaccurately characterized the report from which he drew his information, wrongly saying that Koch Industries produced more than three other companies combined in order to assert they are \u201cthe champions.\u201d\n\nCertainly, Koch Industries contributes to climate change, but the relative impact falls well short of being a \u201cmajor cause.\u201d We understand Reid\u2019s overall point, but it\u2019s important to stick to the facts when making such claims. Given that Reid did not accurately describe the U-Mass. report, our rating on this statement tips toward Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
