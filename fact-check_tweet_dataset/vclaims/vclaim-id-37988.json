While the dispute between Hindu and Muslim communities over this land goes back decades, the dispute took a turn for the worse when several Hindu extremists demolished Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. Authorities and law enforcement agencies fear the verdict could be a flashpoint between the two communities. The verdict can be expected anytime up to November 17. This is the date on which CJI Ranjan Gogoi will retire. A verdict is expected before his term ends.\n\nAlso Read: All You Need To Know About The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid Ayodhya Dispute", "lang": "en"}
