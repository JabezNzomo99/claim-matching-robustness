The man in the video even asked the government to permit backriding even just for married couples.\n\nOn April 30, the last day the whole of Luzon was under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), the Department of Transportation (DOTr) released road transport guidelines for areas under general community quarantine (GCQ).\n\nThe DOTr said private vehicle owners, private cars, and motorcycles will be allowed to operate for the purpose of essential travels in areas under GCQ starting May 1.\n\nOn May 13, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque also presented the guidelines for all forms of quarantine measures, including the most recent one called modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ).
