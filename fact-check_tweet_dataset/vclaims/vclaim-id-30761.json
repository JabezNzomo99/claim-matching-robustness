This is false: the image is from a UK trip in April 2018 when he was heckled over Kenya's treatment of a key opposition figure.\n\nThe post was shared on January 20 on this political Facebook Group with more than 300,000 followers. It generated more than 600 interactions, according to Crowdtangle, a social media analysis site.\n\n\u201cKenyans living in United Kingdom demonstrating against Uhuru Kenyatta who is currently attending UK-Africa summit,\u201d the caption reads alongside a picture of people waving placards saying \u201cRespect the Rule of Law\u201d, \u201cBorn Kenyan Forever Kenyan\u201d and \u201cRespect human rights\u201d. The post has been taken down since.\n\nA similar post was shared on this political Facebook Group, which has 80,000 followers. The comments suggest some believe the protests to be recent while others correctly identify the image as being old.\n\nSimilar claims gained more than 100 retweets and 400 likes on this Twitter account with 28,000 followers. Another post sharing the same allegation can be found here.\n\nIt is an old image\n\nA reverse image search on Google and TinEye reveals the picture was first used two years ago. It appeared here and here in local media coverage of protests outside the Chatham House think tank in London after Kenyatta delivered a speech.\n\nMeanwhile, a YouTube search with keywords such as \u201cprotest,\u201d \u201cChatham House,\u201d \u201cUhuru Kenyatta\u201d revealed this video published on April 18, 2018 by a Kenyan media outlet reporting about the protests in London the day before. In the clip, Kenyatta is seen being escorted to his car by his security detail as the placard-waving crowd heckles him.\n\nKenya's leading newspaper Daily Nation reported that the protesters accused Kenyatta of human rights abuses, ignoring the rule of law and mismanaging the Kenyan economy.\n\nDemonstrators also demanded the government obey a High Court order allowing outspoken opposition figure Miguna Miguna back into Kenya after his controversial deportation.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Miguna took part in Nairobi in a mock swearing-in of opposition leader Raila Odinga who claimed to have won the 2017 presidential election.\n\nShortly afterwards, Miguna was deported to Canada after facing accusations of treason. See AFP\u2019s report here and live footage of his departure on an international flight here.\n\nDespite Kenya's High Court ordering officials on February 26, 2018 to allow him back into the country, he has repeatedly been denied entry as this AFP report and this tweet by German airline Lufthansa show.\n\nThe interior ministry at the time said Miguna had \"denounced\" his Kenyan citizenship after obtaining Canadian citizenship several years ago.\n\nHowever, holding dual citizenship is legal in Kenya and Miguna ran for political office in August 2017 with proof of Kenyan citizenship, a key criterion for all candidates.\n\nWhy did the protest image resurface?\n\nThe old picture started re-circulating a day after Miguna took to Twitter and encouraged Kenyan residents in Britain to \u201cshow\u201d Kenyatta \u201cno one is above the law\u201d as he arrived in London for the 2020 UK-Africa Investment Summit on January 20.\n\nThe Kenyan president was among African leaders attending the summit meant to strengthen ties with Britain.", "lang": "en"}
