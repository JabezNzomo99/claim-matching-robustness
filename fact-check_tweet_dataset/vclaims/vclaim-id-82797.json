This is an example of where we\u2019ve got to get our facts straight.\u201d\n\nObama and Alexander were talking past each other. Alexander was citing an overall CBO figure that included the cost of the additional coverage mandated by the law, for an increase of 10 to 13 percent. Obama was focusing on CBO\u2019s prediction that the same exact insurance would cost less, saying at one point that \u201cthe costs for families for the same type of coverage that they\u2019re currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent.\u201d\n\nOne could certainly say Obama\u2019s language was overly parsed, since it might have left viewers with the impression that premiums would go down as a result of the law. As we have often said, you don\u2019t get something for nothing\u2013and that would include the robust package of benefits in Obamacare.\n\nRegular readers may recall that we have explored this CBO estimate before, when we gave Two Pinocchios to then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius for saying that premiums were 16 percent lower than what CBO had projected. (The problem was HHS had reinterpreted CBO\u2019s analysis without fully disclosing that fact.) The CBO analysis, which was never updated, presented average expected costs in 2016 for a family of four with two adults and two children.\n\nWe had previously noted that the most important part of the CBO report was not the dollar figures but the potential positive and negative impact of the law on premiums. The report did indicate that premiums, on average, were expected to increase because of mandates in the law. But it also showed that, as Obama noted, that all things being equal, the same level of insurance would cost less.\n\nIn any case, how does Alexander come up with the statistic that premiums have gone up 50 percent? He takes a 2010 Kaiser Family Foundation estimate that the average individual monthly premium was $215, and then compares it to an estimate for the second lowest \u201csilver plan\u201d released by HHS in 2013 as the exchanges were launched\u2013$328 a month. (Alexander focused on the second lowest silver plan because the administration labeled it the \u201cbenchmark plan.\u201d)\n\nLarry Levitt, one of the co-authors of the Kaiser report, added: \u201cOne other way in which those two numbers may represent an apples to oranges comparison is that they reflect averages across people, and the composition of who is insured could be very different. For example, very few kids \u2013 who have much lower premiums \u2013 are enrolling in marketplace plans because they are generally eligible for Medicaid or CHIP [Child\u2019s Health Insurance Program], yet the 2010 figure for the individual market represents an average across adults and kids.\u201d\n\nThe same Kaiser data show that a bronze plan would cost $249 on average\u2014and $181 in Tennessee. In 2010, the average for Tennessee was $204, so even using the same reports as Alexander, one could make a case that premiums have dropped depending on the plan selected. (There are also huge differences in costs, depending on age, from $146 for the second lowest silver plan for 21-year-old to $392 for the same plan for a 55-year-old in Tennessee, according to Kaiser.)\n\nMoreover, Alexander is ignoring the impact of premium tax subsidies, a key feature of the health care law. A June report from HHS says that 78 percent of Tennessee residents receive some form of subsidy, which reduce their premium by nearly 70 percent on average. The average premium before tax credits is $281\u2014and $86 after credits. (Alexander doesn\u2019t include the impact of tax credits because the conversation with Obama was about premium costs before tax credits.)\n\nAs for that Fox News quote that \u201cAlexander was right,\u201d the reporter did say that, though the Fox News graphic made clear the perceived increase did not account for the impact of tax subsidies. The CBO report said that those subsidies would reduce premiums by 56 to 59 percent.\n\nAs a general matter, one could say that individual premiums have gone up, in part because the health-care law mandates a rich package of benefits. But one cannot ignore the impact of tax subsidies\u2014or easily compare pre-ACA plans with post-ACA plans. Alexander may want to relive his moment in the national spotlight, but he\u2019s misleading viewers with his math that premiums have risen more than 50 percent.", "lang": "en"}
