The Simpsons has always been everyone\u2019s childhood, so the message will be clear and strong enough i suppose.\n\n Imagine you\u2019re sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show, as cruel as it has been, no jokes, no irony, nothing that the Simpsons normally has, and what it\u2019s loved for. Imagine that, how would you feel? \u2026 Think about that deeply, and give yourself an answer, no need to add anything else! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u201d the post caption read.\n\nThis proves that it was made by artist Yuri Pomo and is not a scene from The Simpson.\n\nThe second picture, where a police station can be seen on fire is from the episode \u201cHello Gutter, Hello Fadder\u201d (Season 11, Episode 6). In the scene from where the screengrab has been picked, Homer was pulled over by Springfield\u2019s Police Chief Wiggum for bypassing the traffic. When Chief Wiggum asked, \u201cAlright smart guy, where\u2019s the fire?\u201d, Homer points at the police station which can be seen ablaze.\n\nIn the episode, there is no mention of any protest or a riot. It was just one of the independent jokes.\n\nThe image is an actual image of a building burning. When we put the picture through Reverse Image Search, we found the same image on the website of AP Images.\n\nAccording to the caption, it is a multi-story affordable housing complex under construction in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cA multi-story affordable housing complex under construction near the Third Precinct, burns on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minn. Protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer Monday. (Mark Vancleave/Star Tribune via AP)\u201d the picture caption read.\n\nThe above information clearly establishes that the post in circulation is False.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
