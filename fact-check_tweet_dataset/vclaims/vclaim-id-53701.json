They have previously argued with Sindhi as they claim that he used to abuse them.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is no political angle in this case,\" Meena said.\n\nBhilwara police denied all claims that the victim was beaten because he was chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai. Meena said that the victim and the accused knew each other and had also got into arguments previously. He explained that the accused who also had shops near the victim's stall were annoyed as he would frequently hurl abuses at them. \n\n\n\n\"There is no communal angle in the incident.
