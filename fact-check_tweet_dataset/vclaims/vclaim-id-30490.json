Howard Dean, chiming into the debate over conservative pundit Ann Coulter\u2019s upcoming event at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn February, Berkeley administrators had to cancel a speech by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after protesters set fires and threw objects at buildings. So after Berkeley College Republicans invited Coulter to speak on campus, administrators decided to postpone the event because they couldn\u2019t make the necessary security preparations by the event date, April 27.\n\nAs of April 21, Berkeley has invited Coulter to speak May 2 instead of the original date. But Coulter wants to stick to April 27, arguing that the postponement and other restrictions are arbitrary.\n\nDean took to Twitter with his reaction to comments Coulter made in 2002 about the Oklahoma City bomber. She said, \"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\"\n\n\"Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment,\" Dean tweeted April 20.\n\nThere is no universal definition of \"hate speech,\" though Coulter has made a number of controversial comments about Mexicans, Muslims, Jews and immigrants generally that some might say fall under that umbrella.\n\nRegardless, the courts have decided that there are some forms of speech the Constitution doesn\u2019t protect. But \"hate speech\" isn\u2019t one.\n\nThe First Amendment of the Constitution, included in the Bill of Rights, says:\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nThis clause doesn\u2019t apply to threats, child pornography and \"fighting words\" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight, such as personal insults).\n\nThere are numerous examples of the Supreme Court protecting speech that much of the public would find offensive or consider to be \"hate speech.\"\n\nIn 1969, the Supreme Court said an Ohio law prohibiting public speech that promotes illegal activity violated a Ku Klux Klan member\u2019s First Amendment rights. In 1992, the court unanimously struck down a St. Paul, Minn., law that banned displaying a symbol that \"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,\" like a burning cross.\n\nMore recently, the family of a deceased soldier sued members of the Westboro Baptist Church who had protested the soldier\u2019s funeral with signs displaying anti-gay slogans. But in 2011, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment right to free speech meant that the church members were not liable.\n\nSometimes hate speech is also a threat or \"fighting words.\" In those cases, hate speech would be excluded from protections offered by the First Amendment, said James Weinstein, an expert in free speech at Arizona State University\u2019s Sandra Day O\u2019Connor Law School, in a past PolitiFact interview.\n\nFor example, it would be unconstitutional to ban someone from putting a racial epithet on a sign at a protest. But if someone used the same racial epithet while credibly saying they plan to harm someone of that race, that might count as a threat and therefore lose its First Amendment protection. But the speech loses the protection because it\u2019s a threat, not because it\u2019s hate speech.\n\n\"With that caveat, the overwhelming understanding is that \u2018hate speech\u2019 is constitutionally protected in the United States,\" Michael Herz, a professor at Cardozo Law, previously told PolitiFact.\n\nWe reached out to Dean\u2019s staff for comment and didn\u2019t hear back. But he did link to a tweet from former New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse that referenced Coulter\u2019s statement that she regrets that the Oklahoma City bomber didn\u2019t hit the New York Times building.\n\nEven though Coulter\u2019s comment mentions a violent act, it isn\u2019t clearly \"intended to promote imminent illegal conduct,\" which is the standard necessary for the speech to no longer have constitutional protection, wrote Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a blog reacting to Dean\u2019s tweet.\n\nRegardless, Dean appears to be saying that the Coulter quote is hate speech \u2014 as opposed to a threat or \"fighting words\" \u2014 and that isn\u2019t enough to strip it of its First Amendment protections.\n\nSeparate from the \"hate speech\" question, we wondered if Berkeley\u2019s treatment of Coulter violates her First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nCoulter has the constitutional right to be treated in the same way as other campus speakers without regard to her viewpoint, Volokh said in an interview with PolitiFact.\n\nBerkeley has a policy by which student groups can invite speakers of their choosing, and as a public university, it cannot administer this policy in a way that treats student groups differently based on political leanings, he said.\n\nUniversity administrators have said their concern is not Coulter\u2019s politics; instead they\u2019re worried about the potential for violent protest. But this also might not pass muster as a reason for Berkeley to treat Coulter different than other campus speakers.\n\nThe Supreme Court has established a general principle that a government administrator can\u2019t decide to charge a group a higher fee for event security based on anticipated public reaction to the content of the event, and a lower court found that this applies to colleges, too. So if Berkeley is basing its security decisions on what it expects Coulter to say, that could pose a problem.\n\nDean said, \"Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nThere are some exceptions to the free speech clause in the First Amendment, but \"hate speech\" is not one of them. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held up the right of an individual or group to engage in speech that much of the public likely finds offensive, like displaying swastikas, burning crosses or protesting a soldier\u2019s funeral.", "lang": "en"}
