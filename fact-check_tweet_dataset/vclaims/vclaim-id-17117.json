Elizabeth Warren likes to say, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d She has lots of plans, but there is one on which many of the others hinge: her plan for an \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d an annual wealth tax on all assets over $50 million.\n\nWarren, one of two dozen Democrats running for president, is counting on the revenue she projects it will raise to fund a host of her other priorities on child care, education and more.\n\nBut how would it work exactly? Have other countries tried it, and how did it work there? Will it really raise as much as Warren claims? (Spoiler: Some economists doubt it.) And what do Americans think about the idea?\n\nWe\u2019ll try to answer some of those questions below.\n\nMany of the Democrats running for president have talked about raising taxes on wealthy Americans. Most have talked about repealing some of the income tax relief granted to high-income earners through the Republican-crafted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which affects largely income.\n\nUnder Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan, households would pay an annual 2% tax on all assets \u2014 net worth \u2014 above $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the calculation? Almost everything. As Warren\u2019s campaign website explains, \u201cAll household assets held anywhere in the world will be included in the net worth measurement, including residences, closely held businesses, assets held in trust, retirement assets, assets held by minor children, and personal property with a value of $50,000 or more.\u201d\n\nOr, as Warren put it in a tweet, \u201cIf you own a home, you\u2019re already paying a wealth tax \u2014 it\u2019s called a property tax. I just want the ultra-rich to pay a wealth tax on the diamonds, the yachts, and the Rembrandts too.\u201d\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who study wealth inequality, say Warren\u2019s tax would fall on about 75,000 U.S. households (less than 0.1%) and would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years.\n\nOther Democratic candidates, including Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, have expressed support for the concept of a wealth tax. Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed increasing estate taxes for the wealthy, and has floated the idea of an annual 1% tax on \u201cextreme wealth,\u201d which he defines as assets exceeding $21 million. But Warren\u2019s plan is the most detailed and ambitious so far.\n\nHow would the tax revenues be spent?\n\nWarren is banking on a $2.75 trillion revenue projection from Zucman and Saez to fund a host of her priorities. In speeches, she has laid out those beneficiaries:\n\u2022 Universal child care for every child age 0 to 5.\n\u2022 None Universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year old.\n\u2022 None Raise wages for all child care workers and preschool teachers \u201cto the professional levels that they deserve.\u201d\n\u2022 None Free tuition and fees for all public technical schools, 2-year colleges and 4-year colleges.\n\u2022 None Forgive student loan debt for 95% of those with such debt.\n\u2022 None $100 billion over 10 years to combat the opioid crisis .\n\u2022 None Down payments \u201d on a Green New Deal and Medicare for All.\n\nThe Warren campaign estimates the first three programs \u2014 dealing with child care and universal pre-K \u2014 would cost about $700 billion over 10 years. And the next three \u2014 free public college tuition, money for historically black colleges and canceling most student loan debt \u2014 would cost about $1.25 trillion over 10 years. That would leave more than about $750 billion for the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, the campaign says. That\u2019s not enough to fully fund either one, but Warren says it is enough for a \u201cdown payment\u201d on each.\n\nWhether Warren\u2019s plan would actually raise $2.75 trillion is a matter of debate among economists.\n\nThe $2.75 trillion forecast comes from Zucman and Saez. To estimate how much revenue the tax would generate on wealth over $50 million, the economists used data from the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve Board and the Distributional National Accounts recently created by economist Thomas Piketty, Saez and Zucman. To estimate the revenue from the tax on billionaires, the economists used the Forbes 400 list of the richest 400 Americans in 2018.\n\n\n\nZucman and Saez estimated that people would reduce their reported wealth by 15% \u201cthrough a combination of tax evasion and tax avoidance.\u201d The authors wrote that \u201crecent research shows that the extent of wealth tax evasion/avoidance depends crucially on loopholes and enforcement. The proposed wealth tax has a comprehensive base with no loopholes and is well enforced through a combination of systematic third party reporting and audits. Therefore, the avoidance/evasion response is likely to be small.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut some economists think that assumption is too rosy.\n\nWhile neither the Tax Policy Center nor the Tax Foundation has yet released a full analysis of Warren\u2019s plan, economists at both said there is reason to believe Warren\u2019s revenue estimate is too high.\n\nKyle Pomerleau, chief economist and vice president of economic analysis at the nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation, said that the assumption of 15% tax evasion/avoidance is \u201cactually the average avoidance for the entire U.S. tax system, which is primarily the income tax and payroll tax. These taxes are, in principle, much harder to avoid than a wealth tax because the transaction (income) is hard to game or hide from the tax authorities. There is a good record of how much you are being paid by your employer.\u201d\n\n\u201cA wealth tax, on the other hand, is much harder to enforce,\u201d Pomerleau said. \u201cFor one, much of the wealth tax base doesn\u2019t have a market price. For example, we don\u2019t really know how much a particular privately-held business is worth because equity (stocks) in that company are not regularly traded on the open market.\u201d\n\nPomerleau also warned that because the wealth tax is a significant tax on savings, it will discourage people from holding on to assets. \u201cThis effect will reduce the potential tax base,\u201d Pomerleau said, a trend that was not accounted for in Warren\u2019s estimate.\n\nHoward Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has similar concerns.\n\n\u201cFirst, while her plan anticipates some tax avoidance, it will be very difficult for the IRS to keep up with the tax planning that highly-paid lawyers and accountants can devise,\u201d Gleckman told us via email. \u201cWith so much money at risk, the wealthy will have powerful incentives to hire smart advisers to help avoid, or at least reduce, their tax liability.\n\n\u201cSecond, a large share of wealth held by the high net worth taxpayers is in the form of privately held businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these are notoriously difficult to value. In effect, the IRS would have to prove that a taxpayer\u2019s valuation is unreasonably low.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect she would collect less revenue than she predicts, but I cannot say how much less,\u201d Gleckman told us.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the Washington Post on April 4, Lawrence Summers, a Harvard University professor who was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama in 2009 and 2010, and Natasha Sarin, an assistant professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School, took direct aim at the $2.75 trillion estimate.\n\n\u201cCommon-sense revenue estimates by economists who are not very deeply steeped in revenue estimation tend to be overly optimistic,\u201d Summers and Sarin wrote.\n\nThe two looked at the U.S. experience with estate tax data and concluded Warren\u2019s wealth tax would only raise about 40% of the amount estimated by Saez and Zucman. And that\u2019s being \u201cmaximally optimistic about the wealth tax\u2019s revenue potential,\u201d Summers and Sarin wrote.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that to a great extent it reflects the myriad ways wealthy people avoid paying estate taxes that in some form will be applicable in any actually legislated wealth tax,\u201d Summers and Sarin wrote. \u201cThese include questionable appraisals; valuation discounts for illiquidity and lack of control; establishment of trusts that enable division of assets among family members with substantial founder control; planning devices that give some income to charity while keeping the remainder for the donor and her beneficiaries; tax-advantaged lending schemes; and other complex devices known only to sophisticated investors. Except for reducing a naive calculation by 15 percent, Saez and Zucman do not seem to take account of these devices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf our suspicion is correct, such a wealth tax will not yield the revenue that its proponents hope for, and that when actual scorekeepers score actual proposals, their estimates will disappoint advocates,\u201d they concluded.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the $2.75T is not realistic,\u201d Sarin wrote to us in an email. \u201cThe closest we get based on extrapolation from the estate tax (which seems relevant because it involves a very similar population and thus many of the same evasion incentives and possibilities) is around 40% of this estimate.\u201d\n\nIn an email response to FactCheck.org, Saez challenged the Summers and Sarin use of the estate tax to estimate the effects of Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposal.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that the estate tax is very poorly enforced and that the rich manage to largely avoid/evade it by giving to heirs before death, spouses, and charity, using lots of trick to discount assets,\u201d Saez wrote.\n\n\u201cWe have assumed an evasion rate of 15% based on the best literature on the question (as we discuss in our letter and in more detail here),\u201d Saez added.\n\nSaez said the Summers-Sarin estimate that the tax on those with assets worth more than $50 million would bring in just $25 billion a year implicitly assumes \u201cthat over 90% of the wealth will be hidden.\u201d That\u2019s not reasonable, Saez said, because \u201c80% of the assets of the rich are publicly traded stocks, bonds, real estate for which there are clear market values.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a simple example to debunk Summers-Sarin: the Forbes 400 richest have $7.2 billion on average in 2018, the Warren tax on them would collect $82 billion (assuming zero tax evasion), that\u2019s already 3 times more than Summers and Sarin $25bn number. How are Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc. going to pretend the Amazon and Facebook stock they own is worth only 10% of their market value? Impossible if the wealth tax is seriously enforced as Warren plans to do,\u201d Saez said.\n\nIn a point-by-point written response to the Summers-Sarin post, Saez and Zucman argue that their estimate is not a \u201c\u2018best case\u2019 scenario\u201d but rather a middle ground. \u201cWith pre-populated returns based on a systematic reporting of information by third parties, a full taxation of all assets at their market value with no exemption, high audit rates, and a high exit tax, it is possible that avoidance would be below 15%,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSarin agreed that the estate tax is poorly enforced, and has numerous loopholes that make avoidance possible.\n\n\u201cI think where we disagree is that I would view this precedent as illustrative of the fact that taxes like this one are likely to be diluted by the same sorts of loopholes and tricks that make the estate tax raise much less than a naive estimation (like the one we and Saez and Zucman engage in) suggest that it should,\u201d Sarin said. \u201cThe wealth tax\u2019s proponents seem to believe that it will be unique relative to the history of tax policy in the US and won\u2019t be watered down. Maybe. But I think the revenue estimates should engage with the possibility that the tax is more likely to be in line [with] our past experiences, rather than totally distinct from them.\u201d\n\nThe Warren campaign says there are no loopholes or exemptions for different types of assets, that the IRS already has estate tax rules in place on how to value assets, and that her plan would increase funding for the IRS to crack down on evasion.\n\nSarin said the Saez and Zucman estimate might be \u201ccloser to right if their plan is to not exempt charitable giving from the wealth tax,\u201d and said that they ought to be clear about that.\n\nAsked about charitable donations, the Warren campaign told us that once you give your money away to charity, it\u2019s no longer part of your wealth.\n\nAs for Pomerleau\u2019s warning about the difficulty of enforcing a wealth tax, Saez said, \u201cWe think wealth is actually easy to measure in a modern economy with well defined property rights and a sophisticated financial sector. We envision systematic 3rd party reporting of all assets with market values. Unlisted stock is only about 20% of the assets of the super wealthy. We think there are ways to value those pretty accurately. For income tax, evasion rate is very low 2-3% when there is 3rd party reporting but huge (50%) when there is not (such as self-employed expenses).\u201d\n\nWe take no position on these competing opinions about how much revenue the wealth tax would generate.\n\nWhat has been the experience of other countries?\n\nWhile as many as a dozen countries in Europe had a wealth tax in the early 1990s, that number has dropped to three as of 2018, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report. (In 2018, France replaced its net wealth tax with a new real estate wealth tax.)\n\n\u201cDecisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns and by the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goals,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also, with a few exceptions, been very low.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, the report concludes that from both an efficiency and equity perspective, there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax in addition to broad-based personal capital income taxes and well-designed inheritance and gift taxes,\u201d the report states. \u201cWhile there are important similarities between personal capital income taxes and net wealth taxes, the report shows that net wealth taxes tend to be more distortive and less equitable. This is largely because they are imposed irrespective of the actual returns that taxpayers earn on their assets. The report also argues that capital income taxes alone will most likely not be enough to address wealth inequality and suggests the need to complement capital income taxes with a form of wealth taxation. The report finds that there is a strong case for an accompanying inheritance tax on efficiency, equity and administrative grounds.\u201d\n\nSarin said the OECD report provides \u201cinternational evidence on wealth taxation that shows that even wealth taxes that are imposed on a much larger swath of the population than Warren is contemplating raise much less than Saez and Zucman estimate. I don\u2019t know how they reconcile these differences. I think their main point is that they are going to be much better on evasion, but as I said I\u2019m skeptical that is going to be as significant as they seem to believe (though agreed that it\u2019s really important to be better on tax compliance).\u201d\n\nStill, the authors of the OECD report wrote, \u201cThe report shows how a net wealth tax can serve as an imperfect substitute for taxes on personal capital income, on capital gains or on wealth transfers.\u201d\n\nThe report then makes several recommendations to guard the effectiveness of a wealth tax \u2014 lessons learned from the European examples. Warren\u2019s plan has attempted to incorporate many of those suggestions.\n\nFor example, the OECD report recommends a wealth tax only be levied on the very wealthy, that the rate should be low and exemptions and reliefs should be limited (to prevent those subject to the tax from moving assets into exempted categories), and that payments should be allowed in installments for those \u201cfacing liquidity constraints.\u201d All of those are part of Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nUnder the Warren plan, those with liquidity issues would be able to defer tax payments, with interest, for up to five years. And to guard against wealthy Americans simply moving out of the country to avoid the wealth tax, Warren\u2019s plan would assess a one-time 40% \u201cexit tax\u201d on the net worth above $50 million for those who renounce their citizenship.\n\nMany look to the example of Switzerland, which has the largest wealth tax. A 2016 National Bureau of Economic Research report looked at the effects of wealth taxation on reported wealth in Switzerland and estimated that \u201ca 0.1 percentage-point rise in wealth taxation lowers reported wealth by 3.5% in aggregate.\u201d (Or that a 1% wealth tax lowers reported wealth by 34.5%.)\n\nOne of the authors of the study, MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, said his research provides a \u201cpessimistic\u201d estimate that suggests \u201cthe [Warren] tax would raise less than 50% of the proposed total.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, Zucman and Saez were totally above board in their analysis,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cThey noted that my estimate for Switzerland was much smaller than what you would get from other international studies, since the Swiss have only voluntary reporting of wealth.\u201d\n\nStill, he categorized the $2.75 trillion estimate as an \u201cupward bound.\u201d\n\nSaez and Zucman say the study coauthored by Gruber is an outlier, and they point to several other studies that showed far smaller avoidance/evasion responses to the wealth tax in other countries. (See footnote 2.) They said their 15% tax avoidance/evasion response to a 2% wealth tax is based on the average across all four of those studies.\n\nWhat do Americans think about Warren\u2019s plan?\n\nWarren has said her tax plan is not only generally popular in the U.S., but that even Republicans support it.\n\nIndeed, several recent polls do show support for Warren\u2019s plan. Among the nearly 2,000 surveyed in a Feb. 1-2 Morning Consult/Politico poll, 61% favored Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan, including 50% of Republicans.\n\nSimilarly, an online New York Times poll in February found that 61% of Americans said they approved of imposing a 2% tax on the wealth of households with a net worth of more than $50 million, including a slim majority of Republicans. And in March, a Des Moines Register/MediaCom/CNN Iowa Poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers found 89% support new taxes that target people with more than $50 million in assets.\n\nFinally, a Jan. 22-23 Business Insider-SurveyMonkey poll found that 54% of respondents approved of Warren\u2019s idea. About 19% disapproved, and roughly 15% offered no opinion.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, a group of 19 ultra-wealthy progressive Americans signed an open letter, published by Medium, calling on all 2020 presidential candidates to embrace a wealth tax, and specifically referencing Warren\u2019s proposal as a worthy example.\n\nThe letter is signed by billionaires including financier and mega liberal donor George Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and Disney heiress Abigail Disney.\n\n\u201cWe are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans \u2014 on us,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cAmerica has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more. A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms. Instituting a wealth tax is in the interest of our republic.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
