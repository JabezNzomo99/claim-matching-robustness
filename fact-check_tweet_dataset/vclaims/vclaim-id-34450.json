No, that's not true: Thomas Bowers, who worked at two large banks over recent decades, committed suicide by hanging at his Malibu, California, home on November 19, 2019, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. His suicide has not \"caused speculation\" about his \"real cause of death,\" except for stories arising from questionable websites known to promote unsourced conspiracy rumors. The only named source in the original report is the publisher one of the stories, and his claim to have personal knowledge of Epstein's banking relationships is in question.\n\nWhile Bowers' work as the head of Deutsche Bank's American wealth management division has been part of a federal investigation, it was concerning his approval of loans for President Donald Trump, not relating to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bank acknowledged it was conducting an internal investigation of its dealings with Epstein, but Bowers, who left Deutsche Bank in 2013, was not himself under investigation.\n\nThe claim originated in a TruePundit.com article and was soon repeated in several stories, including an article published by Big League Politics on December 3, 2019 titled \"Jeffrey Epstein's Long-Time Banker Found Dead From Hanging, Immediately Ruled a 'Suicide'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe jail cell suicide of Jeffrey Epstein on August 10, 2019, triggered several conspiracy rumors based on the suspicion that powerful people were using murder to stop revelations about the Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operation. A new rumor was launched a week after banker Thomas Bowers was found dead in his home. Two websites -- TruePundit.com and BigLeaguePolitics.com -- published stories claiming that Bowers had a close relationship with Epstein while he worked at Deutsche Bank and Citigroup.\n\nThe Big League Politics story, which parroted the True Pundit article, noted that Epstein opened several accounts with Deutsche Bank after another bank distanced itself from him in 2013:\n\nThe bank spokesperson quote was lifted from a Bloomberg.com story from July 23, 2019. Bloomberg made no mention of Bowers or an FBI probe of his purported dealings with Epstein. The stories, however, attempted to create a false narative that Bowers had information about Epstein's sex trafficking and that he died \"before the FBI questioned him.\"\n\nDid Bowers have \"extensive ties\" to Epstein as claimed? Lead Stories has been unable to find a detailed resume' for the banker, but we did find references to Bowers leaving Deutsche Bank in 2013 and also 2015. If Epstein moved his money to Deutsche Bank accounts in 2013, then Bowers would not have been there through much of Epstein's relationship with the bank. Epstein had lost most of his high-powered friends well before 2013. Former President Bill Clinton and future President Donald Trump cut ties with Epstein before the Florida sex investigation began in 2005. Britain's Prince Andrew stopped socializing with Epstein in 2010.\n\nBoth the Big League Politics and True Pundit articles, however, claim that Bowers and Epstein became banking buddies years before when Bowers work for Citigroup and approved big loans for Epstein. Big League reported:\n\nFormer bank executive Mike Moore, who led a Citigroup division's anti-money laundering unit during a time when Citi was in bed with Epstein, commented on the nature of Epstein's loans with the corporate lender.\n\n\n\n\"The loans to Epstein were personal and commercial,\" Moore said. \"The Citi loans I can confirm were for more than $25 million. Some were secured, some were not.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to sources that spoke with True Pundit, Epstein received similar loans from both Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, and it is not a coincidence that Bowers worked in the same role for both banks when Epstein was doing business with them. Bowers was chief of The Citi Private Bank, and led Citigroup's Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses before he made his way to Deutsche Bank.\n\nTurns out \"former bank executive Mike Moore\" is the founder of TruePundit.com, where he uses the alias \"Thomas Paine.\" In other words, Moore was the source for Paine's story, but they are the same human. Moore/Paine's approach to journalism has been closely examined by Buzzfeed reporter Craig Silverman for an August 27, 2018 story titled \"Revealed: Notorious Pro-Trump Misinformation Site True Pundit Is Run By An Ex-Journalist With A Grudge Against The FBI\":\n\nSilverman's report also revealed that Moore/Paine has a recent criminal record:\n\nSilverman confirmed that Moore/Paine worked in the past as a journalist, but he could find no evidence he was \"a former banker\" with CitiGroup. He challenged Moore/Paine in a tweet to explain why Citigroup said he never worked for them:\n\nAnother look at who is Moore/Paine can be read at https://whoistruepundit.com/.\n\nAside from Moore/Paine's validity as a source for what kind of business Epstein did with Citigroup, there are credible reports that the banking relationship was short and sour. The Wall Street Journal, in an August 28, 2019 article titled \"Jeffrey Epstein's Road Through Wall Street Was a Bumpy One\", that Epstein used JP Morgan for most of his money matters prior to moving to Deutsche Bank:\n\nThe WSJ reported that Epstein did take out two $10 million loans from Citigroup in 1999, which he defaulted on, leading to lawsuits:\n\nBy 2002, the investments were in trouble. Mr. Epstein defaulted on both loans, even after Citigroup extended their repayment deadlines, the bank later claimed. Mr. Epstein filed a lawsuit in District Court of the Virgin Islands claiming Citigroup had defrauded him and misrepresented information related to the investments, which he said had been made on the recommendation of Ms. Davison, who \"aggressively solicited my participation.\" Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Davison declined to comment.\n\n\n\nCitigroup filed its own suit in the Southern District of New York for repayment of the loans. Both parties dropped their suits in 2005. Mr. Epstein's relationship with Citigroup was severed in 2006, according to people close to the matter, around the time Mr. Wexner stopped working with Citigroup, the people say. A spokesman for Mr. Wexner declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Epstein was a client for a short period of time, before his abhorrent behavior came to light,\" a Citigroup spokeswoman said.\n\nThere is no indication that Bowers was close to Epstein during that \"short period of time\" or that their friendship survived the lawsuits. True Pundit claims an unnamed \"banking executive\" said Bowers visited Epstein's private island but his name did not appear on any of the flight logs carrying passengers there. It also said Bowers had \"an active night life and enjoyed the party circuit,\" but that does not serve as evidence he did so with Epstein.\n\nThe Big League story ends with this claim:\n\nThere is another high-profile banking relationship involving Bowers that the FBI and Congress are probing: President Donald Trump. For more on that, read the London's Metro newspaper report titled \"Banker who signed off Trump loans found dead after killing himself\".\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bigleaguepolitics.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
