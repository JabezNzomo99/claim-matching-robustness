No, that's not true: the story and the killer's motives were widely reported in Germany right after the attack happened in April 2018. The claim that the German goverment tried to ban reporters from mentioning the child are pulled out of thin air by a website that takes real news stories but adds outrage-inducing headlines in order to get more visitors for economic gain through advertising. There is no ban in effect.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on July 6, 2018 titled \"Migrant Beheads 1-Year-Old Girl In Germany; Merkel Bans Media Reporting\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAngela Merkel's pro-migrant government has banned German media from reporting on a barbaric crime involving a Muslim migrant who allegedly beheaded his one-year-old baby daughter on a train station platform in Hamburg. According to eyewitnesses, the 33-year-old suspect, Mourtala Madou, beheaded his one-year-old daughter in front of a horrified crowd of commuters at Jungfernstieg station on Thursday April 12, and then stabbed his German girlfriend, the mother of the child.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, implying the German government is suppressing the story out of poltical motives:\n\nIn reality the attack was widely reported in Germany, for example in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany's biggest newspapers:\n\nRight in the first sentence it says a 33-year old man stabbed his ex-wife and 1-year-old daughter. The girl died on the scene, the ex-wife died later in hospital.\n\nThe paper followed up with more background on the motives and identity of the killer:\n\nThe man was a migrant who was in a custody battle over his daughter and he feared he would be sent back. The story mentions his immigration background and name and explains why all of that is relevant to the killing. In fact the article came with a note from the editors:\n\nAs a rule, the SZ does not report on ethnic, religious or national allegations of suspected offenders. We only deviate from this line agreed in the Press Code for justified public interest. This may be the case for exceptional offenses such as terrorist attacks or capital crimes, or for crimes committed by a larger group (such as New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne). There is also a public interest in search of a wanted man or if the biography of a suspected person is relevant to the offense. We decide this on a case-by-case basis and are fundamentally reluctant to avoid prejudice against minorities.\n\nSo the paper even explicitly mentioned the migration background even though they don't normally do this if it isn't relevant to a story.\n\nHere is even more German media coverage of the killing, all mentioning the child being murdered:\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Australia NOT To Bankrupt Parents Who Don't Vaccinate\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Jeanine Pirro NOT Confirmed By Trump To Be Next Supreme Court Justice\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Former Clinton Aide Indicted For Child Sex Trafficking\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Say US Must Open Borders To 'As Many Migrants As Possible'\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Give Pedophile Priest Diplomatic Immunity To Avoid Prison", "lang": "en"}
