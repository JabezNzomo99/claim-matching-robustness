But the president's claim that he ended a policy of separating migrant children instituted by Mr. Obama is false.\n\nWhile some migrant families were separated during the Obama and Bush administrations when immigration officials determined parents posed a risk to their children, there was no government policy of systematically separating children from their parents.\n\nUnder the discontinued \"zero tolerance\" policy of increased prosecution for those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the Trump administration forcibly separated more than 2,600 migrant children from their families near the southern border and designated them as unaccompanied minors.\n\nAfter massive public outcry, including from many Republicans, Mr. Trump was forced to sign an executive order in June 2018 to rescind the policy crafted and implemented by his administration.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's denials on Tuesday, multiple administration officials have told CBS News both the president and his senior adviser Stephen Miller have advocated for the policy's revival as part of their \"tougher\" approach to immigration \u2014 which led to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation and a purge of the agency's leadership.\n\nA senior administration official told CBS News on Tuesday that a modified family separation proposal is being looked at \"internally\" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The so-called \"binary choice\" policy would give migrant parents two options: allow the government to separate their children from them or waive their children's special protections so they can be held in detention together indefinitely.\n\nThe official said the roll out of the policy faces \"significant challenges\" because of logistics, including the amount of available detention space and empty beds. The policy would also likely face formidable court challenges.", "lang": "en"}
