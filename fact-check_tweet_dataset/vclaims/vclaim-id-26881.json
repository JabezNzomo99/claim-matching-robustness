Click here to view an archived version of the story.\n\nWhile the initial tweet did not claim that the photo was taken at Indira Gandhi's funeral, it is now going viral on Twitter and Facebook with the misleading claim. A tweet claiming the same was also retweeted by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Subramanian Swamy.\n\nIt was also posted by the Facebook page India Israel Connect. The text of the post says, \"At Indira Gandhi's funeral - why is son Rajeev Gandhi offering prayers in Islamic mode ? Nearby PV Narasimha Rao is doing it the Hindu way.\" (archived link)\n\nThe image was shared over 100 times at the time of writing the story.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image and found two links that matched the photo online.\n\nWe found a tweet by Mohsin Dawar a politician in north Waziristan.\n\nWe also found the same photo on a website www.skyscrapercity.com (Archived site)\n\nBoth the tweet and the website state the image was taken at the funeral of \n\nfreedom fighter Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan better known as 'Frontier Gandhi' or Bacha Khan, in Peshawar on January 21, 1988. The image appears to be from a book.\n\n\n\nGhaffar Khan who died at the age of 98 had suffered a stroke six months before his death on January 20, 1988.\n\nWe also found news articles including those from the New York Times. and LA Times, which confirm Rajiv Gandhi attended Bacha Khan's funeral along with a few members of his cabinet and family.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from an archived article by United Press International.\n\n\n\n\"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi became the first Indian leader to visit Pakistan in 28 years today, flying to Peshawar to pay last respects to a leader in the fight to end British colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent four decades ago.\n\nAn Indian military aircraft carrying Gandhi, his Italian-born wife, Sonia, and several Cabinet ministers, touched down in the capital of the North West Frontier Province, 100 miles west of Islamabad, at 12:49 p.m., airport authorities said. \"\n\nWe also found a video on YouTube that includes a colour photograph showing the same scene from a different angle.\n\n\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, better known in India as 'Frontier Gandhi' worked to end the British rule in the sub continent and for the interest of his Pashtun tribesman. A towering figure, literally and figuratively, he was a close friend of Mahatma Gandhi and a lifelong proponent of non-violence. He spent several decades in British and Pakistani prisons and in exile.\n\nIndira Gandhi was cremated in keeping with Hindu customs on November 3, 1984. She was assassinated by two of her bodyguards on October 31, 1984.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "lang": "en"}
