For example, a viral tweet thread alleged:\n\nThe claim\u2019s underlying notions were these: DeJoy was a political ally to the Republican president, and the new postmaster general had used his new authority to order Postal Service carriers and clerks to slow deliveries to help Trump win the 2020 November election. A backlog of ballots in the weeks or days before Election Day, critics of the president worried, could lead to votes going uncounted or deemed invalid due to state laws governing mail-in election deadlines.\n\nWhat follows is an examination of federal documents obtained by Snopes \u2014 including letters by members of Congress, campaign finance reports, and internal memos to Postal Service employees \u2014 as well as interviews with postal union representatives and a Postal Service spokesperson, to determine the legitimacy of those questions. DeJoy could not be reached for an interview for this report.\n\nNote: Snopes not only investigated DeJoy\u2019s relationship to Trump, but his financial stake in companies that compete with the Postal Service to evaluate if, or to what extent, his past investments provided any evidence of a plan to undermine the Postal Service\u2019s longstanding mission: to provide mail service to every American, no matter their address or income.\n\nYes. DeJoy, who lives in Greensboro, donated more than $1.2 million to the Trump campaign between August 2016 and February 2020, according to campaign finance reports compiled by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when or how DeJoy developed a relationship with Trump, and why he decided to support the billionaire\u2019s political pursuits. In a 2005 interview with Greensboro\u2019s local newspaper, DeJoy \u2014 then-CEO of New Breed Logistics, a distribution and warehousing company \u2014 appeared less supportive of Trump, saying his self-important attitude on the reality-TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was destructive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be fired,\u201d DeJoy said, if he was a contestant.\n\nNonetheless, by early 2017, DeJoy was among his state\u2019s top donors to Trump (see below for The Charlotte Observer\u2019s list that ranks DeJoy at No. 3 with a total contribution of $111,000). And by October of that year, DeJoy had become close enough to the president to host him and other donors for fundraiser at his Greensboro house.\n\nAlso, by that time, DeJoy\u2019s wife, Aldona Wos, had been appointed by the president to serve as vice chair of a White House commission that oversees paid fellowships in federal offices, according to the couple\u2019s foundation website.\n\nIn addition to his contributions to Trump\u2019s political campaigns specifically, DeJoy has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican causes or campaigns over decades, the FEC records show.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s governing board, a group appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate, selected DeJoy as Postmaster General on May 6, 2020, after what it described as an extensive nationwide search for qualified candidates. At the time of that decision, Trump had appointed all six board members \u2014 Chairman Robert Duncan, John Barger, Ron Bloom, Roman Martinez IV, Donald Moak, and William Zollars \u2014 since the early days of his presidency.\n\nDeJoy, who was in charge of fundraising for the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Charlotte when the board made its announcement, made the following donations since the start of 2020, according to filings from the FEC:\n\u2022 January 15, 2020: $150,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign; $217,800 to the Republican National Committee.\n\u2022 April 9, 2020: $35,000 to help re-elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, in November; $27,200 to the National Republican Congressional Committee; $5,000 to the Majority Committee PAC, which says on Facebook its goal is \u201cholding Nancy Pelosi accountable and helping Republicans take back the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nIn sum, considering DeJoy\u2019s record of donations, as well as evidence of him hosting a Trump fundraiser at his Greensboro home in fall 2017, it is accurate to claim that the new postmaster general is a political ally to the Republican president.\n\nThe answer to this question is less clear.\n\nIn summer 2020, the viral claim about DeJoy \u2014 that he had directed carriers to delay mail to benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign (which we unpack below) \u2014 took on another layer: that DeJoy had also allegedly invested $70 million of his own money in delivery companies that compete with the Postal Service.\n\nThat allegation, which we deemed mostly true (see the explanation below), was particularly worrisome for critics of Trump and DeJoy, who believed the alleged holdings were more proof of the two leaders conspiring together \u2014 this time in an attempt to privatize the Postal Service.\n\nHere\u2019s some context before we dive into DeJoy\u2019s personal assets: Conservative Republicans have long pushed to remove government from mail services that they believe should be left to the private commercial market. Since Trump took office, he has called the Postal Service \u201ca joke\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cdelivery boy,\u201d considering its package rates, and has floated the idea of eventually privatizing the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, others fear dismantling the federally-mandated mail service would disproportionately affect people who live in rural areas, where private companies such as FedEx and UPS either charge higher rates or do no shipments at all.\n\nAt the same time, the Postal Service \u2014 which does not receive tax dollars for its operating expenses \u2014 faces a worsening financial situation due to a 2006 congressional mandate that required the agency to prepay health care benefits of retirees, as well as a decline in first-class mail customers. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those long-standing problems, forcing several post offices nationwide to completely close or scale back hours.\n\nFor instance, on April 9, 2020, roughly one month before DeJoy was selected to lead the Postal Service, then-Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the agency was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due \u201cdirectly to COVID-19\u201d and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years. Considering those projections, she said the agency could \u201crun out of cash this fiscal year\u201d \u2014 or the end of September \u2014 without federal intervention. (Brennan announced her retirement in October 2019, after more than 30 years with the agency.)\n\nThe former Postal Service leader made those comments shortly after federal leaders negotiated a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which, initially, included a $13 billion one-time boost for the mail service. But, purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aides to Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the stimulus package, and instead included a $10 billion loan that the Trump administration could leverage in its favor. Then, on July 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that under DeJoy\u2019s leadership, the postal agency gave Mnuchin\u2019s office\u2019s proprietary information about the Postal Service\u2019s most lucrative private-sector contracts, such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS, in exchange for the loan money.\n\nBy that time, Congressional leaders and Trump were battling yet again over another emergency relief package; Democrats proposed a $25 billion boost for the Postal Service but then lowered that amount to $10 billion during talks with Republicans.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2020, during an interview on Fox Business Network, the president said frankly the tug-and-pull over Postal Service funding was part of his administration\u2019s plan to try to make it harder for the agency to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots in the November election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money,\u201d Trump told host Maria Bartiromo, referring to the false claim that Democrats are are proposing a universal mail-in voting system. \u201cThat means they can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting; they just can\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to DeJoy\u2019s assets, and the above-mentioned claim that he had \u201c$70 million invested in companies that compete with USPS.\u201d For the basis of this analysis, we considered private companies that provide shipping or distribution services, such as DHL, the FedEx Corporation, and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), business competitors with the post office.\n\nFor more than 30 years, DeJoy was the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a supply chain business that contracted with a variety of public and private companies, including the Postal Service. In 2014, XPO Logistics acquired DeJoy\u2019s company, and he served on the company\u2019s executive team or board of directors until May 2018. According to internal documents, which we obtained using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) database of company filings, XPO Logistics considered its competitors to include DHL, FedEx, UPS, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services.\n\nAside from that evidence, which proved DeJoy\u2019s former company competed for business with organizations that also competed with the Postal Service, Snopes uncovered a letter from his wife, Wos, to a White House legal advisor on January 3, 2020, that listed her family\u2019s financial assets, known as \u201cAttachment A.\u201d According to that list, the family had stock in companies including UPS, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc.\n\nShe wrote the letter in response to a nomination by the Trump administration to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada, and she said she would divest from all holdings in the document within 90 days of her confirmation. However, as of this writing, Wos had not been sworn into the position. The letter, which was available via the Office of Government Ethics, read:\n\nAs of June 15, 2020, the day DeJoy assumed his role as postmaster general, The Washington Post reported the couple had between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in Postal Service competitors or contractors. XPO Logistics represented the vast majority of those investments, and the couple\u2019s combined stake in UPS and trucking company J.B. Hunt, for examples, was roughly $265,000.\n\nOn DeJoy\u2019s first day, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, said in letter to the Postal Service\u2019s board of governors\u2019 chairman: \u201c[DeJoy\u2019s] financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Services, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, raise questions\u201d over his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan interests.\n\nBy that point, a spokeswoman for DeJoy told journalists he had resigned as finance chair for the Republican National Convention, and would \u201ccomply with any financial divestitures that are required\u201d for the new leadership position.\n\nIn sum, reports proved the DeJoy family at one point had millions of dollars in assets in companies that compete or contract with the Postal Service, which lend credibility to the viral assertion.\n\nBut the exact amount of such investments was unclear, and as of this writing, it was unknown if or to what extent the couple had divested any of the financial holdings.\n\nDid DeJoy Order Mail Carriers To \u2018Slow the Mail Down\u2019?\n\nNot exactly \u2014 but there is some truth to the claim.\n\nUpon our analysis, the rumor seems to have stemmed from a series of directives DeJoy gave Postal Service employees since he took over the agency. On his first day, for example, he addressed the agency in a video that alluded to impending changes under his leadership that aimed to create a \u201cviable operating model,\u201d though he did not go into specifics.\n\nThen, in mid-July, he issued several memos to employees, including a \u201cNew [Postmaster General\u2019s] expectations and plan.\u201d Those messages to all managers, clerks, and carriers nationwide appeared to be the source of the claim, and detailed changes to how and when the Postal Agency would deliver mail.\n\nA July 10, 2020, internal document to managers, which Snopes received from the American Postal Workers Union and refers to an \u201coperational pivot\u201d for the agency, said the following, for example:\n\nBut perhaps most relevant to the claim, the DeJoy-sponsored directives included instructions for employees to leave letters or packages at distribution centers if they delayed carriers from their routes \u2014 contradicting previous rules for deliveries \u2014 and said the Postal Service would no longer pay employees overtime to complete all mail deliveries. The July 10, 2020 memo said:\n\nWe also considered a separate message to employees in July 2020 that said, under a new initiative, carriers in certain regions would not sort any mail during the morning and instead clock in, retrieve sorted mail from the previous day and limit time in the office as much as possible. Then, when they returned from the streets, they would sort all available mail for the next day.\n\nThe agency said the extra spending on employees\u2019 overtime or delivery trips had not improved \u201cour performance scores,\u201d without going into detail on what that meant, and framed the changes as necessary steps to improve its financial position. A July 27, 2020, public statement from DeJoy said:\n\nDavid Partenheimer, manager of media relations for the Postal Service, told Snopes that the postmaster general was not doing any media interviews regarding the initiatives, nor about the underlying claims of this report. In a roughly 760-word email to us, however, Partenheimer reemphasized what the agency viewed as the need for the adjustments, and said:\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that temporary service impacts can occur as we redouble our efforts to conform to the current operating plans, but any such impacts will be monitored and temporary \u2026 and corrected as appropriate.\u201d\n\nSoon after the directives, American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told us in a phone interview that employees and customers across the country were noticing mail delays. In the Philadelphia region, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported situations where residents were going upwards of three weeks without receiving packages and letters, and postal union leaders and carriers said mail was piling up at offices, unscanned and unsorted.\n\n\u201cWhen you \u2026 say this is what you have to do as workers, then that\u2019s what we have to do \u2014 [the change] runs counter to everything that the Postal Service is about, which is we treat the mail as our own; we get it to the customer as quickly as we can,\u201d Dimondstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never seen mail backed up like this \u2014 it\u2019s not being moved.\u201d\n\nThat meant, while DeJoy had not told carriers to \u201cslow the mail down\u201d verbatim, he initiated changes to how and when carriers go about doing their job that the Postal Agency said would cause temporary mail delays.\n\nHowever, it would be inaccurate to assume all slow deliveries under DeJoy\u2019s leadership were a result of the July 2020 directives specifically, when they could also be linked to reduced hours for some post offices or other circumstances.\n\nDid DeJoy Order Mail Changes To Help Trump?\n\nRoughly three months before the 2020 presidential election, voting rights groups and outspoken critics to the president believed the new directives by DeJoy occurred at a convenient time for Trump: when a record number of Americans were preparing to vote by mail and avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 coronavirus by casting ballots at in-person polling places.\n\nSpecifically, they worried the new requirements for post office carriers and clerks would lead to backlogs of mail-in ballots and thus create challenges for elections officials who, in the majority of states, must invalidate ballots that reach them after Election Day \u2014 even if they were postmarked before that date. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, for example, led colleagues in writing a letter to DeJoy on July 20, 2020, that said:\n\n\u201cWhile these changes [to mail service] in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner \u2014 an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nWe asked Dimondstein, APWU president, whether he believed the July directives by Postal Service leadership were somehow linked to a plan to cause mail service chaos before the November election and help Trump win reelection. He said:\n\nPartenheimer said any notion that DeJoy made decisions for the Postal Service under directions from Trump (which include claims that he issued the July 2020 changes that resulted in delays to help Trump\u2019s re-election campaign) were \u201cwholly misplaced and off-base.\u201d\n\nHe said the Postal Service, typically an apolitical agency, remains committed to \u201cfulfilling our role in the electoral process\u201d in places where politicians allow voters to cast ballots by mail and \u201cto delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.\u201d He elaborated:\n\n\u201c[Despite] any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail. Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.\u201d\n\nDays later, he said in a statement to news media that \u201ccertain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards,\u201d especially if election officials don\u2019t pay more for first-class postage. \u201cTo the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, on Aug. 18, 2020, DeJoy issued a statement in which he said he would temporarily suspend initiatives \u201cthat have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,\u201d including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips. The statement read:\n\nIn sum, it was accurate to state that DeJoy, a political ally to Trump, ordered Postal Service workers to leave late-arriving mail at distribution centers for delivery the following day and eliminate extra trips in July 2020 \u2014 a change the Postal Service was expecting to cause temporary mail delays \u2014 although no verifiable evidence proved those directives were part of a deliberate scheme to disenfranchise voters in the November 2020 election. Additionally, there was no proof to show the changes aimed to help Trump win reelection.\n\nFor those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
