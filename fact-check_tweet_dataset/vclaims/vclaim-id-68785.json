Imagine taking less than 30 minutes out of your day to make the trip. If Hyperloop One builds a routein Missouri, that\u2019d be a reality.\n\n\"Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they\u2019ve ever seen,\" he told the Kansas City Business Journal on Oct. 19.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, published a white paper for Hyperloop in 2013, which was presented to former President Barack Obama later that year. According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc. was established in Los Angeles in 2014.\n\nEarlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021.\n\nEssentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph.\n\nIn May 2016, Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017. Says his amendment on a budget bill \u201cwould have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated. Every single Senate Democrat voted against it.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn\u2019t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn\u2019t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal.\n\nIn response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation. The coalition includes MoDOT, the University of Missouri System, St. Louis Regional Chamber and the KC Tech Council.\n\n\"They were on the edge in that competition,\" Katz told the newspaper. Now, he said, \"they are as competitive\" as any on the initial list.\n\nThe company had previously weighed in as part of Missouri\u2019s aggressive pitch for attracting Amazon to either St. Louis or Kansas City for its second headquarters. Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on the state\u2019s Amazon HQ pitch website.", "lang": "en"}
