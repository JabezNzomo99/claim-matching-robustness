Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said it's \"okay to eat pets\" if food runs scarce.\n\nOn May 9, 2020, the BIZ News website published a story reporting that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., stated that it was \u201cokay to eat pets\u201d if food runs scarce.\n\nThe story circulated on Facebook, prompting Snopes readers to ask whether Ocasio-Cortez, often called by her initials AOC, had really made the remark quoted in the headline: \u201cIf Food Runs Scarce, It\u2019s Okay To Eat Pets.\u201d\n\nThe story also contained another purported quote from Ocasio-Cortez:\n\n Ocasio-Cortez did not make these comments, which have not been quoted or referenced in any legitimate news sources. We therefore rate this claim false.\n\nBIZ News is a junk news website with a track record of fabricating inflammatory quotes and attributing them to Democratic political figures, including a fake quote attributed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stating that senior citizens were \u201cnot entitled to Social Security.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
