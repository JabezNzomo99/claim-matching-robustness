But we found that some of those ads are misleading.\n\u2022 In Ohio, a CLF ad misleadingly suggests that Democratic candidate Aftab Pureval was \u201cselling out Americans\u201d because he worked \u201cat a D.C. lobbying firm\u201d that \u201cmade millions helping Libya reduce payments owed to families of Americans killed by Libyan terrorism.\u201d Pureval never did any lobbying, and the Libyan settlement was signed before he joined the firm.\n\u2022 In Virginia, an ad attacking Abigail Spanberger claims she would vote for a Medicare for All bill \u2014 but Spanberger has said she does not support the bill.\n\u2022 Another ad attacking Spanberger calls her \u201ca risk we can\u2019t afford\u201d because \u201cSpanberger taught at an Islamic school called Terror High, a school so radical one graduate tried to kill President Bush.\u201d Before joining the CIA, Spanberger was a long-term substitute AP English teacher at the Virginia school for a year, several years after the man graduated.\n\u2022 An ad in Washington\u2019s 8th District misleading claims Kim Schrier\u2019s support for a state income and carbon tax would make taxes overall \u201cmuch worse.\u201d Schrier said the state, which relies on high sales taxes, should \u201cmove toward a progressive income tax.\u201d But there\u2019s no detailed plan to assess whether it would result in a net tax increase.\n\u2022 In Illinois, an ad attacking Brendan Kelly claims he \u201cpled out\u201d 50 percent of crimes as state\u2019s attorney for St. Clair County. But that figure is both inaccurate and unremarkable. St. Clair\u2019s actual rate is comparable to the state\u2019s and those of its five surrounding counties.\n\nCongressional Leadership Fund, which bills itself as \u201cthe super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership,\u201d is by far the biggest-spending super PAC attempting to influence races in the upcoming November elections. It announced in early October that it had surpassed its $100 million fundraising goal to help elect Republicans to the House in the midterm elections. To date, the group says it has amassed a war chest of $132 million.\n\nAll four of the House races we write about here are rated as \u201ctoss-ups\u201d by the Cook Political Report.\n\nAn ad CLF is running in Ohio\u2019s 1st Congressional District misleadingly suggests that Democratic candidate Aftab Pureval, in his work \u201cat a D.C. lobbying firm,\u201d was \u201cselling out Americans\u201d because the firm \u201cmade millions helping Libya reduce payments owed to families of Americans killed by Libyan terrorism.\u201d\n\nPureval worked at a large law firm that does a bit of lobbying work. But he never did any lobbying work for the firm. Nor was he involved with a settlement the firm helped to negotiate on behalf of the Libyan government to compensate victims of terrorism. Furthermore, Pureval\u2019s opponent, as a member of the House, signed off on the deal.\n\nThe narrator of the ad begins by saying, \u201cPolitician Aftab Pureval will say anything to get elected.\u201d The ad then cuts to a clip of Pureval in an ad saying, \u201cThe special interests and lobbyists rig the game to benefit themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cPureval should know,\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cHe worked at a D.C. lobbying firm. But worse than Pureval\u2019s lies is his hypocrisy. Pureval\u2019s lobbying firm made millions helping Libya reduce payments owed to families of Americans killed by Libyan terrorism. Selling out Americans? Aftab Pureval can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 2008, Pureval was hired that September by White & Case, a large global law firm that, like many large law firms, also does some lobbying work. Pureval, however, was never a lobbyist, and he did no lobbying for the firm. Rather, he acted as an antitrust associate, his campaign said. The Lobbying Disclosure Act database shows no record that Pureval has ever been a registered lobbyist.\n\nPrior to Pureval joining White & Case, the New York-based law firm was hired by the Libyan government under the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi to help reach a settlement to compensate victims of several terrorist attacks, including the 1988 bombing of Pan-Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. A settlement that would pay those victims $1.5 billion was approved by then-President George W. Bush a month before Pureval joined White & Case.\n\nThe settlement agreement was approved in the House by consent without objection. Among those who did not object was Rep. Steve Chabot, Pureval\u2019s opponent in the House race. The Libyan Claims Resolution Act also passed the Senate by unanimous consent and was signed by President Bush on Aug. 4, 2008 (a month before Pureval joined White & Case).\n\nPureval\u2019s campaign said Pureval never worked on the settlement. In fact, Pureval never worked on any matter having to do with Libya, his campaign said. And as the Cincinnati Enquirer noted, Pureval was not one of the three White & Case attorneys who registered as foreign agents and submitted expenses related to representing Libya in 2008, according to Justice Department records. Pureval is not listed as a foreign agent for any country in the Department of Justice\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act database.\n\nCLF unleashed two misleading attack ads against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who is facing incumbent Republican Rep. Dave Brat for Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District seat.\n\nThe first ad portrays Spanberger as being in lockstep with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 whom Spanberger says she would not support to be speaker of the House if Democrats regained control of the House \u2014 and claims she would vote for a Medicare for All bill that Spanberger has said she does not support.\n\n\u201cAs a mom of two, I\u2019m in charge of balancing my family\u2019s budget,\u201d Susan Beals of Midloathian, Virginia, says in the ad. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t support Abigail Spanberger. Spanberger joined Nancy Pelosi to oppose the $2,000 middle class tax cut. And Spanberger would vote with Pelosi for a $32 trillion government takeover of health care, nearly doubling the debt. Spanberger and Pelosi would raise our taxes and put America deeper in debt.\u201d\n\nThe \u201c$2,000 middle class tax cut\u201d refers to Spanberger\u2019s opposition to the 2017 Republican tax law. Though that shorthand to describe the tax plan is a regular Republican talking point, a Tax Policy Center analysis of the plan found that the average tax cut would amount to $380 a year for those in the second income quintile, $930 for those in the middle quintile, and $1,810 for those in the fourth quintile. As for the effect for a typical middle-income family, as we wrote in March, the Tax Policy Center calculated that a family of four with two young children and an adjusted gross income of $75,000 would see a tax savings of $2,119 in 2018. But the savings would be nearly half that ($1,119) for a couple earning the same amount but with two older children, 17 and 18 years old. And by 2027, both of the couples would be paying $150 more in taxes, the Tax Policy Center said, because most of the personal income tax cuts are set to expire that year.\n\nAs for the ad\u2019s suggestion that Spanberger would be in lockstep with Pelosi, Real Clear Politics noted that in an April interview, Spanberger praised Pelosi but said she would \u201cvery much like to vote for someone else\u201d to lead the Democrats in the House. It\u2019s true that the House Majority PAC \u2014 a PAC with ties to Pelosi \u2014 is running ads in support of Spanberger, but she told NBC News in August, \u201cUnder no circumstances, would I vote for Nancy Pelosi to again be speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nThe ad\u2019s claim that Spanberger would \u201cvote with Pelosi for a $32 trillion government takeover of health care, nearly doubling the debt,\u201d is a reference to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All Act, which would expand Medicare into a universal health insurance program.\n\nAn Urban Institute analysis of an earlier version of Sanders\u2019 plan \u2014 which is cited in the ad \u2014 concluded it would increase federal expenditures by about $32 trillion over 10 years (though it concluded overall national health expenditures would increase by $6.6 trillion over that period). Whether the federal debt would double depends on how the plan is offset by increased taxes, though the Urban Institute says the tax revenues suggested by Sanders so far are \u201cmuch too low to fully finance the plan.\u201d\n\nBut Spanberger doesn\u2019t support that plan. She told USA Today in August she opposed \u201ca government-run single-payer health care system,\u201d and she told Richmond2Day in August: \u201cThe single-payer bill that is currently before Congress is not one that I currently support.\u201d\n\nRather, as she has stated repeatedly throughout her campaign, she supports the Medicare-X Choice Act, which would offer a public plan option based on Medicare to those under age 65 who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces.\n\nCLF points to an interview in January in which Spanberger said, \u201cI think that single-payer is a really great direction to go towards.\u201d But her fuller answer (starting at the 24-minute mark) was that: \u201cWhether or not we are ready if the Democrats take Congress in 2018 to fully move towards a single-payer system, that I\u2019m not sure about.\u201d\n\nSpanberger said her \u201cgoal is to ensure that as many people as possible \u2013 that everyone \u2013 has access to affordable, quality health care. And that\u2019s full stop, my goal.\u201d She added that in order to provide stability to the health care system, she wants to \u201cmake sure that any legislation we can reach really does have a significant amount of bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nAnother CLF ad targeting Spanberger attempts to tie her to an Islamic school in suburban Washington, D.C., once dubbed \u201cTerror High\u201d because one of its students aligned with al Qaeda years after graduating.\n\n\u201cAs a mom, nothing\u2019s more important than my family\u2019s safety,\u201d Lane Carr, of Henrico, Virginia, says in the ad. \u201cAbigail Spanberger is a risk we can\u2019t afford. Spanberger taught at an Islamic school called Terror High, a school so radical one graduate tried to kill President Bush.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Spanberger spent a year as a long-term substitute teacher of AP English at ISA, an Islamic School funded by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia. And it\u2019s also true that a one-time valedictorian of the school, Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, was later convicted of joining al Qaeda and plotting to assassinate then-President George W. Bush.\n\nBut it\u2019s beyond a stretch to call Spanberger a \u201crisk,\u201d as the ad does, because of her brief employment as a substitute teacher at the school. In 2002, after graduating from business school, Spanberger applied for employment with the CIA and received a conditional offer to serve in the National Clandestine Service, her campaign said. As she awaited background clearance, which can sometimes take years, Spanberger discussed a substitute teaching position at the school with CIA recruiters, and the CIA was fully aware of her employment. After teaching at the school from December 2002 to December 2003, Spanberger took a job as a federal law enforcement officer at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and then in 2006 began working for the CIA on counterterrorism and nuclear-related issues.\n\nAhmed Omar Abu Ali, who is serving a life sentence, graduated from the school several years before Spanberger was a teacher there. And his arrest came after she had left the school.\n\n\u201cFor a Republican Super PAC to question my national security credentials and integrity based on the time I spent as a long-term substitute, teaching English to children at an embassy school in Northern Virginia, is desperate and weak,\u201d Spanberger said in a statement provided to FactCheck.org. \u201cThe CIA hired me, gave me a Top Secret//SCI security clearance, and trusted me with some of our nation\u2019s greatest secrets in part because of my engagement with and knowledge of other languages, perspectives, and cultures. I drew on this knowledge every day at CIA \u2014 doing so made me a strong operations officer.\u201d\n\nThe ad also says Spanberger \u201csupported the Iranian deal, giving billions to the leading sponsor of terrorism.\u201d That\u2019s based on a tweet from Spanberger on May 8 in which she stated, \u201cThe decision to abandon #IranianNuclearDeal without cause hurts US credibility across the world & erodes the trust necessary to maintain the diplomatic & intelligence efforts that keep our country safe.\u201d\n\nBut opposing the abandonment of the deal, which unfroze billions in Iranian assets, is different from supporting the deal at the time. Indeed several congressional leaders, Republicans and Democrats, opposed the Iran deal struck by President Barack Obama, but later opposed Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the deal because they worried about the perception that the U.S. reneges on settled negotiations.\n\nCLF notes that her comments in a Facebook post explaining her opposition to Trump\u2019s decision to end the deal sounded supportive of it.\n\nSpanberger\u2019s campaign says she was collecting intelligence for military advisers when the deal was negotiated, and took no position on it at that time.\n\nIn Washington\u2019s 8th District, CLF is running a misleading ad against Democrat Kim Schrier on taxes.\n\nIt says, \u201cWe\u2019ve already got the fourth highest sales tax rate in the nation. And Kim Schrier, she\u2019d make it much worse. Schrier supports a state income tax.\u201d It goes on to say that Schrier supports \u201can energy tax, raising our electric bills and gas prices.\u201d\n\nIn making its claim that Schrier supports a state income tax, the ad cites one line she wrote in a candidate questionnaire, in which she said: \u201cHere in Washington state, we need to address our regressive tax system and move toward a progressive income tax.\u201d\n\nWashington has no income tax and instead relies on a high sales tax, which is considered a regressive tax because it takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups. Income taxes, on the other hand, typically impose higher tax rates on higher-income people.\n\nThere\u2019s no actual state tax plan from Schrier to evaluate, so we cannot determine whether a new tax system would make Washington\u2019s taxes \u201cmuch worse,\u201d even when coupled with an \u201cenergy tax.\u201d The ad simply assumes that.\n\nSchrier didn\u2019t say she supported an income tax on top of the state\u2019s sales taxes, as the ad suggests. An overhaul of the state\u2019s sales-tax-based system might make taxes \u201cworse\u201d for some but not for others. Typically, changing tax types or rates would lead to lower taxes for some individuals and higher taxes for others.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Schrier is running for the U.S. Congress, where she would have no authority over state tax decisions. Schrier is running against Republican Dino Rossi for the open House seat.\n\nIn her candidate questionnaire, Schrier addressed federal taxes, where she would have some control if elected.\n\n\u201cFrom the federal level, we need to make sure everyone pays their fair share, including making sure that any tax cuts go to the middle class and that we remove the loopholes that benefit high-earners,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe ad then says that Schrier supports \u201can energy tax, raising our electric bills and gas prices.\u201d That claim is based on a candidate forum in March in which she raised a green \u201cyes\u201d card when the host of the forum said: \u201cI support the carbon tax recently voted down in the Washington legislature.\u201d (See the 53-minute mark of the video.)\n\nThe state proposal, which didn\u2019t succeed this year, called for a tax of $12 per metric ton of carbon emissions on fossil fuels, an amount that would increase until it hit $30 in 2030. The Washington Policy Center, an independent think tank that promotes \u201cpublic policy based on free-market solutions\u201d and opposed the legislation, said that for households that drive about 25,674 miles a year, that would amount to $150 in 2019 in higher gas prices (and $376 in 2029) and that the average family would pay $12 more in 2019 for electricity. The bill called for financial assistance to mitigate the impact on low-income households.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not possible to evaluate whether a carbon tax coupled with a new, but undefined, progressive income tax would make taxes \u201cmuch worse\u201d for residents of Washington and, if so, for whom.\n\nVoters will consider a state ballot initiative in November to enact a carbon fee.\n\nIn an ad attacking Brendan Kelly, who is challenging Republican incumbent Mike Bost in Illinois\u2019 12th Congressional District, the Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Kelly \u2014 the St. Clair County state\u2019s attorney \u2014 \u201ccut plea deals that put violent criminals into our neighborhoods.\u201d On-screen text says: \u201c50% of crimes pled out.\u201d\n\nBut that message lacks both accuracy and critical context about the use of plea deals.\n\nActually, 64 percent of the felony cases in St. Clair County under Kelly resulted in guilty pleas, according to our review of the Illinois annual court reports between 2011 and 2016. (Kelly assumed the position at the end of 2010.) That figure isn\u2019t much higher than the 61 percent plea-deal rate we found for felony cases statewide in Illinois during the same period. St. Clair\u2019s rate also is roughly in line with the rates seen in 2016 for five surrounding counties.\n\n\n\nEither way, the use of plea bargaining to dispose of cases is to be expected, said Theodore Wilson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Albany. Wilson told us that there are two primary avenues used to resolve cases: \u201cGuilty pleas and then case dismissals.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of the felony cases that ended in convictions between 2011 and 2016 in St. Clair County were secured by guilty pleas: 98 percent, according to the state\u2019s annual court reports. Wilson said that isn\u2019t far from the norm. He pointed to an estimate, cited by former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in a 2012 decision, that \u201c94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.\u201d\n\n\u201cProsecutors don\u2019t know exactly what will happen if they take a case to trial,\u201d Wilson said. He noted that a \u201cplea deal often times involves punishment \u2014 where you\u2019re going to be incarcerated or put on probation, at risk of incarceration.\u201d\n\nAnd Wilson cautioned that \u201ca single number without context is misleading.\u201d The rate of plea deals, he said, doesn\u2019t offer insight into the severity of the sentences in each of the cases.\n\nThe ad does accurately point to a case in which a man found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls was sentenced to three-and-a-half years probation. The Belleville News-Democrat, which reported that the man was a \u201cfamily member\u201d of one of the minors \u201cat the time of the conduct,\u201d quoted Kelly as saying the terms of the sentence were what the victim preferred \u201cunder the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAnother ad from CLF claims that \u201cKelly let rape cases go unpunished,\u201d citing an investigation that the News-Democrat published in 2015.\n\nThe newspaper\u2019s investigation found that, between 2005 and 2013, \u201c82 percent of the total rape reports made to police\u201d in St. Clair County did not result in charges being filed. It should be noted, though, that Kelly took office at the end of 2010, and the newspaper found that the number of sex crime charges being filed in 2012 and 2013 had increased. Kelly also announced protocol changes in response to the newspaper\u2019s revelations.\n\nTo support the assertion that Kelly \u201ccut plea deals allowing violent criminals to walk free,\u201d the ad cites a case in which a man convicted of killing his daughter\u2019s mother had twice before been charged with battery against the victim, but received probation. After the slaying, Kelly told the Associated Press that the victim had lobbied for probation despite receiving earlier court protections from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because of the baby or what,\u201d her mother, Cathy McGolson, said to the AP at the time. \u201cEvery time I asked her if something was wrong, she just told me everything was fine.\u201d\n\nAnother case cited involved an HIV-positive teacher who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a student. The deal allowed for the dismissal of some charges, and the teacher was sentenced to 36 months of probation.\n\nKelly campaign manager Sam Barrett declined to comment on specific cases but pointed us to the candidate\u2019s work leading an Illinois task force that eyed improvements to sexual assault prosecutions, and his support of a measure that ended the statutes of limitations for child sex crimes.\n\nThe same ad also tells viewers that \u201cKelly even said it wasn\u2019t his job to win convictions.\u201d That quote is taken out of context. In a video interview with the News-Democrat, Kelly said: \u201cAs prosecutors, our goal is not a conviction. Our goal is not to make an example necessarily out of anybody. Our goal first and foremost is justice.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
