{"title": "Analysis | Is Obamacare a \u2018job killer\u2019?", "subtitle": "Critics of Obamacare say it is killing jobs, but the administration says there is no evidence.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:30:03Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85930", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/02/26/is-obamacare-a-job-killer/", "vclaim": "Under new rules announced this month, employers with 50 to 99 workers will be given until 2016 \u2014 two years longer than originally envisioned under the law \u2014 before they risk a federal penalty for not complying. Companies with 100 workers or more are getting a different kind of one-year grace period. Instead of being required in 2015 to offer coverage to 95 percent of full-time workers, these bigger employers can avoid a fine by offering insurance to 70 percent of them next year.\n\nThe penalty for not providing insurance is $2,000 per person, after the first 30 full-time employees. There also is a separate $3,000-per-employee targeted penalty if the employer coverage is inadequate or unaffordable, though it can\u2019t exceed the first penalty. Moreover, a full-time job is defined as just 30 hours per week. Lanhee J. Chen, a Stanford lecturer (and policy aide to the Romney campaign) in January told Congress that the 30-hour requirement may especially put lower-income workers at risk.\n\nThe net result is that, certainly for some companies, the health-care law will be a burden and force new calculations on hiring and expansion. Each one of those companies is a potential news story. In fact, a new report by the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services predicted that 65 percent of small businesses would see their health-insurance premiums increase because of the health-care law, though 35 percent would see a decrease.\n\n\u201cIt is an undeniable fact that Obamacare is costing this country jobs,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBusiness owners have said over and over that Obamacare is causing them to lay off workers, hold off on the hiring of new workers, or delay the expansion of new business. The fact that the Obama administration keeps delaying certain Obamacare mandates on businesses proves that the administration knows this law is bad for job creation. Claiming that Obamacare doesn\u2019t hurt job growth is about as laughable as President Obama promising, \u2018If you like your health-care plan, you can keep it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a reason why Sebelius cites \u201ceconomists.\u201d That\u2019s because many don\u2019t rely so much on anecdotal data but on actual trends in employment. Thus far, the data show that the impact of the law is minimal, though certainly some critics of the law have tried to document negative effects. (This article in Forbes from July has a lot of the back and forth on what the numbers might mean.)\n\nThe agency noted \u201canecdotal reports\u201d of firms responding to the mandates in the law, and the fact that the share of workers in part-time jobs has declined relatively slowly since the end of the recession. But it said that the share of part-time jobs often declines slowly after a recession, so it was difficult to determine what, if any, impact the Affordable Care Act has had on the job situation.\n\nMoreover, the CBO determined that in the near term, the law will spur job growth because lower income households that will benefit from the law will have more money to spend on goods and services. (This same report also concluded that over time, the full-time equivalent of 2.3 million workers will leave the work force by 2021 because of the law, but that\u2019s another story.)\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers, in a September blog post, laid out the administration\u2019s case, which presumably was the basis of Sebelius\u2019s comment. The blog post notes that since the Affordable Care Act became law, the economy has created 6.5 million full-time jobs, while the number of part-time jobs has been essentially unchanged. The post also cites economic data that back up CBO\u2019s contention that the law has not prompted a shift toward part-time work.\n\nOne chart is especially interesting because so many anecdotal accounts suggest the law is killing jobs in the restaurant industry because few provide extensive health insurance and thus presumably would be more affected by the employer mandate. But the chart indicates employment growth in restaurants and bars has exceeded what one would predict from sales growth alone. In other words, those anecdotal stories may not be telling the whole story.\n\nAt the moment, the administration appears to have a slightly better case in this debate. But officials such as Sebelius should resist making sweeping claims that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of \u201cany job-loss\u201d related to the Affordable Care Act. Clearly, given the design of the law, there will be a negative impact at some companies, just as a certain percentage of people have lost plans that they liked. There are going to be some losers, even if there may be many winners, so it is hard to justify the use of words such as \u201cmyth.\u201d\n\nWhen this all shakes out in a few years, then we will know who was right. In the meantime, we trust the sober assessment of the CBO: It is too early to jump to conclusions. For the moment, we will hold off on the Pinocchios, but will keep an eye out for definitive statements from either side of this debate.", "lang": "en"}
