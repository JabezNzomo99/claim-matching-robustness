These suggest ongoing PFI payments cost the equivalent of around 2% of the NHS budget, or one pound in every \u00a355.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know where Mr Nuttall\u2019s figures come from, and we\u2019re trying to get in touch.\n\nPFIs are a kind of procurement where the private sector manages the delivery of public sector projects. This typically involves designing, building, financing and operating a government facility or service, like a hospital. The private sector owns the assets and leases them to the government.\n\nIt\u2019s different from most public sector projects where the government owns the assets and does most of these things itself, although private contractors are often still used to deliver some services and the end of the process.\n\nPFIs are paid for upfront by groups of private investors, who take on the risks of construction. The government pays later, in the form of annual payments called \u201cunitary charges\u201d. These cover the costs of the services being delivered, plus the costs of interest and repayment of the debt.\n\nPFIs have provoked a lot of controversy since their introduction in the early 1990s. The House of Commons Library has outlined some of the general arguments for and against them.\n\n\u00a32 billion annual cost of PFIs to the NHS\n\nIn 2016/17 the NHS in England paid an estimated \u00a32 billion for past and current PFI projects. That\u2019s about 2% of the NHS England budget of about \u00a3108 billion and a similar proportion of total Department of Health spending, of about \u00a3120 billion.\n\nThe latest figures, as of 2015, show the department is currently paying for 105 NHS projects and will be paying for them until 2050, although the costs will fall towards this date as the payments for earlier projects end.\n\nThis is very different to Mr Nuttall\u2019s claim that the equivalent of 10% of NHS spending goes on PFI debts. It\u2019s not clear what this is referring to. The total capital value of health PFI projects is \u00a312 billion, which is about 10% of the budget. But the capital costs don\u2019t show what the government is paying back.\n\nSimilarly, total PFI repayments this year are expected to be about \u00a310.4 billion, but that includes PFIs in other government departments. The Department of Health is the biggest user in terms of costs, but the Departments for Education and Transport and the Ministry of Defence are all big users of PFIs as well.", "lang": "en"}
