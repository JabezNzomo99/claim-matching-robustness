There is no record of Trump ever tweeting the statement.\n\nThe Pentagon announced in a memo July 17 a policy that effectively bars displays of the Confederate flag from U.S. military installations, The Associated Press reported. An image shared on Facebook claims Trump took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move.\n\n\u201cSO MAD!!! Pentagon abolished Confederate flag today,\u201d reads part of the alleged July 17 tweet from the president. \u201cThe flag is TREMENDOUS part of our history. It\u2019s a symbol of LOVE!!\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of the president ever tweeting the comment. Trump\u2019s tweets often garner media attention, yet there is no news reporting about the alleged tweet, which went on to make racist statements about how plantations \u201ckept black people employed\u201d and how \u201cBlack unemployment was VERY low back then like now with ME as your president.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also searched Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and archives of his deleted tweets, but didn\u2019t find such a remark.\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS News, Trump appeared to defend people\u2019s rights to display the Confederate flag.

My attitude is freedom of speech. Very strong views on the Confederate flag. With me, it\u2019s freedom of speech. Very simple.
