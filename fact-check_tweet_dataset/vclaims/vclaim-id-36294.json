It\u2019s, I think, $35 dollar for one order.\u201d Palau\u2019s unit of currency is the US dollar, while China\u2019s is the Chinese yuan.\n\nTo date, the source of 2019-nCoV is not yet identified. Although there are studies saying it could have originated in bats, there are still no definitive reports that point to bats as the source.\n\n\u201cThe animal source of the 2019-nCoV has not yet been identified,\u201d the World Health Organization said. \u201cThis does not mean you can catch 2019-nCoV from any animal or from your pet. It\u2019s likely that an animal source from a live animal market in China was responsible for some of the first reported human infections. To protect yourself, when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
