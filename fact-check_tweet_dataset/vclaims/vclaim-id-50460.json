(That does not necessarily mean that wages would be lower than today; they might still have grown, but by less.)\n\nThe new analysis from the Department for International Trade (DIT) uses this as a starting point. It says that, assuming the UK signs that sort of free-trade agreement with the EU, signing a free trade agreement with the US would then put wages back up by \u00a31.8 billion or 0.2%, again after 15 years.\n\nSo even if the UK signs free-trade agreements with both the EU and US, the government still expects wages to be around 6% lower after 15 years than the level they would have been expected to reach, had we stayed in the EU.\n\nEven then, there are some assumptions in the analysis that seem questionable.\n\nThe \u00a31.8 billion wage growth assumes a free-trade agreement between UK and US with zero tariffs (complete tariff liberalization) and a reduction of non-tariff measures (such as plant and animal health regulations) by 50%. This is called \u2018scenario 2\u2019 in the document.\n\nProfessor of Economics at the City College of New York, Marta Bengoa, told us:\n\n \n\n \u201cScenario 2 is extremely optimistic as the roadblocks to a [free trade agreement] with the US remain significant. The UK will have to choose between regulatory alignment with the European Union or the United States and that will be a key factor to determine the degree of trade liberalization between UK and US.\n\n\u201cIf UK chooses to continue/maintain regulatory coherence with the EU, then the scope of the UK-US agreement will be quite limited.\n\n\u201cThis is without factorizing the current protectionist approach of the current US administration.\u201d\n\nIn other words the analysis seems to be based on a questionable premise, in assuming that the UK can both have zero-tariff trade with the EU and with the US after signing trade deals.\n\nProfessor Bengoa said scenario 1, with less extensive tariff liberalisation with the US, is \u201cmore realistic\u201d with a positive wage effect of 0.1%.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe model also assumes a fixed labor supply, no changes in demography, and no major technological changes or shocks. These assumptions are quite strict for a period of 15 years.\n\nShe said the model the analysis based on is \u201cwidely used in trade policy analysis but many of the underlying assumptions are difficult to match with the reality of the always changing economic environment.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Telegraph reported that the possible wage rise will be shared by \u201ctens of thousands of workers.\u201d\n\nThis suggests the wage effects will be concentrated among a small group of workers, while the Department for International Trade didn\u2019t actually model the effect on specific groups. That means, though you might expect a trade deal to benefit some people (such as those whose jobs are heavily involved in imports and exports) more than others, it\u2019s not quite right to specify that a trade deal would benefit \u201ctens of thousands of workers.\u201d\n\nSpread across the whole workforce, a \u00a31.8 billion increase amounts to around \u00a355 per worker per year.", "lang": "en"}
