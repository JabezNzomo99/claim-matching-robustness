Both these exams have been postponed a number of times this year due to COVID-19. On August 25, however, the National Testing Agency (NTA) confirmed that JEE (Main) and NEET (UG) exams will be held as scheduled from September 1 to 6 and September 13 respectively. This started a nationwide debate and social media campaign to postpone the exams in view of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. Hashtags like #ProtestAgainstExamsInCovid and #AntiStudentModiGovt were trended to demand postponement of the entrance tests.\n\nOn August 21, National Vice President of All India Students\u2019 Association (AISA) Ashutosh Kumar tweeted two screenshots of alleged news articles by News18 and NDTV. AISA is the student wing affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation. As per the News18 screenshot, 57 parents and grandparents of students who appeared for an exam in Karanataka passed away after over 5,000 students tested positive for COVID. Kumar wrote, \u201cThis is what happened when only 80,000 candidates appeared for exams all over India just think when 28 Lac students will be appearing what will be the condition! Still they say student cannot decide their welfare. #ProtestAgainstExamsInCOVID.\u201d This tweet was retweeted over 3,000 times. (archived link)\n\nThe News18 screenshot has been shared by several other users.\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp helpline (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News analysed the text in the screenshots and found Kumar\u2019s claims to be ingenuine.\n\n\n\nThe headline in the News18 screenshot reads, \u201cCOMDEK UGET 2020: 57 deaths With 5371 students tested +ve for Covid 19, 8456 students qurantined\u201d followed by the subheading that reads, \u201cStudents appeared for the COMDEK many been tested positive for covid 19 with 57 grandparents and parents deaths students onfire.\u201d As per the screenshot the article was published on August 20.\n\nA keyword search does not lead to either this \u2018story\u2019 by News18 or any reports by other media organisations.\n\nFurthermore, the screenshot has grammatical errors that a leading media outlet is unlikely to make. The abbreviation of Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka Under Graduate Entrance Test is COMEDK UGET not \u2018COMDEK\u2019 UGET. The word \u2018quarantined\u2019 is misspelt as \u2018qurantined\u2019. COVID-19 is written without a hyphen and the use of capital letters in the middle of a sentence are other indicators that the screenshot is fake.\n\nSimilarly, the headline of the NDTV article reads, \u201c60 \u0421OVID-19 Positive Among 1.47 Lakh Students Who Appeared For CET in Karnataka\u201d, followed by the text, \u201cSixty COVID-19 positive students were among the 1.47 lakh who appeared for the Karnataka Common Entrance Test for engineering and other courses which began on Thursday.\u201d\n\nAlt News performed another keyword search on Google and found that this article was published by NDTV on July 31 and is about the Karnataka Common Entrance Test (CET) held last months. The COMEDK examinations were conducted on August 19.\n\nAs per NDTV\u2019s report, out of 1.47 lakh students who appeared for CET, 60 were COVID-19 positive. Deputy Chief Minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan was quoted in the report saying, \u201cSeparate sitting arrangements have been made for the COVID-19 students and they faced the examination courageously.\u201d\n\nThus, AISA National Vice-President Ashutosh Kumar shared a doctored News18 screenshot that falsely claimed that 57 parents and grandparents of students who sat for COMEDK exams in Karnataka died due to COVID-19. He also shared an old NDTV report which spoke about CET exams held in the state last month.\n\n[Note: This article does not intend to condone the Education Ministry\u2019s decision to hold NEET and JEE entrance tests during COVID-19. Alt News has only reported on the misinformation circulating in the view of the examinations.]", "lang": "en"}
