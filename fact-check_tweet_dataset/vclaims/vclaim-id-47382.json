This is erroneous.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz and ID\u00d8L C\u00c0L\u00d8Y\u2019s videos twisted GMA\u2019s June 18 statement, in which the network said it \u201cconsistently complied with all requirements\u201d during its 70 years of broadcasting and that it sought 25-year franchising licenses in 1992 and 2017.\n\nThe two videos, which curiously had the same script read by different people, falsely quoted Gozon telling ABS-CBN, among other things, \u201cDon\u2019t drag us into (your problem)! We never violated anything!\u201d\n\nThe Kapuso executive has said no such thing.\n\nGMA Network published its statement after House Deputy Speaker Rodante Marcoleta claimed in a June 17 hearing that renewing ABS-CBN\u2019s broadcasting license for 25 more years is a violation of Article 12 Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution, which states that a public utility company could not be granted a franchise to operate \u201cfor a longer period than fifty years.\u201d\n\nABS-CBN had been broadcasting for 53 years before its franchise expired on May 4.\n\nIn response to Marcoleta, ABS-CBN legal counsel Mario Bautista said there there are over 10 television stations in the country that have franchise terms \u201cin excess of 50 years,\u201d including GMA, ABC 5, and IBC 13.\n\nHe also named the radio stations of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of the Philippines and Iglesia ni Cristo, and public utility companies Meralco, PLDT, and Philippine Airlines as legislative franchise grantees that have been operating for over 50 years.\n\nJustice Assistant Secretary Nicholas Ty, during the same House session, confirmed that the 50-year cap stated in the Constitution \u201cpertains to the franchise itself and not to the grantee,\u201d meaning Congress can issue multiple franchises to an applicant as long as each individual franchise does not exceed 50 years.\n\nThe misleading Youtube videos also skewed a June 19 ABS-CBN report about GMA Network\u2019s statement from the day earlier. Nowhere in the article did the station \u201cquestion\u201d GMA\u2019s operations, contrary to Showbiz Fanaticz and ID\u00d8L C\u00c0L\u00d8Y\u2019s claims.\n\nThe inaccurate reports, which have collectively been viewed on YouTube over 205,000 times, surfaced as the House of Representatives continued its deliberations on the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise.\n\nAt least two websites -- pinasdailynews.xyz and maniladailynewsweb.com -- republished Showbiz Fanaticz\u2019 video and amplified its potential reach to over 3.3 million people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nTraffic to the spurious videos largely came from FB groups PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE and Mayor Inday Sara Duterte International Movement, and FB page Duterte News.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has previously flagged both Showbiz Fanaticz and Phil Daily News for purveying misleading online content.", "lang": "en"}
