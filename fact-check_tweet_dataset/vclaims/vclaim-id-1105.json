They claim to reveal the person who carried out the attack in Forbury Gardens, which killed three people ( here , here , here ). These claims have since been referenced in at least one news report here .\n\nBut neither the name nor the photo match the person who has been arrested in relation to the attack \u2013 nor do the name and photo relate to each other.\n\nThames Valley Police has not yet officially revealed the name of the attacker, but said a 25-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder ( here ). A Western security source told Reuters on Sunday that the man is a Libyan national called Khairi Saadallah ( here ).\n\nThe social media posts are therefore wrong. The man in the mugshot that has been shared by thousands of people is, in fact, Ahmed Ressam, a 53-year-old Algerian national currently in prison in the United States for a failed 1999 New Year\u2019s Eve plot to bomb Los Angeles Airport ( here , here ).\n\nRessam\u2019s mugshot \u2013 identical to the one in the social media posts - can be seen in a news report on his sentencing here . It can also be found in the FBI database by searching for his name on the page listing the bureau\u2019s major terrorism cases ( here ).\n\nThe name Ahmed Hannachi quoted in the social media posts is also unrelated to the UK attack. A man of that name stabbed two women to death at a train station in Marseille in 2017, and was shot dead by police ( here ).\n\nFalse. Neither the man in the mugshot (Ahmed Ressam), nor Ahmed Hannachi was involved in the stabbing attack in Reading. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
