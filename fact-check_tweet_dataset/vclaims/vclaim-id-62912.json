The claim is false since the viral report was originally published by a satire website. The report was found on a website called 'Foolish Humor'. \"Budweiser employee acknowledges having been pissing into beer tanks for 12 years,\" reads the title of the report. Below is a screenshot of the article:\n\n\"Budweiser employee Walter Powell (alias used to keep his anonymity) has acknowledged through a statement he has been pissing inside Budweiser beer tanks for 12 years. At 34 years old, Walter has wanted to clear up any doubt about the taste of Budweiser and has stated he's been doing this for more than a decade just before bottling\" reads the report.\n\n\n\nThe report also quoted sources from Budweiser Brewery Experience at Fort Collins in Colorado, United States. The Budweiser Brewery Experience is a special service for the customers. The website by its own admission has said that their articles are purely fictional with the sole purpose of entertainment.\n\nThe caption said that the person in the image is Nick Mills, the general manager of a Budweiser Brewery in Lysander, New York. The Foolish Humor report had said that the name of the man in the image is Walter Powell.\n\n\n\nHans India later updated their article with a disclaimer saying that the information was based on \"The content of Foolish Humor\" which \"is fiction and does not correspond to reality\". After the screenshot of the satire report went viral on social media, tons of Budweiser related memes flooded the Internet. The hashtag #Budweiser is also trending on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
