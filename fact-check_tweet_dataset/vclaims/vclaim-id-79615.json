According to campaign finance data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, on fundraising events at three Virginia restaurants -- Bobby Van\u2019s Grill, Bobby Van's Steakhouse, and Blt Steak.\n\nBrat spent a little less than $123,000 across the board for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports, which cover spending up until May 21, 2014.\n\nOverall, Cantor outspent Brat more than 40 to 1, according to available records, and still lost by 10 percentage points.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for the collective astonishment -- this is a rare event.\n\n\"I can't think of any (case) in which the incumbent's spending advantage was so huge and he still lost,\" said Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego.\n\nAnother political scientist, John Sides at George Washington University, has a database with about 9,100 House general election contests. Sides tracks which candidate won and which spent the most money. Being outspent was a clear disadvantage.\n\n\"In only 10 percent of races did the candidate who got outspent actually win,\" Sides said.\n\nNow, this concerns general elections, not primary contests like the one Cantor lost, but Sides said the pattern wouldn\u2019t change much.\n\nMoney is a very tangible perk that comes with incumbency. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the odds of a challenger beating an incumbent going back to 1998. In the best year, 2006, challengers who spent $1 million or less, like Brat, had a 1 percent chance of winning. In every other election, their odds were much worse.\n\nTodd said that Cantor spent more at steakhouses than Brat did in his entire campaign. The latest campaign finance reports back that up. Cantor spent $168,000 on steakhouse dinners to Brat\u2019s $123,000 spent in the overall campaign.", "lang": "en"}
