Several Congress leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia, Deepender Hooda, Bhubaneswar Kalita and Janardan Dwivedi have voiced their support for the Narendra Modi government.\n\nThis was reported widely in the mainstream media.\n\nAmid this, a message in Hindi is doing the rounds on social media, attributing it to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\n\nThe message claimed that Singh said the Congress will have to pay a huge price like staying away from power for years for going against the NDA government\u2019s decision on J&K. But even then we are ready to sacrifice the party\u2019s interest to save our nation.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading claim. This message is not of Manmohan Singh.\n\nThe Congress Working Committee (CWC) had issued a statement as the party\u2019s resolution on Article 370 and the current development in J&K. But there was no individual statement issued on behalf of Singh.\n\nSeveral Facebook users such as Pawan Karan and Mohammad Kaleem.\n\nThe message is also viral on Twitter.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, following the developments in the Parliament, the CWC, after a meeting, adopted a resolution. It called the NDA government\u2019s decision to abrogate Article 370 unilateral, brazen and undemocratic.\n\nThe resolution also said, The Indian National Congress pledges to stand with the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh and to fight the BJP and its divisive and diabolical agenda with every power in its hands.\n\nManmohan Singh was also present among other leaders in the CWC meeting. But there was no individual statement made on behalf of the former PM.\n\nThe newspaper report about the CWC meeting can be read here.\n\nWe contacted Manmohan Singh\u2019s office, which outrightly discarded the viral message attributed to him saying it is totally fabricated and incorrect. His office also confirmed that the octogenarian leader has no personal social media account.\n\nNowhere in the CWC resolution or in any media report did we find any statement given by Manmohan Singh in public recently during the recent developments in J&K. His office has also rejected the viral message.\n\nWe, however, do not know what transpired in the closed-door CWC meeting and what Manmohan Singh said in the meeting.\n\nBut going by media reports and the party\u2019s statement, we can conclude that the viral message is misleading and those are not Manmohan Singh\u2019s words made in public.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Pak journalist shares misleading pics to claim atrocities on Kashmiris\n\nAlo read: Fact Check: Truth behind Pakistan soldiers carrying white flag as Indian jawan watches over", "lang": "en"}
