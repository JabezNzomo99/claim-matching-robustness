It was flagged by Facebook Claim Check, the social media network\u2019s tool that identifies suspicious posts spread across the platform.\n\nThe facts: The former Singapore prime minister did say something about the Philippine media in an old speech, but he did not say the words posted by Satorre. Rappler also reached out to Satorre to ask for the source of his post, but received no response.\n\nIn 1988, Lee delivered a speech titled in Washington, USA titled \u201cA Third World Perspective on the Press.\u201d Lee explained there why the US model of the press has not been proven to be a universal standard.\n\nThe full and original video can be found here but here\u2019s a clip of what he said about the Philippines:\n\n\u201cBefore martial law, it was an Asian version of the United States system. The Philippines press enjoyed all the freedoms, but they failed the Filipino people. A widely-partisan press helped Filipino politicians to flood the marketplace of ideas of junk and confuse and befuddle the people so that they could not see what their vital interests were in a developing country.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And because basic issues like economic growth and equitable distribution was seldom discussed and never tackled, the democratic system malfunctioned and President Marcos was able to declare martial law. Fortunately, a miraculous demonstration of people\u2019s power in February 1986 saved the country from impending disaster.\u201d\n\nLee also explained in his speech that the members of the media play different roles in other countries, and these roles have \u201cgrown out of their different historical experiences, political systems, and their national temperaments.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Lee has been misquoted. In October, there was also a quote attributed to him about democracy, which Rappler found to be false. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
