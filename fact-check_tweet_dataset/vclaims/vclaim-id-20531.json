Yet the claim\n\nIt\u2019s also on the website\n\n, Vaperite. Both say it was the conclusion of an agency of the UK\u2019s department of health, Public Health England.\n\nTo be clear, the\n\ndid not judge whether the Public Health England review was credible. It ruled that the claim was not \u201cadequately substantiated\u201d for the products advertised.\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll take over where the advertising authority left off. Is there sound evidence that the smoking of e-cigarettes - more commonly called vaping - is 95% safer than regular ones?\n\n\u201d, was published in August 2015. However, its conclusion was based on a research report\n\n, a UK charity, got together a panel of 12 international experts in London in 2013. The panellists had expertise in a variety of disciplines to do with nicotine and tobacco research, such as medicine, psychiatry, policy and law. (\n\nDuring a two-day workshop, the experts used a model called multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to estimate the harm of products that contain nicotine. When faced with an important decision, a group of people using the MCDA method will select the \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cmost preferred alternative\u201d among a set of options. Such a decision is made after analysing multiple criteria thoroughly and weighing their importance.\n\nUsing this method, the panel rated electronic nicotine delivery system products such as e-cigarettes to have only 4% \u201cmaximum relative harm\u201d. Cigarettes were ranked as the most harmful nicotine product with a score of 99.6%.\n\nBefore you reach for an e-cigarette, it\u2019s important to read on to two key\n\nthe panel itself pointed out.\n\nThe first is that they had to deal with a lack of data. E-cigarettes are fairly recent products and have therefore not been researched thoroughly when it comes to dependence, illness and associated death. Subsequently, one could expect that e-cigarettes would score very low on those key health-related criteria.\n\nThe second is that the expert panel wasn\u2019t selected based on formal criteria, meaning bias could have crept in. This problem is compounded by the conflicts of interest some panellists disclosed.\n\nFor instance, Riccardo Polosa, a professor of internal medicine, reported serving as a consultant to Arbi Group Srl, an e-cigarette distributor. Another author, Dr Karl Fagerstr\u00f6m, has served as \u201ca consultant for most companies with an interest in tobacco dependence treatments\u201d. One such company is\n\n, which was set up by British American Tobacco to develop and commercialise non-tobacco nicotine products.\n\nThough the vaping horse had bolted, criticism quickly followed. In\n\na week after the Public Health England report was published, The Lancet medical journal called the research \u201cextraordinarily flimsy\u201d.\n\nThis was for the reasons pointed out earlier: the absence of evidence, the way the experts were selected and the multiple conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Lancet concluded that \u201cthe reliance by Public Health England on work that the authors themselves accept is methodologically weak, and which is made all the more perilous by the declared conflicts of interest surrounding its funding, raises serious questions not only about the conclusions of the Public Health England report, but also about the quality of the agency\u2019s peer review process\u201d.\n\n. In an analysis, two British professors described the research from which the claim was extracted as \u201ca single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products\u201d.\n\nThe deputy vice-chancellor for research at the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in South Africa, Prof Lekan Ayo-Yusuf, has written extensively on tobacco control and usage in sub-Saharan Africa. He told Africa Check that is \u201cquestionable\u201d whether the same percentage difference would be obtained when researchers used accepted risk assessment principles, compared to the panellists\u2019 value judgements.\n\nWhat do we know about the safety of e-cigarettes?\n\nSo, the paper which was the basis for the claim that \u201cvaping is 95% safer than smoking\u201d has a number of holes. But are there perhaps other, thorough scientific studies to back it up?\n\nMost reviews suggest it\u2019s too early to say for sure. The\n\nnetwork of health researchers considered all studies up to January 2016 where e-cigarettes were used to help people stop smoking tobacco.\n\n: \u201cExpert consensus broadly holds that, based on all available evidence, electronic cigarettes are considerably safer than traditional cigarettes, but further studies are needed to establish their safety profile compared with established smoking cessation aids.\u201d\n\n- looking more widely at the health effects of e-cigarettes - evaluated studies published up until 14 August 2014. It concluded that \u201cdue to the many methodological problems, the relatively few and often small studies, the inconsistencies and contradictions in results and the lack of long-term results, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the safety of e-cigarettes. However, they can hardly be considered harmless.\u201d\n\nBecause the jury is still out, the US\n\ne-cigarettes containing nicotine as a product to help people quit smoking.\n\n\u201cno specific figure about how much \u2018safer\u2019 the use of these products is compared to smoking can be given any scientific credibility at this time\u201d.\n\nIn the final instance, \u201charm to others\u201d must also be considered when evaluating evidence, not only the relative harm at the level of an individual smoker, Prof Lekan Ayo-Yusuf told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cWhile e-cigarettes might be an \u2018efficient\u2019 nicotine-delivery device for an individual smoker, it remains unknown how \u2018effective\u2019 this would be in reducing population harm,\u201d he said. When e-cigarettes are available without regulation, possible community harm may include the re-normalising of regular cigarette smoking and the promotion of smoking among young people.\n\nThe idea that smoking e-cigarettes are \u201c95% safer\u201d than regular ones comes from a research report that was published in 2014. It was catapulted to public prominence through a 2015 review by an agency of the UK department of health.\n\nThe review was quickly lambasted by two leading medical journals, The Lancet and British Medical Journal. Both highlighted that there isn\u2019t yet enough data on this fairly new product to rate its safety and that it was essentially based on the opinion of 12 experts.\n\nFurthermore, the deputy vice-chancellor of a South African medical school told Africa Check that it is \u201cquestionable\u201d whether such a difference can be replicated using established techniques.\n\nMore research is needed to say with scientific credibility whether e-cigarettes are safer than regular smoking.\n\nToo early to say for sureA selection of e-cigarettes on display during an \"E-Cigarette Summit\" at the Royal Academy in London in November 2013.
