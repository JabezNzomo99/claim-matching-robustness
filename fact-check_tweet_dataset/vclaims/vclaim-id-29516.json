The Times of India reported that on the evening of 30 June, to deter people from the protest which was carried out without prior permission, mild force was used by the Meerut police. On 1 July, members of Jamiat Ulama had reportedly taken out a silent protest in Malegaon. The Indian Express reported that they said, \u201cWe do not seek revenge, and don\u2019t believe in violence. We believe in the rule of law.\u201d On 26 June, the organisation had protested in Jharkhand\u2019s Ranchi as well and demanded that the state government take required action, reported The Times of India.", "lang": "en"}
