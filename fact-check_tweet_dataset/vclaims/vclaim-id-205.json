The image shows a white envelope with a postage stamp from Santa Ana, California. Through the envelope, it is possible to read the words \u201cCredit Stimulus Department\u201d and \u201cFunds Disbursement\u201d on the contents of the delivery.\n\nThe image is accompanied by text that reads, \u201cA local mail carrier just posted this\u2026she is delivering these and the main people are senior citizens. THIS IS NOT a stimulus check. Please beware of this and let your friends and family know. Do not deposit this!\u201d\n\nThe claim comes amid the news that this month, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began depositing payments, approved as part of a $2.3 trillion Congressional relief package, ( here ). The IRS may reportedly have to issue as many as 70 million paper checks to Americans for whom it has no account data, including several million who do not have a bank account.\n\nThe claim on social media calling out these letters as fake, is true.\n\nThe \u201cCredit Stimulus Department\u201d listed on the letters is not a U.S. government department.\n\nRecently, the U.S. Secret Service released a sample version of the paper stimulus check \u201cto deter counterfeiters by showing consumers, retailers and financial institutions what a genuine check looks like, describing the watermark paper and other security features\u201d, AAARP\u2014a U.S. interest-group for retired individuals\u2014reports ( here ). The Secret Service points to six security features that authentic stimulus checks will show: a Treasury seal, bleeding security ink if moisture is applied to the seal, microprinted words that are impossible to duplicate on a copier, a watermark that reads \u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d, ultra-violet overprinting, and the President\u2019s name.\n\nThe IRS has also released warnings about \u201cCoronavirus-related scams\u201d and schemes tied to \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d, saying retirees are among the potential targets, ( here ). Among the list of warnings, the IRS notes that taxpayers should be weary of scammers mailing \u201cthe taxpayer a bogus check, perhaps in an odd amount, then tell the taxpayer to call a number or verify information online in order to cash it.\u201d\n\nThis week, The New York Times reported on a wave of scammers using people\u2019s Social Security numbers to \u201cassume their identities and bilk them out of their stimulus checks and unemployment benefits.\u201d ( here ).\n\nTrue: Image shared on social media shows bogus stimulus check amid the Treasury\u2019s efforts to deliver economic support payments under a $2.3 trillion federal coronavirus relief package.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
