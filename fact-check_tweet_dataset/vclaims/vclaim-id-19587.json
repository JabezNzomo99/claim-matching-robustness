In fact, since at least December 2017, he has periodically, and prematurely, boasted that \u201cmillions\u201d of people are already signing up for these association health plans.\n\nThe federal rule pertaining to those plans takes effect Aug. 20, and it doesn\u2019t start applying to association plans until Sept. 1.\n\nAt a July 26 roundtable discussion in Iowa, the president singled out Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, whose department is responsible for the new rule on association health plans. He said he heard there has been \u201crecord business\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d numbers for plans that he said \u201cjust opened about two months ago.\u201d\n\nTrump, July 26: Alex Acosta has come up with incredible health care plans through the Department of Labor \u2014 association plans where you associate, where you have groups and you get tremendous health care at a very small cost. \u2026 And, Alex, I hear it\u2019s like record business that they\u2019re doing. We just opened about two months ago, and I\u2019m hearing that the numbers are incredible. Numbers of people that are getting really, really good health care instead of Obamacare, which is a disaster. So you\u2019re getting great health care for, really, a fraction of the cost. Highly competitive. \u2026 And it\u2019s at very small prices. So I want to thank you. The job you did on that is incredible.\n\nAssociation health plans are created by a group of employers, such as those in a similar industry. The Labor Department has been working on a new federal rule to expand and change the regulation of these plans, and issued its final rule on June 19.\n\nAs we mentioned, the rule says it won\u2019t begin applying to association plans until Sept. 1. Yet, the president has been talking about \u201cmillions of people \u2026 signing up\u201d for months. For example:\n\nTrump, rally in Montana, July 5: We are allowing businesses to join forces to buy better health care for less money through association health plans. They just came out two weeks ago and they cross state lines. \u2026 Millions of people are already signing up. Trump, rally in North Dakota, June 27: So, we have, through our Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, we just came out with the association plan, which is phenomenal. Millions and millions of people are signing up. Trump, interview with the New York Times, Dec. 28, 2017: Now here\u2019s the good news. We\u2019ve created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn\u2019t have insurance. Or didn\u2019t have health care. Millions of people. (Earlier in the interview, Trump says, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be millions and millions of people,\u201d but then switches to the present tense.)\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that millions of people will \u2014 eventually \u2014 sign up for these plans under the new regulations. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May that the then-proposed rule would result in about 4 million people joining association plans, starting in 2023 (with 90 percent of them coming from the individual and small-group markets). Avalere Health estimated that the proposed rule would cause 2.4 million to 4.3 million people over five years to move to association plans.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about these health plans and the administration\u2019s proposal to expand them.\n\nThe new rule would allow associations to form for those in the same trade or industry, or for businesses in the same state or metropolitan area. A breakdown of the rule published by the journal Health Affairs explains that associations would have to have at least one \u201csubstantial business purpose\u201d unrelated to providing insurance.\n\nUnder the rule, insurance plans offered by associations couldn\u2019t deny coverage or charge more based on health status. But they wouldn\u2019t have to cover the 10 essential health benefits the Affordable Care Act requires of plans on the small-group market or individual market, where those buying their own insurance \u2014 including through the ACA exchanges \u2014 get their coverage. Also, these association plans could price plans based on age, gender or occupation.\n\nTherefore, the plans could indeed be cheaper than other options available on the individual market, but that could be because they offer more limited benefits. The CBO expects healthier individuals to be attracted to such plans.\n\n\u201cBoth employers with healthier workforces and individuals who are relatively healthy and have income too high to qualify for premium tax credits for health insurance would find such plans appealing because the premiums would be lower than those for insurance products that comply with the current rules governing the small-group and nongroup markets,\u201d CBO said in its May report.\n\nSince these healthier individuals would leave the small-group and individual markets to join the association plans, CBO expects premiums in those markets to increase. It estimated a 2 percent to 3 percent increase \u201cin most years\u201d due to the association plans and another administration proposal to expand short-term insurance plans.\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office and the Department of Labor about the president\u2019s remarks, but we haven\u2019t yet received a response.", "lang": "en"}
