This is untrue.\n\nThe false tweet comes as protests spread across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed after a white police officer knelt on his neck.\n\nExamples of the post can be seen here , and here .\n\nThe post includes an image of an apparent tweet sent from Trump\u2019s official account on May 31, 2020. The full text is transcribed below: \u201cThanks to the crowd of \u201cprotesters\u201d VP Mike Pence and myself have been escorted to the secret White House bunker located in the basement. It\u2019s a tremendously huge and powerful structure that can withstand anything! Sadly it was kept in very bad shape by OBAMA, who left it extremely dirty and with no food/supplies. Terrible planning!\u201d\n\nThe tweet is not legitimate. It does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline on May 31, nor does it appear in Twitter searches for posts with this wording. No news outlets reported that Trump tweeted this on May 31.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, the tweet has also not been deleted from his page ( here ).\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Trump was rushed by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker on May 31, as protesters gathered outside the White House ( here ).\n\nReuters recently debunked the claim that Trump tweeted that George Floyd\u2019s family was honored to hear from him ( here ).\n\nFalse. Trump did not tweet from the White House \u201cbunker\u201d. This is a fake tweet.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
