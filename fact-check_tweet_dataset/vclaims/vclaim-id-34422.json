Hence, the production has gone down. I take great pride in being an Indian, and proud to be an Indian which feeds every Indian\u2019s mouth, so why has the production gone down.

Sometimes when there is a surplus of the crop, we have also facilitated by giving support to those people who want to export it. I have overnight passed orders for helping with 5 to 7 percent of assistance for exporting it. There are severe structural problems related it onion.", "lang": "en"}
