Asked about his decades-long grip on power, Mugabe supposedly shot back at Christiane Amanpour by asking if she had ever posed the same question to Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II. However, AFP has gone through the 23-minute interview and established there was neither an instance when Amanpour asked the question as it appears in the post, nor a response by Mugabe referring to the queen.\n\nAmanpour interviewed Mugabe in September 2009, the first sit-down she said the then-president had had in five years. The interview came ahead of the 64th UN General Assembly in New York, where the Zimbabwean leader accused western countries of imposing illegal sanctions on Zimbabwe. Here is Mugabe\u2019s full speech from the day.\n\nSince Mugabe died on September 6, a 2013 Facebook post bearing the \u2018queen\u2019 anecdote has re-emerged online and has now been shared more than 1,400 times.\n\n\u201cCNN Interviewer Amanpour: \u2018Mr President, don't you think 89 years old would have been a great time to rest and retire?\u2019\n\nPresident Mugabe: \u2018Have you ever asked Queen Elizabeth this question, or is it just for African leaders?\u201d the post reads.\n\nWhile Mugabe would have been 89 in 2013, when the Facebook post was published, the interview with Amanpour had taken place back in 2009 when he was only 85 -- the first sign that the post was not accurately quoting from the CNN interview.\n\nA search online for Amanpour\u2019s encounter with President Mugabe led us to this 23-minute video of the full interview on CNN\u2019s website.\n\nListening through the interview, Amanpour at no point asks Mugabe the question as it appears in the misleading post, and throughout the interview there is no mention of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHowever, on several occasions, Amanpour asks Mugabe about his determination to hold onto power.\n\nAt 20.15, Amanpour asks: \u201cWhy is it so difficult to leave power in a reasonable way when you are up, instead of waiting until it gets to this stage?\u201d\n\nMugabe responds: \u201cYou do not leave power when imperialists dictate that you leave.\u201d\n\nAmanpour interjects: \u201cNo imperialist, you are the president.\u201d\n\nMugabe responds: \u201cNo, there is regime change. Haven\u2019t you heard of regime change programme by Britain and the United States, which is aimed at getting not just Robert Mugabe out of power but Robert Mugabe and his party out of power? And that naturally means we dig in, remain in our trenches.\u201d\n\nAt 22.09, Amanpour posed the same question differently to Mugabe -- this is how the conversation went.\n\nAmanpour: \u201cI guess I want to know why, why to hang on for so long.\u201d\n\nMugabe: Elections don\u2019t go all that smoothly all the time. In many countries that is the situation. Look at what happened elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMugabe held on to power for 37 years before he was finally ousted in November 2017, when his previously loyal military generals turned against him.\n\nThe strongman is on the record as having made outrageous remarks such as \u201cOnly God who appointed me will remove me\u201d and \u201cI am still the Hitler of the time,\u201d among others -- you can read an AFP round-up of some of his most famous quotes here.\n\nWe did not find any record of him making a quip about Queen Elizabeth II similar to that quoted in the misleading post.", "lang": "en"}
