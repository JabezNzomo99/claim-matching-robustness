The pieces of the puzzle are finally coming together.\u201d\n\nSoros has been a major contributor to Democrats \u2014 he gave $22 million in the 2016 election cycle and has given $12 million so far for the 2018 cycle. But the implication that Soros is paying Ford is baseless.\n\nFord testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that her lawyers are working pro bono and there is a GoFundMe page collecting donations to pay for her family\u2019s security detail. In her opening statement to the committee, Ford addressed accusations that she is a tool of the Democratic party, saying: \u201cI have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one\u2019s pawn.\u201d\n\nThe biggest problem with the picture and the connection it claims to show, though, is that the woman featured in it isn\u2019t Christine Blasey Ford. It\u2019s Lyudmyla Kozlovska, president of a Polish human rights organization.\n\nKozlovska even called out the fakes on her Twitter, saying: \u201cOh. I noticed my photo with georgesoros is used not only by Russian Polish Moldovan Kazakhstani propaganda but also in US\u2026 unbelievable manipulation\u2026\u201d\n\nThe photo purporting to show Ford with Soros was flagged by Facebook users as being suspicious and prompted several readers to ask us if it is legitimate. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just the latest in a long line of bogus claims about Soros that we\u2019ve debunked.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nKozlovska, Lyudmyla. \u201cOh. I noticed my photo with georgesoros is used not only by Russian Polish Moldovan Kazakhstani propaganda but also in US\u2026 unbelievable manipulation\u2026\u201d Twitter. 26 Sep 2018.\n\nBlasey Ford, Christine.
