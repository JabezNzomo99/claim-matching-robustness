The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents,\" the post said.\n\nIt also claimed that vaccinations promoted in India by the Gates Foundation \"were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls\" and that it conducted experimental vaccine trials. But PunditFact in December 2016 debunked a post on an anti-vaccine blog claiming Gates used \"30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer\" and that vaccination efforts led to deaths. That Pants on Fire post was a mash-up of outdated, disproven rumors.\n\nMysterious Times doesn\u2019t offer many details about its website, but the About section of its Facebook page says: \"Aliens UFOs, Conspiracy and Weird Stuff.\"\n\nGates does not seek to \"depopulate\" the planet, but believes saving children\u2019s lives can help reduce population growth.\n\nWhen children survive, families decide to have fewer children and that \"can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call \u2018the demographic dividend,\u2019 \" Gates said in the 2018 edition of the annual letter he co-writes with his wife, Melinda.\n\n\"When more children live, you get one generation that\u2019s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically\u2014and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people),\" Bill Gates said in the 2018 letter. \"That\u2019s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education.\"", "lang": "en"}
