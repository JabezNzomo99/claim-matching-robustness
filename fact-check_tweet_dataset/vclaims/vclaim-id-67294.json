Sarah Palin weighs in on the health care debate, our ears perk up as fact-checkers. The 2008 vice presidential candidate brought us \" \" (our 2009 Lie of the Year) and the inaccurate statement that the Affordable Care Act is government-run health care.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Palin continued her criticism of the law and expressed skepticism that \"30 million more people will receive health care coverage under Obamacare.\"\n\nPalin then made a bold statement regarding the health care law and the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n\"There will be fewer people being covered under a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program under Obamacare than what we see today,\" she said. \"I guarantee you that.\"\n\nThat sounds like other statements PolitiFact has checked in the past. We decided to investigate.\n\nWe reached out to Palin\u2019s camp in hopes she could clarify her statement, particularly what she meant by a \"sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care,\" but she didn\u2019t get back to us. It sounds like previous claims made by the law's opponents, namely that Obamacare puts the government between Americans and their doctors.\n\nIn the past, PolitiFact said that assertion was . The health care law overwhelmingly relies on the private sector to provide coverage to the millions of Americans currently without health care by offering subsidies to help people obtain private insurance. There is an expansion of Medicaid, but reliance on that joint federal-state program has shrunk as several Republican governors have chosen not to increase their Medicaid rolls. Obamacare primarily sets guidelines for minimum coverage of care and created marketplaces for plans to be bought and sold to the uninsured.\n\nAs PolitiFact noted when former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said last year that \"Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,\" if that were the case, we would expect doctors to be up in arms. Instead, the American Medical Association, the largest doctor advocacy group in the country, has been supportive of the law.\n\nThere are other instances when the federal government seeks to improve overall quality of care through bureaucratic means. In 2020, for example, a 15-member panel called called the can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures for Medicare. Some have said this will lead to rationing, but we have found those concerns exaggerated.\n\nNow, there are recent that insurance companies are shrinking their networks, including excluding certain hospitals from coverage. This is particularly the case for insurance plans sold on the new state and federal marketplaces created by Obamacare.\n\nIn certain instances, as noted by the , it has meant some families forced to change doctors or purchase more expansive, and expensive, plans outside the government-run insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe limitations are happening in attempts to keep costs down. One insurance company, Anthem, told the Post \"the network still covers 74 percent of all primary-care providers and 78 percent of specialists,\" and the smaller networks would drive down the cost of their plans.\n\nSome of this maneuvering was going on for years, and a trend already taking place in the industry may have just been accelerated by the law. In the spring of 2011, the Los Angeles Times that insurance companies in California offered a narrower list of providers to thousands of customers.\n\nSo there is some volatility in the market, and that will continue to be the case as doctors, patients, insurance companies and regulators adjust to changes in the law and the massive amount of new customers now buying insurance.\n\nPalin said the health care law changes \"a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program.\"\n\nIt's valid to be worried about people potentially seeing changes in their coverage, including some people who will be forced to switch doctors. But that\u2019s a far cry from Palin\u2019s actual words, which suggest some sort of government intervention in the doctor-patient relationship. That's not the case.", "lang": "en"}
