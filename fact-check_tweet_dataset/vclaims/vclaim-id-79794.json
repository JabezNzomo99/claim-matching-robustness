Adam Schiff, D.-Calif, has had an outsized presence in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, drawing disparaging comments from President Donald Trump and some of Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nA recent Facebook post mocking Schiff claims that he\u2019s tied to George Soros, the wealthy and, in some quarters, often vilified Democratic fundraiser.\n\n\"You can\u2019t make this up,\" reads the text over photos of Soros, Schiff, a woman identified as \"Melissa Schiff Adam\u2019s sister,\" and a man identified as \"Robert Soros son of Geroge Soros; married to Adam Schiff\u2019s sister.\"\n\nThis post, published to Facebook on Oct. 7, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBecause you actually can make this up.\n\nThe photos are genuine, and it\u2019s true that Robert Soros is George Soros\u2019s son. He also married a woman named Melissa Robin Schiff in May 1992. In September 2017, the New York Post reported that they were estranged and divorcing.\n\nBut Melissa Schiff is not Adam Schiff\u2019s sister. The wedding announcement that ran in the New York Times back in 1992 identifies her parents as Marlene Schiff and Haskel Schiff, both of New York.\n\nAdam Schiff was born to Edward and Sherrill Schiff in Framingham, Mass., according to this 2017 U.S. News & World report article. The Jewish Journal reported that year that Schiff was the youngest of two sons born to the couple.\n\nClaims about Schiff\u2019s connection to Soros have been swirling since at least early last year. Back then, the congressman told FactCheck.org that he has just one sibling \u2014 his brother \u2014 and has no known family relationship to Melissa Schiff.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
