She also says Russia must prepare for 2024 -- when she says, a transition of power will become possible.\n\nAsked by Polygraph.info why she was allowed to register for the March presidential elections, Sobchak did not deny she had Putin\u2019s permission to do so, but said the president is \u201cnot getting any younger\u201d and that in what she described as \u201chis last six years in power,\u201d he is seeking a safe exit that will guarantee him immunity after retirement. According to Sobchak, Putin fears her less than he fears the other opposition leaders, and she can \u201cfind an understanding\u201d with him on the way a transition will be implemented.\n\nAsked whether she is saying that Putin is consciously engineering a democratic transition in Russia, Sobchak answered in the affirmative, and said she is the intermediary who can work with Putin to ensure a smooth and non-revolutionary transition from the current regime to democracy.\n\nMany Russia watchers and experts do not share Sobchak\u2019s belief that Putin is preparing for a democratic transition and reforms.\n\nSpeaking earlier this month in Washington, DC, Alexei Venediktov, chief editor of Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow), Russia\u2019s most popular radio station, said Putin \u201chas no intention\u201d of leaving power after 2024, but in fact plans on remaining in power \u201cas long as he lives.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question from Polygraph.info, Venediktov said that during the next six years \u201cunder Putin\u201d Russia will \u201ccross the point of no return, drowned in total isolationism and obstructionism.\u201d\n\nBoris Zilberman, a Russia analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based nonpartisan research institute focusing on national security and foreign policy, told Polygraph.info that Sobchak\u2019s words do not reflect reality.\n\n\u201cPutin is indeed preparing Russia for an eventual transition. But the transition is to ensure stable continuation of the system he has built in the last 18 years,\u201d Zilberman said.\n\n\u201cSaying that Putin is preparing Russia for a transition to democracy or a more democratic nation is a farce. There has been zero indication of any such moves or intentions,\u201d he added.\n\nIn fact, there have been dramatic changes in Russia\u2019s original post-Soviet constitution, all serving the purpose of solidifying the power of the president, including the extension of the presidential term from four to six years.\n\n\"Still, Sobchak is correct about one thing: Putin is not afraid of her. That is the entire point of why she is being allowed to do what she is doing. She is not a threat, unlike others who have been barred from running,\" Zilberman said.\n\nBelow is a full transcript of Ksenia Sobchak\u2019s interview with Polygraph.info.\n\nQ: Many say that Vladimir Putin never allows anything that he does not benefit from, that his continuation in power does not benefit from. Can you name a few reasons why he thinks allowing you to register [as a candidate] is beneficial for him?\n\nSobchak: \u201cLook, time is passing, and Putin is not getting any younger. There are physiological factors that are beyond of even his power. I certainly believe in a transitional alternative. We all remember that in his own time he did not violate the constitution but found that formal means of transferring power to Medvedev. In fact, these reforms started by Medvedev were positive, it\u2019s a pity they did not continue their existence. But I am absolutely sure that these are Putin\u2019s last six years in power and he will be seeking some way out of the situation through a person who is comfortable for him, through a compromise figure, through the possibility of creating a situation in which he will not be persecuted after he gives up power. In this situation, I see as the most constructive thing to show that we have a liberal opposition that is ready to solve problems constructively, which is ready to struggle for the power, which is ready to listen to the other side as well; and which does not want change through revolution, and is ready for a constructive dialog about how this power transition will be implemented.\n\nQ: Are you saying that Putin is consciously preparing for a transition of power?\n\nSobchak: I don\u2019t know consciously or not, but I think these are his last six years, and that I can be precisely that intermediary, because I have known him for a very long time. I think he fears me much less than other opposition leaders and I think, that I, in fact, will have a chance to achieve my goals, and those of my colleagues from the opposition, to find some kind of understanding with the people in power that those goals must be achieved and, on the other hand, that he will be ready for such a dialogue. That is what I am betting on.", "lang": "en"}
