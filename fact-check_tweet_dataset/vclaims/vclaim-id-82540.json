Local police have confirmed to BOOM that the FIR has been registered against four Hindus and there is no communal angle to the incident. District authorities have also confirmed to BOOM that the priest was not murdered but committed suicide.\n\nHowever, social media is rife with speculative posts that pin the priest's death on Muslims. A Facebook user shared the photo in a post calling the incident, an \"ISIS style terrorism\".\n\nThe post is also being shared on Facebook with a caption in Hindi that says, \"One more priest has been murdered in Ram Janki temple in Rae Bareli. Previously, Jihadis had warned that if the temple doesn't stop playing bhajans and aartis then they would kill the priest. And that is exactly what they did. Remember Hindus, till Muslims are your friends, but as soon as he gets a chance he will destroy you and won't spare the women in your life too.\"( \u0930\u093e\u092f\u092c\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0940 \u0917\u092f\u0940\u0964 \u091c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0926\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0927\u092e\u0915\u0940 \u0926\u0940 \u0925\u0940 \u0915\u093f \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u091c\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \u0906\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0924\u094b \u092a\u0941\u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964 \u092f\u093e\u0926 \u0930\u0916\u094b \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0913 \u091c\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0930\u0916\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0935\u094b \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0924\u0932\u0935\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u091f \u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e, \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u091c\u0939\u093e \u0909\u0938\u0915\u094b \u092e\u094c\u0915\u093e \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0935\u0939\u0940 \u0935\u094b \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092c\u0930\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0947\u0939\u0928, \u092c\u0947\u091f\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u091b\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964\u091c\u093e\u0917\u094b \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942\u091c\u093e\u0917\u094b) .
