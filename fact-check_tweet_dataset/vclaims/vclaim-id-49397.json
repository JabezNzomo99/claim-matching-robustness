It recommended several fruits and vegetables supposedly \u201cmore alkaline\u201d or \u201cabove the pH level\u201d of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the disease.\n\n\u201cViruses themselves do not have pH levels, because they are not water-based solutions,\u201d a group of health experts convened by international nonprofit organization Meedan stated in their COVID-19 Expert Database website.\n\nAccording to Oxford University\u2019s Lexico, a solution is considered water-based if its \u201cmedium or main ingredient\u201d is water. The pH scale is used to determine if a water-based solution is acidic (pH level of below 7), neutral (pH level of 7), or basic, oftentimes called alkaline (pH level of above 7).\n\nEating more alkaline food does not affect blood pH but may affect a person\u2019s saliva and urine pH levels, said Meedan\u2019s team of experts. However, \u201cthese changes are variable from person to person and will not prevent or cure COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMaria Carmela Taob, a faculty member of the Department of Food Science and Nutrition (DFSN) of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, shared a similar sentiment. In an email to VERA Files, she said: \u201cThere is no evidence to support the claim that alkalizing food can cure coronavirus patients.\u201d\n\nTaob explained that a food\u2019s designation -- whether acidic, neutral, or alkaline -- is based on the ash it leaves behind after being combusted under laboratory conditions.\n\nMeat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, and grains produce \u201cacid-ash,\u201d while most fruits and vegetables except for prunes, plums, and cranberries generate \u201calkaline-ash.\u201d Coffee, tea, certain sweets, fats, and starches are considered neutral.\n\nThe flier, which listed seven fruits, garlic, dandelion, and turmeric tea, assigned wrong pH level to each food, ranging from 7.4 to 22.7.\n\nIn an April 5 FB post, Benelyn Dumelod, an associate professor from UP DFSN, disputed this, saying the maximum pH value of any \u201cfood or nonfood, living or nonliving\u201d is 14.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the foods\u2019 pH values as declared in the flier, against their correct pH values according to several sources including Dumelod. None were alkaline, or had a pH level between 7.1 and 14.\n\nBoth Taob and the experts at Meedan pointed out that a well-balanced diet -- including the consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables -- can help support one\u2019s immune system.\n\nTaob, however, stressed that preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus relies heavily on \u201cphysical distancing, wearing masks, frequent handwashing, general hygiene, environmental sanitation, and physical activity.\u201d\n\nAs far as the World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned, there is still no drug or vaccine proven to cure or prevent one from acquiring COVID-19. Clinical trials, however, are currently being performed in several parts of the world.\n\nThe viral flier, which bore the title \u201cGoodbye Corona Virus!\u201d, also made false claims on what a person should do on a daily basis to be able to defeat the virus, advising the consumption of eggs and Vitamin C and E, getting sunlight in the morning, and drinking warm water daily.\n\nIn an email to VERA Files, WHO Philippines said that \u201cconsuming eggs, exposure to sunlight, warm meals and vitamins daily do not kill the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms listed in the flier indicating \u201cif a person has COVID-19\u201d are also misleading. While dry cough and fever are listed by WHO as common symptoms of the disease, sore throat and the loss of the sense of smell and taste are \u201cless common\u201d and may affect some patients only.\n\nShortness of breath, on the other hand, is developed by \u201cseriously-ill\u201d individuals, which is just around one of every five COVID-19 patients, added the WHO\u2019s list of symptoms.\n\nThe earliest retrievable online copy of the flier carrying the false claims was uploaded last April 16 on Twitter. It got over 41,000 retweets and 53,700 likes, and has received comments from netizens pointing out the disinformation.\n\nHowever, posts bearing the claims about alkalizing foods have been circulating since March in both FB and private messaging application WhatsApp, as shown by fact check articles of Africa Check, the Associated Press, and the Agence France-Presse.\n\nThey appear to have twisted the contents of a 1991 study published in the Journal of Virology that looked into coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV4), and not the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe false flier was published as original content by at least five netizens on FB from June 17 to 22, and continues to be shared this July. The posts surfaced a day before the total recorded COVID-19 cases worldwide surpassed the eight million mark, and the same day the Philippines\u2019 own number of cases reached over 27,000.", "lang": "en"}
