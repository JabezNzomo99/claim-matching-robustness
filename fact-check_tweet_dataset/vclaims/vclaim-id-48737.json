No, that's misleading: The person who initially posted this claim went on to provide updates to clarify the situation, but not before his original post went viral, prompting some to demand a Marriott boycott.\n\nMarriott is one of countless companies that have had to cut staff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forbes reported: \"Marriott International, the world's largest hotel company, said tens of thousands of hotel workers will be furloughed, and will lay off a number of those workers.\"\n\nThe claim about employees being denied unemployment and health benefits originated in a tweet (archived here) published by @DocDre or thot leedurr on March 17, 2020, which read:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAs of this story's publication, that tweet was liked more than 266,000 times and retweeted 80,000 times. What's more, it also gained steam on Facebook. Among the accounts that put this out there:\n\u2022 Unofficial:DNC shared the tweet, introducing it with these words, \"Capitalism is TRASH.\"\n\u2022 Truthout shared it, saying, \" This is just wrong. Marriot Hotels is leaving their employees out to dry.\"\n\nResponses to this claim prompted outrage among some, including threats of a boycott. \"@Marriott fix this ASAP or your greedy hotels will end up boycotted by twitter followers,\" wrote one person. \"Remember this when we come out of this mess, and boycott Marriott!\" said another. \"It's a hit against their unemployment insurance plain and simple. Marriott will NEVER get my business. Greed knows no bounds,\" wrote a third.\n\nBut there were also plenty of people on social media who raised questions about this claim. \"No. Marriott just reported their status. 'Still working but hours reduced' is an unemployment category. Everybody ready to boycott over a false post with misinformation,\" said one follower. \"You qualify for unemployment on decreased hours alone so I'm calling bullshit,\" wrote another person. \"This isn't true they waived the requirement so you can still apply even if you are temporarily not working please don't spread fake info,\" added a third.\n\nLead Stories reached out to the man behind the original post, seeking contact with his brother or paperwork to back up the claim. We haven't yet gotten a response, but we will update this story if we do hear back. We also reached out to Marriott International, but have not gotten a response.\n\nSeveral economists who specialize in matters of unemployment did weigh in.\n\n\"I have no way of knowing the motives of the person who posted this, but the post is nonsense,\" said Stephen Woodbury, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a professor of economics at Michigan State University. He called it \"thoroughly bogus\" and shared a few reasons why:\n\n1. If a worker's hours have been reduced to zero he/she has been laid off. No UI [unemployment insurance] agency would say otherwise. 2. UI agencies rarely call an employer to check on previous employment. They have computerized wage records at their disposal (i.e., computerized reports that every employer sends to the agency at the end of every quarter) to check on prior employment and determine monetary eligibility for UI. 3. Health insurance has absolutely nothing to do with unemployment insurance, so this is a red herring. UI agencies and Marriott both know this full well.\n\nFurthermore, Woodbury shared concern about fallout from this sort of nonsense. \"This post seems to be doing damage in that it may be discouraging people who are likely eligible for unemployment benefits from claiming them,\" he said in an email to Lead Stories.\n\nGary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, had seen and responded to the post on Twitter, saying, \"Ummmm. Last time I checked, 'Zero hour schedule' *IS* unemployed if someone's been working, say, 35 hours a week for the past 6 to 9 months. Calling it 'Zero hours schedule' doesn't make it 'employed.' [Your brother] should get UI.\"\n\nIn a note to Lead Stories, Burtless added the following:\n\nWithout hearing back from @DocDre, whose profile provided a link showing he's an associate professor at Georgia Tech University, Lead Stories cannot know for certain what transpired. But we did notice that @DocDre posted a few follow-up tweets, which set out to soften or clarify what he originally claimed.\n\nHere's how one began: \"My brother has received a phone call from his job: his health insurance benefits will be covered.\"\n\nThis is how that full update appeared on social media:\n\nThe next update said his brother was contacted and would be getting benefits. It also offered thanks to \"EVERYONE who put me on game.\" Here's how that post appeared:\n\nThen, the last update on this matter encouraged people to keep speaking up, \"if you are going thru a similar situation. ... Our voices MATTER.\" Here's how that post appeared:\n\nNone of these follow-up tweets gained the same sort of traction, however. Again, the original tweet was liked 266,000 times and retweeted 80,000 times. At the time of this story's publication, update two recevied 67 likes and 17 retweets, update three got 4,800 likes and 761 retweets, while update four garnered 125 likes and 40 shares.\n\nWe wrote about twitter.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fact Check: Homeland Security Is NOT Preparing To Mobilize The National Guard To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Viral Meme About United Way Fund For COVID-19 Help Does NOT Contain Right Number\n\u2022 Fact Check: Tom Hanks, Others NOT Arrested For Pedophilia Or Other Crimes in QAnon Conspiracy\n\u2022 Fact Check: 'Security Alert' For U.S. Citizens NOT Issued Over 2020 Census\n\u2022 Fact Check: WHO Is Looking Into Concerns About Anti-Inflammatories With Coronavirus", "lang": "en"}
