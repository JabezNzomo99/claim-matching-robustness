(Overall, the United States has had an agricultural trade surplus with the rest of the world since 1960.)\n\nThe European Union does impose a higher average tariff on agricultural products (11 to 12 percent) than the United States (about 5 percent), but about a third of farm goods enter both the European Union and the United States tariff-free, according to the World Trade Organization.", "lang": "en"}
