Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photos of new notes of denomination Rs. 5000, Rs. 350, Rs. 5 and Rs. 2 launched by the Reserve Bank of India. Fact: The Reserve Bank of India hasn\u2019t launched currency notes of denomination Rs. 5000 and Rs. 350. It has also not released new notes of denomination Rupees 5 and 2. And, the images of Rs. 5 and Rs. 2 notes in the post are photoshopped ones. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhenever the RBI releases new notes, it notifies the public regarding the same through circulars on its website. Such circulars can be found on the RBI website. And also, the RBI publishes details & security features of all the notes currently in circulation in the \u2018Paisa Bolta Hai\u2019 website. Rs. 5000, Rs. 350 currency notes are not part of this list. Hence, it can be concluded that RBI hasn\u2019t released Rs 5000, Rs 350 currency notes till date.\n\nThe notes of Rs. 5 and Rs. 2 are photoshopped\n\nRBI hasn\u2019t released any new notes of Rs. 5 and Rs. 2 in recent times. In the post, a currency note supposed to be of the value \u2018Rs. 5\u2019 has the text \u2018pachaas rupaiye\u2019 written on it. Hence it is a photoshopped image.\n\nBoth the Rupee 5 and Rupee 2 notes posted have the same serial number on them.\n\nIn the post, coins of denomination Rupees 1000, 500, 200,100, 75, 60 can be seen. These are commemorative coins minted in the memory of a person or event etc. Some of these coins may not be legal tender money. The Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), mints these coins and auctions them to the public for their purchase.\n\nTo conclude, RBI hasn\u2019t released currency notes of Rs. 5000 and Rs. 350. It has also not released any new notes of value Rs. 5, Rs. 2 in recent times.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
