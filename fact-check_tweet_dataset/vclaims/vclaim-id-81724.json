And that's what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions.\n\n\"To say things like we've got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex.\"\n\nOne thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons.\n\nAutomatic weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or machine guns -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down.\n\nTwo federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States.\n\nOne law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in.\n\nSemiautomatic weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed.\n\nThey are not banned by federal law.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2004, there was a federal law that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, including some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set.\n\nThe law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired.\n\nJohnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It\u2019s worth noting that in at least one other interview the same day \u2014 with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader \u2014 he spelled that out, saying \"an assault weapon is a fully automatic.\"\n\nHis office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons \u2014 or at minimum, assault-style weapons.\n\nIndeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles.\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: \"Assault rifles already are banned.\"\n\nSome, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic \u2014 firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons \u2014 are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson\u2019s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban.\n\nLawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings \u2014 which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed \u2014 as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law.\n\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
