There are several posts in Kannada on Facebook from 2012 which claim \u201c\u0c9c\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cae\u0ca8\u0cbf\u0caf\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf \u0cb8\u0cbf\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95 32000 \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb7 \u0cb9\u0cb3\u0cc6\u0caf\u0ca6\u0cbe\u0ca6 \u0ca8\u0cb0\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0c82\u0cb9\u0cb0 \u0cb5\u0cbf\u0c97\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cb9 (A 32,000-year-old idol of Lord Narasimha found in Germany).\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Postcard News published the article \u201c32,000 years old Lord Narasimha Idol discovered in Germany\u201d, which shows a different man-lion figurine. The article even highlights \u201cYes! 32,000-year-old Lord Narasimha Idol was discovered in Southern Germany.\u201d This post has been shared more than 5,000 times.\n\nThere are also YouTube videos with similar claims. The one attached below has drawn 1,80,000 views since it was uploaded in August 2017.\n\nAlt News found that are also several posts on social media with the claim that the same \u2018Lord Narasimha\u2019 idol dates back 40,000 years.\n\nAfter performing a reverse image search on Google, Alt News found that the viral image is from a feature story published in 2009 on the Sampradaya Sun\u2019s website. The location of the idol is mentioned in the caption of the image, as highlighted below.\n\nSridham Mayapur refers to ISKCON Mayapur which is located in West Bengal. Thus, the claim that the idol in the viral image is from Germany is incorrect. Alt News also found a video uploaded by Hare Krsna TV \u2013 ISKCON Desire Tree, a verified YouTube account which shows the same idol.\n\nA reverse image search of the figurine\u2019s photo used in Postcard News, revealed to Alt News that it is the L\u00f6wenmensch figurine or Lion-man of the Hohlenstein-Stadel, a cave located in the Jura, Germany.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by Der Spiegel, the fragments of the mammoth-ivory figurine were discovered by geologist Otto V\u00f6lzing in August 1939. Currently is displayed in Ulm Museum, Germany. According to the museum, the lion-man is from the Upper Palaeolithic period from 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe British Museum\u2019s blog post \u2018The Lion Man: an Ice Age\u2019 masterpiece states, \u201cHe is the oldest known representation of a being that does not exist in physical form but symbolises ideas about the supernatural\u2026 It is impossible to know what that story was about or whether he was deity, an avatar to the spirit world, part of a creation story or a human whose experiences on a journey through the cosmos to communicate with spirits caused this transformation.\u201d\n\nTherefore the claim in the viral posts that the figurine from Germany is around 32,000 to 40,000 years old is true. However, no credible sources claim the figurine represents Lord Narasimha.\n\nAn image of a Narasimha idol in ISKCON Mayapur, West Bengal is viral on social media as a 32,000-year-old sculpture of the Hindu god excavated in Germany. Another image, of a prehistoric lion-man figurine, was shared with a similar claim.", "lang": "en"}
