Both versions are misrepresentations of what O\u2019Donnell actually said.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, O\u2019Donnell made a call-in appearance on the SiriusXM radio talk show Just Jenny, on which the topic of moment was menstrual blood. Specifically, the show\u2019s host, Jenny Hutt, and another guest had been criticizing marathon runner Kiran Gandhi\u2019s decision to run the London Marathon that year without wearing a tampon. O\u2019Donnell took exception to their critical remarks.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe two smart, intelligent women who I love, both named Jenny, are on the radio saying periods are disgusting,\u201d she said, comparing the discussion to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s then-recent comment about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, who had questioned him during a televised debate about his misogynistic statements toward women (including O\u2019Donnell herself).\n\n\u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes,\u201d Trump said of Kelly afterward. \u201cBlood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Trump later tweeted that he had meant \u201cblood coming out of her \u2018nose,'\u201d but he was widely understood as having purposely implied that Kelly must be having her period.\n\nAccording to O\u2019Donnell, such demeaning comments are part of a widening \u201cwar on women\u201d in America:\n\nBigger than any specific people, there\u2019s a war on women that\u2019s happening in this country, starting with basic abortion rights, freedom to choose, that we fought for in the sixties and seventies, that women died for, bleeding in back alleys from hanger abortions. Women fought for equality in this country, and right now, politically, it\u2019s being taken away from us, and it doesn\u2019t help with you guys thinking, \u201cOh, that woman who showed the blood, the menstruation blood \u2014 ew, that was disgusting, she\u2019s not fun to have dinner with. Come on, ladies.\n\nThis prompted agreement from host Jenny Hutt, who admitted, \u201cThere is still shame associated with periods.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom men!\u201d O\u2019Donnell replied. \u201cFrom men, ladies, and it doesn\u2019t help when the women do it!\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a period, you\u2019re gonna bleed. That blood is gonna keep the baby alive in your stomach, and the children that you love. It\u2019s part of being a human. Men get erections and semen comes out. Let\u2019s get off the period talk unless you\u2019re gonna be empowering. I\u2019d like to take my period blood that I no longer have and write, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re all assholes.\u201d I\u2019d like to smear it all over some people\u2019s faces. So don\u2019t jump on the bandwagon with the period, please. We all have periods, okay?\n\nBased on the context of her remarks, the most reasonable interpretation would seem to be that O\u2019Donnell was targeting people \u2014 mainly men, in her eyes \u2014 who had engaged in menstrual shaming, not specifically Christians or pro-life advocates.", "lang": "en"}
