Note that a \u201clow risk\u201d exposure is being within three feet of a patient with Ebola. The Ebola virus, as far as is known, does not circulate in tiny droplets that hover in the air, such as influenza. But an Ebola patient could cough, sneeze or spit, transmitting bodily fluids that might land on a person nearby \u2014 and then you might get Ebola if the virus finds a break in your skin or you touch your eye and it goes in through a mucous membrane.\n\n\u201cSenator Paul\u2019s portrayal of a cocktail party as a potential setting for exposure just uses another example of an event during which close contact with a sick person could occur \u2013 leading to potential exposure to bodily fluids containing the deadly virus,\u201d a Paul aide said. \u201cImagine being sneezed on directly by a sick person or using a bathroom after someone sick with Ebola. In both cases, what was once just \u2018close contact\u2019 moves to direct exposure.\u201d\n\nA Paul aide pointed to this comment by CDC Director Tom Frieden on Oct. 9, when he spoke before the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meeting as nations pledged funds to help stem the outbreak in West Africa: \u201cI\u2019ve been working in public health for 30 years. The only thing like this has been AIDS. And we have to work now so that this is not the world\u2019s next AIDS.\u201d\n\nThen the president went on to say: \u201cSecond, the most common way you can get Ebola is by touching the body fluids of someone who\u2019s sick or has died from it \u2014 like their sweat, saliva or blood \u2014 or through a contaminated item, like a needle. That\u2019s why the disease is continuing to spread where patients are being cared for at home or during burials when families and friends lay their loved one to rest. That\u2019s why health-care workers wear protection like gloves and masks.\u201d\n\nFrieden, in a conference call with reporters on Oct. 15, was asked about the bus statement and whether it was accurate in light of the fact that the CDC has contacted people who flew on the same commercial flight as a nurse who had a fever after being in contact with an Ebola victim.\n\n\u201cYes, CDC vetted the message and yes, we believe it is accurate. I think there are two different parts of that equation. The first is if you\u2019re a member of the traveling public and are healthy, should you be worried that you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone. The answer is no. Second if you\u2019re sick, and you may have Ebola should you get on a bus, the answer to that is also no. You might become ill; you might have a problem that exposes someone around you. Because the risk is so low, we think there is an extremely low likelihood that anyone who traveled on this plane would have been exposed, but we\u2019re putting into place extra margins of safety and that\u2019s why we\u2019re contacting everyone who was on that flight.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the administration has to perform a delicate balancing act in terms of public-health messages. \u201cCan\u2019t get it on a bus\u201d refers to the fact that Ebola is not an airborne disease. Officials do not want to inspire panic that simply using public transportation puts you at risk of getting the disease (in contrast to the flu). But, given a known incident, the CDC out of an abundance of caution decided to monitor anyone who was potentially exposed on the plane, despite \u201can extremely low likelihood\u201d of a problem.\n\nThe Paul aide argued: \u201cPresident Obama said something that is misleading. If you \u2018can\u2019t get it on a bus\u2019 then why are all the people who flew Frontier Airlines being monitored? A person on a bus is analogous to a person on a plane, and if the CDC is worried about people on a plane, then they presumably would treat people the same way who are on a long bus trip. A bus trip from DC to NYC would actually take longer than a plane trip from Cleveland to Dallas.\u201d\n\nIndeed, administration officials, from the president on down, have made it clear that people should not touch Ebola patients. Paul\u2019s citation of a three-foot zone, in fact, comes directly from the CDC\u2019s informational material on exposure risks. In the meantime, one can hardly fault the CDC for wanting to be extra careful, even if the risks are extremely low, by contacting passengers on the plane, given that it was a mistake to allow the nurse to travel on public transportation in the first place.", "lang": "en"}
