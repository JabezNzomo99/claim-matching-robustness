Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that image.\n\n\n\nFact: Image in the post is a \u2018laterally inverted\u2019 version of the photo that shows AICC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi saluting during the 65th Independence Day celebrations at the party headquarters in New Delhi. In the original image, Rahul Gandhi was saluting with the right hand. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is cropped and subjected to Google Reverse Image Search technique, many search results with the same image were obtained but no credible information was obtained. But, when the image is \u2018laterally inverted\u2019 and is subjected to reverse image search, a link of \u2018NDTV\u2019 was obtained in the search results. The article in that link had the same image and it was found to be that from the flag-hoisting ceremony at Congress party headquarters in 2011 on the occasion of Independence day. In the original image, Rahul Gandhi was saluting with the right hand.\n\nAn image of \u2018Getty Images\u2019 during that ceremony also confirms that the image in the post is \u2018laterally inverted\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, the image in the post showing Rahul Gandhi saluting with the left hand is \u2018laterally inverted\u2019 to show the mirror image version.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
