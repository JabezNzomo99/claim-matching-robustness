FACTLY has found the video to be old and not related to any recent incident. The video was found to exist on the internet at least since October 2019. FACTLY could not find the original context of the video. The video is being shared in the wake of news reports that the UP Police have stopped migrants at the state border as they lacked valid passes for entry. Also, there are other videos of people not following social distancing in UP, but the posted video is an old one.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
