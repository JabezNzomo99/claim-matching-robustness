It\u2019s a screenshot of a genuine Royal British Legion Facebook post from 2016.\n\nThe Royal British Legion\u2019s post was published in response to a false viral rumour that poppies would not be distributed in certain areas because they will upset minorities. \n\n \n\n Similar claims are made each year, and the charity has routinely stated that these are false.\n\nIn response to the latest viral claims a representative for the charity told Full Fact:\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are aware that there are statements online suggesting the poppy is not being offered in certain areas of the country. We'd like to reassure you that this is categorically untrue. We are proud to offer the poppy in every community in the UK \u2014 we always have been and always will be.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
