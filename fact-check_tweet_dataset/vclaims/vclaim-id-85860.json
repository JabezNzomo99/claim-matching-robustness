We have provided summaries of the fact checks below, as well as links to the original fact check. The interactive Prezi above will also link to the fact checks.\n\nThe Fact Checker has also vetted two other statements made by President Obama during his news conference at the G-20. He earned an Upside-Down Pinocchio for flip-flopping on using executive action on immigration and Three Pinocchios for comments about the destination of oil that would flow through the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nFrom publicly available data, we know that since 2009, the United States has created roughly the same number of jobs as the 35 other advanced economies combined, and more than the other six biggest economies. This is due in part to the fact that the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies. However, it\u2019s not as clear-cut that this recovery involves putting \u201cmore people back to work,\u201d as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs.\n\nObama carefully says \u201cprivate-sector\u201d jobs, which allows him to exclude federal and state government jobs. (Obama is the only recent president under whom cumulative public-sector job creation is negative.) Under that specific criteria, there have been 56 straight months of job gains, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is a longest period since records started being kept in 1939. Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan would have longer and stronger periods of growth, but each suffered a one-month relapse that spoiled their records. Thus, even with those caveats, we award a Geppetto Checkmark to the president\u2019s statement.\n\nThe latest employment figure for Turkey is 26.3 million for August 2014. The amount of growth in employment figure since 2008 financial crisis depends on what period you take as a starting point of the crisis. The comparison in monthly basis leads to mistaken results without using seasonally adjusted figures. We take annual figures of employment in 2008, and since then, 5.2 million jobs have been added. However, considering the seasonally adjusted employment figure for August 2014, the real change is 4.7 million. When we take the annual employment figure in 2007, the growth is 5.1 million. In short, Davuto\u011flu is right to claim that the Turkish economy has performed well in creating employment despite the 2008 financial crisis, but he exaggerated growth in employment figures.\n\nIt depends on the month you start from. The latest available data are for September and show 22.457 million people are employed. That is a gain of 96,000 since January. However, Renzi was sworn in in February 2014, which had seen a dip in employment compared to January. So starting in February yields a net gain of 139,000 jobs. Since March (Renzi\u2019s first full month) it\u2019s just 70,000. You only get 153,000 jobs if you start counting from April. Renzi thus selectively chooses to start counting from the month when employment was lowest to exaggerate his record.\n\nThe executive powers of the president, and the ability of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose stricter emissions standards, are well established, so the recent agreement with China does not have to be ratified by Congress. However, Republicans in Congress could try to limit funding to the EPA, and that could trigger another government shutdown. But there are still questions over Obama\u2019s ability to deliver on the climate deal without support from Congress.\n\n<span data-sheets-userformat=\"[null,null,2947,[null,0],[null,2,16777215],null,null,null,null,null,1,1,0,null,[null,2,2039583]]\" data-sheets-value='[null,2,\"Cristina Fern\\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (also said by Economy Minister Axel Kicillof)\"]' style=\"color: #1f1f1f;\">Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, president of Argentina\n\nA statement about the need for orderliness and predictability of the restructuring of sovereign debt was included, for the first time, in the final communiqu\u00e9, followed by a call to further action that includes \u201cwork on strengthened collective action and paripassu clauses.\u201d These are two of the issues that Argentina, which technically defaulted on its debt in July, is struggling with in the legal battle it has with hold-out creditors \u2014 debt owners who did not participate in the Argentine restructuring and are demanding full payment of the nominal value of the debt, along with interest. A U.S. court in July ordered Argentina to pay $1.33 billion plus interest to the holdouts.\n\nVan Rompuy should have specified that it is the combined total of the E.U. and its member states (as opposed to the E.U. by itself), which is more than twice the second-place United States. Though numbers on aid are ever less clear due to China and the Arab states\u2019 choice of alternative channels, the E.U. and its member states are still undoubtedly top dog in terms of overseas development assistance.\n\nThe South African government is rightly worried about the exclusion of women from the job market, especially those between ages 15 and 34. But officials got their numbers wrong, and so they skew the picture for policy makers. Data show that African women between the ages of 15 and 34 constitute 49.1 percent of youth not employed or studying \u2013 not 37.5 percent. And the corresponding figure for white males is 1.1 percent, not 31.5 percent. Only one in seven white males are not employed or studying, but for black women this figure is nearly one in every two.", "lang": "en"}
