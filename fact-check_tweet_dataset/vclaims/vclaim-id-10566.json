For months I drove by and cringed every time I saw his name near the Michigan and Wacker intersection. In response to his selfishness Chicagoans decided to show who they are NOT voting for: \u2014 feeling satisfied at Downtown Chicago.\n\nThe display apparently caught neither the attention of social media at large (which would have produced a number of shots from other angles) nor the news media, despite its proximity to Trump\u2019s win in South Carolina.\n\nThat alone made the claim dubious, but a reverse image search located a few images identical to the \u201cNO\u201d photo, which quickly led to an earlier, unaltered version of the photograph:\n\nThe angle and pattern of lit windows in the tower and surrounding buildings are identical in both photos (except for the \u201cNO\u201d in the second photo):\n\nWhile the \u201cNO\u201d is missing from the first photo, there\u2019s an identical pattern of lights on both Trump Tower Chicago and adjacent buildings. That suggests a political protest courtesy of Photoshop, not disgruntled residents of the building.", "lang": "en"}
