This means that ABS-CBN managed to avoid paying taxes in 2018.\"\n\nThe facts: ABS-CBN Corporation's 2018 audited financial statement said that they had an effective tax rate of 4% for that year, not negative 5%. The company and its subsidiaries paid their taxes from 2016 to 2019, according to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).\n\nIn their audited financial statement, which is included in their annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, auditor SGV & Co reconciled their statutory tax rate, which is 30%, with their effective tax rate, which was 4% for that year.\n\n\"For obvious reasons, tax credit is not tax avoidance. It's an advance payment already, meaning it's been taxed from a different income or other transactions before they declared it,\" he said in a mix of English and Filipino.\n\nSGV also noted that Big Dipper's application to be registered as an IT (Information Technology) ecozone was approved by PEZA on July 14, 2009. The principal activities of Big Dipper listed in the annual report are digital film archiving and central library and content licensing and transmission.\n\nAccording to PEZA's website, companies that are engaged in IT service export are eligible for their incentives, which include an income tax holiday (ITH) for 4 to 8 years. Upon expiration of the ITH, registered companies are subjected to a 5% special tax on gross income and are exempted from all national and local taxes.\n\nAt a Senate hearing on the network's compliance with the terms of its franchise held on February 24, the BIR said that the media giant had fully complied with the tax requirements of the government.", "lang": "en"}
