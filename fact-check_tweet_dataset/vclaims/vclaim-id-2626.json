There\u2019s no definitive source on it. The government used to publish statistics on changes in mental health funding, but it hasn\u2019t since 2013.\n\nThe idea that we are aiming to spend \u2018record\u2019 amounts on mental health services is plausible. Five years ago the government was spending half the \u00a311.7 billion that\u2019s planned for 2016/17.\n\nBut as we said last week, there are concerns about whether all this money is in fact reaching the front line. Ms Berger\u2019s analysis of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) spending reflects this.\n\nFor the past three years, Ms Berger has been submitting Freedom of Information requests to ask Clinical Comissioning Groups (CCGs) what percentage of their budgets they spend on mental health services, and whether they plan to spend more or less in the coming year.\n\n128 out of the 211 CCGs in England have responded to the latest request so far. 73 of them (57%) plan to spend less of their total funding on mental health this year compared to 2015/16.\n\nOverall, the proportion of spending across these CCGs on mental health is just under 10%, and that\u2019s hardly changed in the last year.\n\nThis still leaves things we don\u2019t know. In particular, we don\u2019t know if the CCGs that didn\u2019t respond have similar spending patterns to those that did. Ms Berger told us that in her experience, CCGs who planned to spend less on mental health services tend to be slower to respond to these FOI requests. If we had complete data on other CCGs, we might see a higher proportion planning to reduce their spend on mental health (assuming the pattern continued).\n\nThere were big variations in how different CCGs planned to change their mental health budget. One CCG planned to increase the share of their budget on mental health by 22%, the biggest increase, whilst another planned to cut it by 15%, the biggest decrease.\n\nChanges in the share of the budget will tell you about the relative priority that a CCG puts on mental health services. But it\u2019s different from whether the total amount they\u2019re spending is rising or falling. If you take inflation into account, then overall these organisations are spending less on mental health than they were last year.\n\nThis article was corrected on 26 October 2016 at 8.00pm. It originally stated that CCGs provide about 80% of frontline mental health services. This is incorrect as it confuses CCGs with mental health trusts. Mental health trusts provide about 80% of all mental health care, according to the Kings Fund. Other typographical errors were also corrected.", "lang": "en"}
