The post also claims that one of the IAF jets was shot down by Nepal.\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the viral claim and found it to be fake.\n\nWe put the image through Reverse Image Search and found the first picture on the official website of the Associated Press.\n\nAccording to the description, the picture was taken on March 19, 2011, when a pilot ejected from the cockpit of a warplane after it was shot down on the outskirts of Benghazi, eastern Libya.\n\nWe found that the second picture is from 2019, when an Indian Air Force\u2018s (IAF) Mirage-2000 fighter crashed at a military airport in the Bengaluru\u2019s eastern suburb on February 1, 2019.\n\nMoreover, government sources confirmed that no such strike was conducted by the Indian Air Force.\n\nRefuting the claim, the Press Bureau of Information tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s Fake. No such claimed action has been conducted by Indian Air Force on any neighbouring country. The images used are from a previous date. Beware of panic mongers.\u201d\n\nHence, from the above information, it is clear that the post in question is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
