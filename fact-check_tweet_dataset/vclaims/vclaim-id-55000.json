Additionally, spouses who are U.S. citizens and filed single tax returns \u2014 regardless of the partner's immigration status \u2014 qualify for the payments.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens and immigrants with Social Security Numbers (SSN) are eligible for stimulus checks from the federal government's COVID-19 economic relief package. The legislation's guidelines exclude the remainder of the country's immigrant population from receiving the one-time payments \u2014 and, in effect, their spouses won't get the money either if the couple filed a joint tax return (and are not in the military).\n\nIn the weeks that followed the U.S. federal government\u2019s March 2020 approval of a $2.2 trillion stimulus package \u2014 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act \u2014 to jumpstart a pandemic-broken economy, journalists and economists combed through the legislation\u2019s 247-page PDF document outlining who would receive the financial help.\n\nEarly news reports on the bill had highlighted its funding boosts to help newly unemployed Americans, small businesses facing diminished profits, health care facilities on the frontlines of fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and qualifying taxpayers by giving them one-time checks of about $1,200 (or more depending on how they filed taxes and their number of children). Then, in mid-April, more headlines focused on the intricacies of the multi-faceted policy package \u2014 including the claim that U.S. citizens married to immigrants wouldn\u2019t qualify for the one-time payments like other taxpayers.\n\nThe implication was that if spouses of immigrants had different marriages, they\u2019d be richer with the federal government\u2019s help. Numerous readers contacted Snopes to investigate the truth behind the claim.\n\nFor our examination, we first looked at where the claim originated. On April 20, the Los Angeles Times published a news story headlined, \u201cThese U.S. citizens won\u2019t get coronavirus stimulus checks \u2014 because their spouses are immigrants,\u201d featuring stories of four couples, each of which includes an immigrant and will not be receiving the payments, as well as commentary from immigrant-rights advocates. The following day, CBS News published a story that cited the LA Times\u2019 reporting. Then, on April 22, Yahoo!\u2019s lifestyle section republished an article from the so-called ScaryMommy website, a self-proclaimed source of \u201centertainment and information for millennial moms online.\u201d The post included editorialized phrasing, such as:\n\n\n\n\u201cThey just hate immigrants, and now, by default, American citizens who associate with them,\u201d the Scary Mommy post read, referring to the federal administration under U.S. President Donald Trump. \u201cThe government is leaving those people (and their families) out of help, and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nA rush of tweets, some lacking important context, followed. Among sharers of the LA Times story was U.S. Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat from Iowa, who said on Twitter:\n\nResponding to her tweet, however, one user wrote: \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant. My wife is a US citizen. We got $2,400 as a direct deposit on April 15th. This is no less misleading than posting \u2018immigrants commit crimes.\u2019 It\u2019s technically true, but there is no causal link.\u201d\n\nCue this fact check on who is and isn\u2019t eligible for the stimulus checks, called \u201cEconomic Impact Payments,\u201d based on 2019 or 2018 tax returns. For those who are eligible, the CARES Act authorized the federal government to send:\n\u2022 $1,200 checks to individuals who make up to $75,000 annually\n\u2022 $2,400 checks to families who file jointly and earn up to $150,000\n\u2022 An additional $500 per qualifying child to all families\n\nAdditionally, for single tax filers with higher annual salaries \u2014 but less than $99,000 \u2014 the federal government is reducing the payments by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000 threshold (similar math goes for payments to families).\n\nBut to qualify, a recipient must be a \u201cU.S. citizen, permanent resident or qualifying resident alien\u201d under guidelines established by the Internal Revenue Service. The latter two categorizations cover foreign-born residents who have obtained green cards to prove their legal status to work and live in the country and Social Security Numbers (SSN). The provision in the CARES Act outlining the payments states:\n\nThat means immigrants who do not have legal status are excluded from the stimulus payments, even if they have work visas or use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (which the IRS issues to workers without SSN) to pay annual taxes. Additionally, if they file joint tax returns with their spouses, both parties are ineligible for the checks; the CARES Act\u2019s provisions require both parties on a couple\u2019s return to have SSN and will not accept joint returns with one or more Individual Taxpayer ID numbers. (Different standards apply to military couples, however: \u201cIf either spouse is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces at any time during the taxable year, then only one spouse needs to have a valid SSN,\u201d according to the IRS.)\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research center, roughly 1.2 million immigrants without green cards are married to a U.S. citizen. Of that amount, the spouses who are U.S. citizens and filed single tax returns \u2014 regardless of their partner\u2019s immigration status \u2014 qualify to receive an individualized payment amount based on their income.\n\nGiven that significant caveat, as well as the fact that immigrants with green cards are eligible for the checks, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of true and false \u2014 U.S. citizens who filed joint tax returns with spouses who are immigrants without Social Security Numbers won\u2019t receive the payments, but spouses to immigrants with legal status will.", "lang": "en"}
