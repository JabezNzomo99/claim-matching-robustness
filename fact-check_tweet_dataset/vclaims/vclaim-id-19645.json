Critics of the plan say the census already provides reliable data for voting rights cases in a separate survey. The Trump administration\u2019s changes to the census could produce an undercount, they add, if immigrants who don\u2019t have citizenship or legal residence stay away for fear of being deported.\n\nRoss said the Justice Department \u201cinitiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question\u201d as a way to compile data on who is and isn\u2019t eligible to vote at a granular, census-block level. The stated goal is to beef up enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which \u201cprohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in one of the language minority groups\u201d recognized by law.\n\nJustice Department lawsuits under Section 2 often seek to block vote dilution. Let\u2019s say more than 50 percent of eligible voters in a district are part of a minority group. If that district has rules or processes that prevent those voters from electing a representative of their choice, officials might file a vote dilution suit. The key to such cases is measuring minority voters as a share of the total voter population. Only citizens have the right to vote, so figuring out the total number of voting-age citizens is the same as figuring out total voter population.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the error bars on rates of voter registration, and turnout among those voters who are registered, along with effects of incumbency and other variables, are all much, much larger than any difference in precision between ACS and Census citizenship data,\u201d Fishkin said. \u201cIn other words, compared to other variables that we are putting into the same equation, ACS citizenship data is more than sufficiently precise.\u201d\n\nSix former Census Bureau directors sent Ross a letter dated Jan. 26 arguing that the citizenship question \u201cwill considerably increase the risks to the 2020 enumeration.\u201d ProPublica reported March 27 that career staff in the Census Bureau advised Ross against adding the question for \u201cfear it will depress response rates, especially from immigrants,\u201d but that Ross overruled them. He said in a March 26 memo announcing his decision that \u201cneither the Census Bureau nor the concerned stakeholders could document that the response rate would in fact decline materially.\u201d\n\nBefore Ross\u2019s emails and other documents were released July 24 as part of the multistate litigation, the secretary issued a supplemental memo June 22 in which he disclosed that he had been considering adding the citizenship question since he assumed office in February 2017 and that he and his staff had \u201cinquired whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) would support, and if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question.\u201d Email records show the Justice Department was onboard.\n\nLooking at the full picture, there are several reasons to be skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for adding the citizenship question \u2014 but what\u2019s clear is that Ross was pressing this cause since he joined the Trump administration and in May 2017 called it \u201cmy months old request that we include the citizenship question,\u201d well before the Justice Department articulated in a December 2017 letter why the question was needed.\n\nDemocrats on the panel pressed Ross several times on the citizenship question. \u201cThere is a great deal of concern that adding this question is going to lead to a drop of participation, particularly among immigrant communities who may not understand that census data is not to be shared and may be afraid the data that is gathered will be shared with other departments,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told Ross.\n\n\u201cExecutive branch officials discussing important issues prior to formulating policy is evidence of good government, and the Secretary\u2019s previous testimony before Congress is consistent with that fact. Secretary Ross clearly explained his decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 Decennial Census in his March 26, 2018 decision memorandum , which details his exhaustive examination and review of the relevant data. \u201cRecent document productions further demonstrate the Secretary\u2019s commitment to taking a hard look at the alternatives presented to him by the Census Bureau. It shows an open, frank, and interactive dialogue between the Secretary and his staff. Nothing in the supplemental production changes the sound rationale he articulated in March, nor does it contradict his prior congressional testimony. These documents also demonstrate that the citizenship question was one of many important Decennial Census issues that the Secretary began considering shortly after his arrival.\u201d\n\nNone of this is evidence that Ross gave complete testimony to Congress. In the March 26 memo the spokesman referenced, Ross specifically said he \u201cset out\u201d to explore adding the citizenship question upon DOJ\u2019s request. \u201cFollowing receipt of the DOJ request, I set out to take a hard look at the request and ensure that I considered all facts and data relevant to the question so that I could make an informed decision on how to respond,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal judge ruled July 26 that the states, cities and groups behind the court challenge \u201cplausibly allege\u201d that Ross\u2019s \u201cdecision to reinstate the citizenship question was motivated at least in part by discriminatory animus and will result in a discriminatory effect,\u201d allowing the case to move forward. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said President Trump himself may have been involved in the decision. The judge also pointed out that Ross as commerce secretary has \u201cbroad authority\u201d over census matters, as NPR reported.", "lang": "en"}
