In reality, this image has been used by multiple media outlets for the past 10 years. It has been available on the photo sharing website Flickr since 2008. Recently, we saw how child abduction rumours on WhatsApp led to the lynching of 8 people. The tiniest of rumour can turn deadly in the age of social media and we as a country need to identify every single outlet that dishes out these fake news, images and videos so as to prevent another Jharkhand from happening.\n\nPostcard.news has been at the forefront in spreading fake news. Multiple websites have documented their efforts at propagating fake news. Here\u2019s a list of articles that have been authored by postcard.news and are absolutely fake.\n\u2022 April 18, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cWatch!! Is Birbhum a Part of Pakistan or Bangladesh\u201c. The first sentence of the article is \u201cJihadi Didi\u2019s West Bengal is a safe haven for all Islamic Fanatics.\u201d In this article they claimed that 2 Muslim IPS officers beat-up Hanuman devotees on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti on April 11th, 2017. To substantiate their claims, they also posted a video of a police officer beating up a man. Alt News investigated this issue and found it to be absolutely fake. The video that they posted has been available on YouTube since 2014.\n\u2022 May 17, 2017: Postcard posted an article titled \u201cMamata Banerjee to setup separate engineering entrance exam for minority students.\u201d We searched for this news in main stream media websites and found nothing that was remotely related to this issue in the year 2017. Finally, we found an article dated April, 05, 2014 in Economic Times. Not only were they rehashing a 3 year old story as a present one, they also forgot to mention that the article has stated clearly that Mamta Government is doing so based on Supreme Court directives. The article on Economic Times also states that Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka already had one such system. Ironically, the last sentence of this Postcard article states \u201cIt is time the courts step in and put a break on her appeasement politics\u201d while it was Supreme Court\u2019s directives all along.\n\u2022 Jan 20, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cMust read! World Economic Forum releases survey on Indian media, the results are shameful!\u201c. It was funny to see a site like Postcard talk about trustworthiness of other media sources. The Postcard article stated that \u201cThe World Economic Forum, which released the report has labelled the Indian media as the second most untrusted institution in the world.\u201d They also managed to connect this data with NDTV, Kanhaiya Kumar and Burhan Wani. Boomlive.in investigated this issue and found that \u201cIndia was among the three countries in which media was trusted. The other countries are China and Indonesia. Moreover, trust in Indian media has increased 3 percentage points from 2016 to 66% in 2017.\u201c.\n\u2022 March 20, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cBBC News Point releases names of 10 most corrupt political parties in the world 2017, Check which party from India is named most corrupt!.\u201d This article claimed that Indian National Congress was the 4th most corrupt party in the world.Geeta Pandey who works with BBC tweeted the postcard article and stated that BBC never did any such survey. DNA also wrote an article stating how BBC News Point was a fake site.\n\u2022 August 19, 2016: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cThe \u2018Kind Young Man\u2019 who gave lift to Barkha Dutt is Hizbul Mujaheddin Terrorist Zakir Rashid??\u201d They posted two unrelated grainy pictures of Barkha Dutt taking a scooter ride with some young man in Budgam and juxtaposed it with a picture of then newly appointed Hizbul chief Zakir Musa. Alt News investigated and found that Postcard\u2019s assertion was faker than fake. Read more about it here.\n\u2022 April 13, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cGood News! Yogi decides to end reservation in this sector.\u201d In this article, they claimed that Yogi Adityanath has decided to end reservation in private medical colleges. The Postcard article claimed that it was a landmark step to change the deteriorating picture of Uttar Pradesh. It turned out that no such reservation ever existed according to this article on New India Express.\n\u2022 Feb 2, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cExclusive & Shocking! Money, Foreign trips and Call girls\u2026Aam Aadmi Party makes revolution in social media campaigning\u201c. In this article, they quoted a a Twitter account called \u201caap_lal\u201d which was created in Jan 2017. It was an anonymous Twitter account which claimed that AAP was paying Rs 50 for ever tweet and 7 for every retweet. SMHoaxslayer looked at this issue and found it to be absolutely fake. As it turned out, the @aap_lal Twitter account was created with the express purpose of spreading rumours. Soon after Postcard\u2019s fake expos\u00e9, Twitter suspended the aap_lal Twitter account.\n\u2022 Jan 3, 2017: Postcard wrote an article titled \u201cBIG BREAKING! PM Modi\u2019s big diplomatic win, Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s assets worth 15,000 crore rupees seized in UAE!\u201c. Huffingtonpost found out that this was completely untrue.\n\nThe above list is just a partial list of the fake news, rumours, disinformation that postcard.news propagates. Who\u2019s behind this factory of fake news? As stated on the website, postcard.news was founded by Mahesh Vikram Hegde, Vivek Shetty and Ankita Rajvardhan.\n\nWhile Mahesh Hegde is followed by PM Modi on Twitter, Vivek Shetty and Ankita Rajvardhan are followed by other Union Minisers such as Piyush Goyal on Twitter. Ankita Rajvardhan also has pictures with various Union Ministers including Sushma Swaraj, Gen VK Singh, Rajnath Singh on her Twitter profile. Vivek Shetty and Mahesh Hegde regularly promote postcard.news articles through their social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook. At the time of writing, via such blatant fakery as exhibited in this article, Postcard.news is now in the top 500 websites in India in terms of traffic ranking.\n\nAlt News requests its readers to be extremely careful about articles from Postcard.news as there is a high likelihood of it being absolutely fake.
