Their source, which was embedded in the story, was the government-owned People's Television Network (PTV).\n\nThe facts: At least 3 news media companies in the Philippines reported on the country's ranking in the 2019 US News and World Report.\n\nThe PTV news report was not published on the same day as the viraltoponline.xyz article. It was published on Facebook on January 26.\n\nThe Philippines ranked 50th out of 80 countries in the 2019 US News and World Report. This was a drop from 49th out of 80 countries in 2018.\n\nBest Countries is an annual report published by the US News and World Report in partnership with brand research company BAV Group and The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nUS News and World describes its Best Countries ranking as a \"rankings, news, and analysis project created to capture how countries are perceived on a global scale.\"\n\nIn an article on their methodology, they explained that the 80 countries are scored on 65 attributes by 20,000 people across the globe. \u2013 Vernise L.
