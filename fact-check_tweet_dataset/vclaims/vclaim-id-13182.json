Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.", "author": "factly.in", "date": "2019-03-23T07:44:37+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13182", "url": "https://factly.in/no-the-crowd-did-not-chant-modi-slogans-at-the-congress-meeting-its-a-doctored-video/", "vclaim": "A video is being shared on Facebook by many users claiming that the crowd chanted \u2018Modi, Modi\u2026\u2019 when the leader asked the crowd to chant \u2018Rahul Gandhi Zindabad\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nThe leader in the video is Alpesh Thakor, a Congress MLA in Gujarat. When searched for \u201cAlpesh Thakor Speech at Congress Rally\u201d on YouTube, it is found that the video posted is from an event where Alpesh Thakor joined the Congress party as a similar video can be seen in the search results.\n\nSo, when searched for \u2018Alpesh Thakor speech at joining Congress party\u2019, the original video can be found in the search results.\n\nAt \u201823.20 seconds\u2019 in the original video, it can found that the crowd did not chant Modi slogans but shouted \u2018Zindabad\u2019 when Alpesh shouted \u2018Rahul Gandhi\u2019. Also, Alpesh asks people to remain silent at the beginning of his speech but in the video posted on Facebook, it has been placed after the slogans to make it look that he is stopping people from chanting pro-Modi slogans. So, it can be concluded that the video posted on Facebook is a doctored video.\n\nFinally, the crowd did not chant Modi slogans at the Congress meeting.", "lang": "en"}
