Salahuddin is a Kashmiri separatist militant and the head of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. At the time of writing this article, the post was shared over 5,600 times.\n\nThe post carried a stamp \u2018The Fearless Indian\u2019, which led us to the Facebook page that created the infographic in 2017. It has nearly 9,000 shares.\n\n\u2018The Fearless Indian\u2019 is a pro-BJP page that is run by BJYM\u2019s national co-convenor of IT and social media Devang Dave.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe claim that Salahuddin contested for the seat of Kashmir MLA on Congress\u2019s ticket in 1987 is false. He had, in fact, contested the elections on the ticket of the Muslim United Front (MUF). Several media reports \u2013 The Caravan, Rising Kashmir, India Today \u2013 have penned his fact, especially as the 1987 elections were a watershed moment in Kashmir\u2019s political history.\n\nSyed Salahuddin had fought the 1987 elections from the assembly constituency Amira Kadal.\n\nThat Syed Salahuddin contested on a Congress ticket is a false claim viral since 2017. Fake News website Post Card News (article now deleted) and website Kashmir News Observerhad published articles citing Dainik Bhaskaras the source of the information. However, Dainik Bhaskar was falsely quoted as the media outlet itself wrote that Salahuddin was representing the MUF. The Quinthad debunked the misinformation in 2017.\n\nThe usual suspects \u2013 Anshul Saxena, Gaurav Pradhan, Mahesh Vikram Hegde, Rishi Bagree \u2013 had helped spread the false claim.\n\nIn conclusion, Syed Salahuddin did not contest the 1987 Kashmir elections on a Congress ticket but fought on a Muslim United Front ticket.", "lang": "en"}
