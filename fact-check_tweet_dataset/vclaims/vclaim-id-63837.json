See image below.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates in Nigeria released an official statement on the matter. This was released via their Official Twitter page yesterday August 6th, 2020.\n\nAccording to the release, the purported imposition of restrictions on Nigerians seeking to travel to the UAE is inaccurate.\n\nIt further stated that the restrictions were based on Covid-19 related restrictions which have since been eased as at July 7th for all travellers with negative PCR tests results within 92 hours of traveling to the UAE, including Nigerians.\n\nThe limitation of travel between Nigeria and UAE is credited to the continued closure of the Nigerian airspace and no other reason.\n\nSee the statement below.\n\nDubawa further reached out to Flyworld as indicated on the image attached to this report. The response indicated that Visa renewals and tourist applications have been temporarily on hold since March 17th, 2020 and NOT for Nigerians alone.\n\nAccording to the United Arab Emirates Government portal, the expired work permits and residence permits of labourers and support service staff such as domestic workers will be issued and renewed automatically. Also, foreigners who are visitors or residents of the country who also have expired visas will also receive extensions for their visa until December 2020.\n\nThis decision was supposedly taken in order to support visitors and residents in the country, following the suspension of air traffic. See specifications of the decision below.\n\n\u201cresidents whose residence visas expired in early March 2020 or are due to expire later will receive an extension of their visas until the end of December 2020. This measure applies to both residents inside and outside the UAE. Foreign visitors to the UAE who couldn\u2019t leave the UAE and whose visas expired in early March 2020 or are due to expire later, will also have their visit visas extended until the end of December 2020. In addition, residents whose Emirates ID cards expired in early March 2020 or later will also have their validity extended until the end of the current year.\u201d\n\nAs seen, no specification is made as to which nationality this will apply to or otherwise and decisions taken are in light of the coronavirus pandemic and moves to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nHowever, The UAE has since July 7th, 2020 began easing air traffic restrictions for citizens, visitors and residents in and outside the country.\n\nUAE has generally suspended visa-related services for most nationalities, including most African countries. Nigeria has not been singled out as a country not to be granted visa or travel-related services in the UAE.", "lang": "en"}
