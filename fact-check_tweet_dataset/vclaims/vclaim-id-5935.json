{"title": "Etymology of 'News'", "subtitle": "Is the word 'news' an acronym formed from the words 'north,' east,' 'west,' and 'south'?", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2001-04-26T01:30:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5935", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/news-etymology/", "vclaim": "Some explanations are just too simple to accept:\n\nThe notion that the English word news \u2014 that is, information about recent events \u2014 is the plural of the word new just doesn\u2019t sound right, so somebody cooked up the notion that the word is an acronym formed from the initial letters of the four cardinal compass points ( orth, ast, est, and outh), supposedly because news is information from all over the land.\n\nSimilar folk etymologies include the idea that \u2018news\u2019 derives from an acronym for the phrase \u201cNotable Events, Weather, and Sports\u201d:\n\nThis tidbit is also obviously not true, as the concept of \u201cnews\u201d was around (and was referred to as such) long before professional sports and reliable weather forecasting became mainstays of that industry (or even existed).\n\nLikewise, the word \u2018newspaper\u2019 is not an acronym formed from the words \u201cNorth, East, West, South, Past and Present Event Report.\u201d A newspaper is so named because it is literally paper on which has been printed information about recent events (i.e., \u2018news\u2019).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the real explanation sounds a bit odd to us, because new is an adjective and not a noun, so how could it have a plural form? The answer is that although adjectives don\u2019t generally have plurals in English, they do in other languages. In some Romance languages, for example, adjectives change to agree in number with the nouns they modify. In Spanish a white house is a casa blanca, but white houses are casas blancas. Likewise, in French a tall woman is a grande femme, but tall women are grandes femmes. When nouveau, the French word for new, modifies a plural (feminine) noun, it becomes nouvelles, which is also the French word for news.\n\nNot so strange after all.", "lang": "en"}
