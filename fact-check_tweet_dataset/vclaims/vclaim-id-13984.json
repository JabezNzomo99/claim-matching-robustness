While the video is from an incident where BJP workers were heckled by a crowd, the incident is not from West Bengal. Although the audio track in the video is not very clear, on listening closely, one can make out that the language being spoken by the crowd is Gujarati. This can be confirmed with a simple reverse image. The results returned versions of the video dating back to 2017.
