The Liberal and Nationals have only increased teacher numbers by just 11 per cent over the last eight years.\u201d\n\nThe Labor opposition has promised to employ an additional 5065 teachers for NSW public schools if it wins the March 23 election. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Dib\u2019s claims the number of school teachers increased by 23 per cent during Labor\u2019s 1995-2011 term, while the increase in teacher numbers under the Liberal-National coalition was \u201cjust 11 per cent over the last eight years\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck requested the Labor opposition provide the source of the figures used to support Mr Dib\u2019s claims. Labor sent AAP FactCheck a table which a Labor spokesperson said came from a NSW Parliament research report and was based on figures compiled from NSW Department of Education annual reports dated 1995, 2013 and 2017.\n\nThe supplied table showed 49,697 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers were employed in NSW government schools in 1995 when the previous Labor government was elected. By the time Labor was voted out in 2011, the number of teachers had increased by 23.6 per cent to 61,144.\n\nThe supplied table also showed that under the coalition from 2011 to 2017, the number of teachers in government schools grew by 7.5 per cent - from 61,144 to 65,714. According to the supplied table the 2018 figure had not been published.\n\nThe 23 per cent increase in the number of teachers under Labor quoted by Mr Dib is correct, according to the supplied table. The 11 per cent coalition figure is incorrect, and puts the government in a more favourable light, because, according to the supplied table, the true figure is 7.5 per cent.\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures however tell a different story regarding the increases in teacher numbers under Labor and Liberal in government schools since 1995.\n\nAccording to the ABS, there were 48,839.1 teachers in NSW government schools in 1995 [2]. The total grew to 52,802 by the time Labor left office in 2011, representing an 8.1 per cent increase [3].\n\nIn 2011 when the coalition was elected, there were 52,802 teachers in NSW government schools. The number rose to 56,743.7 in 2018 - a 7.47 per cent increase [3].\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes that only one of Mr Dib\u2019s claims regarding Labor\u2019s 23 per cent increase could be verified, and only by data supplied by Labor.\n\nABS data showed the rise under Labor was 8.1 per cent (compared to Labor's claim of 23 per cent) and the rise under the Liberals has been 7.47 per cent.", "lang": "en"}
