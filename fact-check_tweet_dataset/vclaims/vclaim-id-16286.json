From April 2017, new claimants will get \u00a373.10 instead of the \u00a3102.15 per week that current claimants get. This is to bring the benefit in line with the Jobseeker's Allowance claimed by people who are unemployed and looking for work.\n\nMrs May was correct in her reply that spending on disability benefits overall will increase each year up to 2020. That is, if you look at the cash amount to be spent on disability benefits\u2014the increase is slightly less consistent when you take inflation into account.\n\nFigures compiled by the House of Commons Library show disability benefit spending in cash terms going from \u00a317.1 billion in 2010/11 to \u00a324.6 billion in 2020/21, rising each individual year in between.\n\nBut, in real terms, the increase over the decade is several billion smaller, and spending is forecast to drop back this financial year.\n\nThis won\u2019t take into account any changes to disability benefits announced at today\u2019s Autumn Statement.", "lang": "en"}
