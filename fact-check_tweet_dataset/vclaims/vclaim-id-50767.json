The image of the tweet has been edited to say Luxembourg. The original correctly reported that an Iraqi migrant\u2019s body was found off the coast of Belgium and linked to a Guardian article about this. The person was believed to have drowned while trying to cross from northern France to the UK, with currents carrying their body to Belgium. It is not unheard of for the bodies of migrants who attempt this crossing to be carried to other areas of Europe.\n\nThere are a couple of things which suggest the image of the tweet shared on Facebook isn\u2019t quite what it seems\u2014the top of the image uses Ms Abbott\u2019s Twitter image and handle, but the bottom uses Facebook\u2019s like and share buttons.\n\nSecondly, this is the only tweet Ms Abbott ever seems to have written using that particular phrasing and she doesn\u2019t seem to have deleted any tweets about Luxembourg either.\n\nYou can read more about spotting altered or fake images here.", "lang": "en"}
