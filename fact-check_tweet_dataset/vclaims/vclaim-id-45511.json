The bill states individuals would quarantine in their homes.\n\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush introduced H.R. 6666, also known as the Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act on May 1.\n\nThe bill would create a $100 billion grant program \u201cto fully mobilize coronavirus testing and contact tracking efforts\u201d among local organizations such as community health centers and nonprofits, per a press release. It seeks to do so through funding the hiring, training and payment of individuals to run mobile testing sites and helping cover the costs of supplies for mobile testing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSince its introduction, multiple Facebook users have claimed the bill will also \u201cgive the government the power to forcibly remove your family from your home and quarantine them.\u201d But that is incorrect. (RELATED: Does HR 6666 Require Microchips To Be Secretly Implanted During COVID-19 Tests?)\n\nThe Daily Caller searched through the bill in its entirety and found no language about forced entry into people\u2019s homes or the removal of family members for quarantine. In fact, the bill states that grants will be distributed for \u201cdiagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through mobile health units and as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.\u201d\n\nRush also disputed the claim on his congressional website, saying, \u201cThis bill does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe TRACE Act would not require anyone to be tested for COVID-19 either, according to Rush\u2019s website.", "lang": "en"}
