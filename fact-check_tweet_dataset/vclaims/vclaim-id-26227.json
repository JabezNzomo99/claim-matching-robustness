Most of the words in the post actually come from a Breitbart interview with actor Jon Voight.\n\nSelleck, star of the popular 80s television series \u201cMagnum, P.I.,\u201d has expressed his political views in the past, telling National Review in 2004 that he was a \u201cregistered independent with a lot of libertarian leanings.\u201d During the 2008 election cycle, he publicly endorsed Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential bid.

The post also includes a number of other quotes attributed to Selleck and is paired with a picture of him.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Selleck ever said these pro-Trump statements in a \u201cmeeting\u201d with Breitbart. A search of Breitbart\u2019s website revealed no interviews with Selleck saying words attributed to him in the Facebook post. In fact, most of the post was actually taken from an exclusive interview that Voight did with the outlet in March 2016.\n\nFurther adding to the Facebook post\u2019s dubiousness, Selleck told the hosts of \u201cThe View\u201d that he wrote in the name of former Dallas Police Chief David Brown for president in 2016 because he \u201cdidn\u2019t really support either candidate,\u201d referring to Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "lang": "en"}
