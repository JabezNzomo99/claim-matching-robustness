But economists and federal agencies keep data on aggregate income growth that can tell us, on average, whether Americans\u2019 incomes are rising.\n\nTo evaluate Clinton\u2019s claim, we\u2019ll start by looking at inflation-adjusted median household income, which takes into account rising prices when comparing average income levels across time.\n\nAccording to an analysis of U.S. Census Data performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, median household income dropped from $57,843 in January, 1999, to $53,657 in January, 2014 , the most recent period for which statistics are available. That\u2019s a 7 percent drop, and supports Clinton\u2019s assertion that Americans haven\u2019t seen their incomes rise over the last decade and a half.\n\nAnother way to measure whether Americans have \"had a raise\" would be to look at a narrower slice of the population: full-time workers over the age of 16. The draws on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to show median usual weekly earnings for these workers.\n\nIn January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 \u2013 a 2 percent increase.\n\n, we could judge Clinton\u2019s claim on this second figure, since it captures people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis and who could receive a \"raise\" as that term is commonly understood.\n\nThat said, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth, and arguably the more appropriate one to use in this context.\n\nMany households receive at least a portion of their income from government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments \u2013 income that isn\u2019t reflected in wages or salary data alone. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it\u2019s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign ad claims, \"Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\" Inflation-adjusted median household income has indeed dropped 7 percent over that period, while earnings for wage and salary workers have increased a modest 2 percent.", "lang": "en"}
