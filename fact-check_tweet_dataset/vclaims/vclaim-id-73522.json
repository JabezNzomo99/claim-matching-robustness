The post claims this video was shot on Mehdipatnam Flyover, Hyderabad. The video shows vehicles moving on the flyover and suddenly the billboard is blown over because of strong winds, hitting two bikers.\n\nThe Facebook caption read, \u201cBad luck\u2026\u0c05\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c07\u0c26\u0c47\u0c28\u0c47\u0c2e\u0c4b (Telugu translation-That is what it is).. Today morning at Hyderabad, Mehdipatnam Omg\u2026.\u201d\n\nWe also found another Facebook post that also claims the videos is from Hyderabad.\n\nMore such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: IPS Vinay Tiwari has not been transferred to CBI\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nWe got our first clue while reading through the comment section of the Facebook post. We saw a Facebook comment stating that the billboard accident video that killed two bikers is from Pakistan. On reading other comments we got an idea about the misleading information that was being circulated on social media about the same incident.\n\nBy putting the keywords \u2018Billboard\u2019 accident\u2019 \u2018Pakistan\u2019 on Youtube Search, we saw the accident footage in the news bulletin on 24 News HD YouTube Channel dated August 7, 2020, saying that the footage of the accident is from Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nOn digging further, we also found the same video of the accident on Youtube claiming that a billboard fell in Karachi in a road accident during heavy rainfall.\n\nFurther, we came across the latest update about the flying billboard accident in an article published on GULF NEWS, dated August 8, 2020, claiming that Karachi Commissioner has ordered for the immediate removal of billboards all over the city to save human lives.\n\nHence, the above information proves that the horrific video in question is from Karachi, Pakistan and not from Hyderabad.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
