Even though, the post looks a joke but many are believing that Rahul Gandhi has actually tweeted it.\n\nThe nationwide lockdown which was announced on March 24 is currently in its 4th phase and is set to be lifted on May 31.\n\n\n\nReportedly, the Union Home Ministry said on May 26 that no decision has been taken on the opening of schools and colleges and all educational institutions across the country are still prohibited from restarting. The statement by the home ministry spokesperson was issued following certain reports that the ministry has permitted all states to open schools. \"No such decision taken by MHA. All Educational institutions are still prohibited to open, throughout the country(sic),\" the spokesperson tweeted. All educational institutions have been shut since mid-March, to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that schools and colleges should reopen from 1st June on odd /even days basis. On observing the screenshot of the tweet, 3 details stand out.\n\nAccording to the screenshot, the tweet from Gandhi came at 8:16 pm on 22 May. However, on Rahul Gandhi's official Twitter account, no such tweet could be found from 22 May. Two of his tweets could be found around that time on May 22: One at 7:15 PM and another at 11: 53 PM.\n\nFurther, no reports stating his official statement regarding the reopening of schools could be found. Therefore the tweet is fake.
