I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far will we go? How much will we do? And that's why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.\"\n\nWe will fact-check whether Clinton is right about what Trump said about Putin and the emails.\n\nA Clinton campaign spokesman pointed us to Trump\u2019s comments at a press conference at Trump National Doral golf course July 27.\n\n\"Russia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump said to a room full of TV cameras as well as reporters from the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times. \"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"\n\nHe also said: \"By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s lawyers had turned over work-related emails but deleted thousands that she said were about personal matters.\n\nFBI Director James Comey said earlier that month that Clinton should have known that some of the emails stored on private servers in her New York home were classified, but concluded there wasn\u2019t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information.\n\nAlthough the Justice Department declined to prosecute, Trump continued to hammer Clinton for the email controversy:\n\n\"That gives me a big problem,\" Trump said in Doral. \"After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\"\n\nWhen Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, asked Trump whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, Trump snapped back: \"Be quiet. I know you want to save (Clinton).\"\n\nTrump also attacked the DNC over thousands of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks in July. Those emails showed its leaders \u2014 including party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida \u2014 favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders. Two days later Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative, announced she would step down from her party post.\n\nAs for any invitation to Russia to hack emails, a Trump campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that Trump said he was being \"sarcastic\" in an interview that Fox News posted the next day.\n\nTrump told Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade, \"You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 emails illegally. You look at that. And when I\u2019m being sarcastic with something ...\" Asked by Kilmeade if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, \"Of course I'm being sarcastic.\"\n\nClinton says Trump \"publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans\u2019 (emails).\"\n\nTrump said at a press conference in South Florida that he hoped Russia was able to find \"the 30,000 emails that are missing.\" That was a reference to Clinton\u2019s emails, not Americans\u2019 emails more broadly.", "lang": "en"}
