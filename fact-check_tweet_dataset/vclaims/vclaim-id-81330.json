We will have that another day. But the application of the Hyde amendment when zero taxpayer dollars are involved is unprecedented. It represents a very significant change in Federal policy\u2026. Yesterday, my friend, the senior Senator from Texas, argued that the inclusion of the language was routine, that this does not change the status quo at all. Well that is simply not accurate. The Hyde amendment is about keeping taxpayer dollars out of the abortion debate. We may have different opinions on the issue, but that is not what we are talking about here. The money at issue in this bill is not taxpayer dollars, it is money collected from sex traffickers. The bottom line is that the offender-financed fund created in this bill relies on zero taxpayer dollars. So if you want to maintain current practice, you have to remove this provision.\u201d\n\nThe stalemate in the Senate over the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 hinges over the inclusion of language limiting the use of funds in a special victims\u2019 fund to pay for abortions. Democrats have opposed the abortion language \u2014 known as the Hyde Amendment \u2014 on the grounds that these victims, if pregnant, might have difficulty claiming they were raped (which is an exception under the Hyde amendment but reports suggest is very difficult to obtain.) Moreover, as shown in the statement by Sen. Leahy, Democrats believe that the use of Hyde when zero taxpayer dollars are involved is unprecedented.\n\nSec. 506. (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated in this Act, shall be expended for any abortion.\n\n (b) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated in this Act, shall be expended for health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion. (c) The term \u201chealth benefits coverage\u201d means the package of services covered by a managed care provider or organization pursuant to a contract or other arrangement. Sec. 507. (a) The limitations established in the preceding section shall not apply to an abortion\u2013\n\n (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or\n\n (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. (b) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as prohibiting the expenditure by a State, locality, entity, or private person of State, local, or private funds (other than a State\u2019s or locality\u2019s contribution of Medicaid matching funds).\n\n (c) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as restricting the ability of any managed care provider from offering abortion coverage or the ability of a State or locality to contract separately with such a provider for such coverage with State funds (other than a State\u2019s or locality\u2019s contribution of Medicaid matching funds).\n\nThere are several ways one could look at this language. The amendment covers funds \u201cappropriated\u201d in the bill, so one interpretation is those funds are covered regardless whether they originally came from tax revenues or not. Once those funds, from whatever source, go into the federal Treasury, they are federal funds. Moreover, note that law specifically mentions trust funds, such as what were originally \u201cprivate\u201d dollars paid in by individuals as Medicare premiums. There are also restrictions on the states, requiring them to contract separately to establish a separate account containing only non-federal money if they want to fund abortions.\n\nWe found an interesting document in the Clinton library, dated June 16, 1998, that sheds some light on use of Medicare funds and abortion. As the memo to the president (embedded below) discloses, Clinton chose to decide that all Medicare expenditures must abide by the Hyde restrictions because some Hyde-covered appropriated funds are deposited in the Medicare Trust fund. In fact, he specifically rejected an option that would have segregated appropriated funds from non-appropriated funds such as premiums. The legal policy was never restricted to funds that came from \u201ctaxes.\u201d (Congress later codified this decision into law.)\n\nSec. 202. None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for an abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape: Provided, That should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void. Sec. 203. None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used to require any person to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion.\n\nFrom a Republican perspective, Democrats have long complained about legislative riders such as Hyde, saying that the place to settle policy matters such as abortion funding is in the authorizing legislation. So now when Republicans have tried to do it in a piece of legislation, such as the human-trafficking bill, the complaint is that this would embed Hyde more permanently in this program than annual appropriations \u2014 not withstanding that Hyde has been in place for more than a quarter-century.", "lang": "en"}
