The post has gone viral on Facebook with claims that it is from Wayanad, Kerala.\n\nThe Facebook caption read: \u201cKerala floods, Cows unable to withstand. Poor cows. OMG.

On putting one of the keyframe through Google Reverse Image Search, we found this video on ImagenTV in Spanish.\n\nWe found the description of the same video on Youtube that claims that it is a video from the Zacualpan river in Nayarit that dragged the cattle into sweeping water.\n\nGoogle Translation, \u201cThese are the images of the overflow of the Zacualpan river in Nayarit that dragged the cattle from the area after the passage of \u201cHanna\u201d. From Pisa and Corre with Nacho Lozano from Monday to Friday at 8:00 am on Imagen Televisi\u00f3n.\u201d\n\nOn digging further we also found the same video on Joranda.com.mx dated July 28, 2020, claiming that the video is from Hanna in which thousands of people have been affected by the torrential rain generated by the storm.\n\nWe also found another article on comosucedio.com dated July 30, 2020, claiming that cattle are dragged by the water flow into the Zacualpan River when the water overflowed in Nayarit.\n\nHence, the above information proves that the video in question is from Hanna, Mexico and it has no connection with flooding in Kerala.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
