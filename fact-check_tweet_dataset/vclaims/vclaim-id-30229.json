The incident took place in Bap tehsil in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The minor girl's father Ahmad Khan had got her married to a man named Shaukat reported DNA. The girl's mother Nemat had refused to let her daughter go with him until the girl turned 18. Shaukat had then reached the girl's village along with his friend Iliyaas and forcibly took the girl away while brutally attacking the girl's mother. Police had taken action after the video went viral at the time. BOOM had debunked false claims being shared with the same video in January 2018.", "lang": "en"}
