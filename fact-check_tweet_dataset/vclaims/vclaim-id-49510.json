You get a message saying a payment hasn\u2019t been taken e.g O2, Vodafone, 3, Giff Gaff or EE and to click here. As soon as you touch it your money is gone. They already have all your details and it\u2019s the most advance scam the bank has ever seen. Pass this on to everyone please. This is straight from work this morning - the banks are being inundated with calls - thousands flying out of peoples accounts! Spread the word to your family and friends!\u201d\n\nThis is not a real scam. Action Fraud (which is run by the City of London Police) posted in March about an almost identically worded post, stating that the content of the message was false and that City of London Police hadn\u2019t issued any such alert.\n\nHowever, phishing scams are a real problem, and you should never give out personal details, such as passwords or pins, over the phone. If you believe you have shared personal details with a fraudster, immediately contact your bank.", "lang": "en"}
