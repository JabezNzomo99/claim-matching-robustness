Cox says New York state\u2019s debt per person is higher than any other state.\n\n\"We have the highest debt per capita,\" Cox said at a debate among three Republican candidates for governor.\n\nThe claim comes among a string of criticisms from state Republicans against the economic record of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\n\nCox recently claimed that unemployment was up in every county in the state outside New York City. We rated that claim Mostly True. State Sen. John DeFrancisco, a GOP candidate for governor, claimed that one-third of New York state\u2019s population is on Medicaid. That\u2019s True.\n\nBut there\u2019s also evidence the state\u2019s economy has improved since Cuomo took office. The state has more private sector jobs than ever before, and unemployment has dropped statewide.\n\nSo what about the debt? It is one of the few economic indicators for the state we haven\u2019t looked at. Is Cox\u2019s claim correct?\n\nA spokesperson for Cox said he was talking about debt incurred by state and local governments, not personal debt like credit cards or auto loans.\n\nNew York state ranked highest in government debt for residents in 2015, the latest data available.\n\nThe debt per person was $17,528 in New York state, according to the Empire Center. The center is a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. It used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate the rate for each state.\n\nThe next highest state was Massachusetts, with government debt at $13,733 per person. Wyoming had the lowest rate, with $3,376 of government debt per person.\n\nNew York state has ranked highest each year since Cuomo took office in 2011. Government debt was $17,204 per capita in New York state that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy and finance analysis organization.\n\nCox said \"We have the highest debt per capita.\"\n\nThe latest data proves Cox\u2019s claim. New York state has had the highest state and local government debt per capita since at least 2011.", "lang": "en"}
