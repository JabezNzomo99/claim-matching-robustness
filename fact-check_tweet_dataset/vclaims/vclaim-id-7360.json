This will be done by removing the Green Belt classification from that land prior to development. We don\u2019t know if these plans will be followed through on and the figures have some margin of error.\n\nThe figure has increased since last year, partly because more councils have completed their long-term plans.\n\nIn the four years to 2016/17, the size of the Green Belt decreased by about 0.3% and 0.7% was built on.\n\nCPRE also found that 22% of homes with planning permission for the Green Belt are \u201caffordable\u201d (homes below market value). Some of these homes have already been built.\n\nThat\u2019s higher than the rate of affordable home building overall. In 2016/17 19% of new homes across England were affordable. Some people argue that building homes at market value (i.e. not defined as affordable), can still improve the overall affordability of housing.\n\nWhat is the Green Belt?\n\nThe Green Belt is land around major cities in England that is designed to stop urban sprawl as well as safeguard the countryside and historic towns. The government\u2019s planning policy says that: \u201cInappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe Green Belt covers 13% of England and comprises a mix of greenfield land that has never been developed, brownfield land that has been developed but is no longer in use and land that is currently in use (e.g. residential or industrial buildings).\n\nIn the four years to 2016/17 the Green Belt decreased in size by around 4,500 hectares (0.3%), though the Green Belt is bigger now by around 2,900 hectares since comparable statistics started in 2006.\n\nThe Green Belt changes size when councils decide to reclassify land within their remit. That\u2019s usually because councils want to build on it, though that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nSince 2013/14 around 11,300 hectares of land still classified as Green Belt has been built on and around two thirds of that land was greenfield land. That\u2019s about 0.4% of the total area of the Green Belt in 2013/14.\n\nTo put that in perspective, imagine the Green Belt was the same size as an A4 piece of paper. Over the past four years, an area of greenfield equivalent to about a 5p coin was built on.\n\nMost of what\u2019s built on the Green Belt isn\u2019t housing\u2014other developments include buildings for industrial or commercial purposes. Over the past four years only 1,600 hectares out of 11,300 was for residential use.\n\nWhat could happen in future?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say how much of the Green Belt will be built on in the future.\n\nThe Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said building on the Green Belt could happen in two main ways. The first is that councils could remove Green Belt status from land destined for building. The second is that developers could receive planning permission to build on Green Belt land.\n\nFor the first element, the CPRE used local council planning data and calculated that councils plan to remove enough land from Green Belt status to build around 460,000 new homes. This is up by around 35,000 compared to the year before when the estimate was 425,000, though some of this increase may be because more councils have actually finalised their plans in the past year.\n\nThe CPRE told us it expects any building to take place in the next 15 years as local plans tend to last that long.\n\nThey acknowledged there were some limits to the data, such as the fact that not all councils have produced local plans\u2014for example, Sevenoaks council proposed up to 6,800 homes on the Green Belt following the report\u2019s publication.\n\nWe have some concerns that, conversely, some of the figures are overestimates. For example, this development of 65 homes in North London is included in CPRE\u2019s figures, but the area is adjacent to the Green Belt, not within the Green Belt. One of the largest homebuilders in CPRE\u2019s figures is Dacorum Borough Council who CPRE say plan to build 14,360 homes on the Green Belt. That is the highest of seven options and hasn\u2019t been confirmed.\n\nUltimately data on local plans should be treated with caution.\n\nAs for planning permissions within the Green Belt, the CPRE hired consultants, Glenigan, to measure the number of planning applications approved within current Green Belt land.\n\nIt found that in 2017/18 planning applications for around 4,000 homes and 190 commercial and industrial buildings on Green Belt land were approved.\n\nUsing planning permissions data to estimate future building is problematic because plans don\u2019t always materialise and more than one permission can be held for each building.\n\nSo what does that all add up to?\n\nPutting aside caveats with the data, we can use it to estimate the area of Green Belt land we may lose to new building. This is very rough and illustrative and doesn\u2019t include land that councils may remove from the Green Belt for non-residential purposes.\n\nBut we calculate that building on the Green Belt (or the loss of land previously with Green Belt status) could amount to around 3,600 hectares a year in the future. That\u2019s about a fifth of a percent of the Green Belt\u2019s current area per year.\n\nWhile a rough estimate, that\u2019s in line with what\u2019s actually happened to the Green Belt in the past four years. Over the last four years, an average of 3,900 hectares of Green Belt land has been built on or lost its Green Belt designation each year (though there may be overlap between the two).\n\nWe calculated the estimate as follows:\n\nFirstly, there are 460,000 homes planned for land that the CPRE say will lose Green Belt status. The Government measured that in 2016/17 new developments were built at a density of 32 homes per hectare. So 460,000 homes would cover about 14,400 hectares or just under 1,000 a year over 15 years. That\u2019s equivalent to 0.9% of the current Green Belt area.\n\nSecondly, there\u2019s the homes that have planning permission to be built on the Green Belt itself. In 2017/18 4,000 homes had planning permission approved. Assuming they get built, and that number remains stable, that adds up to another 190 hectares a year. That\u2019s using the government\u2019s measure that in 2016/17 new developments in the Green Belt were built at a density of 21 per hectare.\n\nBuilding in the Green Belt has to \u201cpreserve the openness of the Green Belt\u201d and so is typically built at a lower density.\n\nFinally, we added in coverage of non-residential buildings. There isn\u2019t an estimate we know of for the density of non-residential buildings on the Green Belt, but government figures suggest around 2,400 hectares a year is used for this. As non-residential planning permissions and building have been pretty stable for a few years, we\u2019ve used this number to estimate future building.\n\nData shared with us by the CPRE suggests that councils aim for 32% of housing in current Green Belt land to be affordable. This excludes councils who have not included affordability targets (14 of the 98 councils).\n\nData from the CPRE also shows that that 22% of homes with planning permission in the Green Belt are affordable. Last year 24% of homes actually completed in 2017/18 in the Green Belt were affordable.\n\nAffordable housing is designed to meet the needs of people who can\u2019t afford housing at market rates. It\u2019s defined as any house that is \u2018social rented\u2019, \u2018affordable rented\u2019 or \u2018intermediate\u2019, which in essence means its cost is held low by rent controls or guideline levels set locally and nationally.\n\nIf accurate, this provision of affordable housing is slightly higher than in England generally. In 2016/17 19% of new houses were affordable.\n\nAlso some argue that housing need not be \u201caffordable\u201d for it to improve the general affordability of housing. For example analysis by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government found that, all other things being equal, an increase in housing supply generally would reduce prices.", "lang": "en"}
