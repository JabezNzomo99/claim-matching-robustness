Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of BJP MLA getting beaten up by people in Patna (Bihar). Fact: There are two clips related to two different incidents in the posted video. Both the incidents took place in West Bengal, not Bihar. While one incident took place in 2017, the other incident took place in 2016. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn watching the video, it can be seen that there are two different video clips in the posted video. So, let\u2019s check each one of them separately.\n\nThis clip has been already debunked by FACTLY when it went viral with another claim in January 2020. The fact-check article can be read here. The video is related to an incident which took place in West Bengal in 2017. West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh and other BJP leaders were heckled by a rebel group of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in Darjeeling. The group was of the supporters of expelled GJM leader Tamang. The news published regarding the incident can be found here and here.\n\nThe second clip begins at 12 seconds in the posted video. When the screenshots of the clip were run through Yandex Reverse Images Search, the longer version of the same clip was found to be uploaded on YouTube in 2016. So, when searched using keywords and time filter, a similar video was found to be uploaded by multiple news agencies on their respective YouTube channels in October 2016, which can be watched here, here, and here. In the description below the \u2018ANI\u2019 video, it can be read that \u2013 \u2018Union Minister Babul Supriyo and his convoy was on Tuesday attacked by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters in West Bengal\u2019s Asansol district. During the scuffle, a BJP party worker was also thrashed and his clothes were ripped. The mob allegedly pelted stones and thrashed party workers in the presence of police officials.\u2019\n\nTo sum it up, video clips of two old incidents from West Bengal falsely are joined and falsely shared as \u2018BJP MLA beaten in Patna (Bihar)\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
