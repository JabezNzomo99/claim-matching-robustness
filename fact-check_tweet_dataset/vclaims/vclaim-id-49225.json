The claim is false; international health authorities and experts do not list gargling as an effective remedy or prevention method for COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was published in this Facebook post on March 14, 2020.\n\nThe post features a graphic image and texts that reads: \u201cCorona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.
