For instance, two of Obama\u2019s most senior campaign aides, David Axelrod and Jim Messina, have worked for different sides in the United Kingdom, with Axelrod advising the opposition Labor Party and Messina aiding the sitting prime minister, David Cameron of the Conservative Party.\n\n\u201cThere was no direction or instruction from the White House or anyone else in the Administration about the work 270 Strategies undertook with OneVoice Israel and V15,\u201d said Lynda Tran, a partner who works with Bird. \u201c270 Strategies was honored to be asked by OneVoice Israel and V15 to share best practices in organizing to maximize their impact both online and on the ground during the recent elections. Our relationship with OneVoice goes back more than a year before the election was even called and continues beyond the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right to do in Israel exactly what we did in the United States, the context is completely different,\u201d admits Bird, who still has some of the Hebrew he learned as a student in Haifa in 1999. But he says the mess in the OneVoice office \u2014 many empty cartons from newly purchased equipment \u2014 reminds him of Obama headquarters, he says: lots of energy and lot of talent. Israel is an ideal country for a door-knocking campaign because of its relatively small size, Bird says. Israel has very complex politics, a large number of parties and relatively high voter turnout, he says, adding that it\u2019s possible to speak with enough people here to replace the government. \u201c\n\n\u201cStaffers who have played significant roles in President Obama\u2019s campaigns were part of an unsuccessful effort to defeat Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s party,\u201d said Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon. \u201cThe notion that they would engage in such activity without anyone in the White House knowing about it, or that the White House could not easily have prevented this with one private word, is completely unpersuasive. This was just one part of an organized campaign to insult and discredit the democratically elected leader of a close ally, designed in part to defeat him at the polls. This administration\u2019s actions go well beyond a diplomatic spat. They have pursued a campaign of clear malice toward Israel and its leaders.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin, saying \u201cJeremy Bird is a huge link,\u201d pointed to the Haaretz and New York Times articles on Bird as evidence of Obama\u2019s involvement. \u201cMoney speaks very loud in politics. The connection is made between U.S. tax-funded nonprofits who at the same time are paying Obama campaign operatives to set up what later became the anti Netanyahu campaign.\u201d He added that \u201cV15 was like a SuperPAC against the PM\u2013unprecedented in Israeli politics.\u201d\n\nBut we should note this line in the Times article: \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Obama or any of his senior aides had anything to do with the move by his former top campaign official, who has never worked at the White House, to join the effort to defeat Mr. Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nThe State Department, of course, funds all sorts of democracy efforts. At this point, we cannot really reach a judgment on whether the State Department sought to bolster Arab Israeli participation, via a joint Arab list, as a way to reduce the size of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. In 2006, The Washington Post disclosed a Bush administration effort to spend $2 million of USAID money in a failed bid to bolster the Palestinian Authority when it faced an election challenge from the radical Islamic group Hamas.\n\nWe see maybe a little bit of smoke but no fire. The burden of the proof rests with the speaker, and as yet there has been no documented evidence that Obama had any involvement in Bird\u2019s association with V15, let alone he \u201csent\u201d Bird and his \u201centire political machine\u201d to Israel in an effort to influence the election.\n\nCertainly, Obama would have been happy to see Netanyahu lose\u2014and clearly the reaction to the Netanyahu\u2019s victory suggests the White House is unhappy that Netanyahu won so convincingly. But that does not support Rubio\u2019s conspiracy theories, which as far as we can tell is based on the activities of a single former Obama campaign operative.\n\nOn the basis of the existing evidence, Rubio ordinarily would earn Four Pinocchios for his overheated rhetoric. But we are going to keep it at Three for now, given that OneVoice has refused to answer queries about V15\u2019s funding or spending during the campaign. Rubio would do better to pose questions rather than make judgments on incomplete information. After all, sometimes conspiracy theories turn out to be true.", "lang": "en"}
