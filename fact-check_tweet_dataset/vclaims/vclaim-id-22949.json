The post claims that temperature touched 52 degrees Celsius in Saudi Arabia on June 5.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the picture that shows the melted back bumpers of two cars.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The pictures are from Arizona in the United States where the cars melted due to a fire incident. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAFWA did a reverse image search and spotted an article in a local news website of Arizona. As per the report in \"Tucson News Now,\" a fire broke out at a construction site near the University of Arizona on June 19, 2018. The fire damaged around a dozen cars parked nearby.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that it was not extreme heat in Saudi Arabia that melted the cars.", "lang": "en"}
