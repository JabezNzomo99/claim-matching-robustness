This is false: the Hungarian-born US philanthropist was not arrested, as Swiss police and his Open Society Foundations confirmed to AFP.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros was said arrested in Switzerland at 13:23 GMT on Feb. 3 2019,\u201d according to a widely shared, though unsourced, article on the openly editable website Before It\u2019s News. The initial statement is followed by a string of equally unfounded assertions about the details of the billionaire\u2019s arrest, including claims that former US president Obama disclosed the information that led to Soros\u2019 arrest.\n\nThe original article, published on the day of Soros\u2019 purported arrest, was not only shared 1,400 times on Facebook, according to social media monitoring tool Crowdtangle, but it also served as the source for further disinformation. A YouTube video viewed 375,000 times at the time of publication, and several other websites spread the false information, citing the Before It\u2019s News article as their only source. Soon, online users were sharing the information in Spanish, French, and Portuguese.\n\nGeorge Soros, the founder of the Open Society Foundations, a grantmaking organization that supports civil society groups worldwide, is regularly the target of disinformation, including false claims that he financed the migrant caravan headed to the US border in late 2018. Over the past year alone, the author of the Before It\u2019s News story wrote four unsourced stories about the billionaire investor.\n\nBefore It\u2019s News allows anybody to contribute with no editorial oversight, all authors need is \u201can account and a good story,\u201d according to the website\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page.\n\nHowever, Soros was not arrested in February 2019. \"We are not aware of an arrest involving this person (George Soros) in Switzerland on February 3,\" Thomas Dayer, spokesperson for the Swiss federal police, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThese claims are false,\u201d added Denise Simmons, spokesperson for Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, in an email to AFP.\n\nFurthermore, neither Soros\u2019 personal Twitter account, the Open Society Foundations' Twitter, or the Swiss Federal Police mentioned Soros\u2019 arrest in the past days.", "lang": "en"}
