The Bangla caption, when translated to English, reads, \"Home Minister Amit Shah visited a hospital to check on Coronavirus infected patients and support the doctors.\"\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the image was not clicked after the outbreak of COVID-19 as no one including Shah can be seen wearing hazmat suit or masks, which is mandatory while interacting with any patient infected with the virus.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search and found that the photograph is originally from 2015, when Shah was in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, to inaugurate an eye hospital. Shah tweeted a set of four images from the inauguration of the Sadguru Seva Trust Eye Hospital, including the viral photo, where he can be seen interacting with medical personnel.", "lang": "en"}
