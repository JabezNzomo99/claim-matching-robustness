Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Recent video of Indian Army stopping the Chinese soldiers from entering the Indian territory. Fact: The same video was found to exist on the internet at least since 2015. So, it is not related to any recent border standoff between the two countries. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. The same video was uploaded by \u2018India Today\u2019 on YouTube in July 2017 with the title \u2013 \u2018Fresh Video Of Faceoff Between India-China\u2019.\n\nBut it was also found that the same video was included in an article published by \u2018NDTV\u2019 in 2015. In the description, it was written \u2013 \u2018This is part of a video of a tense standoff that the Army says took place more than two years ago\u2019. While FACTLY could not independently verify the context and the exact time of the video, it can be concluded that the video is not related to the recent events at the border between the two countries.\n\nTo sum it up, a video taken at least half-a-decade ago is being shared in the context of recent border standoff between India and China.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
