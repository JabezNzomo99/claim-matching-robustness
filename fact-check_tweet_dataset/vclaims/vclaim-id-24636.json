Sachin Tendulkar, the well known former cricket player has now become the victim of Fake News. A post is being shared on Facebook with the claim that Sachin commented on contesting against the Congress in the elections. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Sachin: \u201cIrrespective of the amount of pressure from Modi, I will not fight elections against the Congress party. There is no question of me campaigning for Modi.\u201d Fact: Sachin did not make these comments. No credible source was found which can confirm that the comments were made by Sachin. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the posted comments on Google, it was found that Sachin did not make those comments. Any comments made by Sachin on political parties will be reported by all the major newspapers but nothing was found on the internet. No such comments were also found on his Twitter account.\n\nAlso, similar comments were found to be viral some time back. But then, the comments were against the Congress. At that time, India Today wrote a fact-check article debunking the claim that Sachin opposed Congress requests.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that Sachin Tendulkar did not make comments regarding Modi\u2019s pressure on him. It is a fake post.", "lang": "en"}
