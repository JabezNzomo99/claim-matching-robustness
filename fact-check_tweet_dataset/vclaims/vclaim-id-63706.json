Hence the court has voted against the checking of helmets by traffic police.\n\nNow the court has rejected the helmet checking that was going on in all the states.\n\nAccording to Sagarkumar Jain\u2019s petition, the use of helmet inside the rays of the municipal corporation will not be compulsory for the driver.

On legistlative.gov.in, which is the Govt of India\u2019s Ministry of Law and Justice website, we found a copy of the entire act.\n\nThe guidelines clearly mention: Every person driving or riding (otherwise than in a sidecar, on a motorcycle of any class or description) shall, while in a public place, wear protective headgear conforming to the standards of Bureau of Indian Standards. Explanation\u2014\u201d Protective headgear\u201d means a helmet\n\nHence, we can conclude that the claims are false, and anyone riding or driving a two-wheeler in any public place must wear a helmet.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
