Scott Walker supports taking major actions during a lame-duck session of the Wisconsin Legislature \u2014 a Full Flop from the position he took when he was first elected in 2010.\n\nAs he enters his final weeks in office, the two-term governor has signaled that he generally supports bills adopted by the GOP-controlled Legislature that would weaken the powers of Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who defeated Walker in the November 2018 election, and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats.\n\nThere are also measures that would limit early voting, put lawmakers in charge of litigation aimed at overturning the federal Affordable Care Act and give Republicans more control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state jobs agency.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s lame-duck bills and Walker\u2019s change in position have made national news. They\u2019ve also drawn threats of legal action by liberals and criticism from prominent Republicans calling the move a \"power grab\" and urging Walker not to sign the bills.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2018, four days after the measures won approval from the Legislature during an overnight session, Evers appeared on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press.\" He repeated his call for Walker to veto the lame-duck bills, saying:\n\n\"The entire thing is a mess, it\u2019s a hot mess, and I believe that he should veto the entire package. In fact, at least three or four of the pieces that are in there now, he has vetoed previously. And so, it makes no sense to me.\"\n\nSo, are there three or four provisions in the legislation Walker is now considering that he has vetoed previously?\n\nYes, although they are on more arcane measures, not the ones that have generated the recent controversy.\n\nThe Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, a nonpartisan state agency, identified four provisions in the lame-duck legislation that are similar to four measures Walker vetoed in September 2017 in the 2017-\u201919 state budget.\n\nThat information was requested from the bureau by the office of state Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. Barca\u2019s office then produced a memo on the similarities. That memo was cited to us by Evers\u2019 spokeswoman as evidence to back Evers\u2019 claim.\n\nWe also reviewed a memo on the lame-duck legislation by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, another nonpartisan state agency.\n\nWhat we found is that the lame-duck legislation does contain some provisions that are the same -- or similar to -- provisions Walker previously vetoed.\n\nBut those provisions aren\u2019t the ones in the lame-duck legislation that have caused the big headlines.\n\nEvers said, \"At least three or four of the pieces that are in\" in the Republican lame-duck legislation, Walker \"has vetoed previously.\"\n\nThere are four provisions in the lame-duck bills that Walker has vetoed previously and that would put new requirements or restrictions on the incoming Evers administration.\n\nBut those provisions aren\u2019t the major ones in the lame-duck session that have generated so much controversy and threats of lawsuits.\n\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
