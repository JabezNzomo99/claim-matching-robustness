Rick Scott and the Legislature cynically stripped Florida of its ability to review rates for the law\u2019s rollout, writes in a letter signed by all 10 of the state\u2019s Democratic representatives.\n\nThe letter, which appeals to the federal government to step in on Floridians\u2019 behalf, blames a law at the end of May for refusing to allow the state insurance commissioner to \"negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high.\"\n\nIt asks the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to \"protect Florida consumers \u2014 since Gov. Scott, the Florida Legislature and Insurance Commissioner (Kevin) McCarty will not.\"\n\nDid the governor and state legislators prevent the insurance commissioner from negotiating lower rates and refusing high ones?\n\nLegislators faced a unique challenge during their 60-day session in 2013. Unlike that had laid groundwork to implement the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, Florida had repeatedly refused \u2014 first of the law, then if a new president would offer a reprieve.\n\nBut with the law upheld by the Supreme Court and President Barack Obama back in office, the state was stuck. It had to help with the transition. Now it was also running out of time.\n\nA state Senate in 2013 said it sought a \"rational, reasonable approach.\" State law needed an update to match federal requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The committee sought to do as little as possible.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're in compliance, that we're doing what we're required to do,\" said Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, at a March committee meeting.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act assumed that states would in setting insurance rates, just as Florida had done in the past. It encouraged states to strengthen their rate-setting authority, offering in grant money to help. But it didn\u2019t require that.\n\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation faced a serious time-crunch to get up to speed on a under the law. Legislators offered a compromise. If the federal government wanted to impose new coverage requirements \u2014 well, it could set rates, too.\n\n\"Since the federal government is requiring these additional coverages that will cost more,\" said Sen. Joe Negron, Republican chair of the Affordable Care Act Committee, \"then to me it makes sense for them to be responsible for approving rate increases that are certain to come.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee agreed with this approach at its .\n\n\"I think we're going to find it's going to cost us a lot of money to set rates here in Florida,\" said Sen. Eleanor Sobel. \"... I think we should rely on the federal government.\"\n\nShe expressed confidence the federal government would have a \"greater wealth of knowledge.\"\n\n\"If we have concerns about the rates that the feds do set, then we should work with them,\" she said.\n\nOne hitch she didn\u2019t mention: the federal government didn\u2019t give itself rate-making authority.\n\nWhat resulted was Florida , which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans \u2014 such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval.\n\nSobel now says that wasn\u2019t at all clear at the time.\n\nThe bill earned unanimous support from the Senate Appropriations Committee, then passed the Senate , mostly along party lines. Six senators voted after roll call, including Sobel, who changed her vote from yea to nay.\n\n\"I was reading very quickly. Then I realized this was something that was not good for the people of the state of Florida,\" she said.\n\nThe House vote also mostly followed party lines, with a few Democratic supporters.\n\nGov. Scott expressed the same confidence that the federal government would step in.\n\nWhen he signed the bill into law May 31, he wrote, \"I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The federal government, even under the Affordable Care Act, can\u2019t do what Insurance Commissioner McCarty can do.\n\nFlorida grants its insurance commissioner a range of powers. McCarty can negotiate lower rates with companies. He can refuse rates that the state determines to be too high.\n\nThe federal government can do neither of those things.\n\nOn July 31, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation released projected insurance premiums for policies that will be for sale on the new health insurance marketplaces launching in January 2014 \u2014 premiums it has no authority to review.\n\nThe state estimated in the individual market between 8 percent and 59 percent. (The federal government and consumer groups, we should note, dispute the state's projections, with one group suggesting they're inaccurately and irresponsibly high to discourage Floridians from participating in Obamacare.)\n\nIn a bulleted list, the office noted all of the ways the Affordable Care Act might be driving up costs.\n\nIt didn\u2019t mention McCarty had no power to negotiate or refuse because of the new law.\n\nAnd that matters. A Kaiser Family Foundation found that those states with robust authority to approve or disapprove rates were \"able to extract significant reductions.\"\n\nWhile Florida used the Affordable Care Act as a reason to reduce its rate oversight, most states used the law\u2019s grants . North Carolina reduced a rate increase request with its new authority in 2010 that saved beneficiaries $14.5 million.\n\nThe noted that Maryland used its negotiating power to push rates for next year\u2019s premiums down \"by as much as a third\" from what companies had proposed.\n\nIn the absence of oversight from Florida, the federal government does have some power to protect Florida consumers from outrageous rates \u2014 even if rescind them or otherwise impose penalties.\n\nChief is the new requirement that insurers must spend at least of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates. So, if an insurer filed for a rate increase that granted it profits far beyond the benefits it offered, it would owe consumers a rebate the next year.\n\nSecond, it could refuse to let an insurer sell its product on Florida\u2019s federally run marketplace. But not all insurance will be sold through the marketplace. Meanwhile, the process was supposed to rely on of whether a rate was justified.\n\nLastly, it wields shame. If Florida doesn\u2019t weigh in, the federal government will greater than 10 percent to evaluate whether it\u2019s unreasonable \u2014 a designation the insurer will have to feature on its website.\n\nA letter from Deutch and Florida\u2019s U.S. House Democrats says that the governor and legislators refused to allow the state insurance commissioner to \"negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high.\" They did precisely that, though they argued that the federal government could step in on Florida\u2019s behalf. It turns out, that\u2019s not how it works. Deutch\u2019s claim about the state\u2019s temporarily diminished powers is True.", "lang": "en"}
