As far as we're aware Leave.EU, the campaign group who carried it out, still haven\u2019t published the information you\u2019d need to say whether or not it\u2019s reliable. We\u2019re waiting to hear back from them.\n\nThe Daily Express said this in its report:\n\n\u201cLeave.EU \u2013 which is funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks \u2013 did not provide details of the poll methodology.\n\nBut it insisted it was a \"major polling exercise\" and said the sample size was greater than 4,000.\u201d\n\nA sample size of more than 4,000 people would be relatively large by the standards of many constituency polls, which commonly interview around 500 or 1000 people.\n\nAnd Leave.EU has said:\n\n\u201cOur polling method consists of a high volume randomised sample and the use of sophisticated AI social media techniques developed in the United States by renowned public affairs firm Goddard Gunster\u201d.\n\nBut without knowing things like exactly how the question was pitched, how the poll was carried out, and whether the responses were weighted to make the results representative of the constituency as a whole, we don\u2019t have the information we need to judge for ourselves whether the results are reliable.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted Leave.EU to ask for the things which the British Polling Council, an association of polling organisations, expects its members to publish alongside their results:\n\u2022 Dates when the interviews were carried out\n\u2022 How the interviews were carried out (e.g. in-person, telephone, internet)\n\u2022 The group the poll is trying to represent (e.g. all adults, eligible voters)\n\u2022 The percentages of different responses (including 'don't knows' and refusals)\n\u2022 The number of people who were interviewed and the area the poll covered\n\u2022 How the response of the sample group was \u2018weighted\u2019 to form conclusions about the opinions of the constituency as a whole (i.e. adjusted so that the kinds of people in the sample match up to the population in the constituency)\n\nWe also asked for the complete wording of the question, and whether there was a web address where full results could be viewed.\n\nIf Leave. EU are able to provide us with this information, we\u2019ll be able to judge the reliability of the poll better. Until then, it\u2019s not possible to say.", "lang": "en"}
