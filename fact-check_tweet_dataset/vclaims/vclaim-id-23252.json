The claim is misleading; the photo actually shows a local flight operated by Indonesia\u2019s flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, which has a code share with China Airlines, Taiwan\u2019s carrier; Indonesian law stipulates that all domestic flights must be operated by Indonesian-owned airlines.\n\nThis June 13, 2019, Facebook post contains a screenshot of a Google result for \"Jakarta to Makassar by Air China\", and another screenshot of an image of a flight departure board with a China Airlines flight underlined.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared more than 480 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Indonesian language caption translates to English as: \u201cQuietly China Airlines has served Jakarta-Makassar starting Wednesday, June 12, 2019. The result of work and work. I am Indonesia, I am Pancasila, the Republic of Indonesia is the final price. The result>>> Indochina. Garuda, Lion and other planes battered by their own master.\u201d\n\nThe claim appeared on social media days after President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo floated an idea to allow foreign carriers to operate domestic flights in a bid to lower air ticket prices during an interview published here by Indonesian online news site Kumparan on May 29, 2019.\n\nIndonesian regulations stipulate that carriers operating local routes have to be wholly or majority owned by an Indonesian legal entity or an Indonesian citizen. This is stated in Article 108, paragraph 2 of Indonesia\u2019s 2009 Aviation Law No. 1, which can be seen in this document downloaded from the website of the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, part of the Ministry of Transportation.\n\nChina Airlines\u2019 Flight CI 9798 is actually a code share with Garuda Indonesia\u2019s Flight GA 612 from Jakarta to Makassar.\n\nAFP entered the code \u201cGA 612\u201d in flightstats.com -- a flight-tracking website -- and found that the Garuda Indonesia flight is also marketed as CI 9798 of China Airlines, which serves as a codeshare airline.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the details for flight GA 612 on flightstats.com with the codeshare details circled in red:\n\nCode sharing, according to this page from the United States Department of Transportation\u2019s website, is \u201ca marketing arrangement in which an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline, and sells tickets for that flight.\u201d\n\nOn its website, China Airlines lists Garuda Airlines as one of its code-share airlines.\n\nAFP searched \u201cGA 0612\u201d and \u201cCI 9798\u201d on a flight information service available on the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport website.\n\nThey show the same destination, departing time and departure gate. The GA 612 flight, however, has a check-in counter listed, but not the CI 9798.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the two searches:", "lang": "en"}
