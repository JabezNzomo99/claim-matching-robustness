There is, however, no evidence that Trump ever said this.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here , and here .\n\nThe claim likely alludes to a set of conspiracy theories by QAnon, a fringe group popular among some Trump supporters that claims \u201cdeep-state\u201d traitors are plotting against the President ( here ). QAnon\u2019s theories often allude to a \u201csecret campaign\u201d being waged by Trump against \u201ca child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,\u201d according to Time ( here ).\n\nThe posts come after Twitter permanently suspended accounts that violate its policies while tweeting about QAnon ( here ).\n\nIn 2019, while speaking with law enforcement officials in the White House about the need for funding for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump talked about increased rates of human trafficking. During the meeting on February 11, 2019, Trump said, \u201cpeople think of that as an ancient art. There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers they call them, than at any time in the history of our world because of the internet unfortunately.\u201d ( here, see 3:52 mark ).\n\nA White House transcript of the event shows only one reporter asked a question about a potential government shutdown ( here ), though C-SPAN video appears to show the session ending without any questions at all ( here).\n\nIn the same speech, Trump spoke about the alleged offenses committed by migrants, alluding to data compiled by the Department of Homeland Security. These are the most similar remarks to those in the social posts that Reuters could find. However, at no point did Trump refer to an \u201cancient sex trafficking ring\u201d.\n\nTrump made similar remarks about a month earlier in a signing ceremony for Anti-Human Trafficking Legislation (here). \"You would think [human trafficking] was an ancient form of criminality. It's not. It's a very modern-day form,\" Trump said. He then fielded questions from the press on the government shutdown and on declaring a national emergency.\n\nOn January 31, 2020 Trump delivered remarks at the White House Summit on Human Trafficking on the 20th Anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act ( here ).\n\nIn a few instances Trump alluded specifically to sex trafficking and said that his administration shut down the leading site for online sex trafficking, enacted bills to fight sex trafficking, authorized $430 million to fight sex and labor trafficking, and worked internationally to address child sexual abuse ( here ).\n\nThere were no questions at the conclusion of this address. The event was covered widely by national media outlets ( here , here ).\n\nBloomberg reported that some victim-advocacy groups \u201ccriticized the president\u2019s record on the issue and declined to attend a White House ceremony.\u201d ( here )\n\nOn July 21, 2020 Trump said that he wished alleged sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell well, noting that he had met her multiple times in the past, but he had little else to say on the case involving the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump, speaking at his first coronavirus briefing in weeks, was asked if he thought Maxwell would \u201cturn in powerful men\u201d following her arrest, given that she was the longtime associate of Epstein and was his alleged co-conspirator.\n\n\u201cI just wish her well, frankly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve met her numerous times over the years \u2014 especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach \u2014 but I wish her well, whatever it is.\u201d\n\nMaxwell, 58, has denied charges that she lured underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse and has pleaded not guilty. A U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan denied bail at a hearing in July, saying the wealthy socialite posed a flight risk ( here ).\n\nNo remarks related to \u201can ancient sex trafficking ring\u201d appear on Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline, nor do results from searches for posts with similar wording. No news outlets reported that Trump tweeted this.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, there are no deleted tweets mentioning \u201can ancient sex trafficking ring\u201d from Trump\u2019s page ( here ).\n\nFalse. There is no evidence that Trump said the government was fighting \u201can ancient sex trafficking ring.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
