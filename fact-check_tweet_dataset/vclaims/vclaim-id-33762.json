That\u2019s what a viral photo circulating on Facebook appears to show.\n\nNo, Stefanik did not flip the bird during or after at the hearing. The image has been manipulated.\n\nThe image looks as if Stefanik, who represents New York\u2019s 21st district, is using the hand gesture while her colleagues stand in the background.\n\n\"US Representative Elise Stafanik and an \u2018always trumper\u2019 gives bird finger to the Democrats at the trump impeachment hearing. Classy!\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe consulted with FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, which showed evidence that the image was altered to include the gesture. What\u2019s more, the viral photo shows a raised finger with dark red fingernail polish on it. Photos taken by the Associated Press during the Nov. 15 hearing at which this altered picture was supposedly taken show Stefanik was not wearing such a color on her nails.\n\nThe manipulated version of the photo gained traction online after it was posted in a now-deleted tweet on Nov. 16. When it was pointed out that the photo was fake, the Twitter user, Brian J. O\u2019Malley, deleted the tweet, acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Stefanik.\n\nStefanik did draw attention during the impeachment hearings, especially during the Nov. 15 testimony of former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Stefanik accused House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff of trying to undermine Republicans when he interrupted her line of questioning.\n\nStefanik may have voiced her displeasure at the hearing, but there is no evidence she used this vulgar hand gesture. We rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
