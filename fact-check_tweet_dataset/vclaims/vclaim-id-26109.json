Indeed, as expected, this news proved controversial. Dearborn\u2019s 200 billion dollar Allah Just\u2019ava\u2019nosh Mosque was surrounded by protesters, and the phone lines were jammed with angry potato pancakes. County Pastor Johnathan Regarp tried to calm the crowd down.\n\nOf course, Michigan doesn\u2019t have a 109th congressional district (it has 14 congressional districts, total). Nor does it have a so-called \u201cAllah Just\u2019ava\u2019nosh Mosque\u201d in Dearborn, or a county commissioner named Art Tubolls (both are obviously made-up names, the latter an anagram of the equally faux \u201cBusta Troll\u201d).\n\nThese wacky faux details reveal not only that the story is a fabrication, but also that it was generated by the same online trolling operation responsible for cranking out scores of so-called \u201csatirical\u201d articles like it before.\n\nThe Last Line of Defense, which publishes clickbait junk new articles calculated to inflame the sensibilities of conservatives, is part of a network of several such sites (including Reagan Was Right, Freedum Junkshun, and Daily World Update).\n\nThe present example plays on the fears of those who are convinced that Islam is a threat to Western Civilization and intent on destroying America from within through a program of \u201ccreeping sharia.\u201d Dearborn, Michigan has often (and falsely) been cited as an example of a U.S. city taken over by Muslims.\n\nA disclaimer on The Last Line of Defense reads as follows:\n\nEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.", "lang": "en"}
