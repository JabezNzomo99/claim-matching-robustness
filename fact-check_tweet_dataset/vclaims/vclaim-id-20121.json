The incident happened on February 19, 2019 and the pilot in the video is Wing Commander Vijay Shelke.\n\nThe video was viral after the crash too as a local student was seen speaking to the pilot and comforting him minutes after the crash and everything captured on video.\n\nIt was also widely covered by media outlets and the other person in the video speaking to the IAF pilot was also interviewed.
