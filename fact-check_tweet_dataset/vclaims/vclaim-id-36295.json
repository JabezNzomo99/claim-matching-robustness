One iteration has been liked more than 3,000 times on Instagram.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders told Pete Buttigieg in private 2018 meeting that a \u2018rat-faced little baby\u2019 can\u2019t win presidency, sources say,\u201d reads the headline of the alleged story. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Say The US Has \u2018Had Enough With White Men In Places Of Power\u2019?)\n\nThough the image claims to show a CNN article about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders insulting South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in 2018, no such article actually exists. A search of CNN\u2019s website didn\u2019t turn up any media reports with the headline shown in the post. It appears to be a doctored version of a real article.\n\nThe original story, published Jan. 13, detailed a December 2018 meeting between Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in which Sanders allegedly told her that a woman couldn\u2019t win the presidency. It cited the accounts of two people Warren spoke to \u201cdirectly soon after the encounter\u201d and two people \u201cfamiliar with the meeting.\u201d\n\nSanders has vehemently denied making the remark and accused Warren campaign staffers of \u201clying\u201d about the meeting.", "lang": "en"}
