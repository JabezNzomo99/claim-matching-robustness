(We checked Kriseman's statements here and here.) In this fact-check, we\u2019re looking at Foster\u2019s claim about the unemployment rate.\n\nComparing the city\u2019s unemployment rate with the state average is tricky.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out monthly reports with unemployment data for the country, state and metro areas. Using this data to compare cities with their home states is a little bit like analyzing apples and oranges. Why? The national and state data is adjusted for the season, but the metro data is not.\n\nThe distinction between adjusted data and unadjusted data is important in Florida, where the economy is hugely susceptible to seasonal swings, economists told us. Think of the snowbirds who come to our state during the cooler months each year. They seek out services, pack restaurants, buy goods and visit the beach -- an annual economic stimulus.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t just affect tourism jobs,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. \"That affects everything.\"\n\nThat factor and others, such as teachers taking off for the summer, contribute to the state\u2019s unadjusted employment rate typically ticking up in the summer months. When seasonal forces are factored in, the unemployment rate is smoothed out.\n\nCities do not get the same treatment, left only with the less precise, unadjusted figure.\n\nWith that disclaimer, we\u2019ll move ahead with the check using labor mostly from BLS.\n\n* From state Department of Economic Opportunity. NSA = Not seasonally adjusted, SA = Seasonally adjusted\n\nSo the state\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August, the most recent month available, was 7 percent and the unadjusted rate is 7.1 percent.\n\nThe BLS did not release unemployment data for metro areas and cities as scheduled on Oct. 2 due to the government shutdown. The bureau\u2019s most recent, public estimate for St. Petersburg\u2019s unemployment rate is for July 2013, when the (unadjusted) rate was 7.4 percent. That\u2019s even with Florida\u2019s unadjusted rate for July and larger than its adjusted rate.\n\nWe checked in with the state\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity, which feeds some economic data to the BLS, before calling Foster\u2019s claim inaccurate. According to DEO, the city\u2019s unemployment rate for August was 6.9 percent -- a smidgen lower than the state\u2019s unadjusted and adjusted rates for that month.\n\nThe city\u2019s unemployment rate was actually lower than the state\u2019s, by either measure, for most of 2013.\n\nWe asked our experts to point to better data, but they said this home survey-based data is the best we have. Residents are asked if they are working and, if not, whether they are looking for work. The government uses the data to crank out assessments for the national, state and local levels.\n\n\"At the state level, they\u2019re estimates,\" said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. \"So when you get down to the smaller and smaller geographies, the availability and timeliness of data both begin to wane.\"\n\nA declining unemployment rate is not necessarily a completely positive measure of the economy, PolitiFact Florida has . Florida has a problem with discouraged workers being out of the workforce for a long time and eventually dropping out of the labor force. These workers are no longer reflected in the unemployment rate, which is a ratio of the number of workers versus the number of available workers.\n\nFor example, Florida\u2019s unemployment rate fell steeply from December 2011 to July 2013, from 9.4 percent to 7.1 percent. If the labor force had remained the same in July as it was a year and a half earlier, the real unemployment rate would have been 8.2 percent, according to an August 2013 report by the Legislature\u2019s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The report found that about half of the reason for the drop is due to people leaving the labor force or putting off joining it.\n\nA similar analysis has not been completed at the city level.\n\nFoster did not return our call seeking comment.\n\nSt. Petersburg\u2019s unemployment rate is a little bit better than the state average, according to the most recent data we have from the state and federal government. It\u2019s been the case for most of the year. Is it substantially better? No. And experts cautioned that the numbers we have are not the best. Still, they\u2019re the best we have.
