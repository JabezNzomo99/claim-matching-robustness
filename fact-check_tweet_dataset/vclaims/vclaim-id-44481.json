No such incident has been reported by the Palace nor by the media.\n\nBearing the fake, clickbait headline, \u201cSasakyan ni President DU30 Pinagbabaril ng Dalawang Riding in Tandem.Mga Suspek Patay (President DU30\u2019s vehicle shot at by two riding in tandem. Suspects killed),\u201d website cnnupdates.ml misled viewers by using as its content a video of the aftermath of a March 4 shooting incident involving actress Kim Chiu.\n\nYouTube channel kassie vlog uploaded the nearly-seven-minute clip the same day the crime happened where two unidentified gunmen aboard a motorcycle fired shots at Chiu\u2019s van while she was on her way to work. The video was first published online by YouTube channel Team Ramento Vlogs.\n\nCnnupdates.ml\u2019s fabricated report features the same duplicitous elements present in past hoaxes debunked by VERA Files, including a video that stops playing after a few seconds, a prompt for readers to share the video \u201cto continue watching,\u201d and a layout that copies the format of a Facebook post.\n\nSimilar to its past scam stories, the site\u2019s report is undated, only having a time stamp that reads \u201c1 hr ago\u201d which does not change even while refreshing the page.\n\nFinally, an inspection of the site raises red flags on its credibility as a source of information.\n\nCnnupdates.ml\u2019s homepage leads to a blank page, while its About Us page shows only a vague one-liner. The Contact Us page does not provide any useful contact information where a reader could reach the website\u2019s creators, while its \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d page only contains placeholder text.\n\nThe fake report came two weeks after the National Bureau of Investigation arrested public school teacher Ronnel Mas, who tweeted that he will give P50 million to anyone who can kill Duterte.\n\nA look at FB interactions on the post\u2019s link via social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle suggests that the link has been recycled and used in past hoaxes.", "lang": "en"}
