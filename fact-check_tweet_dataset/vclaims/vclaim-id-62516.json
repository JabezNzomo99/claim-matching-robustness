The caption reads, \u201cClass leader Hillary Rodham of Wellesley College talking about student protests which she supported in her commencement speech.\u201d\n\nClinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969, and excerpts from her commencement address were featured in the June 20 issue of Life magazine that year, along with photos of student speakers. Only one of Balterman\u2019s photos of Clinton appeared in the issue, but others \u2013 including the one in the Facebook post \u2013 were later published, according to Life.\n\nThere is, however, no Confederate flag in the original image, indicating that version shared on Facebook has been digitally manipulated. Other photos from the same collection also show no Confederate flag in the bookcase behind Clinton.

In late 2019, the Daily Caller debunked an image that was manipulated to make it look like she had been photographed shaking hands with former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.", "lang": "en"}
