This is the amount the UK would owe the EU after Brexit to cover its outstanding financial commitments to the EU (things like commitments to pay into the EU budget until 2020).\n\nThe latest estimate puts the total divorce bill slightly lower, at \u00a333 billion (\u20ac36 billion), assuming the UK departs on 31 October this year.\n\nThe UK and EU agreed on the \u201cthe scope of commitments\u201d of a divorce bill in December 2017. In November 2018, the UK and EU set out a draft withdrawal agreement which reaffirmed the UK\u2019s commitment to paying a divorce bill.\n\nUntil the UK parliament approves that draft withdrawal agreement, the divorce bill is not binding. (It has so far rejected the withdrawal agreement three times).\n\nThis is presumably what Mr Johnson is referring to when he says \u201cstrictly speaking\u201d the divorce bill would no longer be owed if we left with no deal. The withdrawal agreement\u2014 which sets out the UK\u2019s commitment to pay\u2014will not be binding in this scenario.\n\nThat would be far from the end of the story, though.\n\nIt\u2019s highly uncertain whether or not the UK would have to pay the divorce bill if we left the EU with no deal on 31 October 2019.\n\nExperts at UK in a Changing Europe told us in February that, under international law, it\u2019s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe grounds for this would be the UK\u2019s repeated commitments to pay\u2014this was set out most importantly in the Joint Report of December 2017, which set out principles on a number of issues in the negotiations.\n\nThe Institute for Government think tank believes that the outcome of such a court case would be hard to predict.\n\nIn addition, UK in a Changing Europe told us earlier this year that the UK might consider the reputational damage that might be caused by not paying. For example, not paying the bill might cause other states with whom the UK is negotiating trade deals, to question the value of the UK\u2019s word in negotiations.", "lang": "en"}
