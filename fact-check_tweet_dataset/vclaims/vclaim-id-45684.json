With mass gatherings cancelled in the state of Mississippi, Reverend Larry Duncan was facing the sad prospect of not having anyone at his weekend service, at Salem Baptist Church, in Lake. But as he walked into the church, on April 11, Larry was met with a beautiful sight. In front of him he found 98 different photographs each depicting the face of a regular attendee.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the genuine video on the church\u2019s Facebook page (R):\n\nThe church also posted the video on its YouTube channel here on April 13, 2020.\n\nThe church also posted a photo of the same event here on April 12, 2020.\n\nThe display of the congregants\u2019 photos at the church was reported here by Christian online news outlet Faithwire.com on April 14, 2020.\n\nThe church\u2019s online Easter service was posted here on April 12, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
