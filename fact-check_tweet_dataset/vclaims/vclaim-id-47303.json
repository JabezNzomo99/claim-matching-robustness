No, that's not true: the story was put out by The Babylon Bee, a well-known and often quite funny satire website. So far, the story has received about half a million engagements on Facebook, many of them from smart people who understood it to be a joke.\n\nBut for the people who thought it was real - or who saw it being repeated on some foreign-run fake news site that stole it and presented it as real news - it is not true.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by The Babylon Bee on January 3, 2020, titled \"Democrats Call For Flags To Be Flown At Half-Mast To Grieve Death Of Soleimani\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.--At a press conference held on Capitol Hill Friday, mourning Democrat leaders called for flags to be flown half-mast to honor the death of Qasem Soleimani. Flags were spotted flying at half-mast around the country, notably at The Washington Post, The New York Times, and in front of several celebrities' homes. The celebrities went out and bought an American flag for the first time just to fly it at half-mast for this important time of grief. \"The grieving process is painful but necessary,\" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. \"As a nation, we need to stop and grieve this great, austere, revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones.\"\n\nThe \"austere religious scholar\" bit was mocking a Washington Post headline from a few weeks ago:\n\nThe satirical story was stolen by at least two foreign-run fake news sites already:\n\n\"The Babylon Bee\" comes with following dislaimer on the about page:\n\nWhat is The Babylon Bee?\n\nThe Babylon Bee is the world's best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims.
