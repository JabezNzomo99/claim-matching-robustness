Some on the team had knelt at a game the previous month after President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that team owners fire players who don\u2019t stand during the song.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not true that Philadelphia police officers took a knee against the Redskins after the game and refused to escort the team to their bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d Officer Tanya Little, spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Police Department told us in a phone interview. \u201cThat did not occur.\u201d\n\nThe photo of Philadelphia police officers that is shown with the story is actually from 2016, when volunteers at a mosque cooked breakfast for officers who were working during the Puerto Rican Day parade. The officer in the foreground of the picture is dancing, not getting ready to kneel.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cCOPS TAKE A KNEE THEN WALK OUT ON REDSKINS LEAVING THEM STRANDED IN THEIR LOCKER ROOM OVERNIGHT.\u201d universaleinfo.com.
