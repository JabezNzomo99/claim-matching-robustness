(Read our story here)\n\nBOOM decided to fact-check the info-graphic based on publicly available data. While we realize that the graphic was made as a hasty rebuttal and plays on Indian news TV channels' obsession with superlatives, our analysis shows that although Kerala ranks highly in a number of crucial parameters it does not always top the charts.\n\nCLAIM 1 : No. 1 state in literacy in India\n\nFact : True. Kerala is the most literate state in the country.\n\nKerala ranked first with literacy rates of 94% in 2011 and 90.9% in 2001.\n\nIn contrast, India\u2019s literacy rate was 74% in 2011 and 64.8% in 2001.\n\nLiteracy is broadly defined as the ability to read and write with understanding in any language.\n\nCLAIM 2: No. 1 state in health indexes in India\n\nLife Expectancy: Kerala had the highest life expectancy of 74.9 years among Indian states between 2010-14. Life expectancy for the entire country was at 67.9 years during the corresponding period.\n\nInfant Mortality Rate: Between 2011 to 2013 Kerala had the least number of infant deaths in India with an infant mortality rate of 12 out of 1,000 live births in each of those years. Infant mortality rate of India during the corresponding period was 44 (2011), 42 (2012) and 40 (2013)\n\nMaternal Mortality Rate: Kerala recorded the lowest maternal deaths of 61 per 1,00,000 live births according to the maternal mortality report of 2011 to 2013. The corresponding number for India was 167 deaths per 1,00,000 live births.\n\nNiti Aayog plans to introduce a \u2018Performance on Health Outcomes\u2019 Index for states by September 2017 which shall account for many more health indicators.\n\nCLAIM 3 : No. 1 state in human life indexes in India\n\nIf the intended claim was about the Human Development Index (HDI), Kerala had an HDI score of 0.91 which was the highest in India, in 2011-12, according to the latest available data. Kerala is followed by Goa with a score of 0.803 during the same year.\n\nHuman development index is a composite index that accounts for factors such as education, health and per capita income of the population.\n\nCLAIM 4 : No. 1 state in gender equality in India\n\nFact: False. There is no official indicator to measure gender equality in India but a Mckinsey report ranked Kerala third in female empowerment.\n\nConsultancy firm Mckinsey developed a news score called Femdex \u2013 Female Empowerment Index in its report, \u2018The Power Of Parity: Advancing Women\u2019s Equality\u2019, in November 2015.\n\nMizoram topped the list with a score of 0.7 out of 1 followed by Meghalaya with 0.69. Kerala stood 3rd with a Femdex score of 0.67. India's overall score was 0.54.\n\nThe index considers 10 indicators that measures gender parity and women empowerment which includes labour force participation, women leadership, maternal mortality rate, sex ratio, child marriage etc.\n\nCLAIM 5 : No. 1 state in sex ratio in India\n\nFact: Mostly true. Kerala has the best sex ratio, but only the 7th best child sex ratio in India.\n\nAccording to Census of India, the sex ratio and child sex ratio of Kerala and India is as follows:\n\nSex ratio is the number of females per 1000 males of the population. Child sex ratio is the number of girls per 1000 boys aged 0-6 years.\n\nThough Kerala has the best sex ratio in the country, in terms of child sex ratio Kerala stood 7th in 2011. Mizoram (971) stood 1st, followed by Meghalaya (970).\n\nCLAIM 6: No. 1 state in primary education in India\n\nFact: There is no overall ranking for primary education in India\n\nHowever, in the Educational Development Index 2014-15 for primary level, Kerala ranked 36th in the component of Access, 8th in Infrastructure, 4th in Teacher and 30th in Outcome among 35 states and union territories in India.\n\nRefer to the table below which lists indicators used in computing the Educational Development Index.\n\nCLAIM 7 : No. 1 state in lowest child death rate in India\n\nFact: True.

The corresponding figures for India was 29 and 55.\n\nCLAIM 8 : No. 1 state in lowest pregnant mothers death in India\n\nFact: There are no statistics for death of pregnant women.\n\n\u2018Death of pregnant mothers\u2019 is a vague statement which could include deaths of pregnant women out of reasons other than complications related to pregnancy and child birth.\n\nHowever, Kerala has the lowest maternal mortality deaths in the country. Maternal mortality ratio gives the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.\n\nKerala has the lowest maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in India, according to a Lok Sabha Question in March 2017.\n\nCLAIM 9 : No. 1 state in transgender rights in India\n\nFact: True.

The study covered 20 states. The study found that in Kerala and Himachal Pradesh, households experienced corruption in single digits \u2013 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nFact: False.

Kerala was 7th most preferred destination for foreign tourists in India with a share of 4.2%.\n\nKerala was not among the top ten destinations for domestic tourists in 2015. Tamil Nadu had the highest share of domestic tourists (23.3%) in the year 2015 followed by Uttar Pradesh with 14.3%.\n\nCLAIM 12: No. 1 state in foreign remittance in India\n\nFact: True.

Kerala (87%) stands 7th in terms of habitation coverage.\n\n\u2018Habitation is a cluster of population, living in an area, the location of which does not change over time\u2019 and as recorded by the 2001 census.\n\nCLAIM 14: No 1. state in human rights in India\n\nFact: We are not exactly sure what was intended by the claim\n\nHowever, number of human rights violations registered in states with Human Rights Commission could shed light on the situation.\n\nRate of human rights violations refers to the number of such cases registered against 1,00,000 population (as of Census 2011).\n\nIn 2016-17, Nagaland (0.61) recorded the least rate of human rights violation, followed by Sikkim and Assam, according to a Lok Sabha Question in March 2017.\n\nRate of human rights violations registered in Kerala was 2.01 in 2016-17 (according to data till March 5, 2017) and 2.99 in 2015-16.\n\nDelhi (35.32) followed by Uttar Pradesh (20.14) in 2016-17 had the highest rates of human rights violations.\n\nCLAIM 15: No. 1 state in religious tolerance in India\n\nFact: False.

Except Jammu & Kashmir, all states implement the Right To Education\n\nAccording to The Right Of Children To Free And Compulsory Education Act (RTE), 2009, every child of the age of 6 -14 years has a right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood government school till completion of elementary education (Ist to VIIIth grade). It extends to the entire country, except for Jammu and Kashmir. According to a Lok Sabha question, all states other than Jammu and Kashmir are implementing RTE Act, 2009.\n\nAlso, only 45% of school going children of the age 6-14 go to government schools in rural Kerala. The number is the highest for Tripura (89.1%) followed by Odisha (88.9%) and Gujarat (87.4%), according to Annual Status of Education Report 2016 by Pratham. It is a rural household survey on children\u2019s schooling status and outcomes.\n\nCLAIM 17: No. 1 state for free health care for all in India\n\nFact: Sikkim and not Kerala had the highest per capita health expenditure by a state in 2014-15 and 2013-14.\n\nKerala spent Rs. 1437 and Rs. 1033 per person on heath in 2014-15 and 2013-14, respectively, according to National Health Profile released by Central Bureau of Health Intelligence. Among Indian states, Sikkim (Rs. 5,666) spent the highest followed by Arunachal Pradesh (Rs. 5,196) 2013-14. In the same year, Bihar (Rs. 530) spent the least.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that despite not having the highest per capita health expenditure, Kerala still leads in major health indices.\n\nCLAIM 18: Only state in India which is open defecation free\n\nFact: False. Kerala is one of the four states to be counted as open defecation free.\n\nHimachal Pradesh, Kerala, Sikkim and Uttarakhand are open defecation free, according to Swachh Bharat Mission dashboard citing data as of June 16, 2017.\n\nCLAIM 19: Only state in India to have electricity in all houses\n\nFact: False. Four other states have achieved 100% household electrification but Kerala is within a whisker at 99.9%.\n\nAndhra Pradesh, Goa, Punjab and Tamil Nadu are the states with 100% household electrification. These states are followed by Kerala with 99.9% of its households electrified. According to GARV Dashboard, out of 71,03,179 households in Kerala 70,97,455 are electrified with remaining 5,724 households yet to be electrified.\n\nCLAIM 20 : Only Indian state mentioned in National Geographic Channel's \u2013 'must watch in a life time' list\n\nFact : Though Kerala was the only state mentioned in National Geographic\u2019s \u2018 50 Places of a Lifetime' , the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri and Delhi were also listed.\n\nFact: False. Kerala saw eight communal riots in 2015 and six in 2014, according to National Crime Records.\n\nIn 2015, India saw a total of 789 communal riots, with Haryana (201) recording the highest number. In 2014, it was a total of 1227 with the most communal riots in Jharkand (249).\n\nFact : According to National Crime Records, the number of cases recorded under Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 for crimes against Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes are 1 and 0, respectively in 2015.\n\nProtection of Civils Rights Act, 1955 is, \u2018An Act to prescribe punishment for the (Preaching and Practice of \u201cUntouchability\u201d) for the enforcement of any disability arising there from and for matters connected therewith\u2019.\n\nMoreover, only 2% of respondents in from Kerala practiced untouchability, according to Indian Human Development Survey 2 ( IHDS 2011 -12) conducted by National Council of Applied Economic Research and University of Maryland, United States. The survey was extended to around 42,000 households in India. As per the survey, 53% of respondents from Madhya Pradhesh practised untouchability, 50% in Himachal Pradesh. The least occurrence of untouchability was in West Bengal (1%).\n\nFact: Kerala recorded a higher rate of crime against Dalits under the Prevention of Atrocities Act than the national crime rate of 19.2.\n\nThough the perception is that Dalit oppression is less heard of in Kerala, according to National Crime Records Kerala recorded a crime rate of 22.9 against Scheduled Caste population under the Prevention of Atrocities Act (POA) in 2015. The national crime rate was 19.2.\n\nThe states with highest rate of crimes under POA are Goa (51.1) and Rajasthan (48.4), while the states of Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram recorded nil.\n\nHere, crime rate refers to the incidence of crime against 1,00,000 of SC population recorded under Prevention of Atrocities Act. However, a high crime rate could also be due to better reporting, registering and policing in states.\n\nPrevention of Atrocities Act is meant to 'prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes'.\n\nCLAIM 24: No death in name of cow\n\nFACT: True. While protests over cattle slaughter and consumption of beef have been in the headlines lately, there have been no reported deaths in Kerala due to it.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with correct literacy rates of Kerala and India according to data from MOSPI.
