However, it uses doctored photos to support its claim. The ANC told us it had no record of the donations mentioned in the meme.\n\nThe post, which we\u2019ve archived here, shows two images of Theron, one behind a podium that reads \u201cBlack Rights Campaign\u201d and another in which she\u2019s seen wearing what looks like a supporter\u2019s t-shirt depicting the face of Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party.\n\nThe same meme can also be found in a vulgar tweet posted on March 12, 2018. The account has since been suspended.\n\nA reverse image search of the meme returned very few results. However, cropping each image out of the collage and running a fresh reverse search revealed that both pictures of Theron are doctored versions of photos taken in 2012.\n\nThe first shows her speaking at a Human Rights Campaign event in Los Angeles. In the meme, it\u2019s been edited to replace the \u201cHuman Rights Campaign\u201d sign with a \u201cBlack Rights Campaign\u201d one.\n\nThe second photo was taken as part of Theron\u2019s campaigning work against HIV. In the meme, her t-shirt was digitally altered to replace the logo of her Africa Outreach Project with a picture of Malema, and the sign to replace the HIV message with a \u201cblack power\u201d clenched fist.\n\nOur next step was to try to figure out if the newspaper article that appears between the two images was genuine. A reverse image search linked it to a 2014 tweet by a former South African actress, but few other leads.\n\nWe then tried a text search for \u201cCharlize Theron ANC donor\u201d and other related terms, such as \u201cCharlize Theron funds ANC\u201d and \u201cCharlize Theron funds EFF\u201d . They yielded no online versions of the article that appears in the meme, and surprisingly few other related results for a claim involving a high-profile actress and major South African political parties.\n\nThe only similar news article was this short post in Afrikaans, published on March 28, 2013, which cited the same alleged donation figures as the article used in the meme. It gave no source for this information.\n\nWe contacted Theron\u2019s representatives, the ANC and the EFF to ask about the claims made in the meme. Theron\u2019s representatives in Los Angeles, as well as the EFF, have yet to get back to us.\n\nHowever, ANC spokesman Dakota Legeota told AFP that he had inquired with the party\u2019s treasurer-general Paul Mashatile and the ANC Women\u2019s League and they were unaware of the donations mentioned in the meme.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have knowledge of that money, I\u2019ve even checked with the women\u2019s league,\u201d said Legoete.\n\nTheron is discreet about her political views and we were unable to find any public declaration of support for any South African political party including the ANC, which has governed since the end of apartheid.\n\nShe met Nelson Mandela in 2004 and has spoken of how how he influenced her campaigning work combating HIV. She also met then-president Jacob Zuma in 2013 to discuss the fight against the disease.\n\nShe has expressed concern over racism in the United States where she is raising two black children, both of them adopted.", "lang": "en"}
