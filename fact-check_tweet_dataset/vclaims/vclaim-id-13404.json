This article is a fact check of these claims.\n\nIs there a distinct focus on learning outcomes for the first time?\n\n The first claim is that for the first time, there is a distinct focus on learning outcomes among students and accountability among various stakeholders.\n\n\u2018Learning outcomes are assessment standards indicating the expected levels of learning that children should achieve for the class they are studying in. These outcomes can be used as check points to assess learning levels at different points of time. The learning outcomes would help teachers to understand the learning levels of children in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Learning outcomes should be the point of reference for conducting achievement surveys.\u2019 This is the definition of learning outcomes according to the \u2018Learning Outcomes at Elementary Stage\u2019 document that is available on the MHRD website.\n\nAccording to this response of the government in the Lok Sabha in March 2017, \u2018the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) in its meeting held in October 2016 has agreed that Learning Outcomes be codified and made a part of Central Rules of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. Accordingly, the Department of School Education & Literacy has amended Rule 23(2)(c) of Central RTE Rules, 2010, vide notification dated 20th February, 2017 to include class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes for all Elementary Classes and link achieving the defined Learning Outcomes with Continuous & Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE).\u2019\n\nThe \u2018Learning Outcomes at Elementary Stages\u2019 document points out that, \u2018the National Policy on Education (NPE) 1986, revised in 1992 and the Programme of Action(PoA) 1992 emphasised that the Minimum Levels of Learning (MLLs) should be laid down and children\u2019s learning should periodically be assessed to keep a track of their progress towards ensuring the achievement of NPE goal that \u2018all children should acquire at least minimum levels of learning\u2019. The MLLs developed class-wise and subject-wise for primary stage in 1992 in the form of competencies were highly product-oriented and had a limited scope for assessment of the overall development of children.\u2019 This implies that the idea of incorporating learning outcomes is not new but the adaptation of it is. The same document also states that the learning outcomes defined explicitly can guide and ensure the responsibility and accountability of different stakeholders for its accomplishment by expectations in different curricular areas.\n\nHow many Atal tinkering labs have been sanctioned?\n\n The second claim is that for building innovative skills, 2400 Atal tinkering labs were sanctioned in schools at 20 lakh rupees each.\n\nAccording to the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) website, \u2018Atal Tinkering Labs are dedicated work spaces where students (Class 6th to Class 12th) learn innovation skills and develop ideas that will go on to transform India. The labs are powered to acquaint students with state-of-the-art equipment such as 3D printers, robotics & electronics development tools, IoT & sensors etc.\u2019\n\nThe AIM website also shows that, across the country, as of November 2018, there are 2441 schools where Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL) has been set up. In response to a question in the Lok Sabha in March 2017, the government stated that each school selected for setting of an ATL shall receive an amount of 20 lakh rupees over four years. In another response to a question in the Lok Sabha in August 2018, the government stated that 3000 more schools were selected for setting up of ATL in June 2018 and that they are yet to complete their compliance stage. As per government data, an amount of Rs. 225.24 crore rupees has been released to 1877 schools as of August 2018.\n\nHow many ramps, railings and special toilets have been built for Divyang children?\n\n The third claim is that 54,000 ramps and railings were built and 50,000 special toilets were built for Divyang children.\n\nUnder the Scheme for Implementation of Persons with Disabilities Act (SIPDA), financial assistance is provided for a number of activities including creating a barrier free environment for persons with disabilities in schools, colleges and other academic institutions. The 2017-18 annual report of the Department of Empowerment of Person with Disabilities gives further details. The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan also calls for a barrier free environment for all children.\n\nThe centrally sponsored scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) provides for barrier free access in the elementary schools for the benefit of Divyang children. As per an answer provided by the government in the Lok Sabha in March 2018, more than 7.66 lakh government schools have ramps and more than 2.18 lakh government schools have CWSN (Children with Special Needs) toilets. But it is not known as to how many of these are built by the current government. Hence this claim cannot be verified.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
