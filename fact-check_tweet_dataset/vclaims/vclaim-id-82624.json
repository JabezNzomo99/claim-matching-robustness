BOOM reached out to Khan for a comment but was unable to reach him. The story will be updated if and when he responds.\n\nBOOM got in touch with Zaffar Abbas, Chief Editor of Pakistani newspaper Dawn, to confirm whether they were stopped from publishing the story on WC Shahzaz Ud Din's death, as claimed by the viral WhatsApp messages.\n\nAbbas rubbished the claims, saying, \"I can say with authority that we at Dawn neither commissioned any such story, nor were we asked or instructed to block its publication.\"\n\nBOOM found a website called China Arms, who had used the same photo on their website in a post from October 4, 2015, and had labeled the aircraft as an SU-30.\n\nAlthough, the identity of the pilot in the picture was not provided, this backs Khan's claim that the photo was taken during a joint exercise with China, dating back to 2015.\n\nGiven the confidentiality maintained by India and Pakistan about the details of their operations in the past week, BOOM was unable to ascertain the exact identity of the person in the photo.\n\nBOOM did a quick Google search with the keywords \"Group Captain Agha Mehar\" and \"Wing Commander Shahzaz Uddin\", seperately, but did not find any relevant result either.\n\nHowever, we found out that there exists a retired Air Marshal Waseem Uddin of the PAF, the alleged father of Wing Commander Shahzaz Ud Din, who was seen giving a speech a the Center for Global & Strategic Studies on June 8, 2018.\n\nHis designation as the Former Deputy Chief of Air Staff (Operations), as described in the video, also matches the description of the alleged father of Wing Commander Shahzaz Ud Din, thus confirming that his identity was used as an inspiration for Khalid Umar's story.\n\nA Twitter user who goes by the name 'h' (@HaadeaP) claimed in a tweet that she knew Air Marshal Waseem Uddin and that none of his two sons are in the forces.\n\nShe also posted a screenshot of a conversation with Aleem Uddin, who she claims is one of the sons of the retired Air Marshal.\n\nBOOM traced the Facebook account of Aleem Uddin, who had posted pictures with his father and brother, tagged as Waseem Uddin and Waqar Uddin, respectively.\n\nWaseem Uddin's Facebook profile states that he is a fighter pilot for the Pakistani Air Force.\n\nBOOM also went through the profiles of both Waqar Uddin and Waseem Uddin, and observed a number of photos of the two sons along with the father.\n\nBy comparing the above photo with that of the YouTube video of Air Marshal Waseem Uddin, BOOM was able to ascertain that they're the same person, and that the Facebook account tagged in the photo is actually his.\n\nThere was no photo of a third son name Shahzaz in any of the profiles.\n\nBOOM reached out to Waseem, Aleem and Waqar Uddin through Facebook for a comment. The story will be updated if and when they respond.\n\nDid any of the Air Marshal's sons serve in the force? A quick look through the LinkedIn profiles of Waqar and Aleem Uddin would suggest not.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the story about a third son called Wing Commander Shahzaz Ud Din has been made up by using the identity of Air Marshal Waseem Uddin as an inspiration.", "lang": "en"}
