Not ONE will be quarantined Enjoy your lockdown, folks\u201d.\n\nWhile the photo does appear to show Heathrow arrivals, it was not taken in April as the post suggests.\n\nThe image first appeared in an article by the Daily Mail claiming social distancing was not being followed at the airport (here).\n\nThe article says that the photograph was taken by passenger Hayley Moore on March 23 after arriving to the UK from Dubai.\n\n\u201cPictures taken by Ms Moore show that passengers arriving at Heathrow today were not standing at least two metres away from each other as the government has recommended,\u201d the caption for the photograph reads.\n\nSince then, Heathrow Airport says it has implemented a number of measures to enforce social distancing.\n\nA Heathrow spokesperson told Reuters: \u201cWe have implemented signage and floor stickers across all terminals to remind passengers of the government\u2019s recommendation to social distance themselves at least 2 metres from others. Our colleagues are also on hand to help manage the queues and provide more space where possible.\u201d\n\nThe airport said it was also working with a dedicated team of Public Health England officials, had increased cleaning processes and had made hand sanitiser more easily available.\n\nFalse: a photograph said to show Heathrow Airport arrivals in April 2020 is from several weeks ago, in March.", "lang": "en"}
