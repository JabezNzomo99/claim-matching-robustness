Phil Gingrey of Marietta joined the chorus the day the court released its decision to uphold the mandate during an interview on American Public Media\u2019s radio show \"Marketplace.\" It airs on WABE-FM, Atlanta\u2019s local National Public Radio station.\n\n \n\n Gingrey said he wouldn\u2019t care to have a beer with Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\n \n\n \"I'd like to pour one on his head,\" Gingrey quipped. He also complained that the bill is a whopper of a tax.\n\n \n\n \"This indeed is the largest tax [increase] in the history of our country,\" Gingrey said. \n\n \n\n Politicians and pundits have been using different versions of this talking point for years, and we\u2019ve often ruled it False or worse.\n\n \n\n The latest such statement PolitiFact rated came from conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who earned a Pants on Fire for saying \"Obamacare is ... the largest tax increase in the history of the world.\"\n\n \n\n It\u2019s not even the largest in American history, PolitiFact ruled.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Georgia contacted Gingrey\u2019s office for answers.\n\n \n\n Before we evaluate his response, let\u2019s review the reasoning behind our prior rulings.\n\n \n\n Hold tight. It\u2019s complicated.\n\n \n\n The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, broke down the tax impact of the health care law from 2010 to 2019.\n\n \n\n Over the next 10 years, the plan would raise hundreds of billions of dollars through measures such as a Medicare payroll tax increase, new taxes on certain medical devices and so-called \"Cadillac\" health care plans, and an annual fee on health insurance providers. \n\n \n\n The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health care law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenue coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019.\n\n \n\n Is this the biggest tax increase in American history?\n\n \n\n We turned to a method employed by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940 to 2006.\n\n \n\n Tempalski used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation. He measured the impact of the increase by calculating the increase in revenue as a percentage of the U.S.\u2019 gross domestic product. He typically used estimates from immediately after the laws went into effect.\n\n \n\n Calculations for 1940-1967 should be viewed with some caution, he said, because revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent.\n\n \n\n Here are Tempalski\u2019s top five tax increases from 1940 to 2006:\n\n \n\n 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP\n\n \n\n 2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP\n\n \n\n 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP\n\n \n\n 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP\n\n \n\n 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: 0.97 percent of GDP\n\n \n\n \n\n The 2010 health care law wasn\u2019t included in the list, so we calculated our own percent of GDP figure.\n\n \n\n We chose 2019 as our base line. That\u2019s when the bill\u2019s tax provisions go into full effect.\n\n \n\n The CBO estimates that in 2019, the government will see increased revenue of $104 billion, including the penalty paid by people who decline to buy health insurance.\n\n \n\n We divided that number into the CBO\u2019s gross domestic product projection for 2019, which is $21.164 trillion.\n\n \n\n The result: 0.49 percent of total GDP. The health care bill doesn\u2019t even crack Tempalski\u2019s top five.\n\n \n\n Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber countered that the CBO\u2019s 2010 long-term budget outlook says Obama\u2019s health care law will increase revenue to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2035. That would catapult the tax to near the top of the list.\n\n \n\n But that projection is for more than two decades from now. The accuracy of revenue and GDP projections plummet the further into the future they go.\n\n \n\n Second, Gingrey\u2019s number is not comparable to those in Tempalski\u2019s ranking. Tempalski\u2019s calculation compares revenue estimates for years immediately after the new tax law goes into effect, not a generation out.\n\n \n\n In addition, Gingrey cherry-picks favorable statistics while ignoring the most up-to-date information. The CBO\u2019s 2012 projections show Obama\u2019s health care bill will increase tax revenue by far less -- 0.8 percent.\n\n \n\n Make no mistake about it -- this is still a huge tax increase. And there are a lot of unknowns as the program is implemented.\n\n \n\n But Gingrey went further than that. He said it is the \"largest tax\" increase in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact ruled previously that Obama\u2019s health care bill is not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. That ruling stands.\n\n \n\n Gingrey earns a False.", "lang": "en"}
