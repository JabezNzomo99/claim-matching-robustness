Also, there is no evidence of the ethnicity of the people who carried out the attacks or the weapons used and the numbers are inconsistent.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2019 presidential elections, the candidates have been crisscrossing the country holding campaign rallies and wooing voters. On the 9th of February, the Vice-Presidential candidate of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi visited the Building Materials Market at Dei-Dei on the outskirts of Abuja to interact with traders and shoppers.\n\nOn the same day, a WhatsApp user Jacinta Ogechukwu Eronini created a broadcast message alleging that Peter Obi\u2019s convoy had been attacked at the Building Materials Market and that he was almost killed by Hausa traders. She also alleged that seven cars in his convoy had been burnt and people were being chased at the Tomato Market, also in Dei-Dei by people with knives.\n\nThere is no indication as to how many times the broadcast message has been shared but the issue has become the topic of discussion.\n\nThis news has the potential to inflame passions and instigate violence.\n\nThe news was flagged because of its sensitivity especially leading up to the presidential elections.\n\nA Dubawa fact-check reveals that the supporters of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) were attacked at the Building Materials Market on the 9th of February and campaign vehicles were burnt. However, the attacks happened after the departure of Peter Obi and he was not in any danger. A tweet from his official Twitter account confirms this.\n\nHowever, there are conflicting reports about how many cars were burnt down: while these users \u2013 Emma Ikumeh and MegaTimesNews \u2013 claimed eight cars were burnt, the WhatsApp broadcast put the figure of burnt cars at seven.\n\nAlso, there is no proof about the ethnicity or party affiliation of those who carried out the attacks. There is also no proof that people were being chased with knives by the attackers.\n\nConclusion: The convoy of Peter Obi was not attacked, rather violence occurred after Peter Obi had left the rally. As such, the claim is rated MOSTLY FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
