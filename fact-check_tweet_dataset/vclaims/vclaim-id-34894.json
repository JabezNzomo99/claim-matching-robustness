Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nWhen the photo was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, an article published by the \u2018Shanghaiist\u2019 with the same image was found in the search results. In the article, it can be read that the boy in the photo is a look-alike of Jack Ma. His name is Fan Xiaoqin. He is also being called as \u2018Mini Jack Ma\u2019. On a \u2018Getty Images\u2019 page, it can be read that the boy \u201cgrows in a poor family as his father has lost a leg, his mother has poliomyelitis and is blind in one eye, and his grandma is Alzheimer\u2019s patient at Yongfeng County in Jiangxi\u201d.\n\n\n\nWhen the videos and photos of Fan went viral previously in 2016, it was reported by various media channels that Jack Ma will fund the education of his 8-year-old look-alike. Some of the Indian media channels also reported the same. But, later, it was found that it is just a rumour. According to an article in the \u2018Fortune\u2019, a spokesperson from the Alibaba group has denied the reports. Talking to the \u2018Fortune\u2019, the spokesperson said that the news is completely false. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the boy in the photo is not Jack Ma. He is Fan Xiaoqin, an 8-year-old look-alike of Jack Ma.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
