(More than 85% of Pinoys have no trust in Leni says survey!),\" the report led off with results of a recent Social Weather Station (SWS) survey and claimed Robredo's trust rating dropped, with only 59% of Filipinos saying they trusted her.\n\nIt also said a survey conducted by website Yahoo! News, on the other hand, revealed 86% of its 120,000 respondents said they have no trust in the vice president.\n\nThe Nov. 1 Yahoo! survey is a mere one-question online poll asking its readers to rate their trust in Robredo, with the choices being \"good,\" \"not good,\" and \"I have no opinion.\"\n\nThe ongoing survey, which has collected more than 142,000 votes, does not indicate whether or not respondents felt they had much, and little or no trust in Robredo, rendering untrue citizenexpress.today's claim.\n\nYahoo!'s survey is attached to a short report about the results of the Third Quarter 2018 Social Weather Survey of SWS released last Oct. 30, which revealed that 59% of Filipinos had \"much trust\" in Robredo, 21% had \"little trust,\" having a net trust of 38%. This is a two-point decline from the same survey conducted last June, which revealed 57% of Filipinos had trust in her while 17% had little trust, earning a net trust rating of 40%.\n\nCitizenexpress.today published its report two days after SWS posted the results of the trust survey on Robredo.\n\nThe false and misleading story could have reached moret than 267,000 people, its largest traffic generator from social media being the page Duterte Express.", "lang": "en"}
