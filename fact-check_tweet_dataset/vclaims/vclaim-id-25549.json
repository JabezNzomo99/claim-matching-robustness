Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is goosing the numbers as he campaigns for universal health care.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-08-28T07:00:25.466Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-25549", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/28/sanderss-flawed-statistic-medical-bankruptcies-year/", "vclaim": "\u201cIn AJPH, many editorials are commissioned by the editor-in-chief from experts in their field(s), as a forum to present their most recent or preliminary findings on specific topics, or to coincide with significant dates or events,\u201d said Morgan Richardson, an AJPH editor. \u201cLack of peer review does not indicate inaccuracy, but editorials are less likely to be cited in the scientific literature as evidence because the standard of rigor is different due to context.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not ask about the sole or main reason for bankruptcy, because our past experience indicates that this is a meaningless question,\u201d Himmelstein, a professor at CUNY\u2019s Hunter College who supports single-payer health care, wrote in an email. \u201cThe vast majority of debtors suffer multiple problems that bring them to file, and cannot identify a single problem among them. Thus, if an illness led to lost work time (and hence income) and medical bills, debtors cannot separate out these different problems; they are of a piece.\u201d\n\nGarthwaite said of Sanders\u2019s claim: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong. Just because the number\u2019s big doesn\u2019t make it right, even if you want to agree with the premise. And we should be careful about this. I\u2019m not saying that medical debt and bankruptcy is not a problem, but I think we should have a conversation about the appropriate scale of the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s denigration of Sanders\u2019 statement rests on an econometric study that found only a modest uptick in bankruptcy filings among persons hospitalized in California between 2003 and 2007. As Himmelstein, Woolhandler and Warren noted in their response to that study in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study excluded most persons with frequent hospitalizations (a group at high risk of medical bankruptcy); assumed that anyone not hospitalized could not suffer medical bankruptcy; that a child or partners\u2019 illness couldn\u2019t lead to bankruptcy; and that potentially bankrupting illnesses always commence at the moment of hospitalization - an assumption contradicted by the study\u2019s own data.", "lang": "en"}
