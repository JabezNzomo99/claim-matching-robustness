Gandhi Hospital is a COVID-19 dedicated hospital treating the COVID-19 infected persons in Hyderabad, Telangana. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of the pathetic situation of COVID-19 patients in Gandhi hospital (COVID-19 dedicated hospital) in Hyderabad, Telangana. Fact: The video shows Gandhi hospital staff resting in the corridors after finishing their shift. So the persons in the video are not COVID-19 patients in Gandhi hospital. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video are subjected to reverse image search technique, an article of \u2018The News Minute\u2019 was found in the search results. Speaking to \u2018The News Minute\u2019, spokesperson for Gandhi hospital (from the Health Ministers office) refuted the claim and said that the two persons in the video were class IV sanitation staff and were resting after finishing their 12-hour shift. The spokesperson also said that the women were wearing full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits but patients only wear masks when moving between two locations within the hospital. As the video went viral with the claim, \u2018TNIE\u2019 has also reported that the Gandhi hospital officials have clarified that the women in the video are their hospital\u2019s staff. Local newspaper \u2018Andhra Jyothi\u2019 in one of its articles carried a visual from the video and mentioned in the description that the women in the photo are Gandhi hospital staff. FACTLY spoke to a doctor in Gandhi hospital who confirmed the people in the video are hospital staff and not COVID-19 patients.\n\nTo sum it up, the video shows Gandhi hospital staff sitting in the hospital corridors, not COVID-19 patients in the hospital.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
