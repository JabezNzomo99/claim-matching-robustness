A German press report quotes investigators as saying Russia gave data that does not satisfy international requirements. But Russia says it has no obligation to do so.

Russia is one of 191 members in the agency.\n\nAn Agency guideline \"simply provides that when said data has been gathered and recorded, it should be shared with the investigation,\u201d Philbin said.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on February 3, 2016 that Russia is awaiting a response from international investigators.\n\n\"The official investigation is not hurrying anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of promptness and transparency, there are still attempts to accuse Russia without any grounds or facts.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch-led investigative team of five countries looking into the July 2014 downing of the plane submitted an interim report on September 28, 2016.\n\nThe report states that a Russian-made Buk missile launched from a village held by rebels fighting Ukrainian government forces hit the plane. It says a surface-to-air missile system that downed the airliner was driven in from Russia to rebel-held territory in Ukraine and pulled out of the area that same evening.\n\nBefore the report was issued, the investigative team did not receive radar data from the Russians, an investigation spokesman told Polygraph.info in October.\n\nAfter the investigation findings were made public, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it could not accept the findings as satisfactory as they are contrary to the radar data that Russia \u201cconveyed recently.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry did not, however, say to whom the radar data was conveyed, although it seems to imply that the radar data was sent to the investigation team headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor.\n\nIn late October, Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur said Russian prosecutors gave \"a packet of information\" to the Dutch embassy in Moscow. He added that the information needed to be assessed as to its value.\n\nThe contents have not been made public, making it impossible to assess the validity of the Russian data or the Russian claims.\n\nA Dutch safety board report said on October 2015 that Russia initially provided \u201ccombined primary radar data and secondary surveillance\u2026in the form of a video containing a radar screen replay. No other data was received.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
