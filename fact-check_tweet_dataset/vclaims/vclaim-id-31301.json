The South American united left party protested against the attack on Jadavpur University campus by BJP goons and the leader of goons Babul Supriyo. BJP is being unmasked not only in the country but also in foreign shores.\u201d\n\nClick here for the archive of the post.\n\nJadavpur University turned into a battlefield on September 19 when students clashed with Union Minister Babul Supriyo who had come to attend a welcome programme for new joinees, organised by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. Supriyo was reportedly attacked in the showdown, following which Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar is said to have come to his rescue.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the images were from protests held as part of the global climate strike.\n\nA reverse image search led us to a post by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist, spearheading the Climate Strike movement across the world.\n\nThe first image is from Sydney, where the Climate Strike took place on September 20. The same image was uploaded on Yahoo News Australia.\n\nThe second image of the crowd was taken in Hamburg, where people had turned up in scores to be part of the global climate strikes on the same day.\n\nThe same image was uploaded on a German news portal\n\nThe third image was taken in Berlin with the Siegess\u00e4ule in the background. Messages in German against the climate strikes could also be seen in the photograph. The same has been reported here.\n\nMillions of people have in the past week taken to the streets to protest against the lack of action against climate change. People turned up in huge numbers in major cities of the world including New York City, Stockholm, Melbourne and Berlin, among others.", "lang": "en"}
