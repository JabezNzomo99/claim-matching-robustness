Sanchez offered his explanation of the \u201creal\u201d purpose behind the U.S. investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u200b\u201cWhy did Russia become our exclusive bogyman when they are not even a communist country anymore, haven\u2019t been for decades?\u201d Sanchez rhetorically asked.\n\nHe answered: \u201cThe demonization of Russia is the engine that drives, if nothing else, our weapons industry. Using a complicit media, the arms industry makes billions and billions of dollars simply convincing us, and other countries all over the world, that they need protection from Russia\u2026 Whether Russia really poses a threat or not \u2013 doesn\u2019t really matter. That\u2019s the real story here, that\u2019s the real takeaway from the Mueller report.\u201d\n\nWhile the Sanchez riff was meant as opinion, it was made without evidence. There are facts to cite on the relevance of Russian threats and whether a federal prosecution in the U.S. had demonstrable impact on the global arms industry.\n\nSanchez\u2019s question about \u201cwhy Russia\u201d was made America\u2019s \u201cexclusive bogyman\u201d and \u201cdemonized\u201d fits the Kremlin\u2019s long-standing narrative that \u201cRussophobia\u201d is the real motivation behind the U.S. -- aka \u201cthe West\u2019s\u201d -- moves in relation to Moscow. Russia has for years used this narrative to deny its own wrongdoing.\n\nHere are just a few recent examples of what the Kremlin labels as \u201cRussophobia\u201d:\n\u2022 The international response to the Russian annexation of Crimea and aggression in eastern Ukraine, including sanctions;\n\u2022 The results of World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s investigation revealing state-sponsored use of doping in Russia;\n\u2022 The results of the international investigation of the downing of MH-17, which found the Russian military responsible for the deployment of the missile used to shoot down the Malaysian airliner, killing all 298 people aboard;\n\u2022 The results of the U.S. investigation into Russian clandestine operations targeting the U.S. presidential election in 2016;\n\u2022 The results of the British investigation of Russia\u2019s use of the military grade chemical weapon Novichok in poisoning at least five people on U.K. soil, one of them lethally;\n\u2022 The results of the U.N. investigation of Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing of Syrian civilian targets and, which found Russia guilty of war crimes.\n\u2022 The results of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and Russia's actions blocking international attempts to hold Syria accountable.\n\nThese are just a few examples showing that rather carrying out a campaign of \u201cdemonization,\u201d the U.S. has joined many other countries in condemning Kremlin actions, which have driven the country to the verge of becoming an international pariah and prompted a series of Western economic and diplomatic sanctions aimed at Russia.\n\nThe aforementioned points answer Sanchez\u2019s assertion that \u201cWhether Russia really poses a threat or not \u2013 doesn\u2019t really matter!\u201d\n\nNotably, a number of EU nations have designated Russia as a threat to their national security, and done so independently, without respect to their relations with the United States.\n\nRussia has been implicated in plots to stage a military coup and an assassination against political leaders in the Balkan countries.\n\nRussia\u2019s clandestine military operations have been reported from Africa to Venezuela.\n\nOver the years, President Putin\u2019s address to Parliament included his summary of nuclear weapons under development and implicit or explicit threats aimed at the U.S. In March 2018, as Putin announced a \u201cnew invincible\u201d nuclear ballistic missile, a large screen behind him showed missiles targeting the U.S. State of Florida. In February 2019 during his address to the Federal Assembly, Putin levelled a threat to retaliate against \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d should the U.S. deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe.\n\nAs to Sanchez\u2019s claim, made without evidence, that \u201cthe real takeaway from the Mueller report\u201d is that \u201cthe arms industry,\u201d using \u201ca complicit media,\u201d makes \u201cbillions and billions of dollars simply convincing us, and other countries all over the world, that they need protection from Russia,\u201d independent analyses and databases show no correlation between the U.S. investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and global arms sales.\n\n\"Europe is spending more on its defense. But the spree may be more cyclical than the result of US pressure,\" leading analysts told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe U.S. Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election (also known as the Mueller investigation) was launched on May 17, 2017 and ended on March 22, 2019.\n\nThe 2018 Yearbook of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which collects and analyses data on arms industry worldwide, concluded: \u201cThe volume of international transfers of major weapons rose by 10 per cent between 2008\u201312 and 2013\u201317, to reach its highest level since the end of the Cold War. The increase marks a continuation of the steady upward trend that began in the early 2000s.\u201d\n\nAccording to SIPRI, the five largest arms suppliers in 2013\u201317 were the United States, Russia, France, Germany and China, which accounted for 74 per cent of the total global volume of exports of major weapons.\n\n\u201cSince 1950 the USA and Russia (or the Soviet Union before 1992) have consistently been by far the largest suppliers and, together with West European suppliers, have historically dominated the top 10 list of suppliers,\u201d the SIPRI 2018 Yearbook stated. It also reported that U.S. accounted for 34 percent of global arms sales. That was only a one per cent increase over the figure cited in the 2016 SIPRI.\n\nConsequently, Polygraph.info finds Rick Sanchez\u2019s claim that the real impact of the Mueller investigation is boosting the U.S. weapons industry by scaring other countries into buying American arms to defend themselves from Russia is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
