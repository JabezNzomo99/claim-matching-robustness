Rutgers University\u2019s English department will change its standards of English instruction in an effort to \u2018stand with and respond\u2019 to the Black Lives Matter movement. In an email written by department chair Rebecca Walkowitz, the Graduate Writing Program will emphasize \u2018social justice\u2019 and \u2018critical grammar.'\u201d\n\nSeveral other websites and blogs posted articles that claimed that Rutgers had declared grammar, or \u201cproper grammar,\u201d racist. Some placed quotation marks around the word \u201cracist\u201d in their headlines and articles, indicating that that description had originated in something written or uttered by the university or its faculty.\n\nThose reports were false. Neither Rutgers, nor its English department, nor that department\u2019s chair, Walkowitz, described grammar, \u201cproper grammar,\u201d or the teaching or use of grammar as \u201cracist.\u201d Nor did they imply it was racist or use words to that effect.\n\nThe controversy originated in a June 19 open letter published on the website of Rutgers\u2019 English department and signed by Walkowitz. The lengthy and detailed post outlined the measures being taken by the department in order to \u201cstand with and respond to the Black Lives Matter movement; to create and promote an anti-racist environment in our workplace, our classes, our department, our university, and our communities; and to contribute to the eradication of the violence and systemic inequities facing black, indigenous, and people of color members of our community, to which the #BLM movement and ongoing protests have drawn our attention in pointed and necessary ways.\u201d\n\nIn one of dozens of sections, Walkowitz wrote that the English department\u2019s Graduate Writing Program would be undertaking three initiatives. One of those was \u201cIncorporating \u2018critical grammar\u2019 into our pedagogy.\u201d On that, Walkowitz wrote:\n\n\u201cThis approach challenges the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard \u2018academic\u2019 English backgrounds at a disadvantage. Instead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them [with] regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on \u2018written\u2019 accents.\u201d\n\nNowhere did the letter describe grammar as \u201cracist.\u201d Online posts that placed quotation marks around that word therefore misled readers by presenting it as a direct quotation. Walkowitz\u2019s letter also did not include statements that could fairly or reasonably be summarized as \u201cdeclaring grammar racist.\u201d\n\nContrary to Leonydus Johnson\u2019s claim in the Washington Free Beacon, the letter also did not \u201c[make] the racist assumption that minorities cannot comprehend traditional English.\u201d Johnson also falsely claimed that Walkowitz\u2019s letter endorsed or articulated \u201cthe idea that expecting a student to write in grammatically correct sentences is indicative of racial bias.\u201d It did not do that.\n\nNeither did the English department propose to \u201calter grammar rules for nonwhite students,\u201d as the Washington Examiner falsely claimed.\n\nIn fact, Walkowitz\u2019s letter explicitly stipulated that the \u201ccritical grammar\u201d initiative ran counter to what she called \u201cthe familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard \u2018academic\u2019 English backgrounds at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nWalkowitz told Hank Kalet, a lecturer in the Communications department at Rutgers and the author of a blog post about the controversy, that the department\u2019s plan would actually result in \u201cmore attention to grammar in the aggregate, not less.\u201d She added that, \u201cOur standards remain rigorous and high, and our goal is to help students succeed in academic writing and other writing genres.\u201d\n\nKalet provided a good summary of the error made by those who rushed to claim that Walkowitz\u2019s letter had \u201cdeclared grammar racist.\u201d Of the key paragraph in the letter, he wrote:\n\nThis passage should be clear to anyone who takes the time to read what is written. The \u201cfamiliar dogma\u201d here is the problem. It assumes that students from multilingual backgrounds will be harmed by a focus on grammar at the expense of broader writing issues. This dogma can leave students without the strong, sentence-level foundation they need to write well. What Rutgers is proposing \u2014 and what the letter clearly says \u2014 is a shift; it is not proposing to de-emphasize grammar, but to encourage \u201ccritical awareness,\u201d or an understanding of the history and development of English grammar, how it works, and the potential impacts of the choices made in the writing process. Rather than lowering the bar, as the critics claim, the department is raising it.", "lang": "en"}
