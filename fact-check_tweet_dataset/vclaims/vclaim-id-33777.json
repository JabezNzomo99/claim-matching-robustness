A blog post on a self-described satirical website claims that Pelosi was spotted drunk at 10 a.m. while attending a children\u2019s benefit in a public park. The made-up item says Pelosi began \u201cyelling at small children\u201d who \u201ccame near her after her third orange juice.\u201d\n\nThe piece originated from bustatroll.org, which includes an \u201cabout us\u201d page that says it is part of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u2019s \u201cnetwork of parody, satire, and tomfoolery\u201d websites. We\u2019ve written many times about content from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense being mistaken for real news.\n\nIn this case, at least two other websites published the Pelosi item without labeling it as satire. The sites \u2014 The Cube News and Conservative News Update \u2014 make no mention of satire on their \u201cabout us\u201d pages, either.\n\nConservative News Update claims it has \u201ca professional team\u201d that provides readers with \u201cthe best news and information,\u201d but the bogus Pelosi story carries no byline and includes no named sources.\n\nThis is not the first time that Pelosi has been the target of false claims about alcohol, even though Pelosi\u2019s office has told FactCheck.org on two other occasions that she does not drink alcohol: once in 2010, amid accusations of Pelosi spending taxpayer dollars on partying during air travel, and again in May, when two videos were manipulated to make Pelosi\u2019s words sound slurred.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
