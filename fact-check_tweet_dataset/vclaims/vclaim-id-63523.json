One such post has been shared over 1,000 times and has received 580 comments and 492 reaction as of writing.\n\nThe facts: Her supposed plan to block Facebook is a rehashed one, and has been debunked as early as 2018.\n\nThere are no statements from her office posted on the Senate website or on her Facebook page, nor reports from news organizations where Senator Poe said she'll make efforts to block Facebook in the Philippines in relation to the ABS-CBN shutdown.\n\nIn April 2018, Rappler rated as false the claim that she is eyeing a Facebook ban in the Philippines if she is reelected senator.\n\nAround that time, Poe \u2013 then the chairperson of the Senate committee on public information and mass media \u2013 was conducting hearings on the spread of disinformation on social media. \u2013 Michael Bueza/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
