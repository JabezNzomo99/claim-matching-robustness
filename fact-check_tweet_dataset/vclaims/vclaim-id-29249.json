The first aid experts we talked to told us there\u2019s no evidence that it would work, and it could potentially hurt the person more if there\u2019s something still in the wound.\n\nWhat you should do is put pressure on the wound with something like a bandage, towel, or even a piece of clothing, and call 999.\n\nApplying pressure to the wound and calling 999 are the most important steps\n\nSt John Ambulance, the first aid charity, told us you shouldn\u2019t put a tampon in a stab wound. Dr Lynn Thomas, their Clinical Director, said: \u201cWe would not advise using tampons to stem severe bleeding as you may not know whether there is an object in the wound nor the full extent of the injury and therefore you risk doing further damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, apply direct pressure to the wound (using a sterile dressing if available and wearing gloves if you can) and call 999. Secure the dressing with a bandage if possible. Help the person to lie down if they are not already and raise their legs to stop them going in to shock.\u201d\n\nWe asked the British Red Cross what they thought.\n\nJoe Mulligan, their head of first aid education, told us \u201cWe do not recommend placing tampons into wounds, there is no evidence that this would stop or slow down a heavy bleed. The most effective way to do this is for people to apply pressure to wounds.\u201d\n\nHe also said \u201ccall 999 and keep pressure on the wound until paramedics arrive. If there is an object in the wound, like a knife, do not remove it, just apply pressure around it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPressure can be applied with your hands or household items like a t-shirt, towel or even a tampon \u2013 just make sure pressure is applied because this will slow down blood loss and help save lives.\u201d\n\nSo while a tampon could theoretically be used (like many other items) to apply pressure to a wound, it\u2019s not advisable to \u201cwhack it in\u201d as the Facebook post suggests.", "lang": "en"}
