Bakker himself had been accused of rape before and has served time for fraud. The entire Bakker quote is made up although the jury is still out on the Trump-Daniels affair.\n\nThe false story about Bakker originated on satirical website The Babylon Bee where it was published (archived here) under the title \"'Trump Was Merely Sharing The Gospel With That Porn Star,' Explains Jim Bakker\". It opened:\n\nBLUE EYE, MO--Squashing accusations that President Trump had a sexual encounter with porn star \"Stormy Daniels\" while he was married to Melania, televangelist Jim Bakker explained to his audience Friday that he had confirmed that Trump was merely scheduling private time with the woman in a hotel suite in order to share with her the good news of Jesus Christ, as he had become acquainted with her and was very concerned that she was not a Christian.\n\nBut \"The Babylon Bee\" comes with following dislaimer on every page:\n\nSome of their greatest past hits include:\n\u2022 Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of 'Your Best Life Now'\n\u2022 Another Actress Accuses Kirk Cameron Of Treating Her With Respect\n\u2022 ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'\n\nWith a track record like that it is clear that you shouldn't take anything posted on the site seriously and you definitely shouldn't confuse it with real news. Despite this reputation the fake story obtained over 160,000 likes, shares and comments and many people on social media seemed to think it was real:", "lang": "en"}
