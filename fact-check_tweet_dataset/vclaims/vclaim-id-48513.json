The letter calls on executives to \"discuss an appropriate resolution of this matter\" that would include a \"substantial payment\" to cover damages.\n\n\"Never in the history of this country has a president been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called \u2018mainstream\u2019 news, as the current situation,\" the letter says. \"My clients intend to file legal action against you to seek compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, reimbursement of legal costs, and all other available legal and equitable remedies, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\"\n\nThe letter doesn\u2019t mention \"pro-impeachment bias\" though the Washington Examiner among others described the president\u2019s charges against CNN that way.\n\nThe letter to CNN was signed by attorney Charles Harder, who represented Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that took down Gawker and who has sent similar threats to other media for Trump. Last year, Harder suggested the president would sue the New York Times for what he called a \"highly defamatory\" story. He threatened to sue author Michael Wolff for libel over Wolff\u2019s book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\"\n\nSo far, though, no lawsuits have been filed. And Rebecca Tushnet, a professor of false advertising law at Harvard Law School, told Reuters that Trump\u2019s latest salvo has \"no merit\" and that she doubted a lawsuit would ever be filed.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
