The claim, which has been shared on Facebook over 30,000 times as of May 11, 2020, is misleading.\n\nExamples of the post are visible here and here .\n\nThe claim comes after weeks of lockdown and social isolation imposed worldwide to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus ( here ). There is no treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19 yet ( here ).\n\nResearch has found that loneliness and social isolation can have a direct adverse effect on health, such as impaired immunity, depression, poor sleep quality and poor cardiovascular health ( here , here ).\n\nAccording to a study led by UCLA professor Steve Cole ( here ), loneliness and social isolation can increase inflammation (the immune\u2019s system response to fight off a threat here ) and decrease immune capacity.\n\nThe American Psychological Association notes here that loneliness \u201ccan occur when people are surrounded by others\u201d and that it is defined by the level of satisfaction a person has with their \u201cconnectedness\u201d (meaning the state of being connected and having a close relationship with other things or people here ).\n\nTo mitigate the effects of loneliness that might be triggered by social isolation amidst the new coronavirus outbreak and bolster the immune system, experts point to the importance of virtual connection to maintain social ties. Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University, told the Washington Post that receiving support from others, as well as being \u201ca source of support\u201d to others, can have positive effects ( here ).\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s report also notes that the \u201csense of security\u201d people obtain from friends and family helps them to cope with stressful situations in a much physiologically calmer way, which \u201ccan lead to a stronger immune system\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses the relevance of \u201cstaying connected while staying away\u201d through phone calls, video chat or social media ( here ).\n\nReuters found no expert evidence to support the claim that wearing face masks weakens the immune system. Health authorities, including the CDC, recommend the use of masks as a way of strengthening social distancing ( here ) to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Atlantic has reported on the benefits of wearing masks, which not only protect the individual but more importantly the people they come into contact with ( here ).\n\nThe CDC encourages people who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as those who are immunocompromised, to wear a face covering when around others ( bit.ly/35RBlFz ).\n\nA CDC spokesperson told Reuters a cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source. \u201cThe mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, \u2018my mask protects you, and your mask protects me!\u2019 It\u2019s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing\u201d (here).\n\nThere are concerns that some people who wear face masks might become complacent about other important measures, like social distancing. The World Health Organization warns of potential risks for healthy people wearing masks in community settings, such as \u201cself-contamination by touching and reusing (a) contaminated mask\u201d and a \u201cfalse sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to other preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene\u201d ( bit.ly/3aueKzh ).\n\nReuters recently debunked a misleading claim here that face-masks cause hypercapnia. While breathing in excessive amounts of CO2 for large amounts of time can be dangerous, it is unlikely that the general public would suffer from these complications by wearing a mask. Most people would wear face coverings on short stints outside their home as a complementary measure to social distancing ( here ).\n\nTo maintain a healthy immune system, Harvard Medicine recommends following general health guidelines, such as eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough sleep ( here ).\n\nVarious publications have reported on the challenges around staying healthy - both mentally and physically - amidst the pandemic, including Forbes ( here ), the World Economic Forum ( here ), the Atlantic ( here ), and Harvard Business Review ( here ).\n\nPartly false. Loneliness can weaken the immune system. To avoid this, experts note the importance of maintaining social ties while socially distancing. There is no evidence wearing face masks as a supplement to social isolation weakens the immune system.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
