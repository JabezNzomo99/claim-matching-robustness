Osmayev, who Russia claimed was plotting an assassination of the Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2012, survived several attempts on his life, the last of which killed his wife Amina Okuyeva near Kyiv in October 2017. Ukrainian intelligence said the attack was planned and carried out by the Russian security services.\n\nKhangoshvili changed his name to Tornike Kavtarashvili and sought refuge in Germany after surviving an assassination attempt in Georgia in 2015. The Russian security services reportedly provided to the German intelligence agencies information branding Khangoshvili as an Islamic extremist and a terrorist.\n\nBased on that information, several Russian and Western media outlets reported that Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was on Russia\u2019s official list of wanted terrorists. That information is false. Neither the name Zalimkhan Khangoshvili nor the name Tornike Kavtarashvili is included on the official list, at least not publicly.\n\nGerman law enforcement detained the suspected killer shortly after he fled from the scene on a bicycle, following eyewitnesses\u2019 alert about the man disposing of his wig, bicycle and handgun -- all recovered later from the Spree River, less than half a mile away from the crime scene.\n\nBerlin\u2019s Attorney General said that the suspect, a man of Russian nationality, 49, was brought before the court and arrested. He came to Berlin shortly before the assassination and had an air ticket back to Russia.\n\nA German security services\u2019 source told Der Spiegel that the man refused to talk with the investigators and demanded to speak with representatives of the Russian embassy in Berlin instead.\n\nThe joint investigative team of Belligcat, the German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Russian outlet The Insider discovered that the suspect used a fake identity and a fake address but travelled with a validly issued Russian passport under the name of Vadim Andreevich Sokolov. Based on the findings, the Belligcat investigation concluded, that the Russian denials of involvement in the Berlin assassination were \u201cimplausible.\u201d\n\nThe body of Zalimkhan Khangoshvili was delivered on Thursday, August 29, to his home village of Duisi in Georgia\u2019s Pankisi Gorge and buried according to the Muslim tradition.\n\nWith Berlin\u2019s increasing suspicions that the killing was a Russian state-organized political assassination and global headlines drawing parallel with the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury, U.K., Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman of Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, denied that the Kremlin or any Russian state agency had any connection to the crime.\n\nThe vast majority of the Russian media promoted an \u201calternative\u201d version of who was behind the killing in Berlin, pushing forward the message that only the victim\u2019s own kin, the Chechens, could have \u201cdealt with him.\u201d Russian media has been actively providing detailed narratives of Khangoshvili\u2019s \u201cterrorist activities.\u201d\n\nThe revenge motive is fabricated, Chechens both in Russia and abroad said.\n\nWhile the Russian narrative about the \u201cChechens from Russia\u201d can potentially have merit based on precedent, Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been implicated in ordering assassinations of his political competitors and critics, carried out by his security guards, friends, and even relatives both in Russia and abroad, including in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThe Chechen law enforcement services denied any connection with the killing in Berlin, saying Khangoshvili \u201cwas Georgian and had lost any ties in Chechnya long ago.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cChechens hiding in Europe\u201d narrative has multiple weak points. First, the claim contradicts logic: it is hard to explain why former militia Chechens -- who \u201chide in Europe,\u201d knowing that Russia is actively seeking their extradition to persecute them for their part in two separatist wars -- would demand to talk with representatives of the Russian embassy, as the arrested suspect did.\n\nMoreover, the European Chechen diaspora made it clear \u2013 Russia is to blame for Khangoshvili\u2019s assassination.\n\nAkhmed Zakayev, one of the most prominent and most sought by Russia leaders of the Chechen separatists in exile in London, U.K. said the killing in Berlin \u201cwas demonstrative in nature,\u201d drawing parallels with the assassinations of Kadyrov\u2019s former bodyguard Umar Israilov in Vienna, Austria in 2009 and the poisoning of the Skripals in the U.K. in 2018.\n\nZakayaev, who served as the head of government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) under President Aslan Maskhadov in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said that these \u201cpolitical assassinations\u201d were \u201cacts of the Russian state terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnzor Maskhadov, the son of the ChRI President Aslan Maskhadov, who has lived in exile in Europe since Russian security killed his father in 2005, told Polygraph.info that Khangoshvili\u2019s murder has been widely discussed among the Chechens both in Russia and abroad.\n\n\u201cI have never heard any Chechen having any issues with Zelimkhan, on the contrary, he was well respected and beloved,\u201d Maskhadov said.\n\nMaskhadov said, his father had \u201calmost brotherly\u201d relations with Khangoshvili, who was one of his most trusted field commanders.\n\n\u201cI knew him personally, he was a true patriot and never shy of stating his strong opposition against Chechens\u2019 involvement in any jihadi wars abroad -- while Russia is still engaged in a war with us, and in a very vile war,\u201d Maskhadov said. He confirmed Khangoshvili has been receiving death threats, \u201che was on Russia\u2019s kill list.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have only one suspect \u2013 the Russian Federation. It was a political execution planned in advance and carried out by the Russian security services\u2019 operatives in Germany,\u201d Maskhadov told Polygraph.info.\n\nHe, himself has been a target of the Russian security services. There have been kidnapping attempts and death threats that \u201cnever stopped,\u201d the last such threat \u201cdelivered in a specifically cruel way \u2013 via my 70-years-old mother,\u201d Maskhadov said.\n\nThe main argument for the \u201cChechen revenge\u201d version promoted by Russian media is Khangoshvili\u2019s role in the so-called \u201cLopota incident\u201d \u2013 an armed standoff between the Georgian security forces and a group of Chechen Islamist militants in 2012. The situation involved hostage taking by the militants and resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides. Although, many details of the operation have never been made public, it has been confirmed that Khangoshvili played a key role in the negotiations to end the stand-off and have the hostages released.\n\nWhile Russia portrayed Khangoshvili as a traitor of the Chechens for making a deal with the Georgian security services, blaming on him the deaths of many of the militants, the Georgian officials said his involvement helped save many lives.\n\n\u201cMany do not know that without Zelimkhan\u2019s direct intervention we would have had much more casualties during the Lapankuri special operation,\u201d Nugzar Tsiklauri, a former member of the Georgian Parliament representing the opposition United National Movement party said, adding, \u201cZelimkhan Khangoshvili was the man who tried his best to prevent Pankisi teenagers from going to the Syrian slaughter.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
