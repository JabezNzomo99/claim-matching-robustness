According to the caption posted by Shubh Pandit, the woman seen in the video is a Madhya Pradesh Congress IT cell vice-president Shilpi Singh. It has been viewed close to 20,000 times. Pandit describes himself as a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath.\n\nSeveral other individuals on Facebook have shared this video with the identical narrative.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple key-frames using Invid, a chrome extension and did a Google reverse image of a key-frame. We found one of the earliest instances when the video was shared online. The video captioned \u2013\u201cNasha sharab me hota to nachti botal\u201d was uploaded on YouTube on July 2, 2017.\n\nFurthermore, juxtaposing the image of the woman in the video with that of Shilpi Singh\u2019s photo depicts a clear distinction between the two. They are NOT the same; the woman in the video is not Congress worker Shilpi Singh.\n\nShilpi Singh also tweeted that the woman in the video is NOT her.\n\nThe video was viral in Pakistan as well, in 2017. It was claimed that the man seen in the video is a local Pakistani minister Jam Khan Shoro. An article published by a Pakistan website, The Sindh Times concluded that the video is from India and the man is NOT the local minister. Alt News couldn\u2019t conclusively establish the origin of the video but it is certain that the video has been circulating on social media for the last two years.\n\nIn conclusion, the video shared as that of Congress IT cell vice-president Shilpi Singh is of an unrelated incident which is at least 18 months old. A woman who seems to be enjoying herself in a social gathering was made out to be female politician. This is a standard technique employed by purveyors of misinformation \u2013 shame a woman for having a \u2018good time\u2019, especially if she enjoys a position of power. This defiling panders to the conservative sections of a society that looks down upon women \u2018having fun\u2019. A similar vilification campaign was launched against Gurmehar Kaur when a video of a girl dancing in a moving car was circulated as hers.", "lang": "en"}
