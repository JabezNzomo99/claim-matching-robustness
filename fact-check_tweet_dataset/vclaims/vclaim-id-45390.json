No, that's not true. The armored vehicles seen in a viral video were apparently part of a music video production, unrelated to the protests.\n\nThe claim was made alongside a video (archived here) posted by hoodsite.com on June 5, 2020. The title of that video read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe claim was also posted on Twitter by conservative commentator Jon Miller, who has close to 80,000 followers. Here is a screen grab of his original post, which has been deleted from his feed.\n\nMiller later apologized for sharing the video on Twitter.\n\nAtlanta authorities similarly say the tanks in the video were unrelated to recent protests, which have exploded in the wake of George Floyd's death. Floyd, an African American man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\nOfficer Steven Avery, a spokesman with the Atlanta Police Department, spoke to Heavy, a U.S.-based news site. Avery said that the video in question shows what \"appears to be a music production,\" according to Heavy, which also reported that police are not investigating the incident.\n\nLead Stories reached out to the Atlanta Police Department for comment. Police have not yet responded to the request.", "lang": "en"}
