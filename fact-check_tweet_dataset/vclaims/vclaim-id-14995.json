Although all his ministers remained in office throughout his first term, his second term doesn\u2019t seem like it would follow the same trend.\n\nIt, therefore, is not out of place to see these ministers blowing their horns. One of such ministers is Barrister Solomon Dalung, Nigeria\u2019s Minister for Youths and Sports Development.\n\nSpeaking in Benin at a meeting of the National Council on Sports, the Plateau-born politician claimed that Nigeria, in various sports competition, has picked \u201cover 700 medals\u201d. In his exact words:\n\n\u201cIn the past three years I took over as the sports administrator of the country, Nigeria has been able to win over 700 medals in various sporting competitions that we participated in, and this is quite historic.\u201d\n\nPerhaps to give his statement a wider coverage, the Minister, whose trademark dressing of Kahki and red cap has been said to be in support of revolutionists Che Guevera and Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso, took to his Facebook page to further profess this message.\n\nTo verify the claim, we contacted the Minister of Sports but though he acknowledged our request, his promise to \u201crevert back accordingly please\u201d has not been fulfilled till date. Several other reminders sent to him were not acknowledged nor replied as well.\n\nWe are also limiting the scope of this check to Mr Dalung\u2019s three full years in service as he became the Minister in November 2015.\n\nThe year-by-year medal mark reached by Nigeria is not available in the public domain. So, we analysed the \u2018international\u2019 sporting events that \u2018Nigeria\u2019 has participated in within the time frame (November 2015 \u2013 March 2019). [We chose to assess international events because the Minister used the word \u201cNigeria\u201d which implies that the athletes must have competed with other countries in a sports competition.]\n\nSports analyst, Olawale Adigun of Top Radio, a Lagos-based radio station, also agreed that record keeping on sports is not top notch in Nigeria. In spite of this poor record keeping, he was of the opinion that \u201cthe Minister\u2019s claim of 700 medals in the last three years is preposterous and atrocious\u201d.\n\nSO, HOW DID NIGERIA FARE IN SPORTS IN 2016?\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria participated in the Summer Olympics, the world\u2019s biggest sporting competition. In that year, Nigeria ranked 78th amongst the countries that participated in the competition. Fortunately, Nigeria got one medal, a bronze medal, through the men\u2019s U\u201323 football team (called Dream Team IV).\n\nIn the summer Paralympics, Nigeria fared better than it did in the summer Olympics [Paralympics is the Olympics for persons with disability, and it is always staged after the Olympics]. With 8 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze medals, the Nigerian athletes at the competition won a total of 12 medals.\n\nThe same year, during the African Championships in Athletics held in Durban, South Africa, Nigeria won 16 medals \u2014 4 gold, 5 silver and 7 bronze medals.\n\nBy this, in the competitions of note, Nigeria won a total of 29 medals.\n\nWHAT ABOUT MEDALS IN 2017?\n\nNigeria\u2019s \u201cpara team\u201d continued from where they stopped in 2016 by keeping the nation\u2019s flag flying at the 2017 World Para Powerlifting Championship in Mexico. They finished second behind China with 10 medals (4 by men, 6 by women). They amassed 5 gold, 3 silver and 2 bronze medals.\n\nNigeria\u2019s contingent at the 2017 London World Athletics Championships did not replicate the feat of the Paralympians as they returned home with only one medal, won by the men\u2019s team.\n\nAs though making up for failing to win a medal for themselves at the IAAF Championships, the nation\u2019s female team won the 2 bronze medals (in the women\u2019s single and women\u2019s double categories) that Nigeria won at the 2017 African Badminton Championships in Benoni, South Africa.\n\nIn August 2017, D\u2019Tigress, Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team, won gold in the Women AfroBasket Championship held in Mali.\n\nBarely a month later, the men\u2019s basketball team, D\u2019Tiger, fell to Tunisia in the final of the Men\u2019s Afro Basketball Championship co-hosted by Tunisia and Senegal. They, however, were compensated with a silver medal.\n\nOn the world stage, Odunayo Adekuoroye made the nation proud at the World Wrestling Championship event in Paris, France, by winning a silver medal.\n\nLater, Aruna Quadri would better this feat in the men\u2019s singles event of the ITTF Challenge Polish Open. The Nigerian defeated Japan\u2019s Kaii Yoshida in six sets (11-7, 11-13 11-8, 6-11, 11-8, 14-12) to become the first African to win an ITTF title outside the continent by winning a gold medal.\n\nBy this calculation, Nigeria ended the year with 17 medals.\n\nAgain, although it could be said that there may be other competitions in 2017 where Nigeria partook in, none has a medal haul of significance that could have boosted Nigeria\u2019s chance of reaching even a 100 medal mark.\n\n2018 RECORDS SAY \u2018700 MEDALS\u2019 IS AN OVERREACH\n\nThe year began on a good footing for the nation\u2019s wrestling team. Showcased in Port Harcourt, Nigeria won 23 medals at the 2018 African Wrestling Championships held between February 7\u201311: 15 gold, 5 silver and 3 bronze medals.\n\nAt the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February 2018, Nigeria came in as a debutant but ended the campaign without a medal. By the 12th of February 2018, Nigeria won two silver medals in 2018 All African Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Team Badminton Championships in Algiers, Algeria. In that same February, Nigeria clinched 5 medals \u2014 3 silver and 2 bronze \u2014 at the 2018 African Badminton Championships held from February 16-18 in Algeria.\n\nBy March, Nigeria took home 2 bronze medals at the African Taekwondo Championships held in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nIn April, Nigeria participated in the 2018 Commonwealth Game, finishing as the tournament\u2019s 9th best with 24 medals: 9 gold, 9 silver and 6 bronze medals. Again, in the 21st edition of the African Senior Athletics Championship, Nigeria finished joint second with South Africa with a haul of 19 medals: 9 gold, 5 silver and 5 bronze. The same month, Team Nigeria got 11 medals \u2014 9 gold and two silver medals \u2014 at the 2018 Africa Gymnastic Level System held in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nNigeria also obtained a bronze medal at the 2018 African Men\u2019s Junior Handball Championship hosted by Marrakesh, Morocco. In what was officially known as the III Summer Youth Olympic Games, and commonly referred to as Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2018, Nigeria placed 48th on the medal log with 4 medals: 1 gold and 3 silver medals.\n\nThe aggregation of these medal spree gives a total of 91 medals. By extension and based on the available data, from 2016 to 2018, Nigeria won a total of 137 medals.\n\n700 MEDALS SEEMS VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH\n\nSince Mr Dalung took over as sports minister in November 2015, the country\u2019s sports team has never finished with a 100 medals in a single competition.\n\nThe highest the country has to its name in the last 4 years is its 144 medal haul (47 gold, 55 silver, 42 bronze) at the 11th African Games (formerly All-Africa Games).\n\nThis 2015 edition of the competition, a quadrennial event, and arguably Africa\u2019s biggest sporting showpiece, was hosted in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, between September 4 and 15. The minister hadn\u2019t been appointed as at this date.\n\nAlso, in the big international competitions such as the Summer and Winter Olympics, Commonwealth Games that held in the years under review, Nigeria couldn\u2019t boast of more than a total of 25 medals.\n\nIn these events, nations have records of amassing hundreds of medals; but such is not the case of Nigeria. Hence, reaching the 700 medal mark as acclaimed by the minister is a far cry, especially considering the medals winnable in the other lesser competitions and the nation\u2019s margin of wins in these competitions.\n\nOlawale Adigun again noted to Dubawa that it is true that the nation has been very successful in para-sports, especially in weightlifting. However, he added, this does not translate to 700 medals in 3 years. He also hinted that the minister has a history faux pas.\n\n\u201cDalung\u2019s misstatement joins the long lists of gaffes he has made in public glare, and he remains a sad reflection of Nigeria sports,\u201d Olawale said.\n\nAlthough, there is no available public data to give the aggregate of the medals won by Nigeria in the last 3 years, \u201c700 medals\u201d is likely to be a very big overstatement. Nigeria did not win enough medals in any of the competitions it participated in to amass such a huge number of medals!", "lang": "en"}
