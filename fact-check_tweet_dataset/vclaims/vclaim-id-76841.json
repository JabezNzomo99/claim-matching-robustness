Together they cut taxes by $370 billion, mostly through tax credits for families with children, and raised other taxes, primarily on cigarettes and air travel, by $130 billion.\n\n \n\n That\u2019s a net tax reduction of $240 billion -- which the budget office pointed out was the first major reduction in federal taxes since the early 1980s. \n\n \n\n But, obviously, $130 billion in tax increases isn\u2019t small change, either.\n\n \n\n In response, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander said:\n\n \n\n \"Neumann has always, always, always said he is fine making changes to our tax structure as long as the overall impact is the same or lower taxes.\"\n\n \n\n But that\u2019s not the statement we\u2019re testing. The claim was an absolute.\n\n \n\n Our rating\n\n \n\n Neumann said he never voted for a tax increase.\n\n \n\n But looking at just two of the major bills he supported, although they contained $370 billion in tax decreases, they also contained $130 billion in tax increases.\n\n \n\n We rate Neumann\u2019s statement False.", "lang": "en"}
