No, that's not true: a notoriously unreliable website misquoted Merkel based on a year-old news article. She never said it.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NewsPunch (formerly YourNewsWire) on December 7, 2018 titled \"Angela Merkel: Trump Has Almost Destroyed The 'New World Order'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has admitted that the New World Order is 'under threat' due to the rise of President Trump and the trend of Trump-supporting populist leaders winning elections around the world in the past year. The German leader slammed the rejection of open borders and globalism, and poured scorn on the patriotic movement currently sweeping across Europe, the U.S, Brazil, Australia and other parts of the world. \"Frankly speaking, the country I have the honor to represent and where I am chancellor has difficulties. And polarization is something that we see in our country as well, which we haven't had for decades,\" Merkel said at Davos.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, which hides the fact her speech is quite old news since it happened almost a year ago:\n\nThe source given for the quote is this article dated January 24, 2018:\n\nMerkel was not speaking about a \"new world order\" but about \"the current world order\". And it is not \"destroyed\" but \"under threat\". And she didn't name Trump directly but spoke about \"polarization\", \"protectionism\" and \"populism\" in general.\n\nThe fact that the article is almost a year old also contradics NewsPunch claim that what Merkel said was about \"the trend of Trump-supporting populist leaders winning elections around the world in the past year\" since that hadn't happened yet when she made the speech.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes newspunch.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
