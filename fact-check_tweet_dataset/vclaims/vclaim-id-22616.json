That is the rules in the state system and it's funded by the Commonwealth and supported as well.\"\n\nUnder the federal-state agreement, public hospitals offer patients the choice of being admitted as private or public patient.\n\nIf they choose to go public, \"components of the public hospital service (such as pathology and diagnostic imaging) will be regarded as a part of the patient's treatment and will be provided free of charge,\" the agreement says.\n\nThe Melbourne Institute's Professor Philip Clarke said that for public patients treated in a public hospital, the experience is free except for extras such as TV.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that public hospitals also take private patients, \"and these patients may incur out-of-pocket costs including any gaps if fees for specialists exceed the Medicare rebate\".\n\nHealth Program Director for the Grattan Institute, Dr Stephen Duckett, said that so long as a person is treated as a public patient, Mr Morrison was \"absolutely right\".\n\nMr Morrison referred to treatment \"in\" public hospitals, though this isn't as straightforward as it sounds.\n\nPublic patients can be formally admitted to the hospital as inpatients, or treated as non-admitted outpatients. When it comes to cancer treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy services are often provided as outpatient services.\n\nThe federal-state agreement explains the basis on which a public hospital outpatient department will treat public patients free of charge.\n\nAssociate Professor James Gillespie, Deputy Director of Sydney University's Menzies Centre for Health Policy, told Fact Check that while public inpatients were paid for by state governments, services at outpatient clinics at public hospitals were instead charged through Medicare and the PBS.\n\nThat could lead to out-of-pocket costs for patients, he said.\n\nAs Breast Cancer Network Australia wrote in 2016: \"For people receiving treatment in the public system, costs can include copayments that some state and territory public hospitals charge for chemotherapy treatment\".\n\nExplaining the situation for public patients in NSW, Associate Professor Kees Van Gool, with Sydney University of Technology's Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation told Fact Check:\n\nCancer Council Australia CEO Professor Sanchia Aranda also told Fact Check that admitted patients received free care in public hospitals, but said they may be offered tests or drug treatments not covered by Medicare which can cost patients extra.\n\nAs Deloitte Access Economics wrote in their 2016 study on the cost of breast cancer treatment:\n\nThe Oncotype DX test it referred to can help determine whether chemotherapy is necessary. According to the report, it costs patients $4,000 to $5,000.\n\nThe study also said doctors may recommend drugs that are approved for sale but not yet listed on the PBS.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by the Breast Cancer Network, women with secondary breast cancer spent an average of $5,277 on non-PBS medicines.\n\nExperts said there was more to cancer treatment than hospital care.\n\nDr Duckett said Mr Morrison's point was a non-sequitur because Labor's policy \"was principally addressed at people who are not in hospital\".\n\nAnd Dr Van Gool said Mr Morrison was \"technically correct\", but there were \"many other costs involved in a patient's treatment as they travel through all the different phases of cancer care\".\n\nThese phases could include diagnostic services, specialist consultations, chemotherapy, surgery, post-chemotherapy, post-radiation then possibly years of follow up checks, he said.\n\n\"Aside from that acute phase [in hospital] ... that patient stands the risk of having out-of-pocket costs on all other things,\" Dr Van Gool said.\n\nAs the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare explains: \"Medicare does not always cover the full cost of medical services. Doctors and other health care providers are free to set their own fees for consultations and procedures and the patient may need to contribute to the cost of those services.\"\n\nSome services and drugs are covered by Medicare and PBS safety nets, which kick in when annual out-of-pockets accumulate past a certain threshold.\n\nStudies offer a glimpse into what patients can expect to pay themselves for their cancer treatment, sometimes indicating payments by public patients.\n\nThe 2015 Breast Cancer Network survey said women with secondary breast cancer treated in the public system paid an average monthly out-of-pocket cost of $531.\n\nThe same women reported total out-of-pocket costs of $900 on surgery, $1500 on radiotherapy and $922 on scans.\n\nBoth the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and Cancer Council Australia directed Fact Check to research by the advocacy group Consumers Health Forum of Australia.\n\nThe group's April 2018 survey found more than a quarter of respondents treated for cancer had paid more than $10,000 in out-of-pocket costs in the previous two years. This finding did not distinguish between patients in the public and private systems.\n\nA 2018 peer-reviewed study that investigated two-year treatment costs for Queenslanders with a major cancer found uninsured patients paid $1035 in out-of-pocket treatment costs. Similarly, it did not distinguish between patients in the public and private systems.\n\nPatients spent the most on therapeutic procedures (such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy), followed by consultations, then PBS medicines.\n\nAccording to the 2016 report by Breast Cancer Network, 88 per cent of the women it surveyed paid for out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn theory, patients can elect to choose treatments in the public or private system, but those choices can be constrained.\n\nDr Gillespie noted that people in rural and regional areas, for example, did not always have easy access to public treatment options.\n\nIn 2014, then-director of the National Rural Health Alliance, Gordon Gregory, told a parliamentary inquiry into patient costs that regional patients had to travel further for every treatment and often lacked public transport options.\n\n\"These transport costs\u2014including accommodation, income forgone and logistical complexities\u2014often dwarf standard out-of-pocket costs for families in more remote areas,\" he said.\n\nA 2016 audit by Cancer Council Victoria suggested the average patient in a Victorian metropolitan treatment centre faced car parking costs of $1,100 per year.\n\nThe Deloitte study found that women spent an extra $3,200, on average, on non-clinical costs.\n\u2022 Healthdirect, The public and private hospital systems, accessed May 15, 2019\n\u2022 BCNA, The financial impact of breast cancer, 2016\n\u2022 BCNA, The support and information needs of women with secondary breast cancer, 2015\n\u2022 Deloitte, Financial impacts of breast cancer in Australia (full report), November 2016", "lang": "en"}
