(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt concerns a 2,500-word New York Times article published April 12 that examined the allegation. Following its publication, the Times removed 13 words from one sentence after receiving an objection from the Biden campaign.\n\nThe deleted words were not about the most recent allegation, one that comes from Biden\u2019s former staff assistant, Tara Reade. Rather, the removed portion referred to previously reported descriptions of Biden\u2019s past physical contact with women. These descriptions are elsewhere in the story.\n\nIn a series of media interviews starting with a podcast released March 25, Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her when he was a senator.\n\nShe said the assault occurred in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building in the spring of 1993, when Reade was a 29-year-old staff assistant to Biden. Reade said Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers.\n\nIn April 2019, around the time several other women complained of unwanted physical contact with Biden, Reade told a California newspaper that Biden had inappropriately touched her, but she did not allege any sexual assault.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign denied Reade\u2019s sexual assault allegation. After some Democrats pressed him to respond, the former vice president appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" May 1 and released a statement denying the allegations. \"I\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,\" he said.\n\nThe Times article on the allegation\n\nFor their lengthy April 12 article, New York Times reporters spoke to several people who worked in the Senate office with Reade who said they didn\u2019t recall discussion of such an incident. The Times reported that Reade said she complained about Biden\u2019s behavior but did not mention the alleged assault to Marianne Baker, Biden\u2019s executive assistant, and two top aides, Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman. They declined to take action, Reade said.\n\nTwo friends of Reade\u2019s would only talk to the newspaper if their names weren\u2019t used. One said that Reade told her about the alleged assault in 1993. The other said Reade in 2008 told her that Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she\u2019d had a traumatic experience working in his office.\n\nThe attack on the Times\n\nThe FrontPageMag.com article homed in on a sentence that Times executive editor Dean Baquet said was edited after publication.\n\nThe sentence was found in the sixth paragraph of the New York Times story, which initially read (emphasis ours):\n\n\"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses, and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.\"\n\nFrontPageMag.com claimed the second sentence was \"deleted\" after the article was posted online. Web archives show the sentence was not deleted, but edited so that it ended at \"Biden\":\n\n\"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.\"\n\nThere is no editor\u2019s notation on the online article disclosing the post-publication change.\n\nHere\u2019s what FrontPageMag.com ignores in its analysis:\n\nTwo paragraphs earlier in the Times article, the story reads that, \"Last year, Ms. Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Mr. Biden of kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nNothing about that paragraph was changed.\n\nFrontPageMag published its article on April 14, the day after the Times ran a question-and-answer article in which media columnist Ben Smith interviewed Baquet.\n\nIn the Q&A, Baquet explains why the sentence was trimmed:\n\nSmith: \"I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: \u2018The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.\u2019 Why did you do that?\"\n\nBaquet: \"Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that\u2019s not what the sentence was intended to say.\"\n\nSmith: \"And why not explain that?\"\n\nBaquet: \"We didn\u2019t think it was a factual mistake. I thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn\u2019t something factual we were correcting. So I didn\u2019t think that was necessary.\"\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Baquet responded directly to the FrontPageMag claim, saying that the paper didn\u2019t make the change at Biden\u2019s behest: \"They reached out and questioned the language, and we decided on our own that they had a point. That happens pretty routinely. That head(line) makes it look like they ordered us to change.\n\n\"We didn't do an editor's note because I didn't think the change rose to that level. My honest view is that it has become a large issue because of the politicization of the case, not because this was a huge change. I thought doing an interview with Ben was an honest way to discuss the story, how we made the decision to run it, and why we made the change. Ben asked hard questions and I tried to answer them. I thought that was pretty visible and transparent.\"\n\nAn article from the website of a conservative organization claimed \"New York Times Editor Admits Biden Sexual Assault Story was Censored at Behest of Biden Campaign.\"\n\nThe Times removed 13 words from a 2,500-word story about a new sexual assault allegation against Biden.\n\nThe Times\u2019 editor said that after being contacted by the Biden campaign, the paper deleted, for better clarity, a portion of a sentence that referred to Biden\u2019s previous physical contact with women.\n\nThe same words that were taken out of the sentence remain in the story two paragraphs before, stating that women had spoken out about Biden \"kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nFor a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
