However, none of the known documentation supports Lavrov\u2019s sweeping claim the U.S. plans to \u201csettle forever in Syria.\u201d\n\nAs the leader of a multi-national coalition, the U.S. has for years supported the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and its military wing, the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), which comprises both Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters, in the fight against IS and government forces of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nBut this support does not sit well with either Moscow, which backs Assad, or Ankara, which is engaged in a military offensive against the Syrian Kurds to ensure a Kurdish state does not emerge in northwest Syria or on Turkish territory. Turkey considers the YPG to be the Syrian wing of the outlawed PKK, which has been waging a decades-long insurgency against Turkey. While Washington has designated the PKK as a terrorist group, it has not similarly blacklisted the YPG.\n\nWith the Islamic State (IS) network in Syria nearly decimated and Assad\u2019s forces making territorial gains against the U.S.-backed rebels, critics have increasingly questioned the U.S. plans and presence in Syria, where Russia\u2019s military involvement has made the U.S. goal of removing Assad unachievable.\n\nThe United States, according to Lavrov, now seeks to shape a transition of power in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. are trying to form ... alternative bodies of authority on vast ... parts of the Syrian territory,\u201d contradicting its \u201cown obligations ... to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Syria,\u201d Lavrov said during a UN conference on January 16, adding that this goes against U.S. promises.\n\nConcerns that the U.S. plans to partition Syria date back several years.\n\nIn 2012, a declassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report published by Judicial Watch discussed \u201cthe possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor)\u201d if the situation in the country \u201cunravels.\u201d However, the report did not include a concrete plan to move forward with the idea.\n\nAt the time, the U.S. had no military presence in Syria. That came three years later. It is noteworthy, also, that the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) began setting up government councils in 2012, according to its political ideology of decentralized governance known as \u201cdemocratic confederalism,\u201d long before the U.S. military joined the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe 2012 DIA report did not contemplate a U.S. presence in Syria.\n\nIn 2015-2017, former Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins, former White House Coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region Philip Gordon, and former North Africa head for the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations Jeffrey Martini, penned a four-part study proposing Syria\u2019s de-centralization.\n\n\u201cIt would likely involve granting extensive autonomy, including control over local security, to local authorities,\u201d the study noted, explaining that Syria could be split into four zones \u2013 one controlled by Damascus; one by the Kurds; one by the Sunni opposition; and one by IS.\n\nDobbins\u2019 report suggested the best outcome at the time would have been an agreed-upon cease fire \u201caccompanied by internationally agreed arrangements for its enforcement\u201d \u2013 not a suggestion of a U.S. military presence.\n\nIn 2015, The Hill reported that Israeli security experts had leaked information indicating that Washington and Moscow were in talks aimed at partitioning Syria.\n\n\n\nNotably, the Obama administration considered partitioning Syria if a planned cease-fire failed. \u201cIt may be too late to keep it as a whole Syria if we wait much longer,\u201d John Kerry, then U.S. secretary of state, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in February 2016.\n\n\u201cAssad himself is going to have to make some real decisions about the formation of a transitional government process that is real\u2026there are certainly plan B options being considered,\u201d he added. But Kerry was silent about any increased military involvement and he did not advocate partition.\n\nYet, Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote at the time that the United States was already pursuing plan B: \u201cChanging the demography of any country is the necessary, if not quite sufficient, precondition for partition\u2026the White House\u2019s Plan B for Syria is already its Plan A. The only question is whether this is by accident or by design.\u201d\n\nChris Harmer, an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War, said the partitioning of Syria was unintended outcome of the \u201creactive\u201d policymaking of the United States.\n\nWith anti-IS operations winding down in Syria, some Western experts and advocates believe the U.S. now appears to be looking for ways to anchor its presence in Syria in pursuit of long-standing objectives through new means.\n\nIn January 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would create a 30,000-strong rebel force in northeastern Syria to secure areas under SDF control. \u201cThis will enable the Syrian people to establish effective local, representative governance and reclaim their land,\u201d the coalition said in a supporting statement. Ankara, Damascus, and Moscow criticized the initiative, prompting Washington to backtrack on the idea but continue supporting the SDF.\n\nOfficially, Washington provides such support to prevent IS and al-Qaeda from re-emerging, to resolve the Syrian conflict through a UN-led political process without Assad in power, and to roll back Iran\u2019s influence. Tillerson said in January that stabilization initiatives are essential to these tasks but that he recognized \u201csome Americans are skeptical of continued involvement in Syria.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the need to maintain Syria\u2019s territorial integrity, Tillerson emphasized that \u201cinterim local political arrangements\u201d supporting \u201cbroader political transition must emerge with international support.\u201d\n\nIn their fourth RAND policy study, published late last year, Dobbins, Gordon and Martini emphasized the importance of stabilization assistance and representative local councils to administer it.\n\nThe authors also suggested several areas with local councils already receiving \u201cmodest Western support\u201d as possible locations for reconstruction if Damascus \u201cresisted decentralization.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Research Service reports that Trump administration has requested $191.5 million in FY2018 for assistance and $500 million to train and equip anti-IS forces in Syria.", "lang": "en"}
