The Fox News personality is currently on a publicity tour for his new book Killing Patton, the fourth installment in the Fox host\u2019s nonfiction Killing series.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News\u2019 Media Buzz, O\u2019Reilly crowed about his ability to draw large television audiences.\n\nif he was ready to stop referring to himself as a \"lonely outsider\" since he\u2019s appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman and chatting with mainstream news hosts like Katie Couric of Yahoo! News and ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. Is he one of them now?\n\n\"It\u2019s not a matter of being accepted, it\u2019s about success,\" O\u2019Reilly explained. \"And I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up. That's why they have me on.\"\n\nBecause we were curious, we wondered about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s rating power when he appears on other shows. We focused on Letterman\u2019s Late Show to make the exercise more manageable.\n\nWe found 15 O\u2019Reilly Late Show appearances since 2001 using the (IMDB) and searching transcripts. We then pulled data for the number of estimated viewers for those shows from Nielsen Media Research, a company that tracks consumers patterns and TV viewership.\n\nWe measured the number of viewers who watched O\u2019Reilly\u2019s appearances against the average of viewers who watched the same day of the week that season, as well as against the Late Show\u2019s annual calendar average.\n\nA couple of quirks about the data: CBS provided Nielsen data for average weekday viewers in terms of broadcast years, which run from September to September and include repeat shows. Nielsen provided average viewers for the calendar year, excluding specials and repeats. The show is on five nights a week, including repeats, so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge matter.\n\nAlso, some ratings for 2014 are not available because Nielsen is still re-evaluating its data following a from the last seven months.\n\nIn the chart below, we shaded appearances in which O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings outnumbered either the weekday average for the season or the annual average. As you\u2019ll see, O\u2019Reilly is largely correct: He usually beats the seasonal weekday average of viewers as well as the calendar year average.\n\nOf 14 appearances with data since 2001, Late Show episodes featuring O\u2019Reilly outperformed the average number of viewers by both measures 10 times.\n\nAn 11th appearance, on Oct. 27, 2008, drew about 140,000 more viewers than the calendar year average but about 20,000 fewer than the Monday average during the 2008-09 season.\n\nPut another way, the shows in which O\u2019Reilly touted a recent book or offered political commentary exceeded the show\u2019s weekday and calendar year average 70 percent of the time.\n\nCBS would not comment on whether it invites O\u2019Reilly to boost ratings.\n\nIn a trademark moment of non-modesty, O\u2019Reilly bragged about his effect as a guest star on mainstream broadcast shows.\n\n\"I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up,\" he said.\n\nLooking strictly at Letterman\u2019s Late Show, to keep things simple, we found he has a point. Using available data, we found O\u2019Reilly beat the average ratings for the comparable day of the week and calendar year 10 or 11 times out of 14 show appearances with data.\n\nIn this specific case, booking O\u2019Reilly isn\u2019t a sure bet for better ratings. But it\u2019s a pretty safe one. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
