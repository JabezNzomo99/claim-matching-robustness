They do say, \u201cA judge should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment.\u201d But it\u2019s a stretch to imagine this broad admonition should have led Kennedy to recuse himself from hearing Trump cases, even if the code of conduct applied to the Supreme Court. By Tanden\u2019s logic, the appearance of bias could paralyze the government, since officials would have to keep tabs on the finances of their grown children and recuse themselves from matters that could be associated with their children\u2019s sources of income.", "lang": "en"}
