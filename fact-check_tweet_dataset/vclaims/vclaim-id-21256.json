Period,\u201d Nielsen wrote in a tweet on June 17.\n\nA day later, she doubled down on that statement during a press briefing when she said that \u201cthis administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.\u201d At the same time, however, she acknowledged that there has been a change in policy that effectively leads to such separations.\n\n\n\nThe fact is, Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly announced a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d on illegal immigration in April, and stated on May 7 that DHS \u201cis now referring 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.\u201d Sessions may not say that family separation is the intent, but that\u2019s exactly what happens when immigrants are referred for criminal prosecution. (Under federal law, illegal entry is a misdemeanor, and illegal reentry is a felony.)\n\nThat results in children being separated from their parents when the adults are sent to federal court and detained under the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. The children cannot be held in detention facilities for adults, so they are referred to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement. That agency assumes responsibility for \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d until they can be placed with other family members in the country or in foster care.\n\nDHS told us the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy went into effect on May 5, and between May 5 and June 9, there had been 2,342 children separated from their parents.\n\nContrary to what Nielsen claimed, other administration officials have acknowledged a change in policy to serve as a deterrent to illegal immigration.\n\nEarly last year, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Nielsen\u2019s predecessor as Homeland Security secretary, indicated that DHS was considering splitting up parents and children as a strategy to deter other families from illegally immigrating to the U.S. He suggested that was still the motivation last month when he told NPR that family separation \u201ccould be a tough deterrent\u201d for others considering trying to cross the border illegally.\n\nStephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, told the New York Times this month: \u201cIt was a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, period. The message is that no one is exempt from immigration law.\u201d\n\nAnd in a speech on June 18, Sessions, the head of the Justice Department, said that \u201cwe do have a policy of prosecuting adults who flout our laws to come here illegally instead of waiting their turn or claiming asylum at any port of entry. He added, \u201cWe cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws.\u201d\n\nEven Nielsen has admitted that there has been a shift from the approach taken by previous administrations. She acknowledged that during the same press briefing where she denied the existence of a policy separating families.\n\nNielsen, June 18: What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law. Everyone is subject to prosecution. When DHS refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the U.S. Marshals Service custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge. And any accompanied child will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child. That is in accordance with the TVPRA \u2014 a law that was passed by Congress \u2014 and a following court order, neither which are actions the Trump administration has taken.\n\nIn her remarks, Nielsen insisted that separations at the border are occurring as the result of either legal rulings or a decade-old law passed by Congress.\n\nBut there is no law that requires family separation at the Southwest border, as we wrote last month when President Donald Trump said \u201cwe have to break up families\u201d because of \u201cbad laws that the Democrats gave us.\u201d\n\nImmigration policy experts told us that the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bring criminal charges against the parents \u2014 rather than follow the civil immigration removal process \u2014 is what has caused the separations.\n\n\u201cIt is the government\u2019s choice whether to criminally prosecute someone for illegal entry or reentry,\u201d said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\n\u201cHistorically, most immigrants were not prosecuted, even when the law allowed for it, they were simply removed in civil proceedings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe significant uptick in criminal prosecution began under President George W. Bush, and continued through the early Obama administration.\u201d\n\nDHS argues that it is unable to detain families together for as long as necessary because of court rulings pertaining to a 1997 legal settlement, as well as a 2008 antitrafficking law affecting minors who are apprehended at the border without a parent present.\n\u2022 , DHS could detain unaccompanied children captured at the border for only 20 days before releasing them to foster families, shelters or sponsors, pending resolution of their immigration cases. The settlement was later through other court rulings to include both unaccompanied and accompanied children.\n\u2022 None from countries other than Mexico and Canada to be placed in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or relatives in the U.S., while they go through removal proceedings. The bipartisan bill by unanimous consent and signed by President George W. Bush, a Republican.\n\nThe 2016 ruling confirming that the Flores settlement applied to unaccompanied and accompanied minors limited how long children could be detained in family detention centers, which were used during the Bush administration and then expanded under Obama in 2014.\n\nBut neither the legal settlement or the 2008 law requires the Trump administration to \u201cbreak up families.\u201d\n\nThey require the government to release children from custody after a certain period of detainment, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. But they don\u2019t require that parents continue to be held in immigration detention.\n\n\u201cThe government absolutely has the option to release the parents,\u201d as well, Pierce said. That\u2019s as long as they aren\u2019t a flight or safety risk, she added.\n\nIn fact, in April, the Washington Post reported that during its first 15 months, the Trump administration released nearly 100,000 people who had been caught entering the U.S. illegally. That included more than 37,500 unaccompanied minors and 61,000 family members, the newspaper said.\n\nBut during the press briefing this week, Nielsen said that it\u2019s Congress that needs to act to fix the current situation.\n\n\u201cCongress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.\u201d\n\nCongress could pass a bill to allow DHS to detain families together for an extended period of time during the removal process, Peter Margulies, professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us in an interview.\n\nSenate Republicans are reportedly working on legislation to do that.\n\nStill, there is nothing that requires the administration to continue prosecuting parents, either, Margulies said.\n\nAnd a new law wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop the separation of families.\n\n\u201cIf the administration continues to move toward prosecuting all illegal entry and reentry violations by parents who enter the United States with their children and jailing the parents before trial, rather than using one of these alternatives to detention, they will continue to separate the parents from the children,\u201d David FitzGerald, co-director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, wrote in an email to us. \u201cIf the parents are then sentenced to a jail term, that will cause parental separation as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as prosecutions are happening it will require family separations. And that was a question that Sec Nielsen did not answer\u201d at the June 18 press briefing, Brown wrote in an email. \u201cThat is, if Congress changes those laws and closes the loopholes, the administration has not said it will end its zero tolerance policy.\u201d\n\nWe asked DHS if it would end its policy of referring all illegal border crossing cases for prosecution, but we did not receive a response. Trump said on June 20 that he would sign an executive order later that day to \u201ckeep families together.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
