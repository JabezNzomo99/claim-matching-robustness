Mattarella\u2019s interpreter was not visibly present when Trump made his remark about Ancient Rome.\n\nTrump met with the Italian president to discuss trade and several other topics on Oct. 16. They spoke to the press at three public events \u2013 before their bilateral meeting, during a joint press conference and at a reception.\n\nMattarella\u2019s interpreter, some noted, appeared to react on camera to a few of Trump\u2019s statements. This Facebook post alleges that the interpreter, identified as Elisabetta Savigni-Ullmann in media reports, visibly reacted to Trump saying the U.S. and Italy \u201chave been allies since Ancient Rome.\u201d\n\nContrary to what the Facebook post claims, Trump never said the U.S.-Italy alliance dates back to that time period. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Trump\u2019s Parents Wearing KKK Robes)\n\nA search of transcripts from all three events show that Trump only said the words \u201cAncient Rome\u201d one time, and that instance occurred during his joint press conference with Mattarella.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome,\u201d Trump actually said. \u201cOver the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture, and music.\u201d\n\nFurther adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness, video shows no interpreter visibly present behind the two presidents during the joint press conference. Mattarella presumably received translations of Trump\u2019s statements through the headphones he was wearing at the time.\n\nSavigni-Ullmann could only be seen sitting behind the two presidents in footage of their remarks before their bilateral meeting. The screenshots of her supposed reactions appear to come from broadcasts of that brief meeting with the press before their closed-door talks.", "lang": "en"}
