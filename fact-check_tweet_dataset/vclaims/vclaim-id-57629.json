Doors and windows should remain closed as 5 helicopters spray disinfectants into the air to eradicate the coronavirus. Please process this information to all of your contacts\u201d\n\nThis is a version of a fake announcement that has been shared all over the world since at least 10 March 2020, when it was first seen in Italy. Fact checkers there could not find any source for the information, nor any sign that spraying with helicopters was part of a local or national plan.\n\nResearch by Dr Peter Burger, an academic and fact checker in the Netherlands, shows that the helicopter story quickly spread to many countries, by text message and WhatsApp, and through other forms of social media. Different versions have been debunked by fact checkers all over the world.\n\nIn a message to Full Fact, Dr Burger said the rumour \u201creached citizens all over the world in a mere two weeks. From Colombia to Egypt, Kuwait, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands: everywhere the story was adapted to local circumstances, and fitted with fake credentials (i.e. logos of police forces, army, air force, etc.).\u201d\n\nSpecific details like the time (11:40pm) and the number of helicopters (five) have often remained the same even as the rumour moved from country to country.\n\nThe rumour has now reached the UK. There is no evidence that it is any more true here than in any other country.", "lang": "en"}
