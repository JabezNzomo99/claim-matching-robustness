It is pointing to Egypt\u2014specifically the Sinai peninsula. Israel is northeast from this location in the Middle East and is part of the continent of Asia.\n\nThe idea of Israel being part of Africa stems from the beliefs of Hebrew Israelites\u2014a movement founded in the US who believe that Africans are descendants from the ancient tribes of Israel.\n\nHebrew Israelites claim Israel as northeast Africa, in part due to the fact that Israel sits on the African tectonic plate, which is true.", "lang": "en"}
