What are the eagles doing here? can anyone explain why are these eagles roaming here?\u2026..from last five years they are not getting employment, who is the reason for that? Modi is the reason for that, RSS is the reason for that, BJP is the reason -translated\u201d.\n\nSurat BJP MLA Harsh Sanghvi tweeted the 33-second video clip and said, \u201c\u0915\u094b\u0907 \u0924\u094b \u0930\u094b\u0915 \u0932\u094b \u0907\u0938\u0915\u094b (Someone at least stop him -translated)\u201d. The tweet was later taken down. An archived version can be accessed here.\n\nSeveral other people on Twitter and Facebook shared the video mocking Gandhi. Facebook page India 272+, which was part of BJP\u2019s 2014 election campaign, also posted the video on February 9, 2020. At the time of writing this article, it garnered close to 4,500 shares.\n\nThe video has a number of edits and jump-cuts thus easily comes across as an amalgamation of several clips into one video. The sequence in which Gandhi\u2019s statements are shown in the above video is not uniform and incongruous. With a keyword search on YouTube, Alt News found the complete speech given by Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi during an election campaign on February 5.\n\nThe Congress leader begins by saying that the country\u2019s harmony, peace and brotherhood has disrupted. He then asks a rhetorical question and claims that several people will say that RSS, BJP and Narendra Modi are the reason behind the disruption. Later, he emphasized that the youth of this country don\u2019t have a direction and that there is a lack of employment.\n\nHe makes the eagle reference after he claims, \u201cModi has given 3,50,000 crore to people like Ambani and Adani.\u201d At 8:40 minutes, he says, \u201cOk brother, tell me what are these eagles doing here, why are they flying here? Can anybody explain why are these eagles roaming here? This dirt, How many crores will be needed to remove this dirt? 5 crore, a 10-year-old kid is saying 5, 10 crores. Ok, it will take 50 crores. Narendra Modiji, a few days back, has waived off Rs 1,30,000 crores taxes for the richest men of India. You people stay in the dirt for 24 hours and they will live in castles and aeroplanes\u201d.\n\nAn edited video of Rahul Gandhi was shared by several social media users including BJP Gujarat MLA Harsh Sanghvi. Many of them mocked the Congress leader believing that he was talking about, as bizarre as it sounds, the unemployment of eagles.", "lang": "en"}
