But the posts are misleading. The photo of Somad was taken three months before the presidential election ballot numbers were announced and does not have any link to the upcoming polls.\n\nOne of the posts that shared the image was this February 8 entry captioned: \u201cUstadz Abdul Somad has returned to the right path. Do follow him if you want the country to be safe. Vote for Jokowi who has the cleric\u2019s support. The number 02 must have been panicked by this news.\u201d\n\nJokowi is Widodo\u2019s popular nickname. Widodo\u2019s ballot number is 01 and raising one finger is seen as a mark of support for his campaign.\n\nHis sole rival in presidential elections in April is retired general Prabowo Subianto, whose ballot number is 02.\n\nSomad, a Muslim cleric who has 7.5 million followers on Instagram, is the man in the center of the photograph.\n\nA Google Reverse Image search showed that the photograph was taken and posted online some three months before Indonesia\u2019s General Elections Commission (KPU) announced the ballot numbers for the presidential election.\n\nKPU announced the ballot numbers on September 21, 2018, after a draw held the same day, according to this Jakarta Post report. KPU\u2019s own announcement can be seen on this post on its official website.\n\nThe photo of three men was posted online on June 24, 2018 by Twitter user @Umar_Hasibuan, who says the photograph shows him, Somad and Musa Rajekshah, who was then a candidate running to be the deputy governor of North Sumatra province.\n\nHasibuan is the man wearing glasses on the left of the image and Musa Rajekshah is on the right of the photo.\n\nMusa Rajekshah\u2019s ballot number was 01 in the local race, according to reports in local media, for example here.\n\nThe tweet, dated June 24, 2018, translates as: \u201cThis is me with Ustad Abdul Somad Batubara and @musarajekshah, the North Sumatra deputy governor candidate. Hopefully the police, the intelligence agency and Indonesian Army will stay neutral in the province\u2019s election on June 27.\u201d\n\nAfter the misleading Facebook posts began to appear February 8, 2019, Hasibuan, who has more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, tweeted a clarification about the photograph.\n\n\u201cI need to clarify about this photo. This photo was taken when Ustad Somad and North Sumatra deputy governor visited my Islamic boarding school. At that time, the deputy governor was campaigning in the North Sumatra Election as candidate with ballot number 1, that\u2019s why we posed for a photo by raising one finger. This photo does not have any link at all with supporting Jokowi. Please don\u2019t slander Ustad Somad and the North Sumatra deputy governor.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
