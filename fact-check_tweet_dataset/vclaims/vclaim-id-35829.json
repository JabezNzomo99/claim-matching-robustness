That\u2019s his opinion, but he falsely supports it by claiming Stone did \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cnobody even can define what he did.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department summed it up this way in November when the jury rendered its verdict: \u201cStone was found guilty of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress, and tampering with a witness.\u201d\n\nAll of the charges stemmed from Stone\u2019s attempts to thwart the House intelligence committee\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the Department of Justice recommended a sentence ranging from 87 months to 108 months, or roughly seven to nine years, saying \u201c[o]bstructing such critical investigations \u2026 strikes at the very heart of our American democracy.\u201d Trump objected on Twitter, and a day later the department filed an updated sentencing recommendation memo that left the decision up to the judge \u2014 resulting in four federal prosecutors to withdrawing from the case.\n\nTrump praised Attorney General William Barr in a Feb. 12 tweet \u201cfor taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought.\u201d (Barr later said Trump\u2019s tweets are making it \u201cimpossible for me to do my job.\u201d)\n\nTrump made numerous remarks to reporters and on Twitter about Stone\u2019s case, saying his friend was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d by prosecutors. When asked if he is considering pardoning Stone, who is due to be sentenced Feb. 20, Trump responded:\n\nBut federal prosecutors, beginning with special counsel Robert Mueller, clearly defined what Stone did and how it interfered with the investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nMueller concluded in a March 2019 report that \u201c[t]he Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d to help Trump win the election. The Russians did this in two ways:\n\nIt\u2019s Russia\u2019s second campaign \u2014 its successful hacking operations \u2014 that resulted in legal troubles for Trump\u2019s ally and informal campaign adviser.\n\nThe federal investigation uncovered a sophisticated hacking operation by a unit responsible for intelligence collection for the Russian military. The Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, \u201chacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees, and volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign,\u201d the Mueller report said. Among other things, the GRU gained access to more than 30 computers on the Democratic National Committee network and \u201cstole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe GRU then publicly released the stolen emails and documents \u201cthrough two fictitious online personas that it created \u2014 DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 and later through the organization WikiLeaks,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to the Mueller report, \u201cThe release of the documents was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.\u201d The Trump campaign also took political advantage of the hacked material.\n\n\u201cAccording to [Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick] Gates, by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks,\u201d the report said.\n\nAt Stone\u2019s trial, Gates testified that in April 2016 Stone privately told him that \u201cWikiLeaks would be submitting or dropping information\u201d that could help the Trump campaign. That was about three months before WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 DNC emails \u2014 the first of document dumps that eventually exceeded more than 44,000 emails and 17,000 attachments, as WikiLeaks says on its website.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, testified during the trial that the campaign saw Stone as its potential \u201caccess point\u201d to WikiLeaks.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, Stone tweeted, \u201cI have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon #LockHerUp.\u201d Assange is WikiLeaks\u2019 founder. That same day, Matthew Boyle, the Washington editor of Breitbart, sent Stone a text message that said, \u201cAssange \u2014 what\u2019s he got? Hope it\u2019s good.\u201d Stone replied, \u201cIt is. I\u2019d tell Bannon but he doesn\u2019t call me back.\u201d Four days later, WikiLeaks released a batch of emails belonging to Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta.\n\nAt the time of the congressional investigation, the House intelligence committee, among other things, was trying to determine whether Stone had insider knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 release of the emails and documents.\n\nAccording to the Feb. 10 sentencing memo, Stone made at least five public statements from Aug. 8, 2016, to Aug. 18, 2016, that indicated he had a source connected to Assange. The committee asked Stone to name the person he was referring to in those early- to mid-August statements. Stone told the House committee it was radio host Randy Credico, who had interviewed Assange on Aug. 25, 2016.\n\nBut that was a lie, according to the evidence prosecutors presented at the trial, including Credico\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cStone and Credico did not even discuss Assange until August 19, 2016, when Credico told Stone that he was trying to book Assange on his radio show,\u201d the Feb. 10 sentencing memo says.\n\nStone was actually referring to Jerome Corsi, a conservative author. \u201c[T]he intermediary or backchannel that Stone referenced in his August 2016 public statements was Corsi,\u201d the memo says.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2016, Corsi told Stone in an email that WikiLeaks planned to release \u201cvery damaging\u201d information about Clinton.\n\n\u201cWord is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I\u2019m back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging.\u2026 Time to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton],\u201d Corsi wrote in that email. \u201cThat appears to be the game hackers are now about.\u201d\n\nIt was after exchanging this and other emails with Corsi in late July and early August that Stone began making \u201ca series of public statements that he was in contact with Assange, and that he knew what information Assange was planning to release.\u201d\n\nStone, for example, told an audience at an Aug. 8, 2016, event held by the Southwest Broward Republican Organization that he had \u201ccommunicated with Assange.\u201d Stone told the group, \u201cI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there\u2019s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also presented evidence that showed how Stone threatened and bullied Credico in an attempt to prevent him from testifying before the House committee and contradicting Stone\u2019s earlier committee testimony. Credico testified that Stone threatened him and used references to the \u201cGodfather\u201d movies to pressure him not to talk to Congress, according to Politico\u2019s account of the trial.\n\nStone\u2019s threats, which were successful, ultimately resulted in his witness tampering conviction.\n\nStone \u201cengaged in witness tampering by urging Credico either to corroborate this false account, or to tell the Committee that he could not remember the relevant events, or to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid testifying before the Committee,\u201d the Justice Department said in a press release after Stone\u2019s conviction. \u201cCredico ultimately invoked his Fifth Amendment right in response to a Committee subpoena.\u201d\n\nStone also lied when he told the House committee \u201cthat he had no written communications with his intermediary and that he had no written communications referencing Assange,\u201d according to the Feb. 10 sentencing memo.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Stone exchanged numerous text messages and emails about WikiLeaks with both Corsi (the actual intermediary) and Credico (the person Stone falsely identified as his intermediary),\u201d the memo says.\n\nAs a result of Stone\u2019s false statements, the committee did not subpoena any documents from him \u2014 which had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d not only on the committee\u2019s investigation but the federal criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cWhen the FBI began investigating Stone\u2019s conduct in 2018, the text messages between Stone and Credico from November 2016 to November 2017, which the Committee surely would have subpoenaed if Stone had told the truth about their existence, were gone,\u201d the sentencing memo says.\n\nStone also lied when he told the House committee that he \u201cdid not ask the intermediary to do anything on Stone\u2019s behalf,\u201d the memo says. \u201cIn fact, as early as July 2016, Stone told Corsi to \u2018get to Assange\u2019 and \u2018get the pending wikileaks emails.'\u201d\n\nStone also lied when he said \u201che had never discussed his conversations with the person he referred to as his \u2026 \u2018intermediary\u2019 with anyone involved in the Trump Campaign,\u201d the Feb. 10 sentencing memo says. \u201cIn fact, Stone had conversations with Gates, Bannon, and Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort about information that he had received from Corsi and Credico.\u201d Also, federal prosecutors submitted Stone\u2019s phone records that showed more than 150 calls with Manafort, more than 120 with Gates and 60 with Trump, as Politico reported.\n\nIn initially presenting their case for Stone to serve up to nine years in prison, the federal prosecutors said his \u201cobstructive conduct\u201d was \u201ca direct and brazen attack on the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cStone was not compelled to testify falsely before Congress. He could have told the truth, or he could have declined the invitation to testify altogether,\u201d the memo says. \u201cInstead, Stone chose another option: he lied to Congress and then he tampered with a witness who could expose those lies. Stone\u2019s goal, at the outset, was to obstruct the Committee\u2019s search for the truth.\u201d\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s remarks, Stone\u2019s crimes are defined under \u201c18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 (count 1); making numerous false statements to Congress in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2) (counts 2-6); and witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) (count 7),\u201d according to the sentencing memo.\n\nTitle 18, Section 1505 makes it illegal if anyone \u201cwillfully withholds\u201d any documents or \u201cmisrepresents\u201d any answers in testimony before any investigation \u201cby either House, or any committee of either House.\u201d This carries a penalty of not more than five years.\n\nTitle 18, Section 1001 (a)(2) makes it a crime to make \u201cany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d to Congress or any other branch of the federal government. This also carries a penalty of up to five years.\n\nTitle 18, Section 1512(b)(1) makes it illegal to \u201cinfluence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding.\u201d Witness tampering is the most serious of the charges, carrying a penalty of no more than 20 years.\n\nIn the Feb. 10 sentencing memo, under the heading of \u201cThe Seriousness of the Offense,\u201d the prosecutors quote the Federalist Papers on the danger of foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cForeign election interference is the \u2018most deadly adversar[y] of republican government.\u2019 Federalist Papers No. 68 (Hamilton),\u201d the memo says. \u201cInvestigations into election interference concern our national security, the integrity of our democratic processes, and the enforcement of our nation\u2019s criminal laws. These are issues of paramount concern to every citizen of the United States. Obstructing such critical investigations thus strikes at the very heart of our American democracy.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Feb. 20: U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison, saying the court has to send a message about the severity of Stone\u2019s crimes. \u201cWitnesses do not get to decide for themselves whether Congress is entitled to the facts,\u201d Jackson said.", "lang": "en"}
