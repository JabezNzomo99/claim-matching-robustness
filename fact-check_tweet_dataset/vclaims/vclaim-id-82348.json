Its virality suggests that the clip has been forwarded on WhatsApp as well.\n\nThe video does not depict a terror attack in Tirupati Tirumala bypass road. It is, in fact, of a mock drill conducted by Telangana police\u2019s OCTOPUS team in Warangal district. A local news channel NTV Telugu reported the training exercise on January 12, 2019. At about 3:08 minutes of the channel\u2019s broadcast, the clip viral on social media can be seen.\n\nThe mock drill was also reported by other mainstream media outlets in the southern states. Telangana Todayreported on January 11 \u2013 \u201cIn order to send a message to the people that the police force is always ready to rescue them in case of any terrorist attack, the personnel of the elite commando force Octopus (Organisation for Counter Terrorist Operations) with the assistance of the local police have conducted a mock drill at the famous Bhadrakali temple.\u201d\n\nThe report also mentioned that the \u201csudden arrival of the Octopus forces wearing the black dress carrying the most advanced weapons\u201d shocked devotees and local people. However, they calmed down after the police informed that it was only a mock drill by the force.\n\nBoomliveearlier fact-check the viral claim and also spoke to Mohan Krishna, PRO of Warangal police Commissionerate, who informed that the OCTOPUS team held two mock drills in Warangal, the Bhadrakali temple and near the junction of MGM hospital, on January 11. \u201cWe are shocked to know that the video from mock drill is being spread as terror attack. It was only a mock drill involving highly skilled commandos. There is nothing to worry about,\u201d said Krishna.\n\nSocial media claims suggesting that the video depicts terrorists nabbed in Tirupathi Tirumala bypass road are, therefore, completely false. Earlier, another police mock drill in Jharkhand was shared as MP police firing at farmers in Mandsaur.", "lang": "en"}
