It was taken in San Juan River, a tributary of the Pasig River.\n\nIts \u201cbastos time\u201d comparison was an undated file photo by the now-defunct Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC), an early copy of which can be found in an October 2018 Interaksyon report. Duterte abolished the PRRC in November 2019.\n\nThe photo showing a trash-filled Manila Bay was taken in the aftermath of Typhoon Ompong (international name: Mangkhut), which hit the area in September 2018. It was published by The Philippine Star.\n\nIts \u201cbastos time\u201d counterpart showing a person taking a selfie on a spotless Manila Bay shore was taken from another Star article in January 2019.\n\nThis was not the first time the Ompong photo of Manila Bay was claimed to be from the time of the Aquino administration. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FB post MISLEADS with \u2018before and after\u2019 rehab photo of Manila Bay; both were taken under Duterte's watch)\n\nAn iteration of the \u201cbastos\u201d and \u201cdisente\u201d time comparison of Manila Bay is also currently making rounds, published by a netizen and FB page DDS Drei Nato, and amplified by MOCHA USON BLOG.\n\nWhile it used the same post-Ompong image as a \u201cdesinte (sic) time\u201d photo, a netizen\u2019s January 2019 picture of a clean Manila Bay at sunset was used as its \u201cbastos time\u201d comparison.\n\nLastly, the \u201cdisente time\u201d image of the algae-filled shore of Boracay was taken from ABS-CBN\u2019s April 2018 article on the Boracay island rehabilitation.\n\nIt was juxtaposed with its \u201cbastos time\u201d counterpart, an aerial view of one of the island\u2019s shorelines, taken from stock image hosting site Shutterstock. One of its earliest, un-watermarked uploads was published by blog Appreciate Goods on March 2, 2017.\n\nThinking Pinoy\u2019s version of the post has been shared over 23,000 times, Duterte Social Media Supporter\u2019s more than 5,600 times. DDS Drei Natabio\u2019s misleading iteration of the Manila Bay post received over 41,000 shares.\n\nThe inaccurate uploads surfaced after Cuneta made her statement about \u201cdecency\u201d on June 29.\n\n(Editor's Note: This story was updated to reflect that President Rodrigo Duterte's term began noontime of June 30, 2016. An earlier version of this story stated Duterte took office in July 2016.)", "lang": "en"}
