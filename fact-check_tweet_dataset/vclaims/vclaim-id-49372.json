I don\u2019t believe they want anything to do with me. I don\u2019t want no (white) friends. It\u2019s me and my boys.\"\n\nThis image and this one have also racked up thousands of shares, linking the comment to an episode of \"The Shop,\" an HBO talk show that launched in 2018.\n\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nJames did say this, but the quote is cut short and leaves out crucial context.\n\nThe quote does originate from the Aug. 28, 2018, pilot episode of \"The Shop,\" which James co-produced. But he makes the comment while reflecting on his feelings in high school. James tweeted a clip that contains the full quote the same day.\n\nIn the episode, former high school teammate and current business partner Maverick Carter asked James to explain his transition from a predominantly non-white childhood neighborhood to the largely white St. Vincent-St. Mary Catholic high school in Akron, Ohio.\n\nJames said, \"I went to an all-white, Catholic high school. So when I first went to the ninth grade I was on some, \u2018I\u2019m not f***ing with white people.\u2019\"\n\nHe went on to tell Carter that growing up in his neighborhood led him to think that white people didn\u2019t want anything to do with him or his friends, and that they did not want them to succeed. In the hierarchy of race in his high school, white people were at the top and Black people were at the bottom, he said.\n\nThe only reason he was there was to play basketball, James said. \"I don\u2019t want nothing to do with white people. I don\u2019t believe that they want anything to do with \u2014 it\u2019s me and my boys. We're going to high school together and we\u2019re here to hoop. So that was my initial thoughts and shocks to like white America,\" he said.\n\nJames has been open about his experiences growing up poor and how it contributed to his drive for success. By the end of freshman year, Carter went on to say in the clip from \"The Shop,\" the initial feelings of separation from white students dwindled as the basketball season progressed.\n\n\"By the end of the year, all of us were best friends,\" Carter said.\n\nOther news outlets reported on the quote after the show's premiere, and Reuters fact-checked similar posts more recently.\n\nFacebook posts quote LeBron James saying that he does not want to associate himself with white people.\n\nThe posts leave out crucial context: When James said this, he was reflecting on how he felt as a freshman in high school when he entered a predominantly white high school. Later in school, James recalled, he became friends with his white peers in the school.", "lang": "en"}
