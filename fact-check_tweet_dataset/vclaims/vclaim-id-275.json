Other iterations include a screenshot of Trump quoting the claim on Twitter ( here ).\n\nBarack Obama has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, calling it \u201cchaotic\u201d, in a leaked conference call with former members of his administration ( here ).\n\nOn May 10, Trump tweeted \u201cOBAMAGATE!\u201d ( here ) in response to Obama\u2019s comments, prompting his followers to make the hashtag a trending topic ( here ).\n\nThe claim that Obama is the first former president to criticize his successor, however, is false. Multiple former presidents have done so including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn 2015, George W. Bush publicly criticized his successor, Barack Obama. \u201cAccording to multiple reports on a closed-door Saturday event with Jewish donors,\u201d Business Insider reported, \u201cBush offered his harshest public assessment of President Barack Obama's foreign policy.\u201d ( here )\n\nIn 2007, amid Hillary Clinton\u2019s first bid for U.S. president, her husband and former president Bill Clinton, criticized then President George W. Bush\u2019s administration for failing in Iraq, saying there was no evidence of much-needed political or diplomatic progress ( here ).\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that, whether we have a good day in a particular community or region in Iraq, that we have either the political reconciliation process within the country working or any diplomatic process that\u2019s got a chance to help with the neighbors,\u201d the former Democratic president said.\n\nIn 1982, Jimmy Carter responded to criticisms by his successor, Ronald Reagan, accusing Reagan of \u201cnot accepting his responsibilities\u201d as president, the New York Times reported ( here ).\n\nAccording to the Times, a few days previously Reagan had blamed the Carter Administration for the recession and said that when he took office, \u201cwe found America in the worst economic mess since the days of Franklin Roosevelt.\u201d\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was critical of his successor, Jimmy Carter, according to a New York Times article from June 24, 1979 ( here ).\n\nFord was \u201ccritical of his successor\u2019s fiscal \u2014 and energy policies\u201d but said that he would not seek the Republican Presidential nomination, the Times reported.\n\nThe Eisenhower National Historic Site has also stated that Eisenhower expressed dislike towards his successor, John F. Kennedy.\n\nAfter Kennedy\u2019s victory in the election, he reportedly stated with sarcasm, \"We have a new genius in our midst who is incapable of making any mistakes and therefore deserving of no criticism whatsoever\u201d ( here ).\n\nFalse. Barack Obama is not the first former president to criticize his successor.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
