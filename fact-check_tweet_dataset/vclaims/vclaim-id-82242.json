That law expanded the definition of \u201cfederal records\u201d to specifically include electronic communications and clarified the responsibilities of federal government officials when they use nongovernment e-mail systems. The responsibilities include copying an official record, such as an e-mail, or forwarding a complete copy of the e-mail within 20 days of transmission.\n\nBut that does not mean that, when Clinton was secretary of state, there were not already in place State Department rules on how to handle e-mails and whether to use a personal e-mail account. While Clinton says that other secretaries \u201cdid the same thing,\u201d none had set up an exclusive and private e-mail server for all of their departmental communications. (In fact, only Colin L. Powell has ever said he sent e-mails from a personal account, so Clinton\u2019s use of plural is misleading.)\n\nThe rules also quickly became clearer. In 2009, just eight months after Clinton became secretary of state, the U.S. Code of federal regulations on handling electronic records was updated: \u201cAgencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.\u201d The responsibility for making and preserving the records is assigned to \u201cthe head of each federal agency.\u201d\n\nThe issue thus becomes whether Clinton cooperated in the spirit of the laws and rules in place at the time. Clinton suggests that \u201cwhen I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into the government system\u201d and so that signified compliance with the requirement to maintain federal records. But her practice made it difficult to locate records in response to specific requests, because Clinton\u2019s e-mail would be in another official\u2019s inbox \u2014 but would not exist in the federal system as part of Clinton\u2019s outbox. An official\u2019s outbox would be the first place that people seeking records would look.\n\nDeparting employees are also reminded they may take with them only personal papers and non-record materials, subject to review by records officers to ensure compliance with federal records laws and regulations. All federal records generated by employees, including senior officials, belong to the Department of State. In addition to the responsibility for preserving the documentation of official activities insofar as it is captured in email, employees generally should not use private e-mail accounts (e.g., Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc.) for official business. However, in those very limited circumstances when it becomes necessary to do so, the email messages covering official business sent from or received in a personal account must be captured and preserved in one of the Department\u2019s official electronic records systems. \u2026The best way for employees to ensure this is to forward e-mail messages from a private account to their respective State account.\n\nIndeed, well before this directive was issued \u2014 and before Clinton joined the Obama administration \u2014 the Foreign Affairs Manual made it clear that before a senior official (such as a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee) departs government service, he or she must prepare an inventory of personal papers that are proposed for removal. The manual states that \u201ccorrespondence or e-mail received or sent in an employee\u2019s capacity as a Department official is not personal.\u201d\n\nClinton certainly failed to live up to that requirement, as she had retained those e-mail records for nearly two years after she left office before returning them to the State Department. The Clinton campaign suggests she could determine what actually was a federal record, but her State Department-related emails did not fall in that category.\n\nIn reality, Clinton\u2019s decision to use a private e-mail system for official business was highly unusual and flouted State Department procedures, even if not expressly prohibited by law at the time. Moreover, while she claims \u201ceverything I did was permitted,\u201d she appears to have not complied with the requirement to turn over her business-related e-mails before she left government service. That\u2019s a major misstep that she has not acknowledged.", "lang": "en"}
