It is being claimed that the incident occurred in Mumbai when an auto driver, angered with the recent fare drop for BEST buses running between BKC and station, wrecked a bus after Friday\u2019s Namaaz.\n\nThe corresponding message reads, \u201cJumme ki namaz ke baad \u2026.auto wale ne BKC me khadi BEST ki bus ki todfod ki \u2026kyuki wo log ne low rate me BKC to Stn seva start ki (After Friday\u2019s prayers, an auto driver smashed a BEST bus because the rate between BKC to the station has been lowered.)\u201d\n\nThe claim is also circulating on Twitter.\n\nAnother caption used to share the video says \u2013 \u201cOppose of bus route started to Bandra to BKC by group of Muslim Rikshawala\u2019s running share Riksha on that route.\u201d The same has been posted on Twitter as well.\n\nAlt News closely analysed the video and found that the incident took place in Surat, Gujarat and not Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nThe word \u2018SITILINK\u2019 is imprinted on the side of the bus. SITILINK stands for Surat Bus Rapid Transit System, which is an integrated public bus transportation system that runs only in Surat.\n\nThe second clue was the number plate of the bus. A faint \u2018GJ 05\u2019 is visible at numerous points in the video. GJ 05 is the RTO vehicle registration code for Surat.\n\nWhen we looked for related videos on YouTube with the keyword \u2018stone-pelting bus surat\u2019, we found one shot at the same location and uploaded by Surat-based Divang News Channel. This clip showed scenes in the aftermath of the attack. The video was titled, \u201cSurat: Police fire tear gas shells as rally against mob lynching incidents turns violent.\u201d\n\nTV9 Gujaratialso reported the incident. A rally to protest mob lynchings was taken out in Surat on July 5. The agitation, however, turned violence and mob began pelting stones. The Times of Indiareported, \u201cA section of [the] crowd went berserk when the rally participants were not allowed to go beyond Makkai Pool to submit a memorandum to [the] district collector. According to the report, two buses were attacked. \u201cThe mob targeted a city bus near Take Off restaurant and broke its window panes and the other at another place,\u201d it said.\n\nForty people have been reportedly arrested for perpetrating the violence.\n\nAn incident of mob violence that occurred in Surat, Gujarat was falsely shared on social media as Muslim auto drivers protesting the recent ticket price drop for BEST buses in Mumbai.", "lang": "en"}
