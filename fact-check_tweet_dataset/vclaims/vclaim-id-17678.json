(RELATED: Trump Claims Illegal Immigration Costs The US More Than $100 Billion A Year)\n\nOccupy Democrats pushed back on this argument, claiming that, without legal status, immigrants don\u2019t qualify for \u201cany\u201d public benefits.\n\nFederal law does prohibit illegal immigrants from accessing most government benefits programs. Besides Medicare and non-emergency Medicaid, it also bars them from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides financial assistance to lower income households with children.\n\nHowever, these immigrants are eligible for a select number of benefits, including WIC, a federal program that provides pregnant or nursing women and children up to age 5 with nutrition assistance, education and health care referrals. The program aids 53 percent of all infants born in the U.S.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture confirmed to The Daily Caller that WIC is open to anyone who qualifies, regardless of immigration status.\n\nIllegal immigrants can also obtain certain forms of federal emergency assistance, including emergency room care and disaster relief. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists on its website a handful of other programs illegal immigrants may receive.
