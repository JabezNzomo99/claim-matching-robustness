The archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nBOOM did two reverse image searches - one on the photograph of Kanhaiya Kumar with the map in the background and another on a snipped clip of the map. We got two different sets of pictures.\n\nSeveral links carried news reports with the same image of Kanhaiya sans the map.\n\nA reverse image search on a clipped portion of the map led us to the same image, albeit without Kanhaiya Kumar in the foreground.\n\nThus, the post that has gone viral with the claim that Kanhaiya Kumar is standing in front of a map portraying Kashmir as a part of Pakistan, is a composite of two different images.", "lang": "en"}
