The claim is false; the purported article was mostly taken from two reports by Hong Kong news site Stand News and adds a misleading headline; South Korea has not issued any new immigration regulations on Hong Kong police; Seoul\u2019s consulate in Hong Kong said the claim was false, and that the country did not block visitors\u2019 entry on the basis of their occupation.\n\nThe misleading article has circulated widely online, for example here and here on information sites Buzznews and jChannel on December 7, 2019.\n\nThe jChannel report has been shared by social media pages with more than five million followers in total, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language headline of the article translates to English as: \u201cNo entry!! Korea tightens policies after \u2018Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\u2019 is enacted - Hong Kong police officers and their families will be arrested and imprisoned for five years if entering Korea\u201d.\n\nWhile Korea as a region includes the countries of North and South Koreas, the claim targets South Korea as the country\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, as well as its flag, can be seen in two images included in the misleading article.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was signed into law by US President Donald Trump on November 27, 2019, in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Here is an AFP report on the legislation, which requires an annual review of freedoms in Hong Kong and bans the sale of crowd control equipment.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading article:\n\nThe same misleading article has also been published by other news sites such as here and here. It has also been shared alongside similar claims on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram such as here, here and here.\n\nThe text of the purported article was mostly taken from two news reports published by Hong Kong news site Stand News.\n\nThe first five paragraphs of the misleading article have been doctored from this December 4, 2019, Stand News report with the title \u201cParliament of Australia to consult whether to enact an Australian version of \u2018Human Rights and Democracy Act\u2019 in order to sanction human rights violators\u201d.\n\nThe misleading article replaces references to Australia with South Korea. For instance, David Fawcett, the chairperson of Australia\u2019s Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, was described by the false claim as making an announcement on behalf of South Korea.\n\nA line was added to the fourth paragraph of the purported article claiming that South Korea will punish Hong Kong police officers and their families with jail time should they attempt to enter the country.\n\nThe paragraph translates to English as: \u201cAnd today South Korea tightens policies after \u2018Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\u2019 is enacted - Hong Kong police officers and their families will be arrested and imprisoned for five years if entering Korea\u201d.\n\nThe formatting of that sentence is irregular and in contrast to the rest of the article, as highlighted by AFP in the screenshot below:\n\nThe remainder of the article was mostly taken from this November 21, 2019, Stand News report, which is titled \u201c[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act] Hong Kong government: US interference in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs does not help ease tension\u201d.\n\nThe misleading article also quoted a commentary on the US legislation by Chinese newspaper People\u2019s Daily, but incorrectly referenced the article\u2019s title, changing it from \u201cany bill that interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs is a piece of waste paper\u201d to \u201cany bill that interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs is rubbish\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson from the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in Hong Kong told AFP the suggestion that Hong Kong police and their families would be arrested by South Korea was \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Korean government does not discriminate against any foreigners who want to visit Korea based on gender, occupation and etc.,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\n\u201cIn particular, there have been no announcements about the refuse or arrest of Hong Kong police and police families upon visiting Korea mentioned in the news.\u201d\n\nA Korean-language keyword search for \u201cHong Kong\u201d on South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website here found no press releases published about Hong Kong since 2017.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the results:\n\nA search for \"Hong Kong\" in Korean language here on the Ministry of Justice's website retrieved no results.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the two photos of US President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in published in the misleading article were orginially taken by news agencies during the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe first one was credited to AFP on September 21, 2017, and the second one was captured by an Associated Press (AP) photographer on September 24, 2018. The photographs can be seen here and here on the AFP and AP websites.\n\nBelow are screenshots of the two photos:", "lang": "en"}
