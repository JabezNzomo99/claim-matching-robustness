That law mandates that an offender\u2019s punishment be increased based on criminal history.\n\nIn July 2020, the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the 1997 life sentence of a Black man who was convicted after he tried, but failed, to steal hedge clippers.\n\nAmidst a nationwide reckoning in the U.S. over criminal justice, police brutality, and racism, a Black man\u2019s decades-old crime and subsequent conviction resurfaced in a Louisiana Supreme Court decision in July 2020, capturing our readers\u2019 attention.\n\nIn 1997, Fair Wayne Bryant was convicted to a life sentence in prison after attempting to steal hedge clippers. His sentence was upheld by the Louisiana Supreme Court in July 2020, two years after Bryant filed an appeal to review his sentence.\n\nSnopes readers asked us to investigate if the man really did receive a life prison sentence for \u201cstealing hedge clippers,\u201d and if the sentence was upheld by Louisiana\u2019s Supreme Court. We found some details of the story to be true, but key information was obscured by the headlines.\n\nBryant\u2019s life sentence was enabled by Louisiana\u2019s habitual offender law, which allows a district attorney to ask that a person\u2019s punishment be enhanced based on the defendant\u2019s criminal history.\n\nBryant had four previous convictions before the attempted burglary in 1997, according to news reports and court documents. He was convicted of attempted armed robbery in 1979; possession of stolen items in 1987; attempted forgery of a check in 1989; and burglary in 1992. In 1997, after he indeed tried to steal hedge clippers from a carport storage room in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Bryant was sentenced to life in prison as a habitual offender, according to a court document.\n\nIn July, the majority of Louisiana\u2019s Supreme Court justices \u2014 with the exception of the sole Black woman justice on the bench \u2014 declined to consider Bryant\u2019s request to review his life sentence, in effect upholding the life sentence. In her lone dissent, Chief Justice Bernette Johnson described the sentence as \u201cexcessive and disproportionate.\u201d She likened the habitual offender law to post-Civil War era \u201cPig Laws\u201d that were \u201cdesigned to reenslave African Americans.\u201d Johnson said:\n\nPig Laws undoubtedly contributed to the expansion of the Black prison population that began in the 1870\u2019s. These laws remained on the books of most southern states for decades. And this case demonstrates their modern manifestation: harsh habitual offender laws that permit a life sentence for a Black man convicted of property crimes. This man\u2019s life sentence for a failed attempt to steal a set of hedge clippers is grossly out of proportion to the crime and serves no legitimate penal purpose. For the reasons cited, I would grant the defendant\u2019s writ application.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, 64% of people incarcerated in Louisiana prisons under the habitual offender law were there for nonviolent crimes. Black people represented 79% of those convicted as habitual offenders.\n\nIn mid-August, Bryant got news that he would have another chance at freedom. A parole hearing was scheduled for Oct. 15 based on a request Bryant had submitted in July. In a unanimous decision, the parole board granted his release from prison.\n\nIn sum, given the role Bryant\u2019s prior convictions played under the habitual offender law, the reason for his life sentence can\u2019t solely be laid on the 1997 attempted-burglary case. We therefore rate the truth of this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
