But they were both infected with COVID-19, the post claims, and \"a few days later they both died holding each other's hand, looking after each other, caressing each other.\"\n\nThe post says the picture \"was taken while they were working in hospital, few days before Antonio got infected, unaware that this might be their last kiss.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Airlines and travelers are still sorting out the new travel ban that President Donald Trump announced late Wednesday, barring most foreign visitors from continental Europe for 30 days.\"\n\nSearching for news stories about Sofia and Antonio and nurses in Italy, we found none \u2014 just other posts sharing the same story that appears on Facebook.\n\nDozens of doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients have died in Italy.\n\nBut this Facebook post does not accurately describe the photo it features.", "lang": "en"}
