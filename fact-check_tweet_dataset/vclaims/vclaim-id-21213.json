On Dec. 19, Cramer was asked on a local television program about how he would pay for the tax bill if it added more than $1 trillion in debt and whether he agreed with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who said that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we have to get after entitlement reform, Chris, because that\u2019s the only way to get to the debt and deficit,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cOver two-thirds of our budget is entitlements. If we don\u2019t deal with that, not only do we not deal with the debt if we don\u2019t deal with it, but the entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are going to go broke.\u201d\n\nSo although there is nothing in the tax bill specifically about Social Security, Cramer has acknowledged that the additional debt generated by the measure will require a closer look at reducing spending on programs such as Social Security. For instance, Cramer has indicated he supported raising the retirement age as part of \u201cslight changes\u201d that would affect only people far from retirement. (Alternatively, one could also raise more revenue for those programs, an approach Democrats favor.)\n\nIndeed, a day later, Cramer, in another interview, seemed to backtrack from the idea of cuts to entitlements. \u201cWe need to reform all of our programs, not just to make sure people keep them but to make sure they can be kept for the long haul because both Medicare and Social Security, as you talked about, are on a path to insolvency,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to shore up both of them, not to cut them, we need to shore them up for the long haul.\u201d\n\nSocial Security certainly faces challenges, with its trust funds beginning to eat into reserves this year, according to the 2018 trustees report. Until 2009, Social Security took in more revenue than it paid in benefits, and since then, it has relied on interest earnings. Now it will begin eating away at its principal, the trustees report said. So it\u2019s safe to say that the deficits generated by the tax bill will make dealing with the problem even more difficult \u2014 and force a reckoning sooner rather than later.\n\nFor 2018, the CBO said, the budget deficit had ballooned by $242 billion, to $804 billion, largely because of a $200 billion decline in revenue caused by the 2017 tax bill. Over 10 years, the cumulative deficit is projected to be $1.6 trillion higher, for a total of $11.7 trillion. If expiring provisions such as the tax cuts were extended the full 10 years, the cumulative deficit would be $15 trillion. By 2028, the CBO said, debt would be 105 percent of GDP, a level exceeded only once in the nation\u2019s history, if the tax cuts were extended as Republicans desire.\n\nNote that the CBO said these deficits would take place even though the tax cut would bolster economic growth. In fact, the CBO said that \u201cexpectations of faster growth in the economy and in wages and corporate profits led to an increase of $1.1 trillion in projected tax receipts [over 10 years] from all sources.\u201d But even with that additional growth, the deficit is projected to increase significantly over the next 10 years \u2014 because of the tax cuts and because of additional spending approved by Congress.\n\nFor a website that proclaims it is providing the truth and nothing but the facts, this line about the tax cuts and economic growth is poppycock. The CBO does take into account the economic effect of tax bills, so Cramer is simply wrong on that score. It\u2019s even worse for a politician to suggest he is a deficit hawk \u2014 and ready to take on entitlements \u2014 and yet dismiss credible forecasts on future deficits by a respected agency.", "lang": "en"}
