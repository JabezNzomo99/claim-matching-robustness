She first provided four examples, but three \u2014 a Bloomberg News poll, a Morning Consult poll and an NBC News exit poll from the Virginia governor\u2019s race \u2014 were from 2017. They were taken as Republicans were trying to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, so health care was certainly in the news at the time.\n\nThe fourth poll, a HuffPost/YouGov poll from April, was more on target. Asked to choose their two top issues from a list, 30 percent of registered voters picked health care. But gun policies and immigration were close behind, at 25 percent each, with the economy at 24 percent. There was a clearly partisan divide on some of these issues \u2014 43 percent of Republicans picked immigration compared with 10 percent of Democrats \u2014 but both Democrats and Republicans rated health care highly.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Maloney also cited a Gallup poll that asked Americans about their \u201ctop worry.\u201d In that survey, 55 percent of respondents said they worry \u201ca great deal\u201d about the availability and affordability of health care, more than 14 other issues that Gallup asked about. Crime, federal spending and the availability of guns followed, tied at 51 percent.\n\n\u201cTop worry,\u201d however, is not the same as \u201ctop issue.\u201d In fact, there is another poll by Gallup that is more often cited for its analysis of \u201cthe top problem\u201d \u2014 and it comes to a starkly different conclusion. This Gallup poll is based on an open-ended question in which people were asked, \u201cWhat do you think is the most important problem facing this country today.\u201d Gallup conducts the poll once a month.\n\nJust 4 percent volunteered \u201chealth care\u201d or \u201chospitals,\u201d far behind \u201cdissatisfaction with government\u201d (23 percent), immigration-illegal aliens (15 percent), race relations (7 percent) gun control/guns (6 percent), economy (5 percent) and unifying the country (4 percent). Health care had been in third place, with 9 percent, in November but faded as a top concern.\n\nIn a Pew Research poll from January, \u201creducing health care costs\u201d ranked fourth, after terrorism, education and the economy and just before Social Security. The poll shows only a slight increase over the past year.\n\nFinally, Quinnipac\u2019s poll in March asked for \u201cthe most important issue\u201d from a list of five issues. This is not as flexible as the other polls, but health care narrowly edged the economy, 23 percent to 22 percent.\n\nRather than the polls being clear, it\u2019s actually quite murky. Murphy can point to a poll that shows health care at the top of the list. But other polls \u2014 including Gallup\u2019s monthly open-ended question that is widely cited for identifying the top problem \u2014 show that health care is lower on the list of concerns.\n\nClearly, the methodology of a poll makes a difference in the result. The open-ended nature of the Gallup poll might get closest to what concerns Americans have when they do not have to choose from a list.\n\nMurphy may be convinced that health care is what will motivate voters in the coming year. But based the polls, he might be fooling himself.", "lang": "en"}
