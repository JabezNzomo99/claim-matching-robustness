As envisioned, it will rely on an array of 12,000 satellites positioned at different altitudes.\n\nAccording to RIA Novosti, Nikolai Samus, a researcher with the Russian Academy of Science\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, said Starlink will place thousands of satellites in orbit, and the sunlight they reflect could corrupt 30 percent to 40 percent of astronomical images.\n\nThis is likely true to some degree.\n\nAlthough we cannot verify Samus\u2019 percentages, American astronomers already photographed Starlink satellites streaking through the night sky in Chile this past November.\n\n\u201cOver five minutes, a train of 19 satellites had crossed into the telescopes\u2019 view, scarring the observation with bright parallel marks, and degrading their scientific value,\u201d Vox reported.\n\nAstronomers worldwide have been debating the potential impact of programs like Starlink. Some say constellations of closely-placed satellites could fundamentally change the night sky. And there is concern that radio frequencies used by Starlink could interfere with those astronomers use to study how galaxies form.\n\n\u201cThe potential tragedy of a mega-constellation like Starlink is that for the rest of humanity it changes how the night sky looks,\u201d Ronald Drimmel of the Turin Astrophysical Observatory in Italy told Forbes last May. \u201cStarlink, and other mega-constellations, would ruin the sky for everyone on the planet.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Musk defended his system. \u201cStarlink won\u2019t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy,\u201d he tweeted. If needed, solar reflection can be minimized by a \u201ctweak of sat orientation,\u201d he added.\n\nLast year, Musk tweeted that he asked the Starlink team to study ways to reduce brightness.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s application for orbital deployment and operation authority, submitted to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission back in March 2017, details its future plans for Starlink.\n\nOf the planned 12,000 satellites, SpaceX said 4,425 will orbit at approximately the same altitude as many other satellites -- 1,110 to-1,325 km \u2013 creating what Musk\u2019s firm calls an \u201cLEO Constellation.\u201d The other 7,518will create a \u201cVLEO Constellation,\u201d operating at a very low Earth orbit, altitudes of 335-346 km.\n\nUnlike older communications satellites, the Starlink versions are smaller, table-sized flat panels, each weighing about 260 kg.\n\nStarlink is not alone. Amazon and the U.K.\u2019s OneWeb also plan on launching similar \u201cconstellations\u201d of low-orbit satellites.Amazon\u2019s Kuiper project aims at launching 3,236 low-orbit satellites beginning in 2021, and OneWeb this past February launched the first 34 of its network of 648 low-orbit satellites, which will be fully deployed by the end of 2021.\n\nThe U.S. scientific community has warned that the popularity of the artificial satellite constellations poses real risks. Scientific American reported last October that the FCC in the prior two years had authorized 13,000 satellites.\n\nThe Tech Crunch website reports that SpaceX now has 300 Starlink satellites in orbit following a Feb. 17 launch.\n\nThat\u2019s just a fraction of all 5,524 satellites currently in orbit. They come from 93 countries and organizations.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia have the most orbiting satellites -- 2,116 (including Starlink) and 1,524, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
