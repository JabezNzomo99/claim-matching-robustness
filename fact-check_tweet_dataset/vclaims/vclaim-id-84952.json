As part of that effort, the U.S. government pushed allies in Europe to curtail trade with Iran.\n\nSweden was one country that resisted this push, according to a 2009 State Department cable released by WikiLeaks, which cited \u201ca dynamic (though still fairly small) trade involving some of Sweden\u2019s largest and most politically well-connected companies: Volvo, Ericsson and ABB to name three.\u201d The cable noted that in February 2008, Sweden had signed a bilateral investment treaty with Iran. \u201cThe Swedish government is critical of Iran where human rights are concerned, but advocates maintaining a dialogue with Iran and encourages trade with Iran,\u201d the cable said.\n\nIn a 2010 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ericsson said it was aware of the export-control sanctions on Iran and monitored them closely. \u201cIn Iran, Ericsson distributes commercial grade systems to public network operators for mobile communications. Ericsson also offers installation and support services for the equipment delivered,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNone of the equipment and services provided by Ericsson is intended for military purposes.\u201d\n\nThis is an argument that might have found favor in Clinton\u2019s State Department. Clinton promoted Internet freedom and social media as a way to allow opposition figures to organize against repressive regimes. At a meeting in the Netherlands in late 2011, Clinton criticized companies that sold technology that allowed governments to inhibit the free flow of information. \u201cWhen ideas are blocked, information deleted, conversations stifled, and people constrained in their choices, the Internet is diminished for all of us,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, in April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order that imposed sanctions on people and entities that use technology, such as cellphone tracking and Internet monitoring, to help Iran (and Syria) carry out human rights abuses. In Iran, the executive order targeted the Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, the Law Enforcement Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Datak Telecom, an Internet service provider. Interestingly, the Guardian newspaper reported that \u201cmuch of the technology used by oppressive regimes was supplied by US firms,\u201d singling out McAfee content-filtering software.\n\nThis is the same executive order that Trump referenced in his speech, when he noted \u201cthose sanctions did not cover Ericsson\u2019s work in Iran.\u201d But that\u2019s because the executive order was not aimed at cellphone companies. The executive order, targeting entities that thwarted communication, was a logical outgrowth of administration\u2019s policies to encourage the free flow of information across the Internet and social networks.\n\nBut Trump made it seem sinister because he inserted this fact in the middle of his timeline: \u201cDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 \u2014 his highest-paying speech.\u201d This is in reference to a speech that Bill Clinton gave in Hong Kong in November 2011 at what Ericsson calls a Networked Society Forum (NEST).\n\nRembe said there was no connection between Clinton\u2019s speech in Hong Kong and the firm\u2019s business in Iran. \u201cThe decision to engage President Clinton was taken by the event project team,\u201d Rembe said. \u201cHe was chosen for his perceived strong attraction power and selected from a list of many potential speakers with crowd pull.\u201d\n\nSeparately, we should note (though Trump did not) that the Clinton Foundation has a Swedish branch, Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse, that has received about $30 million since it was established. Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, Reuters reported. These lotteries, run by the Dutch company Novamedia BV, donate at least 50 percent of their proceeds to charity; the money given to the Clinton Foundation is only a fraction of the $9 billion in charitable donations raised by such lotteries.\n\nIn all, this is an almost nonexistent case for \u201cpay-for-play.\u201d Obama\u2019s executive order, the result of discussions that included agencies besides the State Department, logically flows from administration policies. There is no evidence that Ericsson\u2019s mobile business in Iran was ever under consideration to be part of the executive order \u2014 or that Bill Clinton\u2019s speech five months earlier in Hong Kong played a role in what, ultimately, was an order signed by Obama.\n\nInterestingly, Trump has denied that he engaged in pay-for-play when his charitable foundation made a $25,000 donation to Pam Bondi, Florida\u2019s attorney general, a few days after news reports indicated that Bondi\u2019s office was reviewing complaints of deceptive practices against Trump University. After the donation was received, Bondi dropped the case. The donation was a violation of tax laws, but it was not noticed for several years because the Trump Foundation listed the donation in tax filings as a contribution to an unrelated group with a similar name as the Bondi\u2019s political group. The foundation recently paid a fine for making an improper political contribution.", "lang": "en"}
