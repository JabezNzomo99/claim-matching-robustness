The image is from Sangam Vihar, an informal settlement in South Delhi.\n\nThe archived version of similar posts can be seen here and here.\n\nWith a reverse image search, we found that a similar image has been viral on social media at least since the year 2018 with the claim that it is from Delhi.\n\nWe found multiple posts carrying the image in question on Twitter in January 2020. The posts criticise Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for neglecting the Delhi roads.\n\nAnother post from 2018 carrying a similar image with the same shops and surroundings has mentioned that the photo is of Ratiya Marg in Sangam Vihar, New Delhi.\n\nA closer look at the image helped us identify one of the signboards of a cake shop in the photo \u2014 Ansh Cake Palace.\n\nWhen AFWA reached out to the owner of the shop, Deepak Arora, he confirmed to us that the image is from street number eight of Ratiya Marg at Block D of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cThe image is from Sangam Vihar. However, the photograph is at least a few months old. The road was broken for the construction of stormwater drains that time. But that work never happened and the condition of the road is still more or less the same,\u201d he said.\n\nArora also shared with us some photographs exhibiting the current condition of the road in Ratiya Marg.\n\nWe were also able to geolocate the shop at Ratiya Marg on Google Maps.\n\nHence, it is safe to say that the viral image of a road in a poor condition is from Ratiya Marg of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi and not is not related to Varanasi.", "lang": "en"}
