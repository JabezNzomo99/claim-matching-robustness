Tammy Duckworth of Illinois \u2014 a combat veteran who lost both her legs after her helicopter was shot down in Iraq by a rocket-propelled grenade \u2014 as \u201cLieutenant Nolegs,\u201d a misspelling of \u201cno legs\u201d:\n\nThis is not a genuine tweet from Trump.\n\nFor starters, we could find no record of this tweet on Trump\u2019s timeline. Some social media users claimed that Trump deleted this message, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. There are several organizations that archive Trump\u2019s deleted tweets, such as ProPublica, FactBa.se, and the Trump Twitter Archive, but none had any record of the \u201cNolegs\u201d tweet.\n\nFurthermore, the president of the United States calling a sitting senator \u201cLieutenant No Legs\u201d would have undoubtedly made some sort of splash in the press. However, we were unable to find any news articles mentioning this insult.\n\nAlthough we did not find evidence of Trump calling Duckworth \u201cLieutenant No Legs\u201d in a tweet, Duckworth has referred to the commander-in-chief as \u201cCadet Bone Spurs,\u201d alluding to the medical deferments Trump reportedly received that exempted him from military duty during the Vietnam War. In February 2018, after Trump seemed to imply that it was treasonous for Democrats to not applaud during his State of the Union address, Duckworth took to Twitter, stating that she would not \u201cmindlessly cater to the whims of Cadet Bone Spurs and clap when he demands I clap\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
