Kamala Harris\u2019 schooling and race to accuse the Democratic presidential candidate of \u201clies.\u201d\n\nA popular Facebook meme takes aim at Sen. Kamala Harris by distorting the facts in order to accuse the California Democrat of \u201clies.\u201d\n\nIn a numbered list, the meme wrongly asserts the 2020 presidential candidate has been untruthful about her race and about her schooling in Berkeley, California. It also accuses her of lying about the music she listened to in college.\n\nWe\u2019ll first start by addressing the false claim that Harris \u201cwasn\u2019t in berkley [sic] during segregation..she was in school in Canada at that time.\u201d\n\nHarris has talked about her experience being bused to school in Berkeley, California, as part of the school\u2019s integration efforts \u2014 including at the June 27 Democratic presidential debate.\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote previously, Harris attended Thousand Oaks Elementary School starting in 1970, according to her campaign. A Berkeley Public Schools spokesman, Charles Burress, said in an email to FactCheck.org that while the district has \u201cnot been able to locate any student enrollment records from that pre-digital time showing the students who attended Thousand Oaks Elementary School then,\u201d the district \u201chas no reason to doubt her account, or the accounts of others who attended school with her.\u201d\n\nBurress also pointed to a photo of Harris\u2019 class at the school that the senator published in her book, \u201cThe Truths We Hold.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting for clarity that while Harris said in the debate that she was \u201cpart of the second class to integrate her public schools,\u201d she joined that class, or cohort, in 1970 for the first grade and, therefore, the third year of the busing program.\n\n\u201cAll Berkeley elementary schools were integrated through an innovative two-way busing plan, which was implemented voluntarily by our district beginning in 1968,\u201d Berkeley Public Schools says on its website. \u201cKamala Harris joined first grade in 1970, which means she joined a cohort that had entered kindergarten in the second year of the busing program, in 1969.\u201d\n\nA 2009 report co-authored by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Law School and UCLA\u2019s Civil Rights Project notes that the district\u2019s 14 elementary schools in the early 1960s were attended by students from their largely segregated neighborhoods, which resulted in \u201cde facto\u201d school segregation.\n\nAlthough a \u201cvoluntary\u201d busing program was initially put into place, the district found that \u201cnon-white students bore the burden of busing.\u201d In January 1968, the school board approved a new system with \u201cfour attendance zones.\u201d That desegregation plan was implemented in September 1968 and, during the first year, 3,500 out of 9,000 elementary school students were bused.\n\nAccording to a local news website in Berkeley, Harris lived on Bancroft Way, between Bonar and Browning streets \u2014 which is about two miles from the Thousand Oaks school.\n\nHarris did eventually move with her family to Canada \u2014 but not until 1976, when she was in middle school, her Senate office told us previously. In her book, Harris also writes about being a 12-year-old in middle school when her mother decides to relocate to Montreal for a job opportunity.\n\nThe meme also questions Harris\u2019 race: Harris \u201csays she is black but she has no black parents, Father = jamaican, Mother = Indian.\u201d\n\nThat subject was recently highlighted when President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., shared a tweet with a similar claim, before deleting it.\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, California, to Donald Harris, who is indeed from Jamaica, and Shyamala G. Harris, who was born in India. But there\u2019s no support for the argument that she isn\u2019t black.\n\nIn a February interview with a morning radio show called \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d Harris addressed such questions about the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of her blackness. \u201cI think they don\u2019t understand who black people are,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if you do, if you walked on Hampton\u2019s campus, or Howard\u2019s campus or Morehouse, or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as black people. So I\u2019m not gonna spend my time trying to educate people about who black people are.\u201d\n\nThat same interview is also what prompted the meme\u2019s last claim \u2014 that Harris \u201csaid she was smoking weed in college, listening to music that wasn\u2019t even recorded yet.\u201d\n\nDuring her conversation with hosts DJ Envy and Charlamagne Tha God, Harris admitted that she smoked marijuana in college. But video of the interview shows that Harris\u2019 response regarding music isn\u2019t clear-cut.\n\nMany interpreted her response to mean that she listened to those artists while in college \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t have been possible. Harris graduated from Howard University in 1986 and from the University of California, Hastings College of Law in 1989. Snoop Dogg\u2019s first album was released in 1993; Tupac\u2019s debut studio album was in 1991.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign countered that the candidate was responding to the original question posed by Envy: \u201cWhat do you listen to because I know she has to go \u2014 so what does Kamala Harris listen to?\u201d\n\nHer national press secretary, Ian Sams, shared the clip on Twitter and said, \u201c@djenvy asked what she listened to. @cthagod made a pot joke. Then she answered @djenvy\u2019s question. This really isn\u2019t that complicated. Just watch.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll let readers determine what to make of the exchange.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
