TMZ reported he also used the name \"RavensChamp\" \u2014 one letter off from the user identified by Gateway Pundit.\n\nGateway Pundit has since removed references to the wrongly identified Reddit user, and issued an update that says, \"An anonymous Reddit user was mis-identified in an earlier post.\"\n\nThe Gateway Pundit article now carries a different headline that strikes any reference to the shooter\u2019s political leanings: \"Jacksonville Shooter Had Strange Online Profile and Bizarre Playing Style \u2013 Murdered 3 People (UPDATE).\"\n\nWe searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the post on Limbaugh\u2019s site remains uncorrected. Attempts to reach Limbaugh were unreturned.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, the wrongly identified Reddit user, who NBC referred to only as a Minnesota native named \"Pavel\" to protect his privacy, described his reaction to learning about the case of mistaken identity:\n\n\"I went on Reddit. I noticed I had 60, 70 unread messages. Usually I have two or something,\" he told NBC News. \"I look at the messages and it's a bunch of people using my username claiming I'm that Madden shooter person. Half of them are messages like 'I hope that person's dead.'\n\nResponding to a user who said \"ravenchamps was his profile, see for yourself,\" Ravenchamps wrote back.\n\n\"I'm alive you know?\" he wrote.\n\nLimbaugh said, \"It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'.\"\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s comments were based on an article by the Gateway Pundit, which has since retracted its claim about the shooter\u2019s anti-Trump political leanings.\n\nWe searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that per NBC News, the shooter used the handle \"Ravens2012champs\" as a video game username, not a Reddit username.", "lang": "en"}
