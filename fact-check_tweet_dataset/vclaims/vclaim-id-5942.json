What can we say? An Arab terrorist named Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement Israel had to agree to release so called \"political prisoners\". However, Israeli officials insisted that they would not release any with \"blood on their hands\". Some well meaning American President and Secretary of State insisted that all be released. Thus Mr. Atta was freed and eventually thanked the US by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the networks at the time the terrorists were first identified. It was missing from later reports. That President and Secretary of State were Ronald Reagan and George Schultz. In case you didn't know ... Terrorist pilot Mohammed Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called \"political prisoners.\" However, the Israelis would not release any with \"blood on their hands.\" The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, \"insisted\" that all prisoners be released. Thus Mr. Atta was freed and eventually \"Thanked the US\" by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first identified. It was censored in the US from all later reports. The American public must be made aware of this fact.\n\nOn 12 April 1986, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta (also known as Mahmoud Abad Ahmad), a 33-year-old Jordanian native, ambushed a passenger bus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Atta (working with an accomplice) stopped the bus with a firebomb, then opened fire on it with an Uzi, killing the driver and seriously wounding three passengers.\n\nAtta was arrested in Venezuela a year later, but because Venezuela had no extradition treaty with Israel, Venezuelan officials deported him for immigration violations to his country of origin, the United States. (Atta was a naturalized U.S. citizen.) Atta was arrested by FBI agents upon arrival at Kennedy\n\n International Airport and held in prison in the U.S. for more than three years before being extradited to Israel for trial in October 1990. His extradition was controversial because the nature of the extradition treaty in effect required that the accused\u2019s offense must be of a \u201cnon-political nature,\u201d and Atta maintained that he had committed political rather than criminal offenses. Nonetheless, the U.S. courts upheld Israel\u2019s extradition request on the grounds that Atta had attacked civilian rather than military targets and had therefore committed regular criminal acts, not political acts aimed at the overthrow of a government. In October 1991, an Israeli court found Atta guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nFast forward ten years. As the U.S. tried to piece together the terrorist plot that resulted in four hijacked airliners and the destruction of both World Trade Center towers, they discovered that the mastermind was apparently one Mohamad Atta, who had entered into the U.S. unnoticed and spent well over a year there receiving training at more than one American flight school. Newspapers (both domestic and foreign) begin to criticize U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies for allowing a known terrorist to slip into the country so easily:\n\nFinally the Boston Globe, at least, caught onto the error and realized that the bus bomber and the hijacker were two different people with the same name:\n\nClearly, the message quoted at the head of this article was wrong in its facts. The Atta who attacked a bus was arrested by the FBI and extradited to Israel, not \u201ccaptured by Israelis,\u201d and his extradition didn\u2019t take place until two years Reagan left office. In fact, the Oslo Agreement itself wasn\u2019t signed until nearly years after Reagan left office. All of this makes it rather difficult to support the claim that Atta was released under the terms of the Oslo Agreement at the insistence of \u201cPresident Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State George Schultz\u201d (which explains why this information \u201cwas missing from later reports\u201d).\n\nWhat puzzled us was why newspapers, much less \u201cUS authorities,\u201d should have been confused as to whether the two Attas were the same man (especially since one was fourteen years older than the other) or described Atta as someone \u201csuspected of\u201d or \u201cimplicated in\u201d a bus attack for which he had already been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment ten years earlier. (According to The Jerusalem Post, Atta the bus bomber \u201cwas eventually freed after the Supreme Court ruled there were faults in the extradition process,\u201d but the article did not state when this reversal occurred. Newspaper accounts as late as 1993 still described Atta as \u201cserving a life sentence in an Israeli prison.\u201d) What we had here appeared to be a case of mistaken identity; the mystery we couldn\u2019t solve was why the mistake was made in the first place.\n\nIn mid-2002 the \u201cWe freed Atta\u201d claim was twinned in e-mail with another popular Internet canard, the \u201cOliver North warned us about Osama\u201d falsity. North did speak up about a terrorist during the Iran-Contra hearings, but it was Abu Nidal he mentioned, not Osama bin Laden.\n\nWTC Bomber Was Never Held in Israel (The Jerusalem Post)", "lang": "en"}
