There are no such records on the US Statement Department\u2019s website of its declassified documents, and the portal relies on an unsubstantiated report from another website to base its claim.\n\nKhan was shot dead in the garrison city of Rawalpindi as he addressed a rally on October 16, 1951.\n\nThe Times of Islamabad published its report in July 2017, citing as its source a Pakistan Today report.\n\nThe Times of Islamabad says the US organised the murder of Khan due to his refusal to use his position to secure oil contracts in neighbouring Iran for American corporations.\n\nThe Pakistan Today report is not easily accessible online but an archived version of it can be found here.\n\nThe headline of that articles reads: \u201cSecret is out: Americans murdered Liaquat Ali Khan!\n\nThe Pakistan Today report, from 2015, did not cite any specific US State Department documents.\n\nThe only further information it gave about the purported documents was the following sentence.\n\nThe US State Department has a website from which its declassified documents can be accessed.\n\nA search for Liaquat Ali Khan and Liaqat Ali Khan on these websites does not come up with any results that would back the claims in the Times of Islamabad and the Pakistan Today reports.\n\nThe results of the searches on different libraries on the website are here, here, here and here.\n\nSimilar claims of purported declassified US State Department records showing the CIA killed Liaquat Ali Khan have been circulating online for more than a decade.\n\n\n\nMany refer to this 2006 article by Arab News.\n\nHowever the Arab News report says the telegram describes a newspaper article dated October 24, 1951, from an Indian newspaper called the \u201cNadeem\u201d.\n\nIt says the Nadeem article makes the claim that the US was behind Khan\u2019s death, and the telegram summarises the article, according to the Arab News report.\n\nThe Arab News report does not state the State Department telegram made any claims about CIA involvement directly. It only cited the Nadeem newspaper.\n\nIt is not clear if the telegram exists.\n\nEven if it did, the citation of an Indian newspaper report speculating about events in Pakistan would not be be proof the CIA orchestrated the murder.\n\nUS embassies routinely send summaries of press reports in their countries that might help give insight into how Washington is perceived there. \n\n\n\nThe motives behind Khan\u2019s assassination have never been fully explained, according to this research paper by the National Institute of Historical & Cultural Research.\n\nThe assassin, later identified as Afghan national Said Akbar, was killed on the spot, and while an inquiry hinted at a conspiracy to change the government, it was never made clear who was behind it.\n\nThe Times of Islamabad report has been shared to more than 20 million people on Facebook, according to date from social media monitoring company Crowdtangle.", "lang": "en"}
