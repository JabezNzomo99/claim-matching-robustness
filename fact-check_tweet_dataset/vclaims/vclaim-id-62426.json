Rivkees recently issued a public health advisory urging people to wear face coverings.\n\nThe image, which appears to be a screen grab of an emergency alert issued by a government agency, claims Florida\u2019s surgeon general advised that people should stop wearing masks because they are \u201charmful to your health.\u201d The alleged emergency alert is dated June 24.\n\nBut the emergency alert appears to be fake. Rivkees issued on June 22 a public health advisory urging Florida residents to \u201cwear face coverings in any setting where social distancing is not possible.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Rivkees has changed his position on masks since that June 22 public health advisory was issued. A search of the Florida Department of Health\u2019s website didn\u2019t yield any results for a reversal of the advisory. If Rivkees had done so, major media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email that the post is inaccurate.
