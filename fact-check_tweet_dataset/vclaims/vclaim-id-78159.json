The foundation had been told to stop operating, although the post didn\u2019t say who or what made such a demand.\n\nFor the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect.\n\nThe story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads:\n\n\"During (Hillary) Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State, it\u2019s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories.\n\n\"Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nFor the record, Gen. George Hammond was the one-time leader of the fictional Stargate Command. We also highly doubt Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton went toe-to-toe over Scattergories at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly \"used her family foundation\u2019s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents.\"\n\nWe found several examples of this story online, most of which appeared to point back to the same May 3 post at USAPoliticsToday.com.\n\nThe only source cited in that story was a Nov. 6, 2016, article from the New York Post. That article said there was evidence from WikiLeaks\u2019 hack of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails that Chelsea Clinton had taken money from the foundation to pay in part for her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker had examined that same claim in January 2017, noting that the New York Post was the only U.S. newspaper to run the story, which was picked up by British tabloids and right-leaning news outlets like Fox News.\n\n\"Despite the breathless reporting, it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what is going on in the email exchange, which is dated Jan. 4, 2012,\" the Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler wrote. \"There is no mention of actual Foundation monies being used for the wedding.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton herself has decried how the Clinton Foundation has been a target of fake news outlets and conspiracy theorists.\n\n\"The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn\u2019t seem sufficient to put them to rest,\" she told Variety magazine in April. \"I think that was so odd about the whole experience \u2014 either the truth was insufficient or people just didn\u2019t care.\"\n\nIn any event, Chelsea Clinton remains free, and the Clinton Foundation is still open for business.\n\nWe rate this headline Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
