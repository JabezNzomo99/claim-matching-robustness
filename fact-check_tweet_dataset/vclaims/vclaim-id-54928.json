He praised Taiwan\u2019s mask rationing system as well as virtual learning platforms and said both could effectively prevent the worsening of Japan\u2019s pandemic.\n\nWe then searched by the keywords and found that a claim about Coronavirus being created in a lab was actually made by Nobel laureate and French scientist Luc Montagnier.\n\nFurthermore, we also checked the truth behind Covid-19 being created in a lab. A study in the journal Nature.com, published by multiple science magazines clearly states that the virus was not created in a lab.\n\nHence, it is clear that Japanese scientist and Nobel Prize winner Tasuku Honjo did not claim that Coronavirus was made in China.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
