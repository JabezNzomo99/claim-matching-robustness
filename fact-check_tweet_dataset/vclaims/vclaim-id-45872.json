{"title": "FALSE: Risa Hontiveros quote supporting Maute Group", "subtitle": "This claim has been debunked as early as 2017. Hontiveros did not make any statement in support of the Maute Group, which she tagged as terrorists.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jun 11, 2020 12:47 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45872", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/risa-hontiveros-quote-supporting-maute-group", "vclaim": "Several users posted a graphic attributing the following quote to Hontiveros: \"What Maute Group are doing is not rebellion. I believe they are only doing what they think is right, this people has (sic) a belief, a conviction that pushed them to move forward.\"\n\n\"Maaring (sic) pagod na sila sa mga nangyayari sa lipunan (They may be tired of what is happening in society), at least they have the motivation. We should be inspired of what they are doing. They are the epitome of courage and resilience,\" the quote continued.\n\nThis claim was initially circulated in 2017 and was shared again in June 2020 by pages and users who appear to be supporting the anti-terrorism bill. Hontiveros and Senator Francis Pangilinan are the only senators who voted against the measure, warning of possible abuse.\n\nIn an interview on Get It Straight with Daniel Razon uploaded on June 6, 2017, Hontiveros said that the Maute Group's actions did not fall under the constitutional definitions of rebellion or invasion, which are the circumstances under which the President can place the country under martial law. Instead, she said, they are acts of terrorism.

It is an enemy of peace and development, particularly the people of Mindanao. What they did to Marawi is a terrorist act that must be condemned by all.\"\n\nResponding to Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte's inquiry on whether she was abetting rebellion, Hontiveros said, \"[Purveyors] of fake news accuse me of siding with the Maute group because I didn\u2019t automatically regard their terrorist action as rebellion. Magkalinawan tayo. Ang Maute Group ay mga terorista hindi rebelde (Let's be clear. The Maute Group are terrorists, not rebels)... The essence of rebellion is ideological. Terrorism is pure terror.\"", "lang": "en"}
