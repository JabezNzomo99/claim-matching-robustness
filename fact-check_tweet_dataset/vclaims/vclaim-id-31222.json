As per the claim, all you need to do is to boil the wheat for 10 minutes and sprout it after boiling. Vishvas News investigated the claims of the viral post and found that the viral post is misleading.\n\nA Facebook post shared by a user named \u0918\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0941\u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0947 stated that a scientist from Britain claimed that if sprouted wheat is consumed for 2 days empty stomach in morning, diabetes can be cured completely and consuming the same for 3 days will never give you a heart attack.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by breaking down various elements of the viral claim. We searched online reports on whether any scientist from Britain has made such claim that if sprouted wheat is consumed for 2 days empty stomach in morning, diabetes can be cured completely and consuming the same for 3 days will never give you a heart attack. We did not find any report by a scientist from Britain supporting such claim.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sujeet Jha, Director of Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism at Max Healthcare regarding the viral message. He said: \u201cThis claim is not really true. We are using pseudoscience on diet and trying to reach easy solution by managing diet and making lifestyle changes. But saying that consuming sprouted wheat for 2 days can cure diabetes completely or consuming it for 3 days can never give you a heart attack is not true.\u201d\n\nVishvas News also contacted Dr. Sudha, who is an Ayurveda Doctor. She said: \u201cThis claim is fake. It is impossible to cure diabetes or heart diseases in 2 or 3 days by consuming sprouted wheat.\u201d\n\nWe further investigated and found a report at Centers for disease control and prevention which stated, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting diabetes self-management education and support, and keeping health care appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life.\u201d\n\nAs per Dr Avni Kaul, Nutritionist, \u201cDiabetes can be managed and cured with diet and lifestyle changes, it cannot be cured completely.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are some reports online which suggest that sprouted wheat has certain health benefits, but nowhere has it been mentioned that it can cure heart diseases and diabetes completely.\n\nConclusion The post claiming that consuming sprouted wheat empty stomach in morning can cure diabetes completely or can prevent heart attack is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
