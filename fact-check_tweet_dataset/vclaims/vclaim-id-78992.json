Marco Rubio has a dire message for conservatives who oppose immigration reform: Do something to improve the status quo, or President Barack Obama could make the situation much worse.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been saying now I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen,\" Rubio said in a recent interview with Tallahassee .\n\nRubio, an author of the immigration proposal that passed the Senate this summer, said such a move could doom GOP immigration priorities of stepped-up border security and E-Verify checks in the Senate proposal.\n\nWe cannot fact-check the future, but we thought it appropriate to examine whether Rubio\u2019s worst-case scenario could actually happen. Could Obama essentially legalize \"11 million people by the sign of a pen\" like the DREAM Act population?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to interpret Rubio\u2019s statement as Obama conceivably granting all-out citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order.\n\nThat could not happen.\n\nDoing so would violate the country\u2019s separation of powers. Congress determined the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. He does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation.\n\n\"Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time,\" said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. \"Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"\n\nBut all-out citizenship is not exactly what Rubio warned against.\n\nRubio is very familiar with this subject, having tried to craft a proposal similar to the DREAM Act, a law that would have provided legal residency to immigrants brought to the country by their parents.\n\nBut in June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least for this form of deferred action.\n\nAn Rubio said Obama made it harder for any legislation to pass. To Rubio, Obama\u2019s policy \"basically legalized\" this group of illegal immigrants and was improper -- and he\u2019s not alone in this perspective.\n\nGiving someone a renewable status with work authorization and other benefits without punishment is de facto legalization, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that opposes the Senate bill and is for stricter immigration control.\n\nOthers say deferred action does not amount to legal status because the classification is temporary. The action puts an individual in legal limbo while allowing them to possibly apply for a driver\u2019s license and work without fear of immediate deportation, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a professor at the Pennsylvania State Dickinson School of Law and director of the Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security justified the policy by saying it was within the \" \" of the executive branch.\n\nWe\u2019ve arrived at a significant part of our fact-check: Could Obama grant deferred action to the entire population of illegal immigrants, not just Dreamers?\n\nObama has shot down that possibility, stressing the need for a comprehensive bill.\n\n\"I\u2019m not a king,\" Obama said in January to . \"You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, we\u2019ve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we can\u2019t simply ignore the law.\"\n\nStill, the administration has considered the pros and cons of a broad-based legalization program that excludes people who are a security risk, according to a leaked 2010 DHS memo. The draft memo detailed many risks for such a move, including blowback from Congress and the impression the department secretary is abdicating \"her charge to enforce immigration laws.\"\n\nRubio spokesman Alex Conant pointed us to a that examined an idea among immigration activists that involves persuading Obama \"to freeze the current undocumented population in place through an administrative order, give them work permits, and hope for a better deal under the next president, with the hope that he or she is a Democrat,\" according to the story. They want Obama to expand the deferred action program to other immigrants here illegally, such as those who work, are caregivers, or are immigrant parents of children who are citizens.\n\n\"It\u2019s not an empty threat,\" Frank Sharry of America\u2019s Voice told . \"If Republicans block reform with a path to citizenship, immigration reform activists will look at all their options, including broad executive action.\"\n\nExperts told us Obama indeed has broad executive power over deportations and granting temporary work permits. But it\u2019s a stretch to say he could legally offer all undocumented immigrants that deal.\n\nIf he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\n\"But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I\u2019d consider pretty extreme circumstances,\" Delahunty said.\n\nOn the other hand, the country\u2019s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be \"a crazy scenario,\" he said.\n\nEven some of Obama\u2019s loudest critics on immigration policy don\u2019t think he would go that far.\n\n\"It could be done. Obama\u2019s gotten away with as much, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do it,\" Krikorian said. \"That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nExperts thought it more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories.\n\n\"It would be the mother of all political battles,\" said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. \"As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes.\"\n\nThere\u2019s also an argument that halting deportations alone would do little to offer relief to the country\u2019s millions of unauthorized immigrants. They would still be in a legal limbo because most of the 400,000 or so people currently being deported are those who\u2019ve committed crimes, said Lynden Melmed, who served as former chief counsel of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nRubio said that absent immigration reform from Congress, Obama \"will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen.\"\n\nCould Obama offer deferred action for the entire population of undocumented immigrants? His executive powers over deportations are strong, but most experts say that\u2019s an extreme scenario and susceptible to legal challenges, not to mention political fallout. More likely is that Obama could extend deferred action to more subsets of the undocumented population, pushing them lower on the priority list and into a deal-with-you-later category. That might be relief for them, but it\u2019s also a legal limbo that falls short of legalization.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
