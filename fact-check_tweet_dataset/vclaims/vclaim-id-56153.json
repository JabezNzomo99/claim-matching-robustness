The two variations of posts have been uploaded by over 10 different Instagram accounts \u2013 including here and here \u2013 all containing links to websites selling cinchona powder. In total the posts have been viewed over 160,000 times.\n\nCOVID-19 has swept across the globe with devastating effect, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine gained prominence in March after small studies in France and China suggested administering the drug to people suffering COVID-19, sometimes in combination with another drug, could decrease the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their system.\n\nUS President Donald Trump boosted the drugs\u2019 exposure when he called them potential \u201cgame changers\u201d in the fight against the virus as a possible treatment for symptoms.\n\nHydroxychloroquine has been approved in the United States as an emergency treatment for COVID-19 and Australia has also begun importing the drug for use in hospitals.\n\nThere are a number of false claims in the post, the most obvious being that chloroquine \u201cis made from the bark of the Cinchona tree\u201d.\n\nChloroquine is a synthetic anti-malaria drug that was created in 1934. An article for The Conversation by a medical historian and two scientists describes chloroquine as \u201cinspired\u201d by the activity of quinine but with a \u201cquite different\u201d chemical structure to compounds found in cinchona bark.\n\nMonash Pharmaceuticals Professor Simon Bell told AAP FactCheck that Chloroquine and Hydroxchloroquine are safer and longer-acting \u201csynthetic analogues\u201d of quinine. \u201cThey are chemically different, which gives them different properties, but in the same general class,\u201d he said.\n\nQuinine, used to treat malaria, comes from the bark of the Cinchona tree. Researchers estimate the remedy has been used for close to 400 years but was first isolated by French scientists in 1820. Quinine and cinchona bark are also toxic, and taken in high doses can lead to \u201ccinchonism\u201d which includes hearing and vision loss, breathing issues as well as heart and kidney issues.\n\nProf Bell warned against the post\u2019s claim that it was safe to consume Cinchona tree bark.\n\n\u201cGiven that cinchona powder could contain unknown amounts of quinine, the risks of taking this outweigh any possible benefits,\u201d Prof Simon Bell said.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and mild cases of lupus. Its predecessor, chloroquine, (which isn\u2019t approved for use in Australia) is prescribed solely as an antimalarial.\n\nExperts have expressed concerns about using hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, with some possible side effects and doubts about the medication\u2019s effectiveness against COVID-19 among issues raised.\n\nThe April 10 post states \u201cmany people recovered from the COVID19 virus after receiving chloroquine, the popular anti malaria / lupus drug\u201d.\n\nHowever the studies that have been reported are based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and small numbers of patients. The French study was based on a sample of 42 patients with only 20 people treated with the drugs and six people dropping out during the trial.\n\nThe Australian Department of Health told AAP FactCheck in an email that they do not recommended using cinchona powder to treat COVID-19. \u201cCinchona bark or powder may contain quinine type chemicals in unknown quantities and [be] mixed with a range of other chemicals,\u201d the Department of Health spokesperson said.\n\nDespite hydroxychloroquine being explored as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in clinical trials around the world, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in March cast doubt on its effectiveness as a treatment for COVID-19 and warned that it can cause cardiac toxicity and irreversible blindness.\n\n\u201cWhile there are some clinical trials that have started in Australia and elsewhere in relation to COVID-19, it is not recommended that people use these drugs for COVID-19 prevention or treatment except within an organised clinical trial,\u201d the Department of Health spokesperson said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be false. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are synthetic analogues of quinine and chloroquine is not made from cinchona bark. The claim that \u201cmany people recovered\u201d from COVID-19 after receiving chloroquine is also not accurate. Experts and regulatory bodies advise against using cinchona bark to combat COVID-19, with the substance known to have potentially serious side effects if taken in large quantities. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
