The pontiff also called for an end to the \"culture of death\" and asked for forgiveness, reported BBC News.\n\n\"With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,\" wrote Pope Francis.\n\nThe supposed quote in the claim, \"You are all disgrace to God,\" is only written in the headline and nowhere in the blog post's body. Duterte wasn't mentioned in the blog post either, except in the headline. In addition, the headline was poorly constructed.\n\nThe blog insiderph.com is similar to other blogs Rappler has checked.
