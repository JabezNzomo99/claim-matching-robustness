Scindia never added \u201cBJP\u201d in the first place in his Twitter bio after joining the party in March.\n\nAs per Spoonbill, an online tool that tracks profile changes of Twitter users, Scindia had last changed his Twitter bio on November 17, 2019, while in Congress.\n\nAt that time, Scindia had removed the designation of former MP and former Union minister to \u201cPublic servant, cricket enthusiast\u201d. After this, Scindia never changed his Twitter bio. He changed his profile picture when he joined the BJP in March.\n\nAFWA also found an archive of Scindia\u2019s Twitter profile saved on May 17 in digital archive tool \u201cWayback Machine\u201d.\n\nHere too, Scindia\u2019s bio reads \u201cPublic servant, cricket enthusiast\u201d. This proves he never changed his Twitter bio after joining BJP. He has also confirmed the same on Twitter.\n\nSome days back, using the screenshot of a parody account of news channel \u201cIndia TV\u201d, it was claimed that Scindia is on his way out of the BJP. India Today AFWA had then debunked the claim.\n\nJyotiraditya Scindia, former MP from Guna in Madhya Pradesh, had joined the BJP on March 11 this year after an 18-year-long association with the Congress. This move toppled the Kamal Nath government in MP as 22 MLAs loyal to Scindia resigned from Congress and joined BJP. This paved the way for the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government to return to power.", "lang": "en"}
