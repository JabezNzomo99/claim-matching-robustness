The post listed several musings and observations, some of them factually dubious, which criticized liberals and Democratic politicians.\n\nThe standard version of the post began with \u201cHere are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020,\u201d and several instances prefaced the post with a note that attributed the observations to Tim Allen: \u201cTim Allen is credited with writing this. From: Tim Allen\u201d:\n\nSome readers understood this to mean that the well-known conservative actor and comedian Tim Allen had written the message, and we received several inquiries to that effect.\n\nNo evidence exists that the comedian wrote the post, although one Facebook account that shared the post bore the comedian\u2019s name. As such, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 25, a Facebook user who goes by the name \u201cTim Allen,\u201d and apparently residing in Virginia, posted the \u201cinteresting points\u201d message. He was among the first to share the list of observations during the final week of August when the post spread widely on the social network.\n\nOnline political content has gone viral in the past in similar circumstances. In January 2019, a Tennessee Facebook user going by the name \u201cSteve Harvey\u201d posted a message that praised U.S. President Donald Trump and criticized his opponents. The post spread rapidly when some users mistakenly believed it had been written by the popular comedian and talk show host of the same name.\n\nOn Aug. 24, 2019, right-leaning musician and commentator Ted Nugent had also shared a version of the anti-Democrat post, which had by that time appeared online for several months, with occasional modifications along the way. Some of the musings included in the list were taken from pre-existing, free-standing memes or popular social media posts, such as the observation:\n\n\u201cWe are one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally. We are fighting evil,\u201d which had appeared as its own meme, as early as January 2019:\n\nThe line that stated, \u201cAnd just like that they went from being against foreign interference in our elections to allowing non-citizens to vote in our elections\u201d appears to have been taken from pre-existing social media content that emerged as early as April 2019:\n\nIn sum, no evidence exists that showed Hollywood actor and comedian Tim Allen had either created or shared the lengthy Facebook post that went viral in August 2019, and was incorrectly attributed to him.", "lang": "en"}
