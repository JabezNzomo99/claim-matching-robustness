No, that's not true: the image was a photoshop by a satire website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by People of Lancaster in 2016 but updated in 2019 titled \"Photographer Captures Dolphin Caught In Hurricane Winds\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFORT PIERCE, FL - A photographer with The Weather Channel captured the strength and tragedy of severe weather this evening when he photographed a dolphin that was caught in Hurricane Dorian's winds. \"I have photographed hundreds of tornados and four hurricanes.

On 7 October 2016, the web site The People of Lancaster web site published an article reporting that a Weather Channel photographer had captured an image of a dolphin caught in the strong winds of Hurricane Matthew: A photographer with The Weather Channel captured the strength and tragedy of severe weather this evening when he photographed a dolphin that was caught in Hurricane Matthew's winds.\n\nThe story as it was in 2016 can be seen here on the Internet Archive.\n\nThe source image for the photoshop appears to be even older, it appears in this 2004 BBC story about hurricane Frances:", "lang": "en"}
