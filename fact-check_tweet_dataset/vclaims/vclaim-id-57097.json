John Kasich but it is not in effect yet. Organized labor groups and Democrats are trying to repeal SB 5 through a voter referendum this fall because they say the law is unfair to middle-class, working families.\n\n \n\n State Sen. Tim Grendell, a Republican from Chesterland who voted against SB 5, criticized the new structure for paying teachers during a televised forum about the state budget April 18 in Cleveland.\n\n \n\n \"In Senate Bill 5, there is this new method of evaluating teachers\u2026you\u2019re also going to be rated on what the parents think of you and they can send questionnaires and surveys home to parents,\" Grendell said.\n\n \n\n Allowing parents to play a role in evaluating teachers \u2013 and ultimately deciding how much they get paid \u2013 is problematic, Grendell said, because teachers are responsible for disciplining their children.\n\n \n\n Since SB 5 continues to be a heavily debated issue and because supporters of the law have accused teachers unions of misleading their members about how the law will affect salaries, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Grendell\u2019s claim.\n\n \n\n Within SB 5 \u2013 a massive law change that overhauls collective bargaining for public employees and establishes numerous rules regarding pay and benefits \u2013 is a section devoted to paying teachers. The law eliminates the previous structure set in law, which sets raises based on a teacher\u2019s education level and work experience.\n\n \n\n The law says that school boards must adopt a pay structure based on a teacher\u2019s performance. The law does not prescribe dollar amounts for salaries, but it says that districts must factor five categories into their performance-based pay schedule: what type of license the teacher holds, whether the teacher is \"highly qualified\" as defined by state law, students\u2019 classroom performance, teacher performance evaluations, and any other criteria the board decides to incorporate.\n\n \n\n Grendell\u2019s claim related to teacher evaluations, so let\u2019s zero in on that aspect of the performance-based pay structure. SB 5 includes a description of what the teacher evaluations would look like.\n\n \n\n The law requires the State Board of Education to establish a framework for the evaluations. Local school districts then will adopt their own specific evaluations based on the state\u2019s framework.\n\n \n\n The evaluations will include whether parents and students are satisfied with a teacher, \"which may be measured by surveys, questionnaires, or other forms of soliciting feedback,\" the law reads.\n\n \n\n Teacher evaluations also will measure how the teacher works in the classroom, which can be gauged by classroom observations; how the teacher communicates with students, parents, colleagues and members of the community; and students\u2019 test scores.\n\n \n\n Local school districts will have some discretion in deciding how to weight the different pieces of teacher evaluations, but they are expected to include each factor laid out under the new law.\n\n \n\n As Grendell pointed out at the budget forum, the law does call for parent questionnaires to gauge parent\u2019s satisfaction.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement True.", "lang": "en"}
