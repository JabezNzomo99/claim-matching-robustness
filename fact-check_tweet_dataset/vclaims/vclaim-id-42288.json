I have already given my vote \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc47 https://bit.ly/2UHsoaX). In our fact-check investigation, we found that the government of India is not conducting any such Online survey. This message is false.\n\nWe got this message on our Whatsapp number which the Vishvas.News has shared on the website for the users to send us any viral news for fact check. Once we received the the message, we found that te same message is viral on Twitter and Facebook also.\n\nThe message implies that \u2018Government of India\u2019 is conducting this survey hence we decided to investigate the truth behind the message. We clicked on the link given and it opened in a poll page opening with the URL \u2013 http: //hostindian.in/Pmindia2019/#.\n\nAs we know that all government websites open on a secure platform. The poll page website URL was opening with http://, and not with https:// in which \u2018s\u2019 stands for \u2018secure\u2019. We decidec to vote in the survey on the poll page. When we finished with the survey, a pop-up asked us to forward this message to 10 more people in our friend list. Also, it asked us to download an app.\n\nWhen we clicked to download the app, it asked us to install 4 Fun \u2013 Funny Video, WhatsApp Status App.\n\nOn searching the website on Whois, we found that this website was registered from Chanchora in Guna District of Madhya Pradesh. The website was registered for one year on June 22, 2016.\n\nThe page has a banner beneath the picture of politicians, which says #DailyhuntTrustoftheNation. We searched this hashtag and found that this hashtag was used during a survey conducted by news app Daily Hunt.\n\nWe sent a mail to Daily Hunt asking about any survey it\u2019s conducting. A representative of Daily Hunt told us that they had done a survey \u2013 #TrustOfTheNation \u2013 in the months of October and November in 2018. This survey was done in partnership with Nielsen India. They told us that this survey was done only on the Daily Hunt app and One India website, and not through any message or other website. Also, we were told that this survey URL has now been deactivated.\n\nLater, we called the Central Information Commission (CIC) for official confirmation and we were told by the Joint Secretary staff that the government of INdia is not conducting any such survey.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation we found that the government of India is not conducting any such survey as claimed in the WhatsApp message our user had received. We also found that the graphics used in the message are also taken from a News App Daily Hunt\u2019s old political survey. This message is clichbait, do not click on this URL, nor forward it.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
