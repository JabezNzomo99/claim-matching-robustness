Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a LIC employee committing suicide over the government\u2019s decision to sell LIC. Fact: The man in the video is not a LIC employee. He committed suicide due to his personal reasons. It has nothing to do with the government\u2019s decision to sell a part of its stake in LIC. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video was uploaded in \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes were obtained. When these keyframes were subjected to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe was found in an article of \u2018DT NEXT\u2019. As per this article, the man committing suicide in the video is Sakthi, an army man. He was summoned to appear before an RDO inquiry commission that was set up after the death of his wife, Thenisha. When Sakthi, who was dejected, reached the Madurai Collectorate for the inquiry, all of a sudden he climbed up the transformer to end his life fearing police action. So, the man in the video has committed suicide due to his personal reasons. It has nothing to do with the government\u2019s decision to sell a part of its stake in LIC. Other news reports about the incident can be read here and here.\n\nPreviously, when the same video was shared as related to Amaravati and CAA protests, FACTLY has debunked the false claims. The fact-check articles can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the man in the video did not commit suicide over the government\u2019s decision to sell a part of its stake in LIC.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
