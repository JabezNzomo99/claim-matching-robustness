The caption reads, \u201cThough the idol is gone, Ganesha lives forever! And that story is the same for the true being, the soul, too. It is in this spirit and fervor that the immersion is celebrated all over India.\u201d\n\nThe video was taken on the National Highway 44 bridge that runs over the Krishna river in Beechupally, according to AFP Fact Check. Google Maps shows multiple Hindu temples located nearby.\n\nThe statues appear to depict the Hindu elephant-headed god Ganesha. At the end of the 10-day festival Ganesh Chaturthi, statues of Ganesha are immersed in rivers, according to the BBC.\n\nAs of May 31, India has nearly 90,000 active coronavirus cases and over 5,100 deaths, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website.", "lang": "en"}
