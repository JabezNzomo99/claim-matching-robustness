The quote in the post has been selectively edited to omit the following line which states: \u201cthe contamination did not spread the virus to people\u201d.\n\nAfter news broke in January about a new coronavirus emerging in China, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hurriedly sent a batch of testing kits to public health laboratories in America.\n\nThose kits were subsequently found to be faulty during testing done before they were put into use. Tests found that they returned false positive results. A June report into the bungled process, produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the General Counsel and published by the Washington Post, found \u201cone of the three reagents in this initial batch of manufactured test kits was likely contaminated.\n\nUS news outlets reported on the federal review findings, saying \u201csloppy laboratory practices\u201cand \u201ctime pressures\u201d led to a batch of contaminated tests being sent to nearly all of the 100 state and local public health labs.\n\nAn audit into CDC\u2019s processes has since been announced, to be handed down in 2021.\n\nThe Instagram post in question shows a partial quote from this article about the test failures on technology website Ars Technica. What is omitted from the quote is the following line which reads: \u201cThe contamination did not spread the virus to people, but it made test results uninterpretable\u201d.\n\nWhile the incident slowed US testing in the early stages of the pandemic, the OGC investigation concluded there was no evidence of false coronavirus test results on patients.\n\n\u201cThey could not validate the test\u2014a negative control gave a positive result\u2014and thus, the test kits were not used and no patient received an inaccurate test result,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAfter CDC scientists discovered the error in early February with a particular substance in the testing batch, the https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/5610e9fa-86d7-4bd3-8b7a-f8df10c6fc9e/note/7331ef79-a672-4d2d-9eff-f8ce39c2e462.#page=1 \u201c>problem was resolved later in the month and all tests were pulled from the affected laboratories. The suggestion that the tests may be in circulation ignores the fact the tainted test kits were no longer used.\n\nThe claim about the tests, which has been circulated in other forms such as here and here, has also been examined and found false by fact-checkers Politifact and Reuters.\n\nThis particular version has an Australian angle, claiming some governments are \u201cincentivising testing of healthy people\u2014as in Australia where $1500 has been offered to people to stay home if they get tested positive\u201d. This is inaccurate. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced in June that a $1,500 payment would be offered to Victorian workers required to self-isolate or quarantine because of a positive COVID-19 test or close contact.\n\nThe payment is only available to Victorian residents who are unable to work because of a health directive to self-isolate or go into quarantine, and who are unable to access other forms of income.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim that the COVID-19 test \u201chas the virus\u201d to be false. A batch of test kits produced early in the pandemic by the US CDC was found to be faulty, with components possibly contaminated with the virus. This fault was detected during pre-use validation testing and the kits were not used on patients. No incidents of false results in patients occurred, according to the investigation. The OGC report found the problem was resolved with the creation of new test kits. The suggestion that Australia is offering $1,500 incentive payments for people to stay home if they test positive is inaccurate as it relates only to specific workers in Victoria.
