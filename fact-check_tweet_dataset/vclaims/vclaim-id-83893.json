The claim is false; the clip has been taken from a longer broadcast that shows workers from two different political parties \u2013 Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) \u2013 waving their party flags. The green IUML flag with a white star and crescent is not the same as Pakistan\u2019s national flag.\n\nMultiple online posts have shared the 25-second clip, for example here where it has been shared more than 500 times since it was published to Facebook March 27, 2019, and here where it has been viewed around 6,000 times since it was published March 26.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cRahul to fight elections in Wayanad, Kerala.

He is standing as a candidate in Wayanad district in the southern state of Kerala in India's general election which began April 11, 2019.
