This claim is false; the district\u2019s health authority said there are no confirmed novel coronavirus patients in the area.\n\nThe claim was made on Facebook here on February 7, 2020. Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Hindi post translates to English as: \u201cThe condition of a man in Barhalganj remains serious due to coronavirus. He was admitted to a local hospital when his condition started deteriorating and it was found during the treatment that the virus entered his body after eating chicken. I request you all with folded hands, please do not consume any type of meat and pay attention to cleanliness. Forward this message through WhatsApp to make other people aware. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe claim was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook and here on Twitter.\n\nAs of February 24, 2020, the coronavirus has killed over 2,400 people and infected more than 80,000 globally, AFP reported.\n\nHowever, the claim about a confirmed infection in Barhalganj is false.\n\n\u201cThere are no confirmed novel coronavirus patients in the district,\u201d Dr. Shrikant Tiwari, the Chief Medical Officer of Gorakhpur district, told AFP by phone on February 20, 2020. \u201cWe had kept 35 people out of 43 who had returned to Gorakhpur from abroad since 10 January under strict observation, but all of them have been tested negative.\u201d\n\nLocal media reports, for example here and here in Hindi, also confirmed Dr. Tiwari\u2019s statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian government\u2019s Poultry Development Organization told AFP it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d and there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that novel coronavirus has been detected in poultry.\n\nNationwide, India has only recorded three cases of novel coronavirus, all of which were in the southern Indian state of Kerala. All three patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, the Ministry of Health announced on February 21, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
