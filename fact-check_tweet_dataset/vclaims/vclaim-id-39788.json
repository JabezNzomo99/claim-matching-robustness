The city itself owns and manages the building, so the notion of a \"ban\" on urinals was illogical and misleading.\n\nIn 2019, city officials in Portland confirmed urinals would not be installed in any bathrooms in the Portland Building after its renovation.\n\nWe received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 about the accuracy of reports that claimed officials in Portland, Oregon, had decided to \u201cban urinals\u201d from public buildings in the city.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted an article with the headline \u201cPortland Bans Urinals in Public Buildings \u2014 Out of Respect to the City\u2019s \u2018Shared Values,'\u201d which reported that:\n\n\u201cThe city of Portland (where else) is now banning urinals in city-owned buildings and spending taxpayer money to remove them. The first urinal-free building is appropriately called The Portland Building, where countless paper-shuffling city bureaucrats congregate to waste oxygen and demand pay raises.\u201d\n\nThat post cited an earlier article by local television channel KGW8, which reported that:\n\nThe City of Portland banned urinals in the remodeled Portland Building. Urinals, for those who have never been in a men\u2019s bathroom, are porcelain receptors without seats or lids that allow men to quickly relieve themselves \u2026 In an email to employees last February, Chief Administrative Officer Tom Rinehart wrote: \u201cWe will continue to have gender-specific (male and female) multi-stall restrooms that are readily available to any employee that prefers to use one. But, there will be no urinals in any restroom in the building. This will give us the flexibility we need for any future changes in signage.\u201d The city has redesigned all the bathrooms to be gender neutral \u2014 which means urinals are banned [even] in the men\u2019s room.\n\nKGW8 also claimed, in its headline, that urinals had been \u201cbanned\u201d from the Portland Building, though, unlike The Gateway Pundit, it did not claim the purported ban extended to all public buildings in the city.\n\nPortland city officials have indeed decided not to install urinals in any bathrooms in the Portland Building, which was under renovation as of September 2019. However, The Gateway Pundit\u2019s article was misleading and illogical in characterizing that decision as a \u201cban\u201d and also inaccurate in claiming that the urinal policy applied to all public buildings (or even more than one) in the city.\n\nA spokesperson for the city\u2019s Office of Management and Finance and the Portland Building reconstruction project confirmed to Snopes in an email that officials \u201cchose not to install urinals when the restrooms were remodeled,\u201d and provided a graphic that showed the expected layout of bathrooms in the building, including female, male and \u201call-user\u201d (gender-neutral) bathrooms.\n\nThe absence of urinals in either male or all-user bathrooms, the spokesperson explained, meant that \u201cin the future, we have the ability to move to all-user restrooms on additional floors.\u201d\n\nIn his email to employees in February 2019, Portland\u2019s Chief Administrative officer Tom Rinehart explained that all of the bathrooms had also been designed to be identical to one another, meaning that if officials later chose to convert some gender-specific bathrooms to gender-neutral status, that switch could more easily be made.\n\nThat email, and the plan in question, related only to the Portland Building, meaning The Gateway Pundit\u2019s headline claim \u2014 that the city had \u201cbanned urinals from public buildings\u201d \u2014 was false. Rather, the spokesperson told us:\n\n\u201cIt is possible that, in future remodels of other city buildings, urinals may not be installed if restrooms are renovated. There are no plans to remove urinals as a separate project.\u201d\n\nThe description of the Portland Building urinal policy as a \u201cban\u201d on urinals \u2014 as claimed by both The Gateway Pundit and KGW8 \u2014 was illogical and grossly misleading. The city itself owns and manages the building and is responsible for overseeing its renovation.\n\nRather, the city has made a design choice in order to facilitate potential future changes to the gender status of bathrooms in the building.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we issue a rating of \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
