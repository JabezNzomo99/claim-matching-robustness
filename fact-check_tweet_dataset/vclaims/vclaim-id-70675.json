So we did.\n\nTo quote the Internet, 'Merica!\n\nTo quote Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia, \"That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not.\"\n\nIt turns out that our third president, the lead author of the Declaration of Independence who left this earthly plane 188 years ago, remains a prolific \"author\" on the Internet.\n\nHe, too, has tackled topics as disparate as religion (\"The Bible is the source of liberty,\" a bogus quote) and the qualifications to run for political office (\"No man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which carries him into it,\" a verified quote).\n\nThe misattributions floating around the web got so bad that a few years ago, Berkes set up the Spurious Quotations page on the Monticello website.\n\nThe fake posted by Hice is a common mistake that was first incorrectly attributed to Jefferson in 1853. Historians long attributed the quote to Henry David Thoreau, who used a variation of it in his 1849 essay, \"Civil Disobedience,\" to argue that individuals should not let governments to make them agents of injustice.\n\nNew research indicates, though, that Thoreau himself was likely quoting the magazine, The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837, Berkes said.\n\n\"The opinion has been associated with Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it,\" Berkes said. \"The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It\u2019s just not a Jefferson quote.\"\n\nHice did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe may, as Berkes\u2019 suggests, find the dubious quotes still prove useful to convey a long-held ideology, regardless of the source.\n\nOr, as librarian and Jefferson researcher Eyler Robert Coates concludes, the attribution may belie a misunderstanding of Jefferson\u2019s views. Coates argues the quote does not represent Jefferson because of its vague, abstract use of \"best\" and \"least.\"\n\nOne thing that is clear, is that there is no verifiable evidence that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote the sentiment.\n\nCorrecting the record would surely square with Jefferson, who once said, \"If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed.\"\n\nOK, he didn\u2019t say that, either.\n\nThanks to Berkes\u2019 carefully footnoted research, we can rate both our claim and that from Hice as False.", "lang": "en"}
