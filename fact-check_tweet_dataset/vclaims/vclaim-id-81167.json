However, we found that the image shows KK Plaza in MP\u2019s Bhopal and the locals confirmed to The Quint that the billboard actually shows an advertisement of Bandhan Bank. Taking a dig at Congress, BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua shared the image on Twitter and wrote, \u201c\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0940 \u092b\u093c\u091c\u093c\u0940\u0939\u0924 \u0928\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u0928\u093e\u0925 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0926\u0940 \u2018\u0917\u0923\u0924\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938\u2019 \u0915\u0940 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u0964 One more Pappu ka Paplu\u201d The tweet had garnered over 1,100 likes and over 400 retweets at the time of publishing the article.

We could identify a banner saying \u201cAmit Shukla classes\u201d in the viral image and then searched on Google using keywords \u201cAmit Shukla classes madhya pradesh\u201d. This led us to its exact location as KK Plaza, Maharana Pratap Nagar, Bhopal. Then, we got in touch with a few locals near KK Plaza who refuted the claim that any \u2018Republic Day\u2019 poster featuring former chief minister Kamal Nath have been put over the said building. Maaz Usmani, who works in a restaurant called \u2018Khan Sahab Express\u2019 located in KK Plaza, shared the actual image of the billboard that can be seen over the building on email. \u201cThere is no billboard that shows Kamal Nath\u2019s photo or Republic day written on it. The actual billboard over the building has an advertisement of Bandhan Bank,\u201d he told The Quint. We also checked the EXIF data of the image sent by Maaz on email and the data revealed that the image was captured on Thursday, 13 August, at 6:18 pm. The EXIF data shows that the image has been clicked on 13 August at 6:18 pm. Further, Maaz is not the only one who confirmed that the viral image is fake. Two people working in a nearby hotel and a medical clinic respectively told The Quint that the billboard over the building shows a Bandhan Bank advertisement.\n\nMeanwhile, fact-checking website SM Hoax Slayer spoke to a person in an agency called RK Publicity, that had put the billboard showing the Bandhan Bank advertisement. \u201cThe agency had put up the Bandhan Bank advertisement two days back. Before that, it had the contact details of the agency in case anybody wanted to reach out to the agency.\u201d Further, it is extremely easy to put a fake or morphed poster over any image and can be done using photoshop or any other online editing tool. Evidently, the viral image tweeted out by BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua for mocking Congress for putting Republic Day billboards, ahead of Independence Day celebrations, is fake.", "lang": "en"}
