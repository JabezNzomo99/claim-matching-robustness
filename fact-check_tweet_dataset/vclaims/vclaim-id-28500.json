This is misleading; koalas are considered a vulnerable population by the IUCN, overall whale and polar bear populations are not thriving despite certain healthy subspopulations, and the IUCN told AFP extinctions are not down.\n\n\u201cPolar bears have increased 400% in 45 yrs. Whales are nearly fully recovered. Extinctions are down 90% past century (IUCN). Koalas doing fine.\u201d This optimistic take on the current state of the world\u2019s biodiversity was shared more than 5,000 times on Twitter, as well as on Facebook as a screenshot.\n\nThe tweet was published Dr. Patrick Moore, an early member of Greenpeace. He was once listed as a founding member for the environmental organization but has since been repudiated by the group which states that Moore usually takes \u201cpositions that Greenpeace opposes.\" .\n\nMoore currently serves on the Board of Directors for the CO2 Coalition, a US based lobby group which says it seeks to educate lawmakers and the public \u201cabout the important contribution made by carbon dioxide to our lives and the economy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the tweet is misleading, according to experts interviewed by AFP.\n\n\u201cThe number of people having an interest in spreading misinformation about the status of polar bears is surprisingly high, and a source of despair for us working in the area,\u201d Dag Vongraven, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Polar Institute and co-chair of the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), told AFP in an email.\n\nOf the 19 polar bear subpopulations around the globe, only two had population estimates prior to 1980. The first wide-ranging estimate was the PBSG\u2019s first status table, published in 1993. Even then, Vongraven pointed out, \u201cWe have little or no knowledge of polar bears in half the area where the species exists,\u201d due to lack of data for Russia, the Polar Basin and large parts of Greenland.\n\nData from the last two decades shows that two subpopulations of polar bears have likely increased, four have likely declined, five are likely stable, and the rest are data deficient.\n\nStudies, including this one from 2016, predict that sea ice loss in the Arctic will lead to declines in polar bear numbers in the future as their habitat shrink.\n\n\u201cIt would be too easy to say that all is well in whale country\u201d\n\nThe statement that \u201cwhales are nearly recovered,\u201d does not reflect reality, according to Robert Michaud, president of the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals, a Quebec non-profit dedicated to scientific research and education for marine conservation.\n\nMichaud told AFP that whale population estimates are nuanced and vary not only across subspecies but also within subspecies in different parts of the world\u2019s oceans.\n\n\u201cThere are 400 black whales in the Atlantic, so they are on the verge of extinction. Meanwhile, all fin whales populations from Antarctica to the Arctic are doing very well,\u201d Michaud told AFP. \u201cBut if we were to take the pulse of all whales and the threats to their lives, we could not say that they are doing well,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe International Whaling Commission (IWC), an international agency that regulates commercial whaling to ensure conservation of whale stocks, assesses whale status by population rather than by species. Their numbers are available here, although the group\u2019s website warns that their figures are a \u201cbest estimate.\u201d\n\nThe IWC website states that although the recovery of some whale populations is a major conservation success, \u201cThis is certainly not the case for all, and some populations remain critically endangered.\u201d They cite accidental bycatch in fishing nets, collision with ships, ocean noise and other forms of habitat degradation as the main threats to whales.\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is one of the most exhaustive biodiversity population compilations, and is used as a reference by many.\n\nMoore\u2019s tweet presents the 90 percent decrease in extinctions in the last century as an IUCN figure. However, Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List, told AFP in an email, \u201cThere is no evidence that the number of extinctions is slowing, the reverse is in fact true.\u201d\n\nHilton-Taylor provided AFP with a graph (see below) produced for the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which aims to provide guidance for leaders making policy on biodiversity. It uses IUCN Red List data on extinctions worldwide, and shows a continuous increase starting around the time of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe tweet also makes the sweeping claim that \u201ckoalas are doing fine.\u201d Although the organizations contacted by AFP do not agree on their numbers, neither agreed with Moore\u2019s assessment of the marsupial\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cThe Koala is not doing fine, that is why it is listed as vulnerable. Numbers have been declining and are projected to continue to do so,\u201d Craig Hilton-Taylor told AFP.\n\nThe IUCN Red List estimates that there are 300,000 mature individuals, and that the population is decreasing, citing drought, tree deaths and habitat fragmentation caused by vegetation clearance as the main factors for the decrease.\n\nThe Australian Koala Foundation (AKF), a nonprofit dedicated to koala conservation, contests the IUCN numbers and suggests that there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in Australia. The results of the foundation\u2019s research can be found on Bob\u2019s Map, named after a past chairman of the AKF.\n\n\u201cAKF does not believe they are doing just fine,\u201d Deborah Tabart, current chairman of the AKF, told AFP in an email.\n\nKoalas have been legally listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Australia\u2019s main environmental piece of legislation, since April 2012.\n\nWindmills are a large source of mortality for birds, but various studies on the topic provide different numbers. One 2013 study cited by the US Fish and Wildlife service estimated that collisions with land-based wind turbines killed an average of 234,012 birds per year in the US.\n\nThe largest threat to birds by far was cats, who kill an average of 2.4 billion birds every year.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading claims about wind turbines and bird deaths in North America.", "lang": "en"}
