The two dogs then chase and pin down the man in the red trousers as the man in the yellow jacket tries to set him free from their grip.\n\nThe Hindi caption accompanying the video claims, \"Kashmiri stone pelters throw stones at army dogs...the dog did not wait for government orders and did what it felt was best. \"\n\nThe video has gone viral across Facebook over the past few days. An archived version of one of the Facebook posts can be viewed here.\n\nA reverse image search on the image directed us to a YouTube video uploaded in 2013 with the caption:'Karma! RAGE Idiot Throws Brick At Dogs And Gets Justice DOG ATTACK!'\n\nThe same video has also been uploaded on several other online platforms.\n\nA caption with the above video claims that the incident took place in Morocco.\n\nWe found another article about the incident published in April 2013 which said an altercation between the man walking his dogs and other men on the street resulted in the attack.\n\nAlso, if one hears intently, it is clear from the video that the language being spoken is not Kashmiri or Urdu or any other of its variants.", "lang": "en"}
