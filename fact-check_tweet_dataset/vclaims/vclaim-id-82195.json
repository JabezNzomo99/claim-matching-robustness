DeLauro to issue a statement warning of \u201cmore imports flooding in from Vietnam and Malaysia\u201d because of the pending 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal will make it harder for Food and Drug Administrators to do their jobs.\n\nDeLauro is a fierce opponent of giving President Obama enhanced trade negotiating authority to complete the deal. As the statement noted, DeLauro is the former chairman (and still a member) of the Appropriations Committee panel overseeing the FDA, where presumably she has been in a position to enhance funding for seafood inspections. Her statement said that the FDA currently does not have the resources to inspect more than one percent of frozen shrimp imports.\n\nIn fact, barely any shrimp products from those countries are covered by tariffs \u2014 just two lines of HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) codes with duties that in 2014 amounted to about \u00bc of one percent of the shrimp imports from Vietnam and zero from Malaysia. (In fact, these two codes refer to non-frozen packaged meals in which shrimp is just one component.)\n\nNow, some Vietnamese importers are subject to anti-dumping duties because the Commerce Department, at the urging of domestic producers, brought a case against them. (The rate was recently cut.) But such trade remedies would still be available under the TPP.\n\nSara Lonardo, communications director for DeLauro, noted that the TPP \u201cwill reduce tariffs on 76 lines of seafood, including two lines of shrimp that are currently set at five percent.\u201d (This is the packaged meals in which shrimp is a component and barely imported from the countries in question.)\n\n\u201cFree trade deals with favorable provisions for partner nations will stimulate investment and increase seafood imports,\u201d she added. \u201cMany of the provisions in the TPP designed to make the agreement appealing for partner nations, such as the chapters on investment, dispute settlement, and sanitary/phytosanitary provisions, would encourage more investment in TPP countries as an export platform to the United States \u2013 at the expense of our current leading seafood trading partners.\u201d\n\nShe argued that \u201cnowhere do we talk about removing tariffs. We talk about the impact on regulations. Which is because the TPP is not just about tariffs, it is about the impact on our regulations and laws.\u201d She added that \u201cour understanding of the sanitary/phytosanitary provisions is that the TPP would limit our ability to stop unsafe food from entering U.S. commerce.\u201d (Administration officials dispute that, saying TPP would seek to improve the systems in other countries and make it harder for them to evade responsibility.)\n\nThe FDA recently rejected 107 shipments of frozen shrimp, mainly from Malaysia and Vietnam, because antibiotics residues were found, prompting the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers to warn farmers to improve their practices. The number of shipments rejected by the FDA has increased 224 percent in the first two months of the year, to the highest rate in 10 years.\n\nDeLauro\u2019s statement certainly gives the impression that frozen shrimp exports would be \u201cflooding\u201d into the United States from Vietnam and Malaysia because of the lower tariffs inherent in the agreement. Yet her staff can only point to two minor shrimp lines that would be affected, which were not even featured in the Consumer Reports article. Frozen shrimp already enter the United States duty free \u2014 and TPP would not change that.\n\nCertainly food safety is an important issue, as documented by Consumer Reports. Yet, in theory, if TPP improves Vietnam\u2019s sanitary and phytosanitary systems, then Ecuador, Indonesia, Bangladesh and India might lose market share \u2014 and they fare even worse in the bacteria tests.\n\nIn any case, it is misleading for DeLauro to suggest that the free-trade deal would result in more frozen shrimp imports \u201cflooding in from Vietnam and Malaysia\u201d when trade in frozen shrimp already is duty-free.", "lang": "en"}
