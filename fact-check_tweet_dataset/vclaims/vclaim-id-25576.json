Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photos of children being kidnapped in Odisha. Fact: Two photos in the post are related to an incident in Haryana where a family was stopped by the locals on the suspicion of kidnapping children and taking them in a car trunk. It was later found that the children belonged to that family and were sitting in the car trunk as there was no space in the car. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photos in the post were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a photo was found in an article published by \u2018Dainik Bhaskar\u2019. According to that article, the children in the car trunk were not kidnapped. They were just sitting in the car trunk as there was no space in the car. The door of the trunk was kept open for air and was tied to the window as a safety measure. Some locals, who saw the children in the car, stopped the family and called the police.\n\nAnother photo in the post is also related to the same incident and can be found in the article by \u2018Punjab Kesari\u2019. A video was also taken during this incident which can be seen here.\n\nThe context of the other three photos in the post cannot be ascertained, as they were not found on the internet.\n\nTo sum it up, children were sitting in the car trunk as there was no space in the car, not because they were kidnapped.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
