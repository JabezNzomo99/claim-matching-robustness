She appears in a blue dress laughing and holding round piece of paper in her hand.\n\nThe viral image started circulating on Facebook after the House voted to impeach Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It suggests that the photograph shows Tlaib celebrating that Dec. 18 impeachment vote.\n\n\u201cIt was a somber time for the Democrats as they voted to impeach the president,\u201d says the caption.

Taken by photographer Win McNamee Nov. 30, 2018, the photo actually captures the moment after Tlaib drew the number eight lottery ticket during new member orientation, per its caption. Incoming members of Congress draw lottery numbers to determine the order in which they select available congressional office space.\n\nOn Dec. 18, the House voted on two articles of impeachment against Trump. On the article charging Trump with abuse of power, the House voted 230-197. On the article charging Trump with obstruction of Congress, the House voted 229-198. No Republicans voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment, and three Democrats voted against at least one article. (One of the Democrats, New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, has said he plans to switch parties.)\n\nTlaib drew criticism Jan. 3, her first day in office, for saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to impeachment the motherf****r.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
