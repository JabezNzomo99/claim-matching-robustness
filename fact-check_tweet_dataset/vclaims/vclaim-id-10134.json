She said that this was the Met\u2019s current \u201cplanning assumption\u201d and relied on projections for things like inflation, the exchange rate and pay settlements remaining the same over the next few years.\n\nThis scenario would lead to police officer numbers in the Met falling to \u201cbetween 27,500 and 28,000\u201d, from the current level of \u201cover 30,000\u201d. Commissioner Dick then confirmed that she expected numbers to fall by around 3,000.\n\nThe latest available data puts the number of Met police officers available for duty at 30,000 at the end of March 2017. This is the full-time equivalent figure, meaning that two officers working half a week each would count as one full-time equivalent officer.\n\nAlthough there are 32,000 full-time equivalent police officers in the Met altogether, some are \u201clong-term absentees\u201d and so not available for duty.\n\nAcross England and Wales the number of police officers overall has been declining since 2010.", "lang": "en"}
