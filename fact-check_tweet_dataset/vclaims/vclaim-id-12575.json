Although inaccurate, the post was shared over a thousand times on multiple Facebook pages.\n\nSimply clicking on Sajjan\u2019s tweet is enough to realize the meme\u2019s misleading nature. The defence minister\u2019s tweet is in response to a campaign that took place mostly on the night of Halloween 2018. On October 31, individuals throughout Canada and the United States answered online calls to leave posters stating, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be white\u201d in public venues. In reference to the campaign and the motives of those who instigated it, Sajjan tweeted that \u201cthe racist overtones they represent have no place in Canada.\u201d He added that his government would \u201ccontinue to stand up to hatred and intolerance.\u201d\n\nA coordinated campaign from the internet\n\nThe 2018 \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be white\u201d campaign was a repeat of the same effort which took place in 2017. Individuals across North America answered calls posted on online forums like Reddit and 4chan to affix the posters in order to provoke an overreaction from perceived \u201cleftists\u201d and the \u201cMSM\u201d (mainstream media). The intent was to shift public opinion by creating a perception of unfair treatment toward those identifying as white. Some internet users harbored hopes that the campaign would \u201cconvert\u201d certain citizens to the alt-right movement.\n\nIn their posts, organizers said the date was set for Halloween to enable those who took part in the campaign to remain anonymous by wearing masks and blending in with other people in costumes. Participants were encouraged to affix posters on university campuses and downtown buildings, only using this original font.\n\nIn Canada, the subreddit r/metacanada was particularly active in organizing the campaign, with users posting regular reminders and monitoring media responses to the effort. In the days following October 31, the posters were found in Toronto, Ottawa, Greater Vancouver, Edmonton, Halifax, Winnipeg, and Regina.\n\nIn the United States, some campaign organizers , such as those on this archived 4chan thread, seemed to have more clearly defined political goals, hoping to influence the US midterm elections.\n\nThe New Westminster police, in the Greater Vancouver area, stated that it had opened a file on the case.\n\nThe false Facebook meme also accused Sajjan of belonging to the Khalistan separatist movement, an Indian movement represented by Babbar Khalsa, which is on the Canadian government\u2019s list of terrorist entities.\n\nAlthough the claim cannot be disproved, no evidence suggests its veracity either. The same accusation, without evidence, has been made against other Sikh Canadian politicians, such as New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh.", "lang": "en"}
