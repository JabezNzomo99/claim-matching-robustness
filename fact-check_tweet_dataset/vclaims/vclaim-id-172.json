(here) (here)\n\nThe post, which was originally written as satire but since has been shared in a way that has led some social media users to react in anger, claims two doctors who treated Johnson at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London said his condition was \u201ccontrived\u201d.\n\n\u201c\u2019He had the most pathetic, contrived cough I have heard in all my years of practise! I\u2019d\u2019ve sent him home with a packet of Lockets and bottle of Calcough Children\u2019s Syrup\u2019 - Knott. \u2018If he had Covid-19 then I\u2019m not a doctor!\u201d - Pullin,\u201d the post reads.\n\nJohnson first entered hospital on April 5 after suffering from the symptoms of COVID-19 for more than a week. He spent a week in hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before being discharged on April 12.\n\nThe claim on social media first appeared in the Facebook group \u2018A Poke in the Eye With a Sharp Wit\u2019 in a post by social media user Anthony George. The group describes itself as \u201ca place for political humour and satire, poking fun at those in the government of the day.\u201d (here) (here)\n\nAnthony George told Reuters he wrote the post as satire in a group where it would be viewed as such. \u201cThere was nothing personal intended towards Boris Johnson himself indeed, had it been Jeremy Corbyn or any other PM, I would have said the same,\u201d he said.\n\nIt has since spread online, with some believing it to be true. \u201cContrived cough, fake symptoms and taking up an intensive care bed which was probably needed by a genuine covid 19 patient,\u201d one comment reads.\n\nThe doctors mentioned in the post are not real. No doctors named Shirley Knott and Ashleigh Pullin appear on the General Medical Council (GMC) medical register. (here)\n\nGeorge said their names are a nod to them being fictitious: \u201cShirley Knott - surely not\u201d and \u201cAshleigh Pullen - actually pulling (your leg)\u201d.\n\nFalse: the post claiming British PM Boris Johnson did not have the coronavirus was originally written as satire.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
