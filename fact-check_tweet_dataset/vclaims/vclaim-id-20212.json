The initial cover period from 1st June 2015 to 31st May 2016 now stands renewed every year from 1st of June to 31st May the next year. 13.25 crore account-holders have insured themselves for personal accident cover under PMSBY till December 2017\u2019. It also states that a total of 14,292 claims have been paid.\n\nIt is also necessary to note that, though not entirely this integrated and not focused on accidents, a similar scheme existed during the UPA government as well. A response in Lok Sabha states that \u2018Ministry of Labour and Employment is implementing the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) to provide smart card based cashless health insurance, including maternity benefit, cover of Rs. 30,000 per annum on family floater basis to BPL families (a unit of five). Apart from BPL families, RSBY coverage has been extended to various other categories of unorganised workers viz.

As on 17.02.2014 more than 3.77 crore families are availing the benefits of the scheme across the country\u2019.\n\nHow many people benefitted from the PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana?\n\n The second claim is that \u2018PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana benefitted 5.22 crore families at 330 rupees per year\u2019.\n\nThe Annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states \u2018the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) offers life insurance of Rs. 2 lakh at an annual premium of Rs. 330 for bank account holders (18-50 years) .The scheme was also launched in May 2015\u2019.\n\nThe report also further details that \u2018PMJJBY offers renewable annual life cover of Rs. 2 lakh to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 50 years, covering death due to any reason, for a premium of Rs.330 per annum per subscriber.

This aims to provide monthly pension to eligible subscribers not covered under any organized pension scheme. APY is open to all bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 40 years. Under APY, any subscriber can opt a guaranteed pension of Rs 1000 to Rs 5000 (in multiples of Rs. 1,000) receivable at the age of 60 years. The contributions to be made vary based on pension amount chosen. The Central Government would co-contribute 50% of the total contribution or Rs. 1,000 per annum, whichever is lower, for a period of 5 years for those eligible subscribers who joined the scheme between the period 1st June, 2015 and 31st March, 2016 and who are not members of any statutory social security scheme and who are not income-tax payers\u2019.\n\nIt is further mentioned that \u2018as on 30th December 2017, 79.20 lakh subscribers have been enrolled under APY\u2019. However, a more recent reply in Lok Sabha states that \u2018as on 10th December 2018, 1.33 crore subscribers have been enrolled under APY\u2019.\n\nWhat is the PM Vaya Vandana Yojana? \n\n The fourth claim is that \u2018Financial security of senior citizens has been ensured with PM Vaya Vandana Yojana, that gives 8% interest for 10 years and investment limit doubled to Rs. 15 lakh rupees and scheme extended till 2020\u2019.\n\nThe Annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018Government has also launched a scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY )to protect elderly persons aged 60 and above against a future fall in their interest income due to the uncertain market condition, as also to provide social security during old age.
