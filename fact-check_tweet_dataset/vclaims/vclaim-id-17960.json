(Kanygin says Moskalkova abruptly ended the interview and kicked him out of the car after she became frustrated with his questioning, leaving him on the side of the road).\n\n\n\n Her claim appears to be correct: she does not appear to have ever gone on record calling for the restoration of the Soviet-era law criminalizing homosexual acts between men that was abolished under Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1993. (Kanygin alleged in the interview that she had advocated for the return of the law).\n\n\n\n But while Moskalkova, a retired senior police officer and former federal lawmaker, says that she \u201cvalues\u201d the rejection of the law,according to Novaya Gazeta she said in an interview -- also with Kanygin -- as recently as 2013 that Russia perhaps acted rashly in abolishing it in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n \u201cPerhaps it was premature for our society to reject criminal liability\u201d for homosexuality,\u201d Moskalkova, then a member of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, said in the interview.\n\n\n\n Also in 2013, Moskalkova and her fellow lawmakers backed new legislation enacted that year banning the dissemination among children of \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relationships.\"\n\nThe law was widely denounced by activists and foreign governments as discriminatory against sexual minorities and prompted world leaders to boycott the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. In the 2013 interview with Kanygin, Moskalkova equated \u201cpropaganda\u201d of same-sex relationships with \u201cpropaganda for drugs, propaganda for smoking.\u201d\n\nThe State Duma in April endorsed Moskalkova for her new post In her first major speech after her appointment, she said she plans to \u201cresist attempts by the West to use human rights as a political instrument.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
