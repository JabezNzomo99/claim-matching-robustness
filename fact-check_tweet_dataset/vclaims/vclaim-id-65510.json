To quell the protests, the Trump administration authorized the deployment of federal agents to Portland.\n\nIn recent days, multiple Facebook users have shared an image of a person dressed in futuristic-looking body armor, claiming it shows a \u201cfederal stormtrooper deployed in Portland to deal with peaceful protestors.\u201d\n\nThat is, however, not the case. Photos taken by The Associated Press show federal agents in Portland dressed in camouflage fatigues and riot gear, not the futuristic uniform pictured in the image being shared.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered the photo actually shows concept art of a futurist police uniform. Australia-based artist Michael Andrew Nash posted the image on a forum in August 2016, and it also appears in his online portfolio.\n\nWhen the image resurfaced on social media this week, Nash commented on his Facebook page that it\u2019s \u201cgreat to fool political nuters (sic), job done.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Obama Signed The Law Authorizing Federal Agents To \u2018Snatch\u2019 Protesters Off The Streets in Portland)\n\n\u201cThere is actually a hidden meaning behind the work but I never told anyone about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see the meaning behind my work come out in different ways.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
