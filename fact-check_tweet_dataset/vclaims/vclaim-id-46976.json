He also received tax-free benefits,\n\ndaughter of Manmohan Singh \u2013 from Delhi University were made faculties.\n\n\n\n4.\n\nDaman Singh and Amrit Singh, also daughters of Manmohan Singh, were\n\nappointed honorary faculties. They stayed in the US while drawing salary\n\nfrom the institution.\n\n\n\n5. After 2014, when Modi arrived, all these fraud were stopped and Amartya Sen was thrown out of Nalanda University.\n\nThe following excerpt has been taken from our older article on this issue, which provides a detailed fact check on each of the claims.\n\nAmartya Sen\u2019s salary as the Chancellor of\n\nNalanda University has been under controversy since 2015, when\n\nSubramanian Swamy had taken this up with the university.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hindu, the university retorted back by saying that Swami\u2019s allegations were \u2018false\u2019 and that Sen received no remuneration during his tenure as Chancellor as his work was done in honorary capacity.\n\nUniversity also claimed that Sen did in fact receive a free Air India\n\npass from former Prime Minsiter Atal Behari Vajpayee to celebrate his\n\nNobel Prize, which had nothing to do with the university.\n\nIn Indian universities, the position of Chancellor is ceremonial, and does not have any administrative functions\n\nNalanda University Act clarifies that it is the Vice-Chancellor who is\n\nthe principal academic and executive officer of the University.\n\nTherefore, Sen was never conferred the power to \u2018run\u2019 the institution.\n\nBOOM reached out to Sen for a comment on this matter, and the article will be updated upon receiving a response.\n\nThe WhatsApp message implies that an amount of Rs. 2729 crore had been spent under the Chancellorship of Dr. Sen.\n\nApril 22, 2015, V. K. Singh as the Minister of State of External\n\nAffairs stated that while an amount of Rs. 2727 crore had been approved\n\nby the Government of India for the establishment of the University, only\n\nRs. 47.28 crore had been released at the time of this statement.\n\nTherefore, an expenditure of Rs. 2729 crore is practically impossible.\n\n3. Dr Gopa Sabharwal, Dr Anjana Sharma, Nayanjot Lahiri and Upinder Singh from Delhi University were made faculties.\n\nfound that Dr. Gopa Sabharwal was indeed the Vice-Chancellor of Nalanda\n\nUniversity while Dr. Anjana Sharma was the Founding Dean (Academic\n\nHowever, no mention of Lahiri or Singh was found on the Nalanda University website.\n\nBOOM reached out to Lahiri, who rubbished the claims.\n\nhave neither applied for a faculty position at Nalanda nor did I ever\n\nserve as faculty there. I have not been paid even a rupee by Nalanda in\n\nBOOM also reached out to Singh, and the article will be updated when she responds.\n\n4. Daman Singh and Amrit Singh, also daughters of Manmohan Singh, were appointed honorary faculties.\n\ndid not find any mention of Daman Singh and Amrit Singh on the Nalanda\n\nUniversity website, nor was there any report that shed light on their\n\neditor at The Hindu, claimed in a tweet in response to Jain\u2019s that after\n\na check she found out that neither of the two names mentioned were made\n\nfaculty at the University. She also claimed that one of them doesn\u2019t\n\neven live in the USA, as claimed by the viral message.\n\nBOOM reached out to Daman Singh for a comment. The article will be updated if and when she responds.\n\n5. After 2014, when Modi arrived, all these fraud were stopped and Amartya Sen was thrown out of Nalanda University\n\nSen\u2019s tenure as Chancellor ended with his first term in the position,\n\nwhich lasted for three years as per the Nalanda University Act.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hindu,\n\nProf. Sen had claimed that there was a unanimous resolution for a\n\nrenewal of his Chancellorship for another term. However, Dr. Sen had\n\nrefused to do a second term as he felt that the government wants him \u201cto\n\ncease being the Chancellor of Nalanda University\u201d.\n\na question at the Rajya Sabha dated August 13, 2015, V. K. Singh had\n\nstated that Prof. Sen \u201chad publicly declared that he wanted to exclude\n\nhimself from being considered for continuing as Chancellor of Nalanda\n\nResponse by V K Singh, Minister of State of External Affairs at the Rajya Sabha, 13.08.2015.\n\nThus, its safe to say that the WhatsApp message has some gaping loopholes that question its credibility.", "lang": "en"}
