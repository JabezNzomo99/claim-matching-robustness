Between March 2015 and February 2016, 238 cases where patients had experienced deterioration in vision due to a delay in review or treatment were reported.\n\nTo get further information, the researchers contacted the ophthalmologists who had reported these cases. After excluding non-responses, duplicate and irrelevant records, 169 patient cases were included in the study. Of the 169 patients included, 42% had a main diagnoses of glaucoma.\n\nThis reporting system did not cover all ophthalmologists in the UK, and as such the researchers estimated that there could be as many as 260 such cases a year (or between 15 and 22 a month).", "lang": "en"}
