In fact there don\u2019t seem to be any readily-available estimates of the age of people claiming welfare benefits overall. It\u2019s possible to get this for individual benefits, but this doesn\u2019t answer the claim. We\u2019ve asked Ms Abbott\u2019s office for the source.\n\nThe most claimed welfare payments are claimed entirely or predominantly by pensioners\u2014provided you count pensions as welfare. Just under 16 million people got a Christmas Bonus last year (\u00a310 paid to people who get certain welfare payments), 13 million got the State Pension and 12 million got a Winter Fuel Payment.\n\nThese figures just relate to Great Britain as the Northern Ireland Executive is responsible for welfare payments there.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge overlap here: most people who claim the State Pension get the Christmas Bonus and Winter Fuel Payment automatically.\n\nAs a rough estimate we could be looking at around 13 million pensioners who claim welfare payments in Great Britain. So for Ms Abbott to be right, we\u2019d need to find something like 20 million people of working age or children receiving other payments.\n\nThe biggest bulk of that would have to be the 7.4 million families claiming Child Benefit for nearly 13 million children, for example. You\u2019d also have to consider big caseloads like tax credits and housing benefit. Again, we can\u2019t produce an estimate here because some people will claim several of these at once.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s possible to get a clearer picture by just looking at what\u2019s spent on welfare rather than who\u2019s claiming it. An estimated 56% of all welfare spending in Great Britain goes to pensioners. That\u2019s been rising since 2009 when it was 52%, as government spending policies since then have largely protected pensioners.", "lang": "en"}
