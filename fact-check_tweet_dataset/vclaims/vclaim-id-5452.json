For two years, she not only attended classes but engaged in a systematic effort to promote Russia among Americans involved in politics.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "July 27, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5452", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/butina-foreign-agent-student/29394619.html", "vclaim": "The Kremlin continues its full-throated campaign to #FreeMariaButina, the 29-year-old \u201cstudent\u201d who is accused of insinuating herself into conservative and pro-gun politics in the United States.\n\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman\u2014Artyom Kozhin \u2013 Thursday, July 26, accused the U.S. of charging Butina with violating the foreign agent law, \u201cthough she has not worked for any foreign state, and studied at a Washington university.\u201d\n\nA criminal complaint issued on July 14 charged the Russian woman with conspiring with \u201cothers\u2026including an official of the Russian Federation,\u201d to violate the U.S. foreign agent law, through \u201can effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation\u201d without informing the U.S. government of her efforts.\n\nWe are tempted to call Kozhin\u2019s comment \u201cFalse,\u201d as we did earlier this week regarding Russian comments calling the charges against Butina \u201ctrumped up.\u201d Yet, it is likely Butina\u2019s U.S. lawyer will attempt to convince a judge or jury, if the case gets that far, that she did not act as a foreign agent. So, with the fine point of the foreign agent law in front of the court, instead we will call his official government comment \u201cMisleading,\u201d mostly because Polygraph.info does not have a \u201cDisingenuous\u201d verdict.\n\n\u200bFrom the U.S. court pleadings the U.S. government argues that Butina acted as more than a mere student, taking \u201cdirection\u201d from a Russian official. From her own words on social media in Russia, it is clear Butina\u2019s loyalties lie with her government and its policy positions.\n\nA 17-page affidavit filed by FBI Agent Kevin Helson establishes that Butina \u201cserved as a Special Assistant to the RUSSIAN OFFICIAL\u201d referenced in the allegations, both before she entered the U.S. on a student visa and afterwards.\n\nThough the Russian official is unnamed, reporting in the Western press indicates the description matches the public profile of Alexander Torshin, who was once a member of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament, Russian legislative body and is a top official of Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe FBI agent\u2019s affidavit details Butina\u2019s contacts with a gun rights organization \u2013 identified in reporting as the National Rifle Association -- contacts with U.S. Republican Party political figures and successful efforts to bring Russian representatives to the National Prayer Breakfast in 2016 and 2017.\n\nHelson writes he believes e-mail and Twitter conversations \u201crepresent BUTINA\u2019s plan to conduct activities as an illegal agent of the Russian Federation in the United States through a Russian influence operation.\u201d\n\nThe FBI agent quotes communications \u201cthat reflect direction and coordination of BUTINA\u2019s efforts by the RUSSIAN OFFICIAL.\u201d\n\nButina\u2019s American lawyer, in an appearance on the U.S. network CNN, called the details \u201cpretty thin gruel\u201d for a women who\u2019s been in the U.S. and \u201cunder surveillance\u201d for two years.\n\n\"I think that, like most of the government's case, is taken completely out of context,\" Attorney Robert Driscoll told the network. \"Those Twitter DMs -- which, by the way, most Russian spies don't communicate by Twitter DM -- which are unencrypted, there's thousands of them. ... There's Twitter DMs about picking up toothpaste in America. There's DMs with pictures of kids and dogs and everything else.\"\n\nHe said most of the government\u2019s case \u201cis taken completely out of context.\u201d\n\nTwo former U.S. spies, who themselves maintain public social media profiles, say in Twitter postings that Butina did not appear to be a typical government spy.\n\n\u201cButina is not a professional intelligence officer, but a source who develops access to people\u2026to the pros so they know who is vulnerable and who to go after,\u201d wrote John Sipher, a verified Twitter user who lists himself as formerly working in the \u201cCIA Clandestine Service.\u201d\n\nSteven Hall, also apparently a former CIA officer, wrote \u201cthis does not look like a classical Russian intelligence operation,\u201d on his unverified Twitter account.\n\n\u201cButina was definitely in touch with oligarchs, all of whom work for Putin,\u201d said Hall, whose account identifies him as \u201cRetired CIA Chief of Russian Operations.\u201d Hall also writes for The Cipher Brief, which says he retired from the CIA in 2015 \u201cafter 30 years of running and managing intelligence operations in Eurasia and Latin America.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier fact check of a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, Polygraph.info established Butina\u2019s social media presence in Russia. Russian and English profiles on the Russian social media platform vKontakte and blogs on the Livejournal.Ru website and Russian magazine Snob that left no question as to where her loyalties lie.", "lang": "en"}
