(RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say,\u2019Freedom Is Lost Gradually From An Uninterested, Uninformed, And Unresponsive People?\u2019)\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no evidence that the statement originated with Jefferson. A search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson yielded no results. The quote doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in a collection of his quotes and letters either.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, includes the quote on its running list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to exist mainly on Twitter,\u201d writes research librarian Anna Berkes on the Monticello website. \u201cBut we have been unable to trace its existence before 2015.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Caller traced the quote back to the same year. The earliest known instance of the saying being attributed to Jefferson appears in an October 2015 tweet from user Ziad K. Abdelnour, though there may be prior occurrences.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this Twitter user originated the quote or simply perpetuated an already circulating one.", "lang": "en"}
