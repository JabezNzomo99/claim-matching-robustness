The tweet is viral in the backdrop of a series of tweets by Ranaut and counter statements by Maharashtra political leaders against her.\n\nShiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik said that the actress should be booked for sedition after she likened Mumbai to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK), while Sanjay Raut on September 1, 2020, wrote in the party's mouthpiece Saamna, that if the actress did not feel safe, she should not return to the city. Responding to Raut's statement, Ranaut who is currently in Manali tweeted that she will be returning to Mumbai on September 9, challenging if anyone can stop her. \n\n\n\nBOOM received the screenshot of the tweet by the fake Twitter account on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111)\n\nOn searching with the text of the tweet on Twitter, we found that the fake account had changed its handle name from @RealThackeray to @ThackerayOffic.
