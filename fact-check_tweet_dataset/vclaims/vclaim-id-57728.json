We also condemn violence.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro added that he did not see any attacks on journalists, only \u201cthe joy of the people.\u201d\n\nVideo reports from the rally tell a different story, and the Reuters news agency cited witnesses who said \u201cat least three photographers were attacked by demonstrators\u201d at Sunday\u2019s rally of Bolsonaro supporters. According to Reuters, such incidents are \u201can increasingly routine occurrence in Brazil, where Bolsonaro routinely calls the work of major newspapers \u2018fake news\u2019.\u201d\n\nOne victim, a photographer from the Sao Paulo newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, was \u201cpulled off a ladder and repeatedly kicked in the ribs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, O Estado de S. Paulo \u201creported that one of its photographers and his driver were attacked by demonstrators, and that they had to leave under police escort. Two of its reporters covering the event were verbally insulted, but not attacked.\u201d\n\nOn May 3, Al Jazeera\u2019s political show The Listening Post showed a video excerpt in which Bolsonaro points his left index finger towards the group of reporters and addresses his followers: \u201cThese people say I am wrong and that you all must stay at home.\u201d He then turns to the media present and asks: \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of coronavirus? Go home!\u201d\n\nThe Al Jazeera program included other excerpts of video shot at Bolsonaro public appearances during which he specifically named Rede Globo and O Estado de S. Paulo as outlets with which he \u201cdoes not chat.\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian media watchdog Federacao Nacional dos Jornalistas (FENAJ) reported that in 2019, Bolsonaro made 116 comments about the press that the group considered \u201cattacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a head of state systematically attacks professionals and the media, he encourages his supporters to do the same, including with intimidation, threats and even aggression. Bolsonaro potentiates aggression against journalists, and with that he defies democratic values,\u201d said Maria Jos\u00e9 Braga, FENAJ\u2019s president.\n\nSindicato dos Jornalistas do Distrito Federal, a Brazilian press freedom group, posted on Facebook a video collection of Bolsonaro\u2019s verbal attacks.\n\nAccording to the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, this past March the Inter-American Human Rights Commission said Brazil was creating a threatening environment for journalists.\n\nVideos are circulating on the internet showing people on the streets of Brazilian cities harassing journalists, attacking them verbally and physically, and preventing them from doing their job.\n\nThe Rede Globo network and O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper have published reports and investigations critical of Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency. Lately, they have scrutinized his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
