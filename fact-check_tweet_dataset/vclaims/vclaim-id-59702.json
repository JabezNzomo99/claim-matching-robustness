No, that's not true: This is a fabricated agenda and the president, Nana Akufo-Addo, is not the voice in the video, as an actual recording of the president makes clear. The Rockefeller Foundation did in fact release a May 2010 document, Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development, that has very slight similarities to what is read in the audio recording, but the audio recording mostly features fake excerpts that can not be found anywhere in the document.\n\nThe claims appeared in a video published by a UGETube user on July 1, 2020, titled \"President of Ghana Reads Rockefeller Agenda For Covid, Chilling\" (archived here) with the caption:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nTransport the research strain to a different class four lab, National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, Canada, and have it stolen and smuggled out by China, wow, on purpose and take to China's only class four laboratory, Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, for added plausible deniability and to help cement the wanted public back-up script as something to fall back on if needed. Primary script being it's natural, back up script being China created it and released it by accident.\n\nNone of these excerpts exist in the Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.\n\nThe purpose of Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development was to consider how different technologies will affect the world over the next decade. To do this, the document used four scenarios, one of which was a pandemic. The fabricated audio recording alleges that in the pandemic section, the document predicted the coronavirus pandemic and had a malicious plan to spread it.\n\nThe pandemic scenario actually featured in the document did not predict the current pandemic nor does it include an agenda to spread the coronavirus. In fact, the scenario is quite different from the current pandemic. The only similarity between the pandemic in the real Rockefeller document and the current pandemic is that many governments issued lockdowns. Almost all of what is said in the audio recording cannot be found in the document the speaker claims he is reading from.\n\nWhat's more, the voice in the video of the audio recording is clearly distinct from this video of President Akufo-Addo giving a speech about a month ago, as \"Fact Check Ghana\" points out.", "lang": "en"}
