My life has the tendency to fall apart when I\u2019m awake, you know?\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Hemingway wrote this quote. Two Hemingway biographers also doubt its authenticity.\n\nThroughout his writing career, Hemingway penned numerous short stories and novels, including classics like \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d and \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d\n\nHemingway does talk about sleep several times in his personal letters, usually in the context of having trouble sleeping. In one letter, for example, he tells fellow author F. Scott Fitzgerald about his insomnia; in another he talks about taking sleeping pills.\n\n\u201cLike many \u2018sensitive\u2019 types he had trouble with insomnia (when he wasn\u2019t dead drunk),\u201d Mary V. Dearborn, author of \u201cErnest Hemingway: A Biography,\u201d said in an email to TheDCNF.\n\nHowever, TheDCNF could not find any evidence that Hemingway said or wrote this quote. Searching collections of his novels, poems and short stories failed to return any matching or similar phrases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not Hemingway. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard the quote,\u201d Dearborn said. \u201cThe syntax or diction is wrong. Hemingway would never make an observation and then end it with \u2018you know?\u2019 He wasn\u2019t that friendly, and he wasn\u2019t all that interested in whether someone got what he was saying or not. So just no on all counts.\u201d\n\nAnother biographer, James Hutchisson, shared a similar sentiment in an email to TheDCNF: \u201cMost likely not by Hemingway.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
