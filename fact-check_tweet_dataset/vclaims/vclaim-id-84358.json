The video, a series of clips, shows two toddlers being repeatedly hit on the face and on the head by the woman, who is not seen in the video. The clip also shows one of the babies deliberately dropped from a height causing the child to bleed. BOOM found that the video is from Saudi Arabia and was recorded by the woman torturing the babies who incidentally is also their mother. A story by Gulf news Somalian reported that the woman and her husband, a Yemeni, had separated and she recorded the video to send to her father-in-law demanding money. The same video was viral in 2018 with claims that it is recent. News reports stated that the Saudi Arabian government had rescued the children.", "lang": "en"}
