But the long trail of evidence and links resulting in Butina\u2019s U.S. guilty plea shows otherwise.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "January 31, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12208", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/butina-state-ties-denial-fact-check/29727114.html", "vclaim": "The Voice of America (VOA) Reporter Pete Cobus recently traveled to Maria Butina\u2019s hometown of Barnaul, Russia, to speak with friends, family, teachers and other associates in the wake of the 30-year-old\u2019s high-profile conviction in the United States.\n\nThe VOA News story traces Butina\u2019s path as a University student in Barnaul toward the halls of power in the Kremlin. Her mentor at Altai State University\u2019s School of Real Politics, Konstantin Emeshin, described a ambitious, outgoing woman.\n\nHe nominated Butina for the Seliger educational forum, a prestigious lakeside summer camp designed for political \u201ctraining,\u201d and labeled by the New Yorker magazine as \u201cRussia\u2019s Nationalist Summer Camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knew everybody,\u201d Emeril said referring to three men who were close allies to President Putin, two who were former ministers.\n\nYet, among those Cobus interviewed was Alexander Ionov, vice chairman of the State Duma\u2019s Security committee, who\u2019s narrative tracks government claims about the young woman.\n\n\u201cMaria Butina is, first and foremost, a citizen of the Russian Federation and she is a person to whom the regulations of the international law should be applied,\u201d Ionov told the VOA reporter.\n\nIonov insisted that from the \u201cvery moment\u201d Butina was \u201cinterrogated\u201d in the U.S. senate, she had divulged everything regarding her contacts and activities in the United States.\n\n\u201cThat is why for me Maria Butina is a Human Rights activist, for me Maria Butina is a public figure, a student of the American University, and the most relevant is that she is a person who did not work (collaborate) with the Russian state bodies,\u201d Ionov said in the interview.\n\nAfter coming to the attention of U.S. lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Butina was asked to testify before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee in April 2018. During that eight-hour session, Butina reportedly told the committee that Russian billionaire Konstantin Nikolaev financed her Russian gun rights group \u2013 Right to Bear Arms, the Washington Post reported.\n\nLater that month, FBI agents raided her home.\n\nAfter receiving a post-graduate degree in international relations from American University last May, Butina was arrested in July and charged with conspiracy and illegally acting as an agent of the Russian Federation.\n\nProsecutors allege that for years Butina, at the behest of high-level Russian government officials, attempted to make inroads into the Republican Party and conservative circles in the U.S., including the National Rifle Association and the National Prayer Breakfast forum, in order to advance the interests of the Kremlin.\n\nIonov\u2019s characterization of Butina, a gun rights advocate, as a \u201chuman rights activist,\u201d is similar to the narrative of the National Rifle Association, which characterizes itself as the \u201clongest standing\u201d civil rights organization in the U.S.\n\nEvidence produced by prosecutors of Butina\u2019s conduct as a public figure and student at American University in Washington D.C., belies Ionov\u2019s claim she did not work or collaborate with Russian state bodies.\n\nOn December 13, 2018, Butina pleaded guilty before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to conspiring \u201cto act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government, specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General.\u201d\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Butina, who now faces a maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation, waived her right of appeal.\n\nButina further agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities in an ongoing investigation.\n\nAs previously reported by Polygraph.info, the U.S. indictment of Butina described her relationship with Alexandr Torshin. The outgoing deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia and former deputy chairman of the Federation Council (upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament), was labeled a \u201cRussian official and Butina\u2019s handler.\u201d\n\nSince Putin came to power in 2000, Torshin, a highly decorated government official, appeared at public events standing next to the Russian president \u2013 an honor reserved for those in the Kremlin inner circle who are closest to Putin.\n\nTorshin was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April 2018 along with other Russian businessmen and politicians for \u201cadvancing Russia\u2019s malign activities.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s criminal complaint against Butina, which she described in court when she plead guilty as a \u201ctrue and accurate\u201d account of her actions, direct message exchanges with Torshin and emails to her American associate \u2013 identified by prosecutors as \u201cU.S. Person 1.\u201d In her words, she refers to Putin\u2019s direct approval of her \u201cmission\u201d on at least seven occasions.\n\nIn a letter dated March 30, 2016, Butina referred to a conversation between Torshin and Putin, writing that Torshin \u201csuggested to President Putin that he consider coming to the National Prayer Breakfast forum next year, Feb. 2017, and Pres. Putin did not say \u2018no\u2019!\u201d She also suggests that for Putin to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, he must receive a personal invitation from the U.S. president.\n\nIn her letters, Butina repeatedly cited the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s approval for her own actions and Torshin\u2019s visits to the U.S. and meetings with influential American politicians. In two instances, she wrote to Torshin telling him she had his diplomatic passport and that she could purchase plane tickets for him.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore find that Ionov\u2019s claim that Butina had not worked with Russian state bodies, mirroring similar claims in the past, is likewise false.", "lang": "en"}
