But, in doing so, Trump got the facts wrong:\n\u2022 Trump misquoted Obama when he claimed that the former president said, \u201cPresident Trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% GDP.\u201d In a June 2016 town hall, Obama said Trump would need a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to bring back \u201csome of those jobs of the past,\u201d such as manufacturing jobs.\n\u2022 Trump wrongly tweeted that the \u201cGDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\u201d It has actually happened dozens of times.\n\nThe president and former president have exchanged some words lately about who is responsible for the post-recession economic recovery. It started when Obama, in remarks on Sept. 7 in Illinois, said, \u201clet\u2019s just remember when this recovery started.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I\u2019m glad it\u2019s continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that\u2019s been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, and suddenly Republicans are saying it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Trump tweeted a quote that he claimed a skeptical Obama made about the growth in the gross domestic product.\n\nWe could not find that quote or any quote of Obama using the term \u201cmagic wand\u201d to describe Trump\u2019s ability to grow the economy by 4 percent.\n\nWe did find that Obama used the term \u201cmagic wand\u201d at a June 1, 2016, \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d town hall meeting in Indiana. But Obama was referring to Trump\u2019s promise to bring back \u201csome of those jobs of the past.\u201d Instead, Obama said, the next president needed to focus on job training for \u201cjobs that are coming in now.\u201d\n\nObama, June 1, 2016: Now, the good news is that there are entire new industries that are starting to pop up and you\u2019re actually seeing some manufacturers coming back to the United States because they\u2019re starting to realize, \u201cYou know what? Energy prices are lower here, workers are better here, this is our biggest market. And so even though we off-shored and went someplace else before, now it turns out we\u2019re better off going ahead and manufacturing here.\u201d But for those folks who have lost their job right now because a plant went down the Mexico, that isn\u2019t going to make you feel better. And so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back, and when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned who I\u2019m not going to advertise for, that he\u2019s going to bring all these jobs back, well how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do? There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no answer to it. He just says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to negotiate a better deal.\u201d Well, how \u2014 what \u2014 how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually, the answer is he doesn\u2019t have an answer.\n\nDuring the previous administration, Obama, in 2013, and his vice president, Joe Biden, in 2012, touted a rise in manufacturing jobs during the post-recession period.\n\nIn his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said that U.S. \u201cmanufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three\u201d years since bottoming out in 2010. That was true, but as we pointed out at the time, there was still a net loss in manufacturing jobs under Obama.\n\nSince Trump took office, the economy has continued to add manufacturing jobs. The U.S. has added 348,000 manufacturing jobs from January 2017 to August 2018.\n\nBut the U.S. still has a little more than 1 million fewer manufacturing jobs now than it did when the Great Recession took hold in December 2007.\n\nAs for the GDP, Trump\u2019s tweet was referring to the recent Bureau of Economic Analysis estimate that the real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018. That was the largest increase since the third quarter of 2014, when it grew at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent.\n\nIn a press briefing later in the day, Kevin Hassett, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he did not know if Obama ever said the quote that Trump attributed to the former president on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m not the chairman of the Council of Twitter Advisers,\u201d Hassett said.\n\nIn a separate tweet the same day, Trump also wrongly claimed, \u201cThe GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\u201d The White House later acknowledged the error, and said the president should have said it hasn\u2019t happened in 10 years. (Actually, it last happened 12 years ago.)\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet caught the attention of Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, who did an analysis and found that while the president\u2019s figures for the GDP and unemployment rate were accurate, the president was way off in claiming that it was the first time in a century that the quarterly GDP rate was higher than the unemployment rate.\n\nIn two tweets, Wolfers listed the 62 times that has happened going back to 1948, most recently in the first quarter of 2006. For good measure, Wolfers included a graph superimposing the unemployment rate on the quarterly GDP.\n\nHassett, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged the error and said that \u201cwhat is true is that it\u2019s the highest in 10 years, and at some point somebody probably conveyed it to [Trump] adding a zero to that, and they shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe history of thought of how errors happen is not something that I can engage in, because, like, from the initial fact to what the president said, I don\u2019t know the whole chain of command,\u201d Hassett said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to talk to the president about where the number came from,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cBut the correct number is 10 years.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the number, Wolfers tweeted, the whole exercise of comparing levels of unemployment with growth rates of GDP is inane.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that he\u2019s comparing two things that are different,\u201d Wolfers told us via email. \u201cThe temperature in Fahrenheit is larger today than my shoe size, but that doesn\u2019t make it warm.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
