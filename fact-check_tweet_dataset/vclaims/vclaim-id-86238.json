It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s simply confused about how many people pay what are known as \u201cShared Responsibility Payments.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d he said, \u201cThere were tens of millions of people who were paying a fine, paying a fee, rather than take Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s wrong. According to most recent Internal Revenue Service data (Statistics of Income), for 2016, 4.95 million taxpayers made the payment, at an average cost of $732. That\u2019s a decline from the year before, when nearly 6.67 million taxpayers made payments at an average cost of $462. The penalty had been increasing, but effective Jan. 1, 2019, the tax bill signed by President Trump set the penalty at zero. (The mandate has not been eliminated.)\n\nA letter to Congress in 2017 by the then-IRS commissioner gave a little more detail about the 2015 payments: the median payment was about $330, and 7 percent were $100 or less. \u201cThe vast majority \u2014 77 percent \u2014 of taxpayers reporting a shared responsibility payment still reported a refund,\u201d the letter said. About 8 million taxpayers reported a payment in 2014. So the trend line had been going down.\n\nWhy so few people? That\u2019s because many more people qualified for exemptions from paying the fee. In 2015, 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. Exemptions are granted for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that an individual has income below a certain threshold and lives in a state that did not expand the eligibility for Medicaid. The second-most common exemption is if a citizen lives outside of the United States. People also did not need to pay a penalty if they would have had to pay more than 8.05 percent of their income (in 2015) to obtain health insurance.\n\nThe 10 million on Obamacare and 2.3 million young adults add up to 3.8 percent of the U.S. population in 2016, or more than the 3.3 percent represented in the tax returns that made payments. (We will ignore the fact that the 15 percent of the population is over 65 and in theory would be on Medicare, and thus don\u2019t need health insurance.)\n\n\u201cNot all people file tax returns, so the denominator for the 3.3 percent is too small,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every person on a tax return on which somebody paid the mandate penalty paid the penalty themselves.\u201d He added that he suspected \u201cthe typical tax unit in which somebody paid a mandate penalty is smaller than average, in which case the 3.3 percent of tax returns would correspond to a smaller fraction of the total population.\u201d\n\nBut Mulvaney\u2019s assertion really goes off the rails when you consider the impact of the expansion of Medicaid, the health program for the poor. He did not mention it, but that was also a key part of the Affordable Care Act. The law offered Medicaid to nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of the poverty level, or $27,821 for a family of three in 2016. In Kentucky, far more people qualified for health care under Medicaid than signed up for Obamacare insurance.\n\nThe number of people who gained because of the Medicaid expansion is a bit fuzzier and open to interpretation. \u201cThere are 17.1 million in the expansion group for whom states are getting enhanced federal matching payments,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere are 12.7 million who were made newly eligible. The reason the numbers are different is because some states had waivers pre-ACA that included some of these enrollees.\u201d\n\nAs a matter of simple math, Mulvaney is wrong. Far more people \u2014 twice as many \u2014 gained under the Affordable Care Act than paid a penalty. We\u2019re not sure why Mulvaney would have such a limited understanding of the impact of the law, but it may have started with his misimpression that \u201ctens of millions of people\u201d were paying a fine. That\u2019s totally off base, too.", "lang": "en"}
