A reverse image search found that the photo was created by a Russian 3D graphic artist. National Geographic told AFP that the purported award did not exist and the image had not appeared in the magazine.\n\nThis Facebook post shows a photo of a shark jumping out of the ocean.\n\nThe caption claims the image was \u201cNational Geographic Photo of the Year\u201d but does not provide the name of the photographer or any details of when and where the image was shot.\n\nThe post has been shared hundreds of times.\n\nNational Geographic said the shark photo had not won any prizes from the magazine.\n\n\u201cThis image is not a National Geographic image,\u201d Chandler Hueth from National Geographic\u2019s Global Communications department told AFP.\n\nA reverse image search found the picture came from the ShutterStock page of Alexyz3d who is described as a photographer, illustrator, vector artist, videographer, and a 3D artist.\n\nThe original caption on the image, which is described as a stock illustration, says: \u201cShark jumps out of the water\u201d. The picture is tagged with terms including CG (computer graphics) FX (effects) and 3D.\n\nEarlier versions of the image circulated online had falsely claimed it was taken by a National Geographic photographer named Bob Burton.\n\nNational Geographic said in 2016 that Bob Burton did not work for the magazine, had not won a prize, and that the shark photo was \"clearly fake\".\n\n\u201cWhen a man on Twitter claimed to be National Geographic's chief photographer, several photo editors at the magazine assembled to discuss. \u2018Have you ever heard of this guy?\u2019 None had,\u201d Daniel Stone, an editor at National Geographic magazine, wrote in the magazine's rebuttal of the original viral claims.\n\n\u201cThe man, who goes by the alias Bob Burton, claimed (falsely) to have taken National Geographic's photo of the year (an award we don't have) of a shark leaping out of the water (which is clearly fake). But none of those erroneous details seemed to matter as the image made the rounds of social media to enthusiastic reviews,\u201d Stone wrote.", "lang": "en"}
