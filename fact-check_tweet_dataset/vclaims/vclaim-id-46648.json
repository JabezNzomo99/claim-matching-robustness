The claim is misleading; the photo has previously circulated in media reports about Muslims participating in a Hindu festival to promote religious harmony in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; the man in the photo told AFP by phone in July 2019 that he remained a Muslim.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on June 21, 2019, where it has been shared more than 8,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201cBrothers, I have quit Islam and embraced Hindu religion. There cannot be useless religion like Islam which take people's life in the name of jihad and play with prestige of our mothers and sisters in the name of Halala. I take refuge in feet of Shri Ram hereafter. Victory to Shri Rama.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalala\u201d refers to the process which a Muslim couple can choose to undergo if they want to reunite after getting divorced.\n\nA Hindi language caption alongside the photo and text translates to English as: \u201cVictory to Shri Rama. Zakir has understood that Islam is not a religion. When will others understand? Wake up.\u201d\n\nThe photo has also been shared on Facebook here, here and here, with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the man in the photo told AFP he remained a Muslim, saying he attended the event to promote religious harmony.\n\nWith the support of a local journalist from Gorakhpur, AFP identified the man in the misleading posts, who gave his name as Imran Khan.\n\nKhan denied the claim while talking to a journalist form AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau by phone on July 8, 2019.\n\n\u201cI participated in the event to promote communal harmony among Muslims and Hindus, but I am firm on my religion of Islam and will remain firm in future as well,\u201d he said.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo of Khan that was used in the misleading posts published here on Indian news site Nyoooz Hindi on August, 2017.\n\nThe Hindi language headline of the report translates to English as: \u201cGorakhpur: Hindu sisters set precedent of unity by tying Rakhi to Muslim brothers.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo of Khan in the report:\n\nThe first paragraph of the report translates from Hindi to English as: \u201cPresenting a precedence of secular culture, Muslim brothers and Hindu sisters set an example of Hindu-Muslim unity by tying Rakhi to the formers\u2019 wrist. They (Muslim brothers) pleadged to protect honour and presitige of Hindu sisters as well. The sisters also prayed for their longevity by putting Tilak -- sacred colour -- to their forehead.\u201d\n\nThe Nyoooz Hindi report published additional photos of the event.\n\nWith the help of a local journalist from Gorakhpur, AFP managed to identify another person, circled below in green, as Anwar Hussain, who describes himself on Facebook as the general secretary of the Gorakhpur unit of India's opposition Indian National Congress party.\n\nSpeaking to a journalist from AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau by phone on July 8, 2019, he said: \u201cI have been organising this interfaith event to promote religious harmony and brotherhood for the last ten years. I just want to convey the message that no one can divide us in the name of religion.\u201d\n\nHussain also identified two other people -- marked in green in the same image published by Nyoooz Hindi -- as Imran Khan (L) and Annu Prasad (R).\n\nA journalist in AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau contacted Annu Prasad by phone on July 8, 2019. She said she was a researcher at the University of Gorakhpur and a student leader.\n\n\u201cThe event was organised in the Pant Park near the Gorakhpur University on the occasion of Rakshabandhan in 2017,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
