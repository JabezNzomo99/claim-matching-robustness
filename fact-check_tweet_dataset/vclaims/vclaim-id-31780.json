The YSRCP chief is a Christian by faith.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the video to be completely false.\n\nOn May 25, Facebook user Manoj Nair posted a video claiming Jagan Reddy has embraced Hinduism. He wrote, \"Jagan Reddy is reconverted to Hinduism by Swarupanamda Saraswati. The Swami fixed the date of his swearing-in ceremony on May 30th.\"\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the post had been shared by more than 400 users.\n\nIn the 10-minute video, Jagan Reddy could be seen in traditional Hindu religious attire along with some priests. He is seen taking instructions from the priests and observing Hindu rituals and offering puja.\n\nThe archive of the video can be seen here.\n\nThe post was widely shared on Facebook. Other social media users such as Arun Dorasamy and Shivatamasubramanians Iyer have also shared the post.\n\nAFWA did a reverse search of the video and found it to be an old one.\n\nIt was a video of Jagan Reddy performing Homam, a special puja, in Rishikesh on August 10, 2016. He prayed for the welfare of people and sought Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh. He prayed to Goddess Ganga and performed Hindu rituals with Swaroopananda Swamy.\n\nLater, he donated food to saints and pandits at the site. The event was widely covered by media organisations and also found mention in the YSRCP website.\n\nOn Saturday, in an interview with India Today TV, when asked about his past relationship with the Congress, Jagan Reddy said, I pray and read my Bible. It\u2019s for God to decide.", "lang": "en"}
