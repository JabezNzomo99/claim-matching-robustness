But the comments aren\u2019t real; they originally came from a parody article.\n\nThe supposed comments by Maduro began spreading in West Africa in August 2018 and have recently begun doing the rounds again as Venezuela\u2019s political crisis dominates international headlines.\n\nArticles in French cited Maduro as calling on the French government to scrap visas for Africans, saying: \u201cFrance has a moral responsibility to open its borders to Africans because it is responsible for the misery there.\u201d\n\nIt quoted Maduro as saying France was \u201cthe primary beneficiary of African raw materials and most of the time it doesn\u2019t pay a single cent to extract them. It exploits them freely without paying a cent to the governments of these countries. That\u2019s why most of these Africans are coming to Europe, to have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe comments spread widely in francophone Africa, from Mali to DR Congo, Senegal to Benin. They were also translated into English on the news and entertainment website How Africa.\n\nIn both languages the posts generated debate over the extent to which France is responsible for poverty in former African colonies.\n\nBut an advanced search on Facebook using Whopostedwhat shows that the comments first appeared on the site 24jours, which says in its \u201cconditions of use\u201d section that it publishes fictional content.\n\n\u201cIf you want verified information, please see France 24, CNN, the BBC, RT, Euronews etc,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe suggestion that France is the biggest beneficiary of African raw materials is also false.\n\nAccording to figures from the World Bank's WITS database, China is the biggest single-country importer of sub-Saharan African raw materials, not France.\n\nIn 2017, sub-Saharan countries exported raw materials worth around $14.2 billion to China, and $4.0 billion to France.\n\nWhile these comments were made up, Maduro has in fact waded into the debate over France\u2019s colonial past before.\n\nAfter France won the football World Cup last summer, Maduro commented that Africa was the true winner owing to the African heritage of some of its team members.\n\n\u201cHow much have they despised Africa, and in the football World Cup France won the trophy thanks to African players or the sons of Africans,\u201d Maduro said, as reported by AFP in July 2018.", "lang": "en"}
