The text on the bus has been edited and replaced with the text:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send Trump \u00a3500 million a week. Let\u2019s fund US drug firms, not our NHS\u201d.\n\nJeremy Corbyn expanded on this at an election campaign event in Harlow when he said:\n\n\u201c[Boris Johnson] stood in front of a bus in 2016 and promised \u00a3350 million a week for the NHS.\n\n\u201cNow we find out that \u00a3500 million a week could be taken out of the NHS and handed to big drugs companies under his plans for a sell-out trade deal with Donald Trump and the USA.\u201d\n\nIt's a line that other Labour MPs have also used. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted last week that \u201cUnder Johnson\u2019s plans our NHS will be forced to pay \u00a3500 million a week to US corporates for drugs.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that drug prices for the NHS might increase following a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the USA, as this fits with US priorities from past negotiations. But it\u2019s not possible to say what this will look like with any certainty. The \u00a3500 million figure quoted by Labour is a rough calculation based on a scenario that expert body the Nuffield Trust has said is fairly extreme.\n\nPresenting this figure as if it\u2019s certain, as some versions of this claim have done, is misleading and unjustified.\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely that, even if drug prices did increase by that amount, that the money would all go to US firms, as has been suggested.\n\nIncreased drug prices are a possible outcome of a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal\n\nThere has been much debate over whether or not the NHS will be \u2018on the table\u2019 during any future trade negotiations with the USA post-Brexit.\n\nBack in June when this suggestion was first put forward the Nuffield Trust health think tank said: \u201cA trade deal would not have the power to stop the NHS being a free, universal service.\u201d\n\nIt points out that trade deals don\u2019t aim to \u201credesign the funding of public services\u201d and that previous trade deals between the USA and countries with publicly-funded healthcare haven\u2019t done this.\n\nIt also points out that US companies already have the right to bid for private contracts in the NHS in England. The rules that allow this don\u2019t apply in Scotland and Wales in the same way because they don\u2019t run their health services on the basis of contracts.\n\nWhat may be more likely to happen, and what Jeremy Corbyn seems to have been referring to in his speech, is that a trade deal could affect the prices the NHS pays for drugs.\n\nAt the moment, there are initiatives in the UK which allow medicine prices to be bargained down or for costs to be recovered, so drugs can be purchased here more cheaply than in the USA. Another reason for this is that national bargaining like this is banned there.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust says that\u201cPushes for countries to go easier on medicine prices have been a significant feature of recent US trade negotiations.\u201d\n\nIn February, the USA published its negotiating objectives for any future trade deal. This included a desire for \u201cprocedural fairness for pharmaceuticals and medical devices\u201d.\n\nDepending on the type of deal, the NHS could change the types of drugs it uses or there could be changes to the way the NHS and Department of Health and Social Care can bargain on prices. The Nuffield Trust told us that drug-pricing works across all four nations, so any changes to this would apply throughout the UK.\n\nThe \u00a3500 million figure is not an accurate calculation\n\nThis figure of \u00a3500 million a week is one that Labour has used a lot recently, and originated in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme aired in October.\n\nThe figure, calculated by academics from Harvard, the World Health Organisation and Liverpool University, is based on how much more is paid for drugs per person in the USA than in the UK.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Organisation for Economic \u00ad\u00adCooperation and Development, in 2017 the UK paid roughly $470 per person while the USA paid $1,220. That\u2019s around two and a half times as much.\n\nThe NHS in England spent around \u00a318 billion in total on drugs in 2018/19. If per person spending increased by around two and a half times following a US trade deal then that number would be \u00a345 billion. That\u2019s an increase of \u00a327 billion or about \u00a3519 million per week.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said already it\u2019s certainly possible that drug prices could increase. But the Nuffield Trust told us:\n\n\u201c[The \u00a3500 million more a week figure] represents a fairly extreme scenario, although it illustrates a genuine concern.\n\n\u201cIf you look at other countries that have concluded a trade deal with the USA containing provisions on medicines, they have not experienced increases in pharmaceutical spending to the same level per person. In fact the gap with Australia has not closed at all.\u201d\n\nDr Andrew Hill, who was involved in developing the calculation for Dispatches, told the programme:\n\n\u201cI think there is very little understanding about just how high US drugs prices are and how these trade negotiations could lead to these high drug prices. Donald Trump has said he wants to see higher drug prices for foreign governments. I don\u2019t think people have any idea how much money is involved here.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Dispatches the Department for International Trade said:\n\n\u201cThe NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic\u200e\u2026The sustainability of the NHS is an absolute priority for the government. We could not agree to any proposals on medicines pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to say exactly how much UK drug prices could change post-Brexit without seeing the draft text of an agreement between the US and UK. Even so, presenting as certain what is in reality a rough estimate based on an extreme scenario is misleading and unjustified.\n\nEven if UK drug prices did increase by the amount suggested by Labour and the Dispatches programme, this doesn\u2019t mean all this money would suddenly be paid to US drug companies. There are a number of UK-based pharmaceutical companies such as GSK and AstraZeneca which already work with the NHS who would presumably still compete on the market.", "lang": "en"}
