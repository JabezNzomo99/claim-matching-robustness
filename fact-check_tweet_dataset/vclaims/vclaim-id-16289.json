The analysis behind it hasn\u2019t been published, so neither we nor anyone else can check how accurate it is yet.\n\nAge UK claims 1.2m people aged 65 or over in England don\u2019t get the support they need with at least one everyday task at least some of the time. Its report from last year estimated that just over a million people, or around 10% of older people, had at least one unmet need. So this year\u2019s estimate is an increase on previous ones.\n\nThe findings are based on comparing the results of a large research survey on aging in England with official population statistics.\n\nThe survey asks people whether they need help with tasks like getting dressed, washing or eating, and then how often they get enough help. Those findings are compared to the total population of 65-90 year olds in England in 2014.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund published a report on social care for older people this year. It said the effects reduced funding for social care may be having on the NHS should be considered alongside other pressures, such as those on GPs and community nurses.\n\nAge UK told us that more information will be provided in a report to be published in a few weeks time.", "lang": "en"}
