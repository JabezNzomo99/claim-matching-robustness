The slums should not be demolished. I am fasting for them today. I want to work for a social cause,\" as reported by Deccan Chronicle. \n\n\n\nWe also found a report by The Hindu which carried another image from the same event taken from a different angle.\n\nAlso Read: Anti-CAA Protest Poster Calling For Hijab Or Burqa Dress Code Is Photoshopped", "lang": "en"}
