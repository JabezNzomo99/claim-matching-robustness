In the video, a woman can be seen walking on a street while talking on the phone, followed by a gentleman who yells, \u201c\u0905\u0930\u0947 \u092e\u0948\u0921\u092e, \u0913 \u0930\u0941\u0915\u094b \u0905\u0930\u0947 \u092c\u0941\u0932\u093e\u0913 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u094b\u201d (Arre Madam, please stop, someone call her), and asks her to take her baby whom she left behind. Following this, the woman comes back and takes the baby with her.\n\nThe video was also broadcast by ABP News in its programme Viral Khabar. All the media organisations, in their reports, have referred to this video having been posted by a social media user named Amit.\n\nThe video is viral on social media with the message, \u201c\u092e\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0907\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0930 \u092e\u0947 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0947 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u092d\u0942\u0932 \u0917\u092f\u0940\u201d (Distracted by mobile, woman forgets her child- translated). This video has also been posted on Facebook by a page Sonepat Breaking News. The video has been viewed over 41,000 times from this link alone and shared over a thousand times.\n\nThe video has been circulated on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nA close look at the video reveals that the accompanying claim is false. At 0:07 minutes in the video, behind the person carrying the child, a crowd can be seen gathered at the spot. The people stand still and watch what\u2019s happening in front of them This suggests that the video is perhaps a scene from a shoot.\n\nApart from this, a twitter user Aasif Todia commented that this is a video from a shoot, and posted another video of the same incident wherein the person seen in the viral video can be viewed clearly.\n\nWe found that a user Hetal Oza, commenting on another user @Amit_smiling\u2018s post, said that this video is of a film shoot, adding that the person seen in the video is a Gujarati actor and has often been seen in the serial \u2018Tarak Mehta Ka Oolta Chashma\u2019.\n\nOn the basis of this claim, Alt News conducted a basic search and found that the person in the video is Sharad Sharma, who is an actor in Gujarati movies and shows. Alt News then contacted Sharma for clarification, who told us, \u201cThis is a video from a shoot. Last Monday, I shot at Nasik where I donned the role of a rickshaw walla. During the shoot, one of the bystanders recorded it and shared it on social media. When this video releases then you will be able to see these visuals.\u201d (translated).\n\nA video shot by a bystander during a shoot was shared on social media with the false claim that a woman forgot her child behind in an auto as she was occupied with talking on a mobile phone.", "lang": "en"}
