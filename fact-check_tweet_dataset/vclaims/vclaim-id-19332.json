It's important that they be dealt with iron hands. Noida/Bulandshahar - Videos of crime viral on social media has created a stir in the society. We too have found similar videos whose time and place are yet to be verified, but parents are worried about the safety of their kids.'\n\nThe message then goes on talking about the faulty and defunct CCTV cameras dotting the streets and lanes of Noida and Bulandshahar. \n\n\n\nYou can watch the viral video here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe video, nearly 3 minutes long, shows a group of men questioning a visibly injured person sitting bare-chested. They ask him about his whereabouts, and later in the video the injured man can be heard admitting that he had come to Kanpur to abduct children.\n\nBOOM watched the video closely and found the name of Kanpur mentioned more than once in the course of questioning. We then searched with keywords 'child kidnapper caught in Kanpur' in Hindi. We found the same video uploaded on YouTube claiming that the incident was from Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. BOOM also found a news report published in Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar which reported that the incident was from Etawah in UP.\n\nSome readers can find the video disturbing hence viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThe news article reports that an unidentified man had tried to abduct a 14-year-old boy from a farmland on August 11. However, the victim's brother called for help and the villagers managed to catch the alleged kidnapper and thrashed him brutally.\n\nBOOM then called the office of superintendent of police, Etawah. The PR at the SP office told BOOM that the incident had nothing to do with child kidnapping.\n\nBOOM also called the additional SP (City), Etawah, who reiterated the PRO's claim of the accused being mentally unstable.\n\nThe Additional SP also told BOOM that as a precautionary measure, the man has been jailed for now.", "lang": "en"}
