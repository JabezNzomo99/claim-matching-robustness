This document, however, does not provide any sort of \u201coperation manual\u201d for how to manufacture a global pandemic. Rather, it envisions how the world would be impacted in four different scenarios (including a global pandemic).\n\nWhen we look at this rumor a little closer, it becomes clear that what is being called \u201cOperation Lockstep\u201d has very few similarities to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that much of the fear about this document was manufactured by purveyors of misinformation.\n\nWhat Is \u201cOperation Lockstep: From the Rockefeller Playbook\u201d? It Doesn\u2019t Exist.\n\nFor starters, the above-displayed image entitled \u201cOperation Lockstep: From the Rockefeller Playbook\u201d is presented as if it shows a screenshot from a document published by The Rockefeller Foundation. However, there is no document called \u201cOperation Lockstep,\u201d and this image did not come from a \u201cRockefeller Playbook.\u201d Those spreading this rumor have linked \u201cOperation Lockstep\u201d to a report entitled \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development\u201d that was published by The Rockefeller Foundation in 2010.\n\nThe \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology\u201d document envisions four scenario narratives, only one of which, dubbed \u201cLock Step,\u201d deals with a global pandemic. The text in the above-displayed image, \u201c1st Phase: Common cold/flu. Mild symptoms at most. Media endorsement of mass paranoia and fear. Flawed testing system utilized, which picks up any genetic material in the body and triggers a positive result. Inflation of Covid case numbers, through changing of death certificates, double-counting, and classifying all deaths including other disease and natural causes as COVID19. Lockdown will condition us to life under Draconian laws, prevent protests and identify public resistance,\u201d etc., does not appear anywhere in this document. In fact, nowhere in the \u201cLock Step\u201d section of \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology\u201d is the word \u201cCOVID\u201d even mentioned.\n\nDoes the Quote \u201cUnder the Guise of a Pandemic, We Will Create a Prison State\u201d Come from the Rockefeller Foundation? No.\n\nRumors about \u201cOperation Lockstep\u201d are often shared on social media along with the quote: \u201cUnder the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state.\u201d Again, this quote does not appear anywhere in the actual document from the Rockefeller Foundation. This quote appears to come from the Wordpress blog envirowatchrangitikei\u2019s faulty interpretation of the \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology\u201d document. While the Rockefeller Foundation did envision a world where governments implemented stricter rules to combat the pandemic (including the mandatory requirement to wear face masks), they did not warn about a \u201cprison state.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, however, the genuine report from The Rockefeller Foundation did not envision a future in which world leaders manufactured a pandemic to implement a prison state. A section of this document envisions how global leaders would react to a real pandemic, not how they would create a fake one.\n\nWhat Are the Similarities Between \u201cOperation Lockstep\u201d and COVID-19? Few and Far Between.\n\nWhile the \u201cLock Step\u201d section of the actual document does deal with a global pandemic, the similarities between The Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s envisioned scenario and the current COVID-19 crisis are few and far between. For instance, the hypothetical pandemic envisioned by foundation started in 2012, originated in wild geese, and killed 8 million people in the first 7 months. Comparatively speaking, the COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019, is widely believed to have originated with bats, and, according to John Hopkins University (as of this writing in July 2020) has killed just over 600,000 people within an approximate 7 month time-span.\n\nThe \u201cLock Step\u201d scenario also envisioned that the majority of deaths during this hypothetical global pandemic would take places like Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America. As of this writing, the most deaths from COVID-19 \u2014 about 140,000 \u2014 have taken place in the United States.\n\nA video report from news outlet WUSA9 on the differences and similarities between this rumor and the actual document from The Rockefeller Foundation can be viewed here.\n\nWhy Did the Rockefeller Foundation Produce \u201cThe Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development\u201d Report? To Better Prepare for the Future.\n\nThis rumor is based on a 2010 report published by The Rockefeller Foundation entitled \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.\u201d This document does not detail an \u201coperation\u201d in a \u201cplaybook\u201d detailing how global elites can manufacture a pandemic and implement a prison state. Rather, this document explores the possible outcomes of four different scenarios.\n\nJudith Rodin, the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, explained the purpose of this document in an introductory letter:\n\nOne important \u2013 and novel \u2013 component of our strategy toolkit is scenario planning, a process of creating narratives about the future based on factors likely to affect a particular set of challengers and opportunities. We believe that scenario planning has great potential for use in philanthropy to identify unique interventions, simulate and rehearse important decisions that could have profound implications, and highlight previously undiscovered areas of connection and intersection. Most important, by providing a methodological structure that helps us focus on what we don\u2019t know \u2013 instead of what we already know \u2013 scenario planning allows us to achieve impact more effectively. The result of our first scenario planning exercise demonstrate a provocative and engaging exploration of the role of technology and the future of globalization, as you will see in the following pages. This report is crucial reading for anyone interested in creatively considering the multiple, divergent ways in which our world could evolve.\n\nIn 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation produced a report entitled \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development\u201d that envisioned how the world would be impacted in four different scenario narratives \u2014 one of which dealt with a global pandemic. This document gives a hypothetical look at future events in order to envision possible problems that might arise. While this document does explore how the global population could react during a pandemic, it is in no way an \u201coperation manual\u201d for how to manufacture a virus in order to implement a police state.", "lang": "en"}
