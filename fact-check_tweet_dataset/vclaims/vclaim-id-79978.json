(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe story does not provide any source for its claim. It simply says that Jay-Z \"quietly put together a trust fund for Nipsey\u2019s children and you won\u2019t guess how much it\u2019s worth.\" It then goes on to allege Jay-Z made Hussle\u2019s partner, Lauren London, \"the executor of a trust that is worth $15 million; its beneficiaries are his daughter Emani and son (with London), Kross.\"\n\nWe attempted to contact the author of the article, or anyone who writes for the website, but no contact information exists on the website. Its Facebook page appears to have been taken down.\n\nJay-Z did have a relationship with Hussle. And after Hussle\u2019s death, Jay-Z posted a picture of Hussle on his Instagram account with the caption: \"RIP Nipsey Hussle. Another tragic loss for Hip-Hop. Condolences to his family.\" In fact, according to Los Angeles Police Commissioner Steve Soboroff, Hussle and representatives of Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation had scheduled a meeting with the agency to \"talk about ways (Hussle) could help stop gang violence.\" It was slated to take place the day after Hussle died.\n\nBut there is no evidence to suggest that Jay-Z has arranged a trust fund for Hussle\u2019s kids. And not a single credible media outlet or entertainment news website has reported on the alleged donation.\n\nWe reached out to Jay-Z\u2019s record label, Roc Nation, for comment on the story but did not hear back.\n\nSoon after the trust fund story was discredited, fans quickly took to social media to call it out:\n\nA story posted on an entertainment blog claims that Jay-Z set up a \"$15 million trust fund\" for the late Nipsey Hussle\u2019s children.\n\nThe report was soon discredited as being inauthentic by several hip-hop websites and we could find no evidence or details to suggest that such a donation was made.\n\nThis is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
