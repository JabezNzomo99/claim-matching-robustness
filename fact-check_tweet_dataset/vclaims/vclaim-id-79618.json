And we can\u2019t fight it alone. We need partners.\"\n\n\"We have to work better with all of our allies, all around the world. In Western Europe, we have to strike a balance. Our friends can\u2019t depend on us for all of their defense needs and we can\u2019t dictate to them all of their defense policies. Every member of NATO has pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us.\"\n\nWith tensions rising in Iraq, the Ukraine and elsewhere, is it true that only three NATO countries spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense?\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was in 1949, largely to provide against the Soviet Union. There were 12 , including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\n\nThe new allies that \"an armed attack against one or more of them \u2026 shall be considered an attack against them all\" and that following such an attack, each would take \"such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.\"\n\nFrom 2004 through 2011, NATO in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO's top official the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine's armed forces following Russia's annexation of the ex-Soviet republic's Crimea territory.\n\nThe alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO\u2019s , for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures:\n\nSince 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased.\n\nTo back Ryan\u2019s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members \"have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities.\"\n\nOne of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members \"should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense.\"\n\nOnly the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says.\n\nBut , released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark:\n\nThe day before Ryan gave his speech, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called for European allies to increase their defense spending, that since Estonia had met the 2 percent goal, he expected other nations could also do so. The fact that only four NATO members had met that mark had also been noted previously by news media including the and .\n\nRyan said all 28 members of NATO have \"pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us.\"\n\nRyan neglected to count a fourth member, Estonia. But that oversight doesn\u2019t negate his larger point, which is that few NATO countries meet the 2 percent benchmark.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.", "lang": "en"}
