The posts hinting at communal bias also say that under Article 30(A), Bhagavad Gita cannot be taught in schools.\n\nThe claim has been shared several times on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nArticle 30(A) in the Indian Constitution does not allow schools to teach the Gita. Section 30(A) that apparently prevents the reading of Gita in schools, does not exist. Article 28 deals with 'Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions'. The entire content of the article can be read below:\n\nTherefore, the three articles of the Indian Constitution that are cited in the viral claims do not mention anything about the Gita not being permitted in schools while other religious texts are exempted from this restriction.\n\n\n\nSupreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde rubbished the claim while speaking to BOOMLive. He said that these provisions had elements of exclusivity towards a religious or linguistic group in them.
