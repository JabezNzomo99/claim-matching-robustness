{"title": "HOAX: CHR chair says 'rights of NPA rebels should not be violated'", "subtitle": "'The quote is a work of fiction,' says Commission on Human Rights Chairperson Chito Gascon", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Dec 10, 2018 2:23 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18296", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/hoax-chito-gascon-says-npa-rebels-rights-should-not-be-violated", "vclaim": "The facts: There is no such quote from Gascon. Lee, the user who posted the claim, also did not provide proof or a source. He also did not respond to Rappler's Facebook message asking for proof supporting his claim.\n\nNegative comments against Gascon in reaction to the claim indicate that other Facebook users may have been misled into believing that the CHR chair really made the statement.\n\n\n\n\"They are peddling a line that because I questioned that action by state authorities who they claim to be members of the NPA that therefore I am coddling [the] communists,\" Gascon said.\n\nThe \"Talaingod 18\" are former Bayan Muna representative Satur Ocampo, ACT Teachers Representative France Castro, and 16 others. They were arrested on November 28 for alleged kidnapping and trafficking of minors in Talaingod, Davao del Norte, charges that Ocampo and Castro both denied.\n\nThis is not the first time Rappler has checked a false claim involving the CHR and Gascon. A claim surfaced in August alleging that the Commission on Audit \"flagged\" Gascon's 3 China trips worth P6.7 million in July. \u2013 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
