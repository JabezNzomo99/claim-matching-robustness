His remarks also highlighted this community\u2019s \u201cachievements\u201d and \u201ccontributions,\u201d not necessarily a foundational role, as the phrasing of the quote on social media implies.\n\nThis claim was previously debunked by Snopes in 2015 here .\n\nReuters previously addressed other claims misquoting the Obamas ( here and here ).\n\nPartly false. \u201cMuslims built the very fabric of our nation\u201d is not a direct quote from President Obama.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
