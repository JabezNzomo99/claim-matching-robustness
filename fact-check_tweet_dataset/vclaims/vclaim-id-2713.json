{"title": "Welfare sanctions and homelessness", "subtitle": "A survey found that 39% of homeless people had been sanctioned. 21% became homeless because of it.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2713", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/welfare-sanctions-and-homelessness/", "vclaim": "This is missing an important caveat.\n\nThe study that Jeremy Corbyn is referring to only looked at people who were using homelessness services. The proportion of people who lose their job after being sanctioned is likely to be smaller than this\u2014even though the report he\u2019s referring to does suggest a link between welfare sanctions and becoming homeless.\n\nPeople are offered welfare payments on certain conditions, such as spending a certain amount of time looking for a job. They can be sanctioned with a reduction in their payments if they don\u2019t comply. Payments can also be stopped altogether. Sanctions have been more widely used in recent years, especially since 2012.\n\nWhat did the survey say?\n\nThe report he\u2019s referring to interviewed 548 people using homelessness services who were receiving welfare between February and April 2015. It found that 213 of them had been sanctioned in the previous year, so about 39%.\n\nAbout half of the people who had been sanctioned said that it made it harder to keep their home.\n\n45 said they lost their home as a result of a sanction. That\u2019s about a fifth of the 213 who had been sanctioned, and that\u2019s where the figure comes from.\n\nSince the survey invited responses from people using homelessness services, it\u2019s likely that a smaller proportion of all people who are sanctioned then become homeless.", "lang": "en"}
