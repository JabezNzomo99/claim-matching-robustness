No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by BustaTroll.org on September 17, 2019 titled \"Kamala:'Our Police Are All Criminal Animals; They Are A Cancer'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nApparently Kamala Harris feels that the way for her to win the Democratic nomination for president is to continually foam at the mouth in her speeches and insult everything that true Americans hold dear. And by true Americans we mean, of course, the Trump faithful. In the past month she has suggested interning trump supporters should she win the White House and has blasted our military, calling them \"soulless cowards.\" Now she's moved on to another group that should only be getting respect for the great work they do in an extremely difficult and trying job .....the nation's police. In a speech yesterday before her home crowd of Crips and Bloods in California, Kamala Harris had nothing positive to say about our boys in blue, quite the opposite in fact. An excerpt follows from what will surely be the final nail in the coffin of a failed presidential bid: \"The police in this country are nothing more than thugs. Most of them anyway. I used to be a cop so I know. Those that aren't thugs allow the others to be thugs. And that makes them complicit. All police are criminals.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted in the category \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" and the stories about interning Trump supporters and calling the military soulless cowards were also made up by the site in earlier articles:\n\nThere is also no record or video of Kamala Harris saying any of the things she supposedly said.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
