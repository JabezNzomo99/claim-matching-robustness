It is part of the Uniform Crime Reporting program, which includes a separate measure of nonviolent crimes. These are the statistics Flynn and Barrett cite each quarter when they tout the improvement in the city\u2019s violent crime numbers.\n\n \n\n Walzak, though, says for the 20-year measure they are looking strictly at homicides.\n\n \n\n So, we\u2019re already off on a bad track -- the campaign cherry-picked two years of data, not all the years of Barrett\u2019s tenure. And it used homicides as a stand-in for all violent crime.\n\n \n\n To be sure, homicides attract the most attention. But Flynn and Barrett have regularly cited the broader number, with experts saying the murder rate alone can distort the picture. (Of the 6,446 violent crimes reported in 2009, 72 were homicides)\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s what we found when we crunched the numbers:\n\n \n\n When you compare 2004, the year Barrett took office, with last year, reported violent crime incidents were 36 percent higher in 2009 than 2004.\n\n \n\n (Even if you make Barrett\u2019s first full year in office, 2005, the baseline year, violent crime was still 5 percent higher last year.)\n\n \n\n If you look strictly at homicides, there was an 18 percent drop from 2004 to 2009.\n\n \n\n But the Barrett campaign talks about all violent crimes -- then it morphs the homicide number into the crime rate number and carries the comparison back decades.\n\n \n\n Homicides are at their lowest point in at least two decades. But the high-water mark in terms of all violent crime since 1990 actually came during Barrett\u2019s tenure, in 2006.\n\n \n\n What\u2019s going on here?\n\n \n\n When Barrett came into office on April 20, 2004, violent crime was at its lowest point during the past 20 years, thanks to a seven-year period when the numbers plummeted (see chart with this item).\n\n \n\n Barrett\u2019s second full year, 2006, was marked by a surge to the highest point since 1990. Indeed, the city was among the national leaders in a spike in violent crimes.\n\n \n\n Since then, violent crime has fallen considerably, but reported incidents were still well above the 2004 level.\n\n \n\n National trends factor in. Crime experts have said the decline in violent crime that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies.\n\n \n\n Likewise, the subsequent jump was attributed to many factors.\n\n \n\n In 2007, Barrett himself cited a decline in federal funds for the community-oriented policing service program and the need for responsible gun legislation.\n\n \n\n Whatever the reasons behind the trends, the Barrett campaign is playing loose with its words and the numbers.\n\n \n\n The campaign defines its bragging about what has happened \"under Tom Barrett\u2019s leadership.\" But it cherry-picks the best two years to highlight, ignoring the full picture for his time in office.\n\n \n\n Then the campaign goes beyond Barrett\u2019s time in office to say violent crime is at a 20-year low. This time it picks the pit out of the cherry, using the homicide rate as a stand-in for all violent crimes. In truth, the 20-year high point for violent crime was in 2006, two years into Barrett\u2019s term.\n\n \n\n All that cherry-picking leaves voters with a false impression -- and leaves us with a sour taste. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.\n\nNote (Sept. 23, 2010): In response to this item, the Barrett campaign changed the statement in question to make it accurate.", "lang": "en"}
