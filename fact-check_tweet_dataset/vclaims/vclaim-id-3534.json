There are only 13 appellate courts below the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 12 Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Federal Circuit Court. And there is no Judge Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith.\n\nOverall, the story claims that a judge \"allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law\" to be practiced in the United States and that Trump used his executive power to remove him from the bench.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the story and how separated it is from reality.\n\n\"When asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states,\" the story claimed.\n\nBut as fellow fact-checkers have noted, there is no \"systematic infusion clause,\" and the 14th Amendment largely deals with citizenship rights.\n\n\"President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution, reports As American As Apple Pie,\" the story continues.\n\nHowever, the website asamericanasapplepie.org is not a source of accurate news.\n\nThat website\u2019s About page claims everything posted on its site is fiction. \"It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.\"\n\nWebviners.com\u2019s story also uses different names for the supposed judge, at times calling him \"Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith,\" \"al Allalawaralahali-Smith\" and \"Alallaha-Smith.\"\n\nThe Feb. 28 post is a variation of other stories debunked in 2017. Previous fake news posts claimed it was \"Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith\" who ruled in favor of Sharia law in the United States.\n\nPolitiFact Texas reported that in November 2017, the Facebook page for Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a post from a website called trumpsolidsupporters.me, which made the same fake news claims as webviners.com did in February 2018.\n\nThe link to trumpsolidsupporters.me remains on Miller\u2019s Facebook page, yet an amended description for the link says: \"Well it looks like I may have been duped. This may be fake news, but I still think Sharia law has no place in the United States of America.\"\n\nA webviners.com post claimed Trump removed a Muslim federal judge for trying to implement Sharia law in the United States. But the post is riddled with inaccuracies and cites as a source a purveyor of fake news.", "lang": "en"}
