In his remarks, he said:\n\nWe\u2019re all truly blessed\u2026to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. And that\u2019s what my grandfather did, he came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper \u2026 and we pray, we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country.\n\nThe backlash was swift, prompting a boycott of the company\u2019s products using the hashtag #Goyaway.\n\nProminent Hispanic American Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro suggested boycotting their products and #Goyaway began trending alongside #BoycottGoya.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans spoke out in support of Unanue\u2019s remarks, and Trump supporters reacted to the backlash with a \u201cbuy-cott,\u201d calling on more people to buy Goya products.\n\nOnly 32% of Hispanic American voters \u2014 a significant voting group \u2014 back Trump, according to a June report from the Pew Research Center. Much of his unpopularity can be boiled down to his past comments calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d policies separating asylum seeking families along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his efforts to build a border wall.\n\nUnanue, in an interview with Fox News on July 10, said the criticism of his White House visit was \u201csuppression of speech.\u201d He said he had participated in an Obama administration event before, and perceived this reaction as a double standard. He also said he would not apologize for his remarks:\n\nWe should note that Unanue and his family have mostly donated to Republican causes and candidates in recent years.\n\nSnopes reached out to Goya Foods for comment, and will update this post if they respond. In previous statements, the company did not remark on the boycott, instead focusing on the purpose of Unanue\u2019s White House visit, which was to support Trump\u2019s initiative.\n\nDue to the overwhelming response from across the political divide, and Goya Foods\u2019 CEO\u2019s own defense of his comments, we rate this claim as a \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
