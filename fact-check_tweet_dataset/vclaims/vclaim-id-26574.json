The original tweet has been shared over 4,000 times.\n\nThe tweet is incorrect. We\u2019ve found no evidence that German TV reported a figure of 2.2 million people at the march, and the claim seems to originate from an anonymous twitter account.\n\nMost of the coverage that we\u2019ve seen from German media, both broadcast and online, reported a number in the tens or hundreds of thousands. A couple of German news websites also quoted the organisers\u2019 estimate of one million people.\n\nWe also spoke to experts in crowd science at the Manchester Metropolitan University. They told us that a total crowd of two million people was implausible. Their estimates found that the number was most likely in the low hundreds of thousands, and certainly not in the millions.
