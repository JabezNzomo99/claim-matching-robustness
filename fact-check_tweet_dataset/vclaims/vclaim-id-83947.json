Shame and what a shame! Your brutal army kills innocent and unarmed Kashmiris. If this is ur benchmark of bravery and gallantry than we curse and curse on such a bravery. Don't celebrate it rather feel ashamed and cry on it!\"\n\nThe first photo of an injured girl is from Gaza, Palestine and clicked in 2014.\n\nBOOM found that the photo is of a teenager from Gaza identified as Rawya Abu Jom'a, who sustaned injuries during an Israeli air strike on her apartment building.
