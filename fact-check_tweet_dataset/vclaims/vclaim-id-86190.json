The gain in December was 32,000 \u2014 and for all of 2018, 284,000. The November and December data is preliminary, so the numbers could change, but without a doubt, it\u2019s a great result: the largest annual gain in manufacturing jobs since the Great Recession wiped out nearly 1.4 million just in 2009.\n\nThe 284,000 gain in manufacturing jobs came right after a 207,000 gain in 2017, which basically matched President Barack Obama\u2019s best years (208,000 gain in 2014 and 207,000 gain in 2011). In fact, the rebound in manufacturing stalled out at the end of Obama\u2019s term, with a gain of just 69,000 jobs in 2015 and then a decline of 9,000 in 2016.\n\nThe data from the Reshoring Initiative shows that companies started to return jobs to the United States \u2014 or other countries invested in the United States \u2014 during the Obama administration, but the trend really started to pick up in 2017. About 73,000 jobs were brought to the United States in 2015, 113,000 in 2016 and 171,000 in 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office. That\u2019s a gain of more than 50 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\nSo the 2017 gains in manufacturing jobs might well be attributed to announcements when Obama was president, but the more impressive gain in 2018 could be attributed to announcements during Trump\u2019s tenure. Moser said that about 40 percent of the total gain in manufacturing jobs could be attributed to reshoring.\n\nBut Trump may have also just been in the right place at the right time. China became less attractive as its wages and prices have increased. The rise of e-commerce has meant that some companies have returned to the United States to be closer to customers, who expect quick deliveries.\n\nMoreover, there are other metrics that are not as positive. A.T. Kearney\u2019s fourth annual U.S. Reshoring Index, released in July 2018, presents a different picture: record imports from traditional offshoring countries in 2017 \u2014 a sharp reversal of the glimmers of hope seen in 2016. The Reshoring Index, unlike the Reshoring Initiative, does not count foreign direct investment or partial job shifts. So it focuses much more on actual moves by entire companies.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 Reshoring Index shows that reshoring continues to be a drop in the bucket, and US manufacturers are not exactly coming back in droves,\u201d the July report said. \u201cAlthough 2017 was a strong year for US manufacturing, both imports and domestic gross output of manufactured goods grew at rates that have not been matched since 2011.\u201d\n\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, told CNN that \u201cit\u2019s still a two-way street. We still have manufacturing that is leaving the US, but you also see some reshoring.\u201d CNN cited a survey of 800 manufacturers conducted in mid-October by IHS Markit, in which respondents on average said the new U.S. tariffs and escalating trade war would make them slightly more likely to move production overseas over the next two years.\n\nWhile the numbers are not yet complete, Moser said job announcements in 2018 will amount to about 130,000, off the 2017 pace by nearly 25 percent but still higher than in 2016. He attributed the slowdown to the trade disputes engineered by Trump, as well as dysfunction in Washington, along with a rise in the value of the U.S. dollar.\n\nTrump said he believed that the gain in manufacturing jobs \u201chas a lot to do\u201d with companies returning to the United States. It\u2019s certainly an important factor, but not the only factor \u2014 and the trend started under Obama, even as it accelerated under Trump. The president should also note the storm clouds caused by his trade disputes in 2018. We are generally reluctant to let any president give themselves too much credit for the economy, but Trump can certainly claim some bragging rights. Besides, it\u2019s not often that we find ourselves concluding that the president is mostly on target.", "lang": "en"}
