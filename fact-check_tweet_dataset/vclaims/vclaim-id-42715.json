Somewhere on the sea beach near Chandrabhaga, along the Puri-Konark marine drive road in Odisha.\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nOn putting the keyframes of the video through Reverse Image Search, we came across the same video posted by a Facebook user, Anthony Martin, on November 10, 2015.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t mention the location of the video.\n\nThough NewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the video, but, the above information establishes that the video in question is old as it was already on the internet much before the lockdown came into effect in India.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
