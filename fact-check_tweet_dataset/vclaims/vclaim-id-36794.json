The image also has a \"breaking news\" banner and the headline placed on it.\n\nThe facts: Claims alluding to expected earthquake schedules have been debunked repeatedly by Rappler. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has also repeatedly pointed out that there is no available technology that could accurately predict when earthquakes will strike.\n\nThe article from live.tv-netw0rks-channel.com includes a video, but the user is prompted to share the article first before watching the rest of the video. In addition, after clicking the link, the reader is redirected to another website that contains the video along with multiple ads.\n\nThe embedded video is not even related to the Taal eruption. It is a 24 Oras news report on April 29, 2019 titled, \"Phivolcs: 'Di bababa sa 20 ang lindol sa bansa kada araw (Phivolcs: At least 20 earthquakes will be experienced in the Philippines each day),\" which just points out the vulnerability of the country to earthquakes.\n\nThere are no additional details on the website about the source of this claim, nor about the 15 cities that will be supposedly hit.\n\n\"There is no reliable technology in the world that can confidently predict the date, time and location of large earthquakes,\" Phivolcs said on its Facebook page in April 2019.\n\nIn a primer on its website following the October 2019 earthquakes in Cotabato, Phivolcs observed that rumors \"claiming to predict an earthquake, tsunami, or volcanic activity are easily spread that may cause panic.\"\n\n\"Please avoid sharing these messages because your friends and relatives will think that you believe these messages are true and they will take your word for it,\" Phivolcs also said in a separate post on the Facebook page of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council in January 2019. \u2013 Michael Bueza/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
