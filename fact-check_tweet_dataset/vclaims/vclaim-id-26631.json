The saying attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to be one of them.\n\nSearching for the expression in collections of Hemingway\u2019s novels, poems and short stories turned up no matches.

My Life Has The Tendency To Fall Apart When I\u2019m Awake\u2019?)\n\nThe DCNF also reached out to several experts, none of whom recognized the quotation as belonging to Hemingway.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like him,\u201d said Mary Dearborn, author of \u201cErnest Hemingway: A Biography,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cHe did write that great passage in \u2018A Farewell to Arms\u2019 about being \u2018strong at the broken places,\u2019 and I think all this contemporary talk about \u2018broken\u2019 families, abuse victims, systems is mistakenly attributed to him.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Hemingway did write in his 1929 novel, \u201cThe world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.\u201d\n\nThe quote from \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d might have evolved and \u201cmerged\u201d with a lyric from singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen\u2019s song \u201cAnthem\u201d to make the saying attributed to Hemingway in the Facebook post, according to the website Quote Investigator. The line in Cohen\u2019s song reads, \u201cThere is a crack, a crack in everything/That\u2019s how the light gets in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts exact genesis is uncertain, but [Quote Investigator] hypothesizes that the 1929 statement by Hemingway and the 1992 lyric by Leonard Cohen both strongly influenced the evolution of the expression and its ascription,\u201d writes Quote Investigator.\n\nThe alleged quote has been attributed to Hemingway since at least 2013, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
