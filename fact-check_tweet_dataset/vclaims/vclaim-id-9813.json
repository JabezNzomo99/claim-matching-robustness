We could find no record of Stone ever making those comments, or the others included in the article.\n\nMultiple websites have shared the story since last year, but none indicates where or how the supposed remarks were obtained. The greatnewsupdates.blogspot.com post listed its source as trumpsolidsupporters.me, which published the same story in December 2017.\n\nAmong the other quotes attributed to Stone was this one: \u201cI admit that at first I wanted Hillary to win, but with time I understood that America made a great choice with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t comport with what Stone expressed in a conversation published in Out magazine in July 2017. Discussing her movie \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d Stone referenced Trump and the election.\n\n\u201cWe began shooting in the spring of 2016, when there was still a lot of hope in the air, and it was very interesting to see this guy\u2014this narcissistic, self-focused, constantly-stirring-the-pot kind of guy\u2014against this incredible, qualified woman, and at the same time be playing Billie Jean, with Steve [Carell] playing Bobby Riggs,\u201d Stone said. \u201cObviously the way this has all panned out has been fascinating and horrifying, and it still feels like we\u2019re in a bad dream.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of real news stories about celebrities and their feelings about Trump. This week alone, Trump and Roseanne Barr spoke highly of each other, and Jim Carrey continued to share his anti-Trump art.\n\nNevertheless, the fictional stories continue to circulate online. We\u2019ve debunked false claims dealing with Miley Cyrus, Keanu Reeves and Demi Moore, to name a few.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cActress Emma Stone: \u2018For The First Time In History We Have A President That\u2026\u2019\u201d greatusanewsupdates.blogspot.com. 24 Mar 2018.\n\nDeerwester, Jayme. \u201cThis week in Jim Carrey art: A dessert-obsessed Trump; an elephant out for revenge.\u201d USA Today. 29 Mar 2018.\n\n\u201cEmma Stone, Andrea Riseborough & Billie Jean King on Tennis, Equality & the Battle of the Sexes.\u201d Out.com. 6 Jul 2017.\n\nHaberman, Maggie and Healy, Patrick. \u201cTrump Rings Up Roseanne Barr After Her Show Is a Ratings Winner.\u201d New York Times. 28 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
