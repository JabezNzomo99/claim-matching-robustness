The claim is false; the ministry dismissed the social media posts as a \u201choax\u201d; the photos shared in the posts have circulated online before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThis Facebook post was published on March 1, 2020.\n\nIt contains a long post in Indonesian language and three photos showing Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi, people in a group photo, and an aircraft.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe first two paragraphs of the post\u2019s caption translate to English as: \u201cForeign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi advises all Indonesian citizens abroad to stay alert because of the coronavirus in China. President Jokowi told Retno Marsudi, the foreign minister, to bring home Indonesian citizens who want to return home [and provide] 1,000 free tickets.\n\n\u201cPromptly report yourself to PT Angkasa Pura through the following number because the tickets are limited, only 1,000 tickets. Those who report fast will return home free of charge.\u201d\n\nThe misleading post includes a phone number which it says it belongs to a person in charge of the free tickets from PT Angkasa Pura.\n\nJokowi is the nickname of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The virus has killed more than 3,825 and infected more than 110,000 people in more than 100 countries, AFP reported on March 9, 2020.\n\nThe claim in the misleading post was first published on Facebook on February 26, 2020, here, where it was shared more than 1,300 times before it was removed. The same claim was also shared here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the Indonesian Foreign Ministry dismissed it as a \u201choax\u201d on the agency's official Facebook page here on March 2, 2020.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Facebook post includes a screenshot of one of the misleading posts with the word \u201cHOAX\u201d in red stamped on it.\n\nThe text on the blue box translates to English as: \n\n \u201c#MOFAFriends\n\n BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT HOAX\n\n\u201cStay alert and be careful with circulating information that uses the name of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Retno L. Marsudi\n\n\u201cFACTCHECK\n\n The Foreign Affairs Minister and the Foreign Affairs Ministry have never promised \u2018free international tickets\u2019 as mentioned in the following hoax.\u201d\n\nThe ministry\u2019s spokesman, Teuku Faizasyah, also told AFP via WhatsApp on March 3, 2020, that the claim is a \u201choax\u201d and warned there could be \u201ca fraudulent motivation behind it.\u201d\n\nPT Angkasa Pura also refuted the misleading claim in a post published on its official Facebook page here on March 1, 2020, saying the company was never involved in selling tickets to passengers.\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBEWARE OF HOAX\n\n\u201cBeware of a hoax that says that Angkasa Pura I provides 1,000 free tickets to Indonesian nationals abroad due to coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAngkasa Pura I as an airport operator has never involved in the selling of airline tickets to passengers or collaborating with travel agents.\n\n\u201cWe ask Indonesian nationals to always be mindful and do not send personal identities and transfer a certain amount of money to irresponsible parties.\n\n Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe photos in the misleading posts also do not support the claim.\n\nThe photo of Foreign Minister Retno was previously published on October 25, 2019 here on the website of the Indonesian Embassy in Tripoli, Libya. The photo was posted in a congratulatory message marking Retno's re-appointment as foreign minister in the 2019-2024 cabinet.\n\nThe second image that shows people posing in a group photo was previously published without a caption here on January 12, 2018. The photo was used as a cover photo on the Facebook page of the airport authority of Manado, a city in the eastern Indonesia province of North Sulawesi.\n\nThe third photo that shows an airplane was published here on image-sharing website Pixabay and was taken by a photographer named Peter Herrmann.\n\nThe claim has been debunked by other Indonesian media outlets, for example by Liputan6.com, Vivanews.com and Jawa Pos.", "lang": "en"}
