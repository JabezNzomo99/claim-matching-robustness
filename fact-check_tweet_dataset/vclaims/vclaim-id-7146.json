However, this is only part of an effort to expose money laundering and other financial crimes by requiring investors to disclose the source of assets that are deemed disproportionate to their owners\u2019 declared income.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 22, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7146", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/britains-new-dirty-money-law/29243736.html", "vclaim": "On May 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters in Sochi that the British government could start labeling any foreign investments as \u201cdirty money.\u201d Peskov\u2019s comments were in reference to a new British parliamentary report titled \u201cMoscow\u2019s Gold: Russian Corruption in the U.K.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin and his allies have been able to continue \u2018business as usual\u2019 by hiding and laundering their corrupt assets in London,\u201d reads a summary of the report on the Parliament\u2019s official website. \u201cThese assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support President Putin\u2019s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually-reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s embassy in London attacked the report via Twitter, implying that Russians were being singled out in the search for illegal assets.\n\n\n\nWhile the parliamentary report focused on money laundering in connection with Russia, it is part of a larger push to combat such money laundering in general, not only Russian. For example, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported on March 2 that a Central Asian politician had become the first-ever subject of an \u201cunexplained wealth order\u201d issued by the British National Crime Agency (NCA). The order requires the owner of the assets in question to provide evidence that they were obtained legitimately. According to the National Crime Agency, the assets under review have been temporarily frozen.\n\nWhen the legislation authorizing unexplained wealth orders came into effect in January this year, Transparency International\u2019s Britain office released a list of top properties they believed authorities should investigate. Only one Russian was on the list -- then Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov.\n\nShuvalov is suspected to be the owner of two London luxury apartments worth an estimated 11.44 million British pounds ($15.3 million). Other names on the list include the family of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, a former Libyan major general, the president of the Nigerian Senate, and a former prime minister of Pakistan.\n\nRecently it has been reported that Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, billionaire owner of the Chelsea football team and personal friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, may be required to explain his wealth in order to renew his British visa.\n\nAccording to Donald Toon, director for economic crime at the NCA, \u201cunexplained wealth orders have the potential to significantly reduce the appeal of the UK as a destination for illicit income.\u201d\n\nBased on this, it is clear that the British government\u2019s latest measures against foreign money laundering do not single out Russians, as Russia\u2019s embassy in London tweeted.\n\nUnexplained wealth orders (UWO) were introduced in Britain\u2019s Criminal Finances Act, which was passed in April 2017. A UWO requires a respondent to declare his or her interest in the asset being reviewed and provide proof it was obtained it through legitimate means. The orders can be applied to an asset worth 50,000 GBP or more, when there is reasonable evidence to suspect illegal activity. A number of factors must be established by investigators before they can apply to a court to issue a UWO. Therefore, Peskov\u2019s implication that British authorities may label any investment as \u201cdirty money\u201d is false.", "lang": "en"}
