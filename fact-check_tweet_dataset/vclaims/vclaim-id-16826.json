She threatened that Russia would \u201crespond\u201d in kind.\n\n \n\n Zakharova said most Russian diplomats in the U.S. \u201care not allowed to go beyond 40 kilometers from their respective diplomatic missions\u201d without \u201cseveral days\u201d notice to the U.S. State Department. She added that in diplomacy \u201ceverything is based on the principle of reciprocity\u201d and that \u201cU.S. diplomats in Russia will be treated similarly. Once again, we are forced to respond.\u201d\n\n \n\n In a response to a query from Polygraph.info, a U.S. State Department official wrote that the current restrictions are based on a long-standing reciprocal agreement between Russia and the United States that dates back to the Soviet Union period. \n\n \n\n Russian diplomats are required to provide 24-hour \u201cadvance notification for any travel beyond a 25-mile radius from the cities in which the Russians have a diplomatic or consular presence,\u201d the official wrote.\n\nSimilarly \u201cAmerican diplomats in Moscow are required by the Russian government to provide advance notification of internal domestic travel to the Russian Foreign Ministry on a similar basis,\u201d according to the U.S. State Department. \n\n \n\n Zakharova\u2019s assertion that \u201cthey plan to deprive Russian diplomats of even that possibility\u201d was an apparent reference to language in the Intelligence Authorization Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on November 30.\n\nThe bill, which was not acted upon by the U.S. Senate before its winter recess, does not impose any additional distance or notification restrictions on Russian diplomats.\n\n \n\n It calls for additional inter-agency coordination within the U.S. government to monitor the travel of Russian diplomats.\n\nSpecifically, it tasks the U.S. Secretary of State to coordinate with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence to \u201ctake necessary action to secure full compliance by Russian personnel and address any noncompliance.\u201d \n\n \n\n The bill also requires the State Department to submit a quarterly report \u201cdetailing the number of known or suspected violations\u201d of any travel requirements. \n\n \n\n For the bill to become law, it will require reintroduction of the legislation in the House and Senate next year when a new Congress convenes.\n\n \n\n Russian expert Paul Goble told Polygraph.info that while the bill \u201cclearly reflects the thinking of many in the Congress, the measure has not been taken up by the Senate, which means it is not close to becoming a law.\u201d\n\n \n\n Contrary to Zakharova\u2019s allegations, Goble added that Russian diplomats\u2019 work \u201cwould not be complicated. The U.S. government will simply know more about what they (Russian diplomats) are doing.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
