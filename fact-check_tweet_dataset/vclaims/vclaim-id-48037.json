And that\u2019s only the starting point. It doesn\u2019t take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country\u2019s public finances.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) released analysis costing the Labour party\u2019s plans to nationalise various utilities.\n\nIt said the plans would cost at least \u00a3196 billion, and would cost pensioners and savers too. It did not try and weigh that up against any potential economic benefit of nationalisation.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first effort to cost Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans, and it can be hard to say definitively how accurate analyses like these are\u2014all are trying to predict the future using models with various advantages and disadvantages. We will be writing more about this issue at a later date.\n\nWhat we can say for certain though is that the reporting of CBI\u2019s analysis (aided by CBI\u2019s press release) is misleading.\n\nIt claims both that nationalisation will cost \u00a3196 billion and that pensioners and savers will lose out, when in fact the CBI\u2019s analysis says those two outcomes would occur under different (and contradictory) scenarios.\n\nMore broadly, some have argued that what really matters isn\u2019t the upfront \u2018costs\u2019, but whether nationalisation would deliver net costs or benefits to the public on an ongoing basis.\n\nProblems with how the analysis was reported\n\nThe CBI\u2019s analysis says that renationalisation will initially cost \u00a3196 billion. This assumes that Labour would pay the market capitalisation cost s of each company. Market capitalisation is the amount you get if you multiply all the shares a company has \u201coutstanding\u201d (sold or given to other people) by the current share price.\n\nThe CBI said that where market capitalisation was not available it used the regulated asset value of these businesses plus a 30% mark-up as a proxy.\n\nIt claims that: \u201cThis is based on evidence of historical takeovers which shows that utility companies have typically fetched a price above the asset value.\u201d\n\nThe CBI also says that if a Labour government did not pay this mark-up, this would translate into a financial loss for shareholders who would not be paid the full value of their shares. These shareholders would include pensioners and savers who own stock either directly or indirectly (for example, via private pension funds).\n\nThat means it\u2019s misleading to report, as many outlets did, both the \u00a3196 billion estimated cost to the state and the cost to shareholders, without specifying that under the CBI\u2019s model they can\u2019t happen simultaneously.\n\nAccording to the CBI, either you have a \u00a3196 billion cost (where a Labour government pays a 30% mark-up to acquire companies) or you have a smaller upfront cost and a potential impact on pensioners and savers (where the mark-up isn\u2019t paid).\n\nWhile this was made clear in their methodological note, it is misleading of the CBI to say in its press release:\n\n\u201cThe price tag for Labour\u2019s renationalisation plans is beyond eye-watering \u2013 close to \u00a3200 billion. And that\u2019s only the starting point. It doesn\u2019t take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country\u2019s public finances.\u201d\n\nAside from the way the analysis was reported, CBI\u2019s methodology has been disputed.\n\nIn particular, various economists have questioned the valuation of companies using a 30% mark up on the regulated asset values.\n\nAlso the CBI has since admitted it made an error by including the cost of buying the rail industry\u2019s trains\u2014which isn\u2019t Labour party policy. The CBI said it was unable to provide an exact breakdown of its calculations, or how much it estimated the acquisition of trains to cost.\n\nBut perhaps more important is that in looking just at the upfront \u2018costs\u2019 of nationalisation, the analysis may be focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nLabour has not produced its own costing for its nationalisation plans, arguing that\u2014as Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has previously said\u2014\u201cIt would be cost-neutral because you would be bringing into public ownership an asset.\u201d\n\nLabour plans to issue government bonds to pay for the companies so while public debt will increase, so will the value of public assets.\n\nThey\u2019re not alone in arguing that this view of what nationalisation would \u2018cost\u2019 is not really the most important issue. As the Financial Times put it back in 2017: \u201cFor economists\u2026the acquisition costs of nationalisation are not an interesting issue when governments are able to borrow freely.\u201d\n\nRather, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it in the same year, \u201cwhat matters is whether assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to the CBI, it does make clear that \u201cthe scope of this analysis focuses on the cost side of renationalisation and does not seek to estimate the potential benefits.\u201d However it is limited by taking this approach.\n\nFor example, the CBI said that the government would need to service the debt created by nationalisation to the tune of over \u00a32billion per year, without considering how this could be offset by any profit generated by these newly nationalised industries. Again, we don\u2019t know enough to say whether a net profit or improved service\u2014or both, or neither\u2014is the likely outcome of taking companies into public ownership.\n\nAs we said above, we expect to write more on this issue in the future.", "lang": "en"}
