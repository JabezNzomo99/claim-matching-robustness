While it is still the case there is no evidence you can catch the new coronavirus from your pet, there\u2019s some evidence animals may be able to become infected. Our latest piece on the evidence around animals testing positive for the virus can be found here.\n\n\n\nThis article has been archived as a result. You can find our latest fact checks on the new coronavirus here.\n\nYou may have seen a number of posts on Facebook claiming that pets can\u2019t carry the new coronavirus. The posts say:\n\nThese claims have been shared over 800,000 times on Facebook alone.\n\nThe claim is essentially true. There is no evidence that humans can catch Covid-19 from their pets, and there\u2019s dispute within the scientific community on whether pets can really have a case of the disease.\n\nAccording to Public Health England, \u201cAt present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation says that \u201cthere is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.\u201d\n\nA dog in Hong Kong did test \u2018weak positive\u2019 for the virus and was put into quarantine, but it had no symptoms. Its owner had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Hong Kong\u2019s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reported that the dog had a low level infection of the virus. But other experts questioned whether there was enough evidence to conclude that the dog did in fact have the virus. We\u2019ve written in depth about this story before.\n\nSince being released from quarantine, the dog, a pomeranian, has reportedly died. An unnamed source told the South China Morning Post that it was very unlikely it had died of the virus, since it was an old dog for its breed, and had underlying health issues.", "lang": "en"}
