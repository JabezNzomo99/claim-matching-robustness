So you can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days. They catch a drug dealer, they don\u2019t even put him in jail. \u2026 Think of it: You kill 5,000 people with drugs, because you\u2019re smuggling them in and you\u2019re making a lot of money and people are dying, and they don\u2019t even put you in jail, they don\u2019t do anything. But you might get 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, remarks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, March 10\n\nWe consulted a number of experts on the illegal drug market, and the president\u2019s comments left them scratching their heads. No state, not even California or Ohio, has more than 5,000 overdose deaths in a single year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cCannabis aside, the total drug markets in the U.S. at retail probably generate $50 billion a year in illicit revenue,\u201d he said. If the average dealer earned $50,000 a year (which is way high, since most dealers are small-scale retailers, many of them supporting their own habits), that would suggest something like 1 million full-time equivalent dealers. There are less than 100,000 total drug overdose deaths, which would be less than one-tenth of a death per dealer per year on average.\u201d\n\nWhen we dug into specific drugs \u2014 such as heroin \u2014 Trump\u2019s claim still did not add up. There are 1 million heroin users in the United States, and about 2,000 dealers are arrested each year. The number of heroin deaths is about 12,000 a year. Even if one assumes there were twice as many dealers as those arrested \u2014 a very low-ball assumption \u2014 that would only be three people per dealer a year.\n\nThe indictment says about 700 patients \u201care now dead and a significant percentage of those deaths, directly or indirectly, were the result of overdosing on narcotics prescribed\u201d by Urgent Care & Surgery Center Enterprise, the defendants\u2019 company. The death toll attributed to the enterprise is said to still be climbing.\n\nStill, even a \u201csignificant percentage\u201d of 700, or twice that, is not going to get you to 2,000 or above. The indictment also said that investigators had charged an additional 30 narcotics traffickers and 80 to 90 small narcotic distributors. It\u2019s hard to parse out exactly how many deaths each person would be responsible for, unless you pin all of the deaths on the top of the pyramid.\n\n\u201cA retail cocaine dealer who gets arrested with a small amount and pleads to a possession charge might well get a few months in jail,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cSince those people are utterly replaceable, it\u2019s really not worth locking them up, except for the minority who commit violent acts in connection with their dealing.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the president ends up in Four-Pinocchio territory because of the way he frames his rhetoric. He may have a point that \u201ckingpin\u201d drug dealers are responsible for at least hundreds of deaths. But then he cannot turn around and say they only end up with 30 or so days in prison if they are caught. A handful of drug dealers might get by with a little prison time, but those are the small fry, not the people responsible for many deaths.", "lang": "en"}
