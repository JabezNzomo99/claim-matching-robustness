Teachers assessed 78% of students to have reached at least the expected writing standard and 80% to have reached the expected reading standard.\n\nSATs scores and teacher assessments are not the only way to measure literacy. For example, England takes part in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) which measures reading aptitude among year 5 (9 to 10 year-olds) students.\n\nThe latest data, from 2016, shows that 86% of these students reached at least the intermediate benchmark for reading.", "lang": "en"}
