The website is part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d popular network of satire pages and sites.\n\nReuters has previously clarified that similar satirical content has been mistaken as true about the Congresswoman, visible here and here , as well as a viral claim featuring a fabricated tweet by AOC here .\n\nFalse.
