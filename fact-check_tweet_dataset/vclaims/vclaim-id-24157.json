Here are some examples:\n\nWe watched the entire video and observed that people in the video can be heard speaking the Gujarati language. The fact that the video is from Gujarat is corroborated by the signboards written in the Gujarati language. We used InVid Magnifier and Google translator to view the signboards in the video. \u201cDeluxe Pan Parlour (translated)\u201d, reads a signboard in the Gujarati language.\n\nWe further investigated the video and used InVid tool to extract the keyframes of the video.\n\nWe performed the reverse image search on the keyframes and landed to a tweet supported by a caption that suggested that the incident took place in Viramgam in Gujarat.\n\nWe performed Google search using relevant keywords \u201c\u0a85\u0aa5\u0aa1\u0abe\u0aae\u0aa3, \u0aae\u0ac1\u0ab8\u0acd\u0ab2\u0abf\u0aae, \u0ab5\u0abf\u0ab0\u0aae\u0a97\u0abe\u0aae (Translated from: Conflict, Muslim, Viramgam) and landed to an article written in Gujarati language.\n\nWe came across an article in Gujarati news platform Akila News that was published on April 1, 2019. The text in the article read:\u0ab5\u0abf\u0ab0\u0aae\u0a97\u0abe\u0aae\u0aae\u0abe\u0a82\u0a95\u0aac\u0acd\u0ab0\u0ab8\u0acd\u0aa4\u0abe\u0aa8\u0aa8\u0ac0\u0aa6\u0abf\u0ab5\u0abe\u0ab2\u0aac\u0abe\u0aac\u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa0\u0abe\u0a95\u0acb\u0ab0-\u0aae\u0ac1\u0ab8\u0acd\u0ab2\u0abf\u0aae\u0ab5\u0a9a\u0acd\u0a9a\u0ac7\u0a9c\u0ac2\u0aa5\u0a85\u0aa5\u0aa1\u0abe\u0aae\u0aa3 (English: A group clash between Thakor-Muslim in connection with the wall of the cemetery in Viramgam).\n\nAnother text in the article reads: Muslim community with Thakor community in Viramgam has created mass clashes in respect of the land and wall of the cemetery). We observed that, the image used in the article were exactly same as the keyframes of the video (translated in English).\n\nWe searched Google to know more about the incident and found the news reports of the same incident were published by some other media websites as well. Here is a screenshot from the news published in Hindustan Times:\n\nWe also contacted a local reporter from the place where the incident happened and he said that a clash happened between Thakor-Muslim in connection with the wall of the cemetery in Varamgam.\n\nWe used Stalkscan to check the profile of the user \u2018S M Sarwar Hussain\u2019 who shared the post and found many misleading posts.\n\nThe incident shown in the viral video actually took place even before the general elections started and the Facebook post and video are found to misleading.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
