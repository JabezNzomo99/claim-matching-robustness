Now, some are calling for her removal.\n\nBack in May 2017, Sanders told reporters that \"countless\" FBI agents expressed their support for former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s firing. She subsequently repeated the talking point.\n\nBut the redacted Mueller report says her remarks were \"not founded on anything.\" When investigators questioned Sanders, she admitted there was no basis for her statement, blaming the falsehoods on a \"slip of the tongue\" and \"the heat of the moment.\"\n\nWhite House correspondents have criticized Sanders\u2019 credibility, with one reporter, April Ryan, calling for her firing.\n\nWe decided to look into past press secretaries\u2019 falsehoods to understand the significance of Sanders\u2019 actions.\n\nFormer presidents \u2014 from Woodrow Wilson to Richard Nixon \u2014 famously have had strained relationships with the press. But what does it mean for the president\u2019s official spokesperson to tell untruths?\n\nJay Carney, Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary, echoed Obama\u2019s claim that Americans could keep their current health care plans under the Affordable Care Act. As Obama\u2019s plan moved from idea to legislative reality, the statement became inaccurate. Ultimately, the statement was repeated dozens of times with insufficient context, earning PolitiFact\u2019s Lie of the Year for 2013.\n\nBut in most instances we tracked down, press secretaries have lied in order to protect American security or military interests abroad. In 1971, when asked if American and South Vietnamese forces were preparing to invade Laos, Nixon\u2019s Ron Ziegler replied, \"The president is aware of what is going on in Southeast Asia. \u2026 That is not to say anything is going on in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nJody Powell, Jimmy Carter\u2019s press secretary, garnered criticism over his handling of the botched attempt to save hostages from the American embassy in Tehran. In the weeks leading up to the rescue mission, Powell assured the press that the idea had been abandoned.\n\nDuring George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Ari Fleischer suggested there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; that proved false. Both Fleischer, as the face of the war effort, and the press have been accused of marshalling the American people into war. He has since attributed his statements to a \"major intelligence failure.\"\n\nMike McCurry, Bill Clinton\u2019s press secretary, told PolitiFact last year, \"These questions about national security are the most sensitive and create the dilemma. You tap dance, but never lie.\"\n\nThose who study political communications and public relations draw a bright line between spinning and lying, according to Northwestern University political science professor Larry Stuelpnagel. While it\u2019s common for press secretaries to present facts that help justify the president\u2019s actions or demonstrate widespread support for a policy, lying is frowned upon because it damages the credibility of the entire administration.\n\nSanders\u2019 mistakes are not an isolated case within the Trump administration. Her predecessor, Sean Spicer, told falsehoods about voter fraud, surveillance of Trump Tower, and the crowd size at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former communications director, testified to Congress that she told \"white lies\" while representing the president.\n\nThe Mueller report says that Sanders spoke with the president after the Comey briefing and that Trump \"told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments.\"\n\nPerhaps the most pertinent historical example of a press secretary lying to protect their boss came from Ziegler, who dismissed Watergate as a \"third-rate alleged burglary attempt.\" When Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein kept digging, Ziegler accused them of \"shabby journalism\" and \"character assassination.\"\n\nIn a piece for Politico Magazine, John Farrell, who authored the biography \"Richard Nixon: The Life,\" wrote that the president \"viewed Ziegler as a tool and a mouthpiece, not a trusted confidant.\"\n\nSanders has yet to acknowledge that she gave reporters false information about FBI agents expressing support for Comey\u2019s firing. Instead, she\u2019s on the offensive.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, George Stephanopoulos told Sanders, \"The report exposes a culture of lying at the White House \u2014 the president lying, telling others to lie, and it calls your personal credibility into question.\"\n\nIn response, Sanders doubled down on her earlier comment, explaining that current and former members of the FBI \"continue to speak out and send notice to the White House of their agreement with the president\u2019s decision.\"\n\nStephanopoulos, who served as Clinton\u2019s communications director, pressed her, \"Why can\u2019t you acknowledge that what you said then was not true?\"\n\n\"I said that the word I used, 'countless,' and I also said \u2014 if you look at what's in quotations from me \u2014 it's that, and it's that it was 'in the heat of moment,' meaning that it wasn't a scripted talking point. I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party,\" Sanders replied.", "lang": "en"}
