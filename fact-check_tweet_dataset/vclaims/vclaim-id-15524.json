Rahul Gandhi is misleading the country is claiming he is unmarried.)\u201d reads the message.\n\nSeveral individual users on Facebook have circulated the message and Gandhi\u2019s image with a woman.\n\nThe message is also viral on Twitter as well.\n\nSearching for the alleged \u2018expos\u00e9\u2019 leads to no relevant results on WikiLeaks. There are also no media reports that mention Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u2018secret\u2019 marriage to a Colombian woman. Moreover, reverse-searching Gandhi\u2019s photograph being shared along with the message reveals that the image was uploaded in 2017. The woman in the photograph is Spanish-American actress Nathalia Ramos.\n\nRamos had also uploaded the photograph on her Instagram account and captioned it as, \u201cLast night with the eloquent and insightful @rahulgandhi. I feel so blessed to have the opportunity to meet and listen to so many brilliant thinkers from all parts and perspectives of the world. It is only with an open mind and open heart that we can really make the world a better place. Thank you @berggrueninst for opening mine. #IdeasMatter\u201c\n\nThis image was viral earlier this year with a changed narrative claiming that the woman in the photograph was a porn actor. Since the start of the general elections, misinformation related to Rahul Gandhi has been floating on social media. It was earlier claimed that Gandhi was \u2018uncourteous\u2019 while handing his nomination papers. Another piece of misinformation claimed that Gandhi\u2019s name was misprinted on a Congress poster. A fake newspaper clipping was also shared in the Congress president\u2019s name.", "lang": "en"}
