The UK triggered Article 50 (following parliamentary approval) in March 2017, which set off a two-year countdown before we officially leave, on 29 March 2019.\n\nOn 22 March the government extended Article 50, meaning the most likely date for a no deal Brexit is now 12 April.\n\nThe UK is already a democratic, sovereign nation with its own (unwritten) constitution, and has its own rule of law. So it\u2019s false to say that leaving with no deal would make us these things \u201conce again\u201d.\n\nCurrently EU laws take supremacy over UK law should they come into conflict, and the Court of Justice of the European Union is the highest court on matters of EU law.\n\nEU law doesn\u2019t cover all aspects of UK law. In areas where no EU law is applicable, the UK parliament and courts are the supreme bodies for making and judging law.\n\nNo deal Brexit would change elements of how sovereignty (the authority of the state to govern itself) and legal process is exercised in the UK. Leaving the EU with no deal would remove the jurisdiction of EU courts and laws in the UK (although we\u2019d copy over existing EU law into UK law). That would arguably make the UK more independent and sovereign, in as much as more law-making comes directly from the UK.\n\nHowever a no deal Brexit wouldn\u2019t mean that every rule the UK follows is made in the UK. For example, we would remain members of international organisations like NATO and the WTO, and membership of these things means following collective rules or decision-making.\n\nCorrect. The transition period is part of the draft withdrawal agreement, so if we leave the EU with no deal, that means no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.\n\nThe transition period lasts from the day we officially leave the EU until December 2020 (although it could be extended). During the transition period, we will trade with the EU as we do currently and try to negotiate the future trade relationship with the EU.\n\nCorrect, leaving the EU with no deal means leaving the customs union.\n\nUnder the draft withdrawal deal we\u2019d stay in the customs union until the end of the transition period. It\u2019s the government\u2019s intention to leave the customs union once the transition period ends. But if a future trading relationship isn\u2019t agreed between the UK and EU during that time the Irish backstop arrangements would kick in and the UK would remain in a form of customs union until an agreement could be reached.\n\nCorrect, leaving the EU with no deal means leaving the single market.\n\nUnder the draft withdrawal deal we\u2019d stay in the single market until the end of the transition period. It\u2019s the government\u2019s intention to leave the single market once the transition period ends. If the Irish backstop arrangements kick in, then Northern Ireland will remain aligned to some of the rules of the single market.\n\nAs part of the draft withdrawal agreement, the UK has agreed to pay its outstanding financial liabilities to the EU, estimated at \u00a339 billion.\n\nIf we left with no deal, it\u2019s uncertain how much of that we\u2019d have to pay, if anything.\n\nExperts at UK in a Changing Europe told us in February that, under international law, it\u2019s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice.\n\nThis seems to be referring to the UK\u2019s annual payments into the EU budget, though it\u2019s unclear. If that\u2019s the case it\u2019s incorrect\n\nIn 2017 the UK government paid \u00a313 billion into to the EU budget after the rebate had been applied (which gives the UK a discount on its contributions). The EU was then forecast to spend \u00a34 billion on the UK public sector leaving a \u201cnet\u201d contribution of nearly \u00a39 billion.\n\nAdditionally the EU spent money on the UK\u2019s private sector, reducing the UK\u2019s net contribution further to around \u00a35 billion in 2017.\n\nIf we leave the EU without a deal, it\u2019s possible that we may not have to pay anything to the EU, whereas under the draft withdrawal agreement we would (as explained above).\n\nWe already have some powers to control EU immigration, and the ability to control non-EU immigration.\n\nIf we left with no deal, the UK would have more control over immigration from the EU\u2014as we would not have to follow EU rules on freedom of movement.\n\nHowever that could also be the case if the existing draft withdrawal agreement is passed. The government wants to end the free movement of people between the UK and EU after the end of the transition period, and for EU citizens to no longer get preferential access over immigrants from over countries.\n\nThese are, however, only intentions, and would still have to be negotiated after the passing of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that leaving with no deal would remove the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Under the withdrawal agreement, the UK would continue to follow EU law (with a few exceptions) and the rulings of the ECJ during transition period. What happens after the transition period would depend on the outcome of UK-EU negotiations.\n\nBut it\u2019s incorrect to say that a no deal Brexit will end the role of the European Court of Human Rights. This court has nothing to do with the EU and post-Brexit the UK will still remain a member. You can read more about the ECHR here.\n\nFree trade is a somewhat hazy phrase but one definition might be that free trade is when international trade happens without tariffs, quotas or other restrictions.\n\nFollowing a no deal Brexit, the trade agreements we\u2019re already signed up to as a member of the EU will cease to apply and trade will take place under WTO rules.\n\nUnder WTO rules, countries set their own import rules, so a no deal Brexit means that the government could, in theory, allow goods and services from all countries across the world to be imported into the UK without tariffs or quotas.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean other countries would have to do the same, meaning that UK exports to those countries would, in many cases, face tariffs and restrictions.\n\nIn any case, the government have said that under a no deal Brexit scenario, tariffs would still apply to 13% of goods (by value) imported into the UK for up to 12 months. During that time it will undertake a review on a long-term approach to tariffs.\n\nAnother way of thinking about free trade is that the UK would be able to decide for itself how trade with other countries would operate. In the longer-term a no deal Brexit would give the UK the greatest agency over its future trade deals, although the exact terms would have to be agreed in negotiation with each individual country. These deals would likely take years to negotiate.\n\nSee the section above about the UK becoming a sovereign, independent country.\n\nThis is largely correct, though arguably this would also be the case under the draft withdrawal agreement.\n\nCurrently the UK is part of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), whereby the EU sets quotas on how much fish a country can catch in a single year.\n\nIf the UK leaves the CFP, it will become an \u201cindependent coastal state\u201d and be able to negotiate access to our waters in return for access to other markets and territorial waters. This will form part of the negotiations of the future relationship that will take place during the transition period. But the government has said that there are other international obligations on fisheries the UK will still need to abide by.\n\nA no deal Brexit, in which there was no transitional agreement on fisheries until the end of 2020, would mean that the UK would become an independent coastal state from March 2019.\n\nWhile some European politicians have spoken about their desire for a more federal European system, akin to the United States of America, there are currently no developed plans for this to happen.", "lang": "en"}
