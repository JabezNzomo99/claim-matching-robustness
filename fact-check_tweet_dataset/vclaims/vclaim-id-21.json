The photo, portraying Melania Trump and two women at a party, has been shared at least 10,400 times on Facebook (see example here and bit.ly/2wR7f7r) and has over 662 retweets on Twitter (See example here and here as of February 28, 2020.\n\nThese claims are partly false. This photo (see original here) does portray Melania Trump (center) and her sister Ines Knauss (left) but the women in the white suit (right) is not their mother, Amalija Knavs, as suggested.\n\nThe photo, taken for Getty Images by Lucien Capeheart is from Mar-a-Lago taken in 2005. According to Getty, it shows Melania and her sister with American philanthropist Audrey Gruss at a Valentino Fashion Luncheon benefit for the Boy\u2019s Club of New York.\n\nAudrey Gruss is the Founder and Chairman of the Hope for Depression Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to the funding of scientific research on depression and emotional disorders. She has been publicly seen with Melania Trump a few times (some examples here)\n\nInes Knauss is Melania Trump\u2019s older sister. Aside from this picture, Ines is not often photographed in public. Reuters could not find any other recent photographs of Melania and Ines. Photographs on her Facebook (www.facebook.com/iknauss) and Instagram (here) accounts appear to confirm Ines\u2019 identity and she often references her sister, Melania.\n\nMelania\u2019s mother, Amalija Knavs, has been filmed and photographed in public several times. A Reuters video showing Melania\u2019s parents in 2018 is visible here. A photo of Knavs taken in 2006 (closer to the claimed photograph\u2019s date) is visible here.\n\nAnother post on Facebook misleadingly claims Audrey Gruss to be Melania\u2019s sister. See example here. Melania Trump has only one sister.\n\nThe claim might have come from the fact that several media outlets have used this photo to illustrate their stories on Melania\u2019s family (examples here and here).\n\nPartly false: this photo does portray Melania Trump and her sister, Iness Knauss, but the woman in white is not their mother, Amalija Knav, but American philanthropist Audrey Gruss.", "lang": "en"}
