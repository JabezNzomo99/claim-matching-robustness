Including a general warning on our US website is a step commonly taken by companies selling products in California.\u201d\n\nAs the company told us the warning appears because of a California law Proposition 65, which means companies that conduct business in the state of California must provide warnings about \u201csignificant exposures to chemicals that cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.\u201d\n\nPretty Little Thing are not the only company to use this warning\u2014other fashion sites like ASOS and Fashion Nova have the warning on their US sites too.
