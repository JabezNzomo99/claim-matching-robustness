Recently, Henry Kissinger did an interview and said very amazing things regarding President Trump. He starts with: \u201cDonald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen before\u201d! The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy and predicts its success: \u201cLiberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it. They will never admit that he is the one true leader. The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation\u2019s people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference.\u201d Kissinger knows it and he continues with: \u201cEvery country now has to consider two things: One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. And secondly, that there is a new president who\u2019s asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.\u201d\n\nAs the transcript shows, Kissinger did say \u201cDonald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen.\u201d He also described what foreign countries would have to consider under a Trump presidency:\n\nKISSINGER: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen. So it is a shocking experience to them that he came into office, at the same time, extraordinary opportunity. And I believe he has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president, because every country now has two things to consider, one, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it. I\u2019m not saying it will. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nHowever, all the rest of the text of those Facebook posts was a mixture of various political opinions and quotations scraped from other sources and falsely attributed to Kissinger. The former secretary of state didn\u2019t call Trump \u201cthe one true leader\u201d or say he \u201cputs America and its people first,\u201d nor did he maintain that Trump was \u201ctalking about 13 issues that most Americans are concerned about.\u201d\n\nThis was a variation of a similar claim we rated \u201cFalse\u201d in 2018.", "lang": "en"}
