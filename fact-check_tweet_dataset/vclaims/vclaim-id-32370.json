But a company spokesman said there is no such current promotion.\n\nThe fake offer, archived here, looks like this:\n\nWhen a Facebook user clicks on the link, it opens a webpage that asks a series of questions and seeks to collect personal information.\n\nEventually it requires the user to share the link on Facebook with \u201cThank you!\u201d written in the comments field.\n\nHowever, this offer is not affiliated in any way with JetBlue Airways.\n\nIt \u201cdoes not match any of our recent promotions or giveaways,\u201d Derek Dombrowski, JetBlue Manager for Corporate Communications, told AFP by email on February 24, 2020.\n\nIt is also not a significant anniversary of JetBlue Airways. According to the company\u2019s website, it was \u201cborn at JFK in 1999.\u201d\n\nThe company also has a post from 2019 pinned to the top of its official Facebook page that reads: \u201cFact: we love free stuff just as much as the next person. Also a fact: we don\u2019t want our customers to fall for the free ticket scams run by an unverified source.\u201d\n\nThe company promotes actual ticket offers on Twitter here.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked other fake offers on Facebook, including non-existent coupons from global retail giant Walmart, home improvement retailer Lowes and brewer Molson Coors.", "lang": "en"}
