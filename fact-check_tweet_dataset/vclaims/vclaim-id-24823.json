People tried to explain it to them. They were already prepared or whatever it is, they started pelting stones. Everything happened hurriedly and after this the idol was taken for immersion.\u201d\n\nHere is full audio of my conversation with Additional SP of Balrampur. I did not want to make this public because I have deep respect for the police force, however, I cannot let a PR agency get away with lying repeatedly. Listen to what ASP says at 3:15https://t.co/Bk9qF1mGq2 \u2014 Nupur J Sharma (@UnSubtleDesi) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Quint got in touch with the Additional SP of Balrampur Police who denied giving any such statement and told us that that the incident happened in Balrampur on Tuesday, 8 October while a Durga Puja procession was crossing a mosque. Mishra said, \u201cThe procession was crossing the mosque and was expected to switch off the music, but that did not happen. This angered the Muslim and triggered clashes between the two communities.\u201d He further added that the police has arrested eight people in connection with the violence.\n\nThe Quint spoke to the police officer again on Thursday who once more denied making any such statement. Further Balrampur police took to Twitter to clarify that the police is taking all the necessary steps to ensure law and order.\n\nWe also spoke to a local journalist who said that the clashes broke out between the two sections when the procession allegedly didn\u2019t stop the loud music and splashed colours while crossing the mosque. But it remains unclear as to who instigated the violence.", "lang": "en"}
