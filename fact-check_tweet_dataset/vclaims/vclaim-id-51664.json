These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum \u2014 it is, after all, an inanimate object.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren\u2019s Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\n\nHere\u2019s an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\n\nBut the Warren\u2019s Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\n\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \u201cAnnabelle escaped\u201d rumors.\n\nSpera said: \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you something, I don\u2019t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelle\u2019s alive \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say alive \u2014 Annabelle\u2019s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\u201d\n\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.\n\nThe rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the \u201cAnnabelle\u201d movie. Wallis talked about her new film, \u201cThe Silencing,\u201d as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d Wallis also talked about \u201crunning\u201d in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the \u201cescape\u201d scenes from \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping.", "lang": "en"}
