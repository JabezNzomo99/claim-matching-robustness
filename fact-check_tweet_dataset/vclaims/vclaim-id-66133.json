What is even more shocking, allegedly they have found human and horse meat in the freezers of an Oklahoma City McDonald\u2019s meat factory. In addition, inspectors found human meat in several trucks on their way to deliver the burgers to the fast food restaurants.\n\n\"Lloyd Harrison is FBI agent, and for Huzler he stated: \u2018The worst part is that it\u2019s not only human meat, it\u2019s child meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible,\u2019\" read the post.\n\nThe post never discloses the name or publication of the report that would maintain the validity of the article, but it does divulge the name of the website that originated this meaty tale. The story first began on Huzlers.com. Huzlers, a website that specializes in publishing joke articles about topics that are trending on social media, published the original article in March 2014, according to the debunking website Snopes.\n\nReaders who believed the post took to social media to accuse McDonald\u2019s of using human meat and questioning the contents of their burgers. The fast-food company affirms that their patties are made out of 100 percent real beef.\n\nAlthough the story is still circulating three years after its publication, there is no record of McDonald\u2019s trying to feed diners human flesh. In 2016, a Bay Area food lab took a stab at trying to discover surprise ingredients in burgers. The lab got a combined 258 meat and veggie sample patties from different retailers and fast food chains in Northern California and tested them for missing or unexpected ingredients.\n\nOut of the 258 test samples they found that one burger contained a minute trace of DNA that was likely left by a factory worker who came into contact with the product. The report does not disclose where each sample was from but it does explain that the patty found with the human DNA was a veggie burger, a menu item that is not served in American McDonald\u2019s.\n\nDon\u2019t believe this fast food factoid because it\u2019s fake news.
