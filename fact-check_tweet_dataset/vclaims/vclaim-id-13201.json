An opposition party lawmaker in Germany\u2019s Parliament called for that, but the German government itself has not taken that position.\n\nAmerica\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has been in Berlin for a little less than a year and has been at odds with some German officials from the start.\n\nBut the claim that Germany has called for his removal isn\u2019t true, although it has been shared widely on social media. That claim came from the Twitter account of a user who describes himself as \u201cvery left\u201d and, on March 19, tweeted: \u201cIn a first, Germany is requesting the removal of the Trump appointed ambassador to Germany, RichardGrenell. They consider him to stoke racism and fascism on the country. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at, folks. The Germans want the American gone, because he\u2019s a Nazi.\u201d\n\nIt has been retweeted more than 23,000 times on Twitter and it was made into a meme that has been shared 13,000 times on Facebook. The Kerr County Democrats, in Kerrville, Texas, posted the text on their Facebook page, for example.\n\nBut Germany has not requested that Grenell be removed. Rather, Wolfgang Kubicki, a member of the Free Democrats, an opposition party in the German Parliament, said that the German foreign minister should consider declaring Grenell \u201cpersona non grata.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny US diplomat who acts like a high commissioner of an occupying power must learn that our tolerance also knows its limits,\u201d Kubicki reportedly said.\n\n\n\nThe comments from both members of Parliament were made in response to Grenell\u2019s criticism of Germany\u2019s plans for defense spending, which won\u2019t meet NATO spending goals, not because they \u201cconsider him to stoke racism and fascism,\u201d as the tweet claimed.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Grenell has sparked the ire of German politicians, though. In June 2018, Grenell said in an interview with the conservative news website Breitbart that he wanted to \u201cempower other conservatives throughout Europe.\u201d That prompted rebukes from some German politicians, including Martin Schulz, a member of the Social Democrats Party, who said, \u201cIf a German ambassador in Washington said, \u2018I\u2019m here to strengthen the Democratic Party,\u2019 he would be thrown out immediately.\u201d\n\nDespite the criticism, Grenell remained in his post.\n\nSo, while some German politicians have criticized Grenell, that\u2019s not the same as the German government formally requesting his removal.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGregor, Andrew James (@andrewjgregor). \u201cIn a first, Germany is requesting the removal of the Trump appointed ambassador to Germany, RichardGrenell.
