Violent crime rates had peaked in 1991, for reasons still debated, though that trend was not apparent when the bill passed. Nevertheless, Clinton toured around the country trying to take credit.\n\nThe crime bill had many provisions, such as giving states funds to hire an additional 100,000 police officers, but one part is especially important to this issue. The bill earmarked $8.7 billion over six years for states to build more prisons. About half of that was available to states that enacted \u201ctruth-in-sentencing\u201d laws, which curb paroles and required people convicted of violent crimes to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.\n\n\u201cFolks, let\u2019s get something straight. 90/92 of every 100 prisoners behind the bars is in state prison, not a federal prison. This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration. The only bill, that bill had $30 \u2014 it was $30 billion dollars. $10 billion went to making sure there was rehabilitation, that it was for prevention \u2014 that\u2019s what it was about. Secondly, the court, I made sure there was a set up in that law that said there were no more mandatories, except two that I had to accept. One was the President Clinton one of three strikes and you\u2019re out. It was of this entire bill. It included the Violence Against Women Act. It included the gun control efforts, as well as included \u2014 anyways I won\u2019t go into it, it\u2019s raining \u2014 but here\u2019s the deal. What happened is the mass incarceration incurred by the state setting mandatory sentences.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, responding to a protester, Clinton blamed the sentencing provisions in the law on Biden. \u201cVice President Biden . . . he was the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this crime bill,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden said, \u2018You can\u2019t pass this bill. The Republicans will kill it if you don\u2019t put more sentencing in.\u2019\u201d (The Biden campaign provided a news clip from 1994 in which Biden called the three-strikes provision \u201cwacko\u201d and reflective of the \u201ctough-on-crime attitude\u201d of Congress.)\n\n\u201cWhile the precise impact of the grant program is hard to quantify, the law\u2019s passage, and the concurrent or subsequent passage of at least 20 state \u2018truth-in-sentencing\u2019 laws, marked a turning point in the length of sentences served nationwide,\u201d she said, pointing to a 2012 Pew Center study of 36 states that found that the average length of stay for offenders released from prison in 2009 increased 36 percent from 1990, with nine states reporting increases of over 50 percent.\n\nThe Biden campaign also cited an Urban Institute study on the impact of the \u201ctruth-in-sentencing\u201d (TIS) provisions of the crime bill, which depending on how you read it either supports or undermines Biden. The study found that the 1994 law had no impact on whether 30 states adopted truth-in-sentencing laws. But the study also found that between 1995 and 1999, nine states adopted TIS laws for the first time, and another 21 states changed their TIS laws to comply with the crime bill\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe report, citing a General Accounting Office report also flagged by the campaign as well as a Justice Department report, said that federal funding was a key factor in five states and a partial factor in 10 more states. The grant program \u201ccontributed to incremental changes in sentencing laws in some states, largely by leading to laws that increased the percentage of sentence served. Second, it provided rewards for states whose TIS practices were already consistent with the federal grant criteria,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Urban Institute quoted a Justice Department official as being surprised by the states\u2019 level of interest in the grant program, considering how small the grants were compared to costs of long-term incarceration. It suggested that the main influence of the grant program was that it allowed states to appear tough on crime.
