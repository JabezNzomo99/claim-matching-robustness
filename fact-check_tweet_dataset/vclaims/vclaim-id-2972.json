And that candidate was Donald Trump.\n\nShah muddied that point in an interview with Fox News when he claimed the indictment shows the Russian efforts \u201cwere about sowing confusion in the electoral process and undermining the next president, not about supporting one candidate over the other.\u201d\n\nShah, Feb. 16: There\u2019s three main points that we see from these indictments. One, as you mentioned, they started \u2014 this plot started in 2014 before the president jumped in the race. And what we also saw is that they proved that there\u2019s no collusion. The biggest point that the president has been making since before this investigation even began. And the last point that this investigation \u2013 or rather, these indictments make clear, is that all these efforts were about sowing confusion in the electoral process and undermining the next president, not about supporting one candidate over the other. And so, really, when you see these efforts by Democrats, they\u2019re pushing this collusion conspiracy, what they are doing is doing the dirty work for the Russians, for them. The media and the Democrats, making false claims, are really pushing what the Russians want them to push.\n\nAs we have written, the indictment did not clear Trump or his campaign of colluding with the Russians. It said that no American was a knowing participant in the illegal activity outlined in the indictment, but the investigation is continuing into other activities allegedly carried out by the Russians.\n\nShah is partially correct that the indictment says the Russian efforts \u201cwere about sowing confusion in the electoral process.\u201d As the indictment put it, the Russian co-defendants \u201chad a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system.\u201d But Shah goes too far in saying the Russians efforts were \u201cnot about supporting one candidate over the other.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Russian organization\u2019s efforts to interfere in the American political process began in 2014. The group employed hundreds of people and spent millions of dollars from its hub in St. Petersburg, Russia to conduct what the group called \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America\u201d by exploiting \u201cdivisive U.S. political and social issues.\u201d The defendants used stolen identities and fake personas to pose as legitimate U.S. activists and set up social media accounts to engage in illegal political activity.\n\nIn May 2014, the Russian group had the stated goal of \u201cspread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d (The emphasis is ours.)\n\nIn a tweet on Feb. 17, Trump accused the \u201cFake News Media\u201d of ignoring that the origin of the group dated back to 2014, which Trump sarcastically noted was before he had even decided to run for president.\n\nThat\u2019s not accurate. News outlets such CNN, Washington Post and the New York Times all noted that the group was formed in 2014.\n\nBy 2016, the indictment states, the Russian group had turned its full attention to the presidential candidates. \u201cThey engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment states on page 17. The indictment says that on Feb. 10, 2016, the Internet Research Agency, a Russian online propaganda operation, circulated among its employees \u201can outline of themes for future content to be posted to organization-controlled social media accounts.\u201d Those responsible for posting content to social media accounts were told to \u201cuse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2013 we support them).\u201d\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Feb. 18, Sanders \u2014 who lost to Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary \u2014 said the Russians efforts on his behalf were intended to hurt Clinton.\n\nSanders, Feb. 18: At the end of my campaign when it appeared that Clinton was going to win, and certainly after she won the nomination, what the Russians were doing was flocking to Bernie Sanders Facebook sites, and they were saying to Bernie Sanders supporters, as they were by the way to Black Lives Matter supporters, people who were fighting for social justice. As they were saying to the Muslim community, if you voted for Sanders, you have to understand Hillary Clinton is crazy, she\u2019s a murderer, she is terrible, all kinds of horrible, horrible things, about Hillary Clinton.\n\nBy the general election, the group\u2019s efforts were clear and focused: to support Trump and oppose Clinton. According to the indictment, \u201cby early to mid-2016, Defendants\u2019 operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\u201cTrump Campaign\u201d) and disparaging Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nA sampling of election-related hashtags produced by the group illustrates its rooting interest: #Trump2016, #TrumpTrain, #MAGA, #IWontProtectHillary, and #Hillary4Prison. The group also created social media accounts that included \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d on Twitter and \u201cClinton FRAUDation\u201d and \u201cTrumpsters United\u201d on Facebook.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Russian defendants \u201cused false U.S. personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump.\u201d\n\nIn the latter half of 2016, well into the general election season, the Russians \u201cbegan to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d For example, just a few days before the election, the group purchased an Instagram ad that read, in part, \u201cChoose peace and vote for [Green Party candidate] Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\nA sampling of political ads purchased by the group between April 6, 2016 and Oct. 19 of 2016 also shows one-sided support for Trump/opposition to Clinton. Among them: \u201cI say no to Hillary Clinton / I say no to manipulation\u201d; \u201cDonald wants to defeat terrorism . . . Hillary wants to sponsor it\u201d; \u201cWe cannot trust Hillary to take care of our veterans!\u201d; and \u201cAmong all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists.\u201d (See examples on page 20 of the indictment.)\n\nDuring the general election, the indictment alleges, the Russian group also organized rallies in support of Trump and against Clinton.\n\nAfter the election, the Russian group went back to sowing discord on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\u201cAfter the election, the defendants allegedly staged rallies to support the president-elect, while simultaneously staging rallies to protest his election,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a Feb. 16 press conference announcing the indictment. \u201cFor example, the defendants organized one rally to support the president-elect and another rally to oppose him, both in New York, on the same day.\u201d\n\nHeld on Nov. 12, 2016, the pro-Trump rally organized by the Russians was designed to \u201cshow your support for President-Elect Donald Trump,\u201d while the anti-Trump rally was to show \u201cTrump is NOT my President,\u201d the indictment states. The group organized another rally entitled \u201cCharlotte Against Trump\u201d in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Nov. 19.\n\nIn other words, the Russians\u2019 efforts after the election were aimed, in part, at undermining the next president. Similarly, prior to the 2016 election, the indictment says the Russian organization\u2019s aim was to \u201cspread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\n\nBut during the 2016 campaign itself, the indictment says the pattern was clear: an organized effort to oppose Clinton and to support Trump.", "lang": "en"}
