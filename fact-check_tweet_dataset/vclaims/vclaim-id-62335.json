After all, it\u2019s not uncommon to see pieces of text incorrectly attributed to influential figures floating around social media. (Check out our ever-growing list of \u201cmisattributed\u201d articles.)\n\nThe above-displayed text, however, was actually written by Rabbi Michael Beals. This story was originally published on Joe Biden\u2019s Medium page back in September 2019, where it was preceded by the following introduction:\n\nWe\u2019re sharing stories directly from the people who truly know Joe and his character \u2014 from his family members to his colleagues to veterans he greeted at the White House. Meet Joe Biden through the eyes of those who know him best.\n\n Then, help build the campaign that\u2019s going to send him to White House.\n\nBeals, who has been with Delaware\u2019s Congregation Beth Shalom since 2004, confirmed to us that he was the author of this story, and assured us in an email that \u201cthe story is true.\u201d Beals also sent us the obituary for Sylvia Greenhouse, the woman whose death anchored this story, and told us that this was just one of several \u201cmenchy [sic] stories\u201d about Biden.\n\nIn 2019, Beals relayed a story about Biden attending a shiva minyan, a worship service following a death of a Jewish person. According to Beals, he was conducting the service for Greenhouse, a Delaware woman who was \u201cnot a person of means,\u201d when Biden quietly entered the room. Beals writes that he asked Biden why he attended the service, and that the then-senator responded that Greenhouse had been a frequent small donor to his political career.\n\nAn excerpt from Beals\u2019 story appears below. The full post can be read on Medium.\n\nWe assembled the ten elders together, and it was in this most humble of places that I began to lead the kaddish. Toward the end of the service, a door at the back of the laundry room opened, and who walks in but Senator Joe Biden, his head lowered, all by himself. I nearly dropped my prayer book in shock. Senator Biden stood quietly in the back of the room for the duration of the service.\n\n At the close of the kaddish, I walked over to him and asked the same question that must have been on everyone else\u2019s mind: \u201cSenator Biden \u2014 what are you doing here?\u201d And he said to me: \u201cListen, back in 1972, when I first ran for Senate, Mrs. Greenhouse gave $18 to my first campaign. Because that\u2019s what she could afford. And every six years, when I\u2019d run for reelection, she\u2019d give another $18. She did it her whole life. I\u2019m here to show my respect and gratitude.\u201d Now, the number 18 is significant in the Jewish faith \u2014 its numbers spell out the Hebrew word chai, as in \u201cto life, to life, l\u2019chayim!\u201d But it\u2019s also a humble amount. Joe Biden knew that. And he respected that. There were no news outlets at our service that day \u2014 no Jewish reporters or important dignitaries. Just a few elderly mourners in a basement laundry room. Joe Biden didn\u2019t come to that service for political gain. He came to that service because he has character. He came to that service because he\u2019s a mensch. And if we need anything right now when it comes to the leadership of our country \u2014 we need a mensch.", "lang": "en"}
