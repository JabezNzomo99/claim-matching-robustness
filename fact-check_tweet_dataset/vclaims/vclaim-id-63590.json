A Black Rifle Coffee Company spokesperson confirmed it is not affiliated with Black Rifle Company.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on May 1 an immediate ban on the sale and use of over 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, The Associated Press reported. The ban came roughly two weeks after a gunman killed 22 people in Nova Scotia.\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee Company tweeted on May 6 a screen grab of part of the list of banned firearms, saying, \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so @JustinTrudeau did you really ban our Fresh Roasted Freedom in Canada eh?\u201d The phrase \u201cBlack Rifle Company BRC15B\u201d is outlined in red in the screen grab tweeted by Black Rifle Coffee Company.\n\nThe tweet prompted reactions from social media users: one Twitter user said, \u201cOh. My. God. Canada banned coffee in its idiotic new gun ban,\u201d while a Facebook user screen grabbed the exchange and commented, \u201cLay off the crack Canada.\u201d\n\nDespite having similar names, Black Rifle Coffee Company is not the same as the Black Rifle Company that manufactures the firearm outlined in red. Black Rifle Coffee Company is a veteran-run American coffee company, whereas Black Rifle Company is a rifle manufacturer.\n\nThe new law makes no mention of coffee or the Black Rifle Coffee Company.
