However, the content of the video does not support the description in the blog.\n\nIn the 8-minute video, two different clips were merged showing VACC lawyer Jacinto \u201cJing\u201d Paras filing obstruction of justice, wiretapping, and kidnapping versus Hontiveros in the first part. The second half featured former justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre who was complaining about the senator's alleged violation of the anti-wiretapping law.\n\nThe claim was spotted on social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. The blog has been shared by 38 Facebook pages accumulating total interactions of over 9,000. Some of the pages which shared the claim are Sara Duterte for President 2022 Elections, Duterte Para sa Bayan, and President Rody Duterte Facebook Army.\n\nThe facts: The charges filed by the VACC against Hontiveros were not related to any PhilHealth issues but had to do with the Kian delos Santos case. (READ: Paras prepare slew of cases vs Hontiveros)\n\nIn September 2017, Paras accused the senator of kidnapping, failure to return a minor, and inducing a minor to abandon his home when she placed under her custody minor witnesses in the killing of Delos Santos.

The complaint involving the anti-wiretapping law also came after Hontiveros publicized in a privilege speech a photo of Aguirre's purported exchange of text messages with a certain \"Cong Jing,\" whom the senator believed to be Paras. The said photo was taken by a photojournalist during a Senate hearing on the Delos Santos case.

In August 2018, the claim saying that the Commission on Audit (COA) supposedly ordered the senator to return the agency's P163.85 million in bonuses was proven to be \"mixed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the website balitangupdates.blogspot.com has a disclaimer that says, \u201cThis site/blog shall not be responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by website users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in this website or by any technical or human error which may occur.\u201d \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
