She also said that she can\u2019t breathe without medical equipments, which are seen in the viral video.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The woman seen in the video is not the wife of Justin Trudeau but a COVID-19 patient from London.\n\nThe video is being shared like wildfire on social media. The caption of the viral video says, The Canadian PM's wife. For people who are still not taking it seriously.\n\nWith the help of keywords, we found several news reports regarding the video.\n\nA report by \"Daily Mail\" says it is the video of 39-year-old Tara Jane Langston who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 15. Tara made this video with her phone in the intensive care unit at Hillingdon Hospital in London, pleading others to take the deadly coronavirus seriously.\n\nAs per \"Business Insider\", since this video was made, Tara has recovered partially and has been moved out of ICU.\n\nSome of Tara's friends have also posted this video on Facebook.\n\nOn March 19, Justin Trudeau said in a tweet that his wife is better and they are working hard to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As a precautionary measure, the Canadian PM is also under the isolation period of 14 days after his wife tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the video of a COVID-19 patient from London is being passed off as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Fake WHO's warning of lockdown in India goes viral\n\nALSO WATCH| We need to practice social distancing: Health ministry", "lang": "en"}
