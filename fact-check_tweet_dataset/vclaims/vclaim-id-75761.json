So PolitiFact Oregon hit the road to check Duyck\u2019s claim.\n\nWe contacted county spokesman Stephen Roberts, who pointed us to documents that seem to support the assertion.\n\nThe last budget adopted before Duyck became board chairman in 2011, for instance, contained $6 million less for bicycle and pedestrian improvements than is budgeted in the current fiscal-year cycle.\n\nOf that, $3 million comes from Gain Share, a state program that compensates local governments for providing tax breaks to qualifying companies. \"This represents new dedicated bike/ped funding that did not exist before,\" Roberts wrote in an email.\n\nAn additional $2.7 million for bike/ped projects this year is coming from a special district formed years ago to resurface hundreds of miles of streets in the county\u2019s urban, unincorporated area. If incorporated, it would would be one of the largest cities in the state.\n\nIn September 2011, the Board of Commissioners approved Duyck\u2019s suggestion to modify the program to allow funding of \"safety improvements,\" including sidewalks. Twelve of 13 projects funded this year have been pedestrian improvements, according to county budget documents. \"This also represents new funding available for bike/ped improvements,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nThe final chunk of \"new\" money comes from the county\u2019s Minor Betterments program, an allocation of the county\u2019s road fund. The $500,000 available this year for bike/ped projects compares with $320,000 budgeted the year before Duyck became chairman, according to documents.\n\nTogether, those numbers show significantly more money is spent now for bike/ped improvements than before Duyck became chairman. But can he fairly say that money is \"more than at any time in the history of Washington County\"?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say that with authority, Roberts said, because a decade or more ago, total road project costs were the only figures recorded. Bike/ped work done as part of those projects was not broken out, he said.\n\n\"But the county has only gotten bigger,\" Roberts said. \"And in all typical projects we take on now, we estimate that 25 percent is bike/ped. Based on the numbers, it seems like an accurate statement.\"\n\nFor additional historical reference, we reviewed county spending on these projects going back to the boom years of 2004-05. That year\u2019s combined total of the top two sources for bike/ped money was the second-highest ever. Even so, the total still fell about $5 million short of this year\u2019s record-breaking amount.\n\nFinally, we called Commissioner Dick Schouten, an outspoken advocate of bike-friendly policies who shows up to most meetings on his bike. Of Duyck\u2019s claim, he said, \"I guess that\u2019s true in the sense we have some new programs and access to additional dollars we didn\u2019t have before.\"\n\nHe quibbled only with Duyck\u2019s use of the phrase \"under my watch.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure what that means, \u2018under my watch,\u2019\" Schouten said. \"He\u2019s one vote among five.\"\n\nIn addition, unlike in Multnomah County, the Washington County chair does not prepare the annual budget.\n\nWashington County board Chairman Andy Duyck, now running for re-election, claims that more money has been spent for bicycle and pedestrian improvements during his first term as chairman than at any time in Washington County history.\n\nBudget documents show that spending for such projects is now more than $6 million more than it was before Duyck became chairman.\n\nComparable figures from more than a decade ago aren\u2019t available because statistics specific to bike/ped projects weren\u2019t listed separately then. However, spending on bike/ped projects during the building-boom years of 2004-05 was $5 million less than current allotments.\n\nA fellow commissioner noted that Duyck didn\u2019t approve the spending allocations alone since it takes at least three votes for a budget proposal to win. We also note that while Duyck voted for the increases, his \"watch\" doesn\u2019t come with the power to write the proposals.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
