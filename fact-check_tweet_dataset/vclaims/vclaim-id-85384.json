Ossoff is just 30, but he had pitched himself as having had five years of experience as a \u201cformer national security aide\u201d and holding a \u201ctop-secret clearance.\u201d He has cut ads that show him standing in what appears to be a national security situation room or entering a vault assessed only by a code.\n\nThe soundbite above from the meet-and-greet \u2014\u201cI\u2019ve got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress. I held top secret security clearance.\u201d \u2014 is rather typical of the way Ossoff frames his experience as an aide for Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). As far as we can tell, there is always a period between a sentence about five years of national security experience and a sentence about having the security clearance.\n\nThat\u2019s important, because campaign manager Kennan Pontoni says that Ossoff held the security clearance for only five months, at the end of his job with Johnson. Johnson, who served on the Armed Services Committee, says Ossoff, his advisor on foreign affairs and military issues, obtained the clearance because he was otherwise prevented from attending briefings with Johnson. But then Ossoff left Capitol Hill to move to London to pursue a master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics.\n\nOur antenna went up when we looked at his LinkedIn page. This showed him receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009 from Georgetown University. It also listed him as \u201cLegislative Correspondent & Systems Administrator\u201d from 2007 to 2009 \u2014in other words, a part-time job while he attended college \u2014 and then shows only three years as a \u201csenior legislative assistant\u201d working on military issues from 2009 to 2012. (He was also Johnson\u2019s campaign manager from April to October 2010, so effectively he was doing full-time legislative work for 2 \u00bd years.)\n\nJohnson, in an interview, insists this is true. He said that Ossoff had become a campaign spokesman when Johnson was given little chance of beating an incumbent in the 2006 election. \u201cHe was 18 years old but wiser than his years,\u201d Johnson said. (Johnson credits Ossoff\u2019s then-pioneering use of Facebook as essential to his unexpected victory.) By the time Johnson took the oath of office, Ossoff \u201cwas closer to me than anyone else in the office. He did a lot more than a title would indicate.\u201d\n\nDaraka Satcher, Johnson\u2019s chief of staff at the time, said that \u201cI know it looks a little weird,\u201d but Ossoff, as a part-timer, really did have governance over international issues. \u201cForeign affairs is not a huge issue on the Hill. It is mostly domestic issues, especially for a first-year member,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat is why we felt comfortable having him do that. I know something about foreign affairs so I provided a little oversight.\u201d\n\nNow, a nonbinding resolution like this is not a particularly heavy lift. There was a companion resolution in the Senate, and the language in the House version is virtually similar. The debate on the House floor consisted of a handful of speeches, all in favor, and it was passed on a voice vote. But it does indicate that Ossoff was actually involved in foreign affairs even as a part-time worker.\n\nOn balance, it seems reasonable for Ossoff to say he spent five years working on national security issues in Congress, even though at least two years of that period overlapped with college work. So the GOP ads mocking him for including his college years as part of experiences are off base. The passage of the Uganda resolution demonstrates he was doing more than just answering phone calls in the office.", "lang": "en"}
