The country\u2019s national and provincial elections will be held on 8 May.\n\nTaglined \u201cone South Africa for all\u201d, the manifesto contains a number of claims about the state of the country.\n\ndefines the youth as people \u201cbetween the ages of 14 and 35\u201d.\n\nAnd according to the agency\u2019s acting chief director for labour statistics, Malerato Mosiane, \u201cbenchmarking is done using five-year age groups, so the 35-year-olds will be in the 35- to 39-year age group\u201d.\n\nMosiane said the unemployment rate for people aged 15 to 34 was 38.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 \u2013 the latest available data.\n\nThis is according to the official definition of \u201cunemployed\u201d: people without work who are still looking for work or trying to start a business.\n\nUsing the expanded definition \u2013 which includes people who are not actively looking for work \u2013 half (50.1%) were unemployed, Mosiane said.\n\n, the DA claims that South Africa\u2019s youth unemployment is among the highest in the world.\n\nBut different countries use different definitions of \u201cyouth\u201d.\n\nAnd comparing unemployment in different countries is also complicated by factors such as different data collection methods.\n\nThe DA said it based its claim on British news magazine the Economist\u2019s Pocket World in Figures, which\n\nHowever, these stats were based on 2017 numbers, which is why the statement in our manifesto places South Africa amongst others globally with high youth unemployment statistics,\u201d DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cAs employment stats are highly dynamic it is not inconceivable that countries could move a rank or two depending on labour market shocks.\u201d\n\nas people between the ages of 15 and 24 years.\n\n, a UN agency, provides data for this age group in 189 countries, territories and areas.\n\nThere are many reasons for South Africa\u2019s high youth unemployment, and many of them are connected. That\u2019s according to Ariane De Lannoy, associate professor in the\n\nat the University of Cape Town.\n\nDown at the household level, De Lannoy said, South Africa\u2019s past \u2013 where the education system and labour market discriminated against black people \u2013 lives on. \u201cWe have young people that live in households where no one else is employed.\u201d\n\nAs a result, they may struggle to come to grips with the job market.\n\nAt level of the country as a whole, the education system\n\nprovide the advanced skills required by the labour market, she said.\n\nA recently released report on youth unemployment by the\n\nalso says the education system is an underlying cause of youth unemployment.\n\u2022 None The small difference between minimum wages and median wages, which discourages companies from employing people without experience. \u201cWhy do so, when an experienced worker costs about the same amount?\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cToo many South Africans live in places where it is hard to find a job or expensive to get to and from work.\u201d \n\n\n\nof hundreds of journal articles and government documents related to youth unemployment\n\n, said there wasn\u2019t a \u201csingle, simple\u201d solution to the problem.\n\nIt should be tackled by society as a whole \u2013 by the government, businesses and other employers, as well as by communities, where people could help each other get access to knowledge and opportunities.\n\nWhile country comparisons of youth unemployment data have limitations, the available data does put South Africa among the worst performers.\n\nAs testament to its achievements, the DA\n\nthat \u201c50% of all new jobs in South Africa, in the past year, were created in the Western Cape\u201d.\n\n, released on 23 February 2019, said these jobs had been created between the third quarter of 2017 (July to September) and the third quarter of 2018.\n\nThe DA was elected as the Western Cape\u2019s government in May 2009.\n\nQuarterly Labour Force Survey for the\n\nthat 95,000 net jobs were created in the Western Cape in the previous year. A total of 188,000 net jobs were created countrywide.\n\nThe DA\u2019s claim is therefore correct for the period between Q3 2017 and Q3 2018.\n\nAfrica Check that this kind of calculation \u201cmay be confusing\u201d. But Yves Perardel, a statistician at the\n\n, told Africa Check that the DA\u2019s calculation was methodologically correct.\n\n\u201cThis is a standard approach globally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe DA\u2019s claim is correct for the period given. But when the party released its manifesto, more recent data was available. Stats SA released figures for the\n\nThis more recent data shows that 358,000 jobs were created in South Africa\n\nthe fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2018. But only 29,000 of these jobs were created in the Western Cape.\n\nThis is 8.1% of all jobs created in the last year, significantly lower than the 50% claimed by the DA.\n\nThe largest share of net jobs were created in Gauteng (48%), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (37.7%), Limpopo (16.5%) and the Western Cape (8.1%).\n\nThe DA continues to make the claim as the election approaches, despite more recent data being available.\n\nthat \u201cmore than half of all new jobs created in [South Africa] in the last financial year were created in the [Western Cape]\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is important to use the latest data when your purpose is to describe the most up-to-date situation in the labour market,\u201d Morn\u00e9 Oosthuizen, deputy director of the\n\n\u201cThat way, you can be reasonably confident that the current situation is not materially different from the situation you might have described using older data.\u201d\n\nBut if the purpose was to show how well the provincial economy had been managed, it would have been better to use data covering a longer time period, Oosthuizen said. This way, the DA could have avoided being accused of cherry picking, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember that local and provincial economies, while all exposed to the same forces in terms of things like exchange rates... may react slightly differently to these same forces\u201d. They had their own unique characteristics, weather conditions and labour market dynamics, Oosthuizen said.\n\nA province may see rapid jobs growth in one quarter and may seem responsible for a large share of the total increase in employment, but this can easily be reversed in the next quarter.\n\n\u201cAs an example, in periods where mining has done particularly poorly and has shed jobs rapidly, the Western Cape is typically shielded from the type of job losses observed in provinces where mining is more important,\u201d Oosthuizen said.\n\n\u201cWhen mining recovers and adds jobs, the situation may be reversed.\u201d\n\n, told Africa Check that job creation was largely driven by \u201cnational and international conditions and national policies\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Western Cape inherited the best infrastructure in the country plus none of the former so-called \u2018homelands\u2019, so they started with a far lower jobless rate and a much more dynamic economy.\u201d\n\nThe DA relied on outdated data when it claimed that \u201c50% of all new jobs in South Africa, in the past year, were created in the Western Cape.\u201d The most recent data shows that the province accounted for 8% of net jobs between the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe ratio in this claim does not reflect the current situation because it is based on numbers that date from the year of the previous general election.\n\nDA spokesperson Solly Malatsi told us that the statistic was contained in the\n\nThe SAIRR, in turn, sourced this number from the work of the\n\nfrom the Health Systems Trust puts the number of public clinics in March last year at\n\n. But because of the increase in the population size since 2014, the ratio in the claim is out of date.\n\nresidents last year. This would mean that there was one clinic for every 18,114 people at the time.\n\nCandy Day, technical specialist at the Health Systems Trust, told Africa Check/City Press that the number of clinics cited in the SA Health Review applied to government-operated clinics (not private clinics) and excluded mobile and satellite clinics.\n\nShe said the source of the count was the\n\n, which is used by the national and provincial departments of health, and contains a categorisation of health facilities.\n\n\u201cIn general, we do our best to provide the summary statistics, but, as with all data, there are many nuances and areas where errors or interpretation can arise,\u201d she said.\n\nPopulation not the only consideration\n\nHe said population wasn\u2019t the only determinant of where and how many healthcare facilities government provides. In some cases, the ratio of facilities to people would be \u201cirrelevant\u201d.\n\nMaja gave the example of the sparsely populated Northern Cape, where a small community of about 1,000 people would need access to a primary healthcare facility.\n\nConversely, he said, it was \u201cnot feasible\u201d to have a facility every 2km\n\nin densely populated areas like Soweto in Gauteng.\n\n\u201cIn these cases, you would have primary healthcare service delivery facilities that would have up to 30 consulting rooms to enable the provision of services to the catchment population.\u201d\n\nThe DA also claims that the country\u2019s clinic-to-person ratio falls short of a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 1:10,000.\n\nthe party provided in support of this only states that the number and distribution of health facilities per 10,000 people is a core indicator for monitoring service delivery.\n\nWe were unable to find a WHO representative who was aware of the existence of the purported guideline for clinics cited by the DA in its\n\nIn 2017, Phosa reportedly said that \u201c\n\nWe asked Phosa, through his office manager, what he had based his statement on, but received no response by the time of publication.\n\nPhosa was, however, not the first to make a claim about a land reform failure rate of about 90%.\n\nIn 2010, then minister of rural development and land reform Gugile Nkwinti\n\n: \u201cWe have not talked about the revenue which the state has lost because 5.9 million hectares of farms that were active and acquiring revenue for the state were handed over to people, and more than 90% of those are not functional \u2013 they are not productive and therefore the state loses revenue.\u201d\n\nHowever, Professor Ben Cousins of the\n\nat the University of the Western Cape told Africa Check/City Press that, at the time, Nkwinti\u2019s claim was not backed by research, and the same is true for the DA\u2019s current claim.\n\nAsked how the party defined success, Malatsi said it applied to land redistribution projects where \u201cbeneficiaries have managed to create economically viable businesses once land has been redistributed\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cupon reflection\u201d, it appeared that the actual failure rate, based on Phosa\u2019s claim, was 90% instead of 92%, but the party believed the \u201coverall narrative remains correct\u201d.\n\nThe DA conceded however that, outside of the completion rate for land restitution claims, \u201cthere has been no attempt by the national government to conduct a proper audit into the success or failure of land reform projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cDefining success and failure depends on the measure you use to assess impact,\u201d stated a\n\non the extent to which land reform projects had improved beneficiaries\u2019 income and livelihoods.\n\nThis number, he told us, was a \u201crough estimate\u201d in the absence of more reliable data. It is based on research published between 2005 and 2013, including:\n\u2022 None of 43 land reform projects in North West, published in 2005, found that production was stable or had increased in 56% of cases.\n\u2022 None In a 2008 national survey of Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development projects (2001 to 2006), 49% were identified as stable or showing improvement, according to the above-mentioned Plaas fact check\n\u2022 None project census of 117 redistribution and restitution projects in the Vhembe and Capricorn districts of Limpopo showed evidence of activity (some production, leasing or joint ventures) in 44% of cases. The research was done from 2007 and the results were published in 2013. \n\n\n\n, which covered the four years from April 1 2009 to March 31 2013, set out to determine whether a sample of land reform projects in the province was successful.\n\nDA spokesperson Solly Malatsi told us the latest audit report, covering 2014 to this year, was not available when the\n\nThe 135 projects that were rated as successful or unsuccessful represented just more than half of the 246 provincial projects assisted through two farmer-support programmes.\n\n\u2013 are funded by the national government and implemented by provinces.\n\nEighty-four of the projects were deemed successful as they scored between 53% and 100% based on 39 criteria. These included the ability to feed the household, whether the project was viable or profitable and whether the farm was used to its full potential.\n\n\u201cSuccessful\u201d projects made up 62% of the sample of 135 and not of all supported projects.\n\nWhat proportion the 135 rated projects make up of all land reform farms in the province is not known.\n\nAs the DA\u2019s claim relates to farms and not projects, we asked the Western Cape government if the two were synonymous.\n\nBianca Capazorio, spokesperson for the province's head of economic opportunities (which includes agriculture), said: \u201cTechnically, they are not the same thing. A land reform project is a project that is on a land reform farm.\"\n\n\u201cHowever, there are instances in the province where there is more than one farmer on a land reform farm, and they are deemed to be two separate entities.\u201d\n\nCapazorio could not say whether the 246 projects from which the sample was selected represented all land reform farms in the province at the time.\n\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know and we believe that the department of rural development and land reform doesn\u2019t have sufficient data on the numbers either. The 246 on our list are either farms that we have been alerted to by the department, or are farms we have supported or that have approached us for support.\u201d\n\nShe could also not say how many land reform farms had been redistributed in the province since 1994, saying that land reform was the mandate of the department of rural development and land reform, which \u201cis also the record keeper\u201d.\n\nThe summary report on the audit, by urban and rural development planning company\n\n, identifies commodity support as a contributing factor to the success of land reform in the province. However, no mention is made of equity share schemes, which was a key success factor mentioned in the DA\u2019s claim.\n\nBased on Phosa\u2019s statement, the DA claimed that \u201cthe national government\u2019s failure rate of land reform projects is currently standing at 92%\u201d.\n\nWe asked the department of rural development and land reform for comment on the DA\u2019s claim, but it did not respond by the time of publication.\n\nThe DA claims that 62% of \u201call\u201d land reform farms in the Western Cape are successful. However, the audit on which the claim is based did not review all land reform farms in the province. In fact, the provincial government does not know how many land reform farms there are. The 62% only applies to 135 projects and to a period of four years. Furthermore, the definition of success applied in the manifesto is not standardised.", "lang": "en"}
