The flyer is fake, it was not issued by the Roseburg VA and health experts told AFP the advice it contains is misleading.\n\nImportant announcement - coronavirus,\u201d begins a message that AFP was first alerted to by a reader who received it via Facebook messenger on March 17, 2020. The notice, which was also shared publicly on Facebook here, here, here and here, goes on to make unfounded claims about the resilience of the novel coronavirus. It also offers misleading information about COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nSeveral of the Facebook posts unequivocally show that those who shared the COVID-19 information mistakenly believed the flyer and the guidance it contained was genuine.\n\n\u201cThis is not official Roseburg VA Health Care System, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance,\u201d Tim Parish, Public Affairs Officer for the Roseburg VA Health Care System, told AFP by email.\n\nThe Oregon VA hospital system also used its official Facebook page to warn against sharing the document:\n\nGenuine updates from the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding COVID-19 can be found here.\n\nParish also said: \u201cClinical staff are available to provide 24/7 virtual care and support, including nurse advice and triage. This service is available at no cost to Veterans enrolled for VA health care.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check had previously identified the same misleading coronavirus advice being falsely attributed to Stanford Health Care and the UN\u2019s Children\u2019s agency (UNICEF).\n\nExperts caution that too little peer reviewed research has been carried out on the novel coronavirus to make the specific claims being shared.\n\nFor example, the misleading message claims the novel coronavirus dies at temperatures above 26/27 degrees, but the CDC states on its information page: \u201cIt is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization also said: \u201cFrom the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 flyer also makes false claims about the resilience of the novel coronavirus on different surfaces.\n\nA US government funded study was published on March 17, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine. AFP reported that the new coronavirus was detectable for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard.\n\n\u200bAFP Fact Check is focused on combating misinformation about COVID-19.
