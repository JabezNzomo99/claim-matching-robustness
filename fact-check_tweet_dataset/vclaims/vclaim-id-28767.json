The CityKey cards do not allow noncitizens to vote; that is still illegal.\n\nBefore Chicago rolled out a new municipal ID program last spring, some erroneously purported that the CityKey IDs would allow noncitizens to vote.\n\nThat false claim has resurfaced online in recent weeks through viral posts on Facebook.\n\n\u201cChicago now has City ID Cards which allow illegal immigrants to vote in local, state & federal elections (which is illegal),\u201d the posts read, before going on to accuse Democrats of \u201ccolluding with foreigners to interfere in our elections.\u201d\n\nThe CityKey program officially launched in April 2018, about a year after Chicago\u2019s City Council authorized it. City officials said the new, optional IDs, available regardless of immigration status, would be of use to noncitizens, the homeless and other groups that may otherwise face difficulty accessing government IDs. The IDs allow cardholders to sign leases, obtain marriage certificates and access discounts in the city, and they double as transit and library cards.\n\nIt\u2019s true that they can also be used to register to vote. But the city\u2019s Board of Election Commissioners pointed out in a March 2018 statement that voter-registration applications require applicants to attest that they are U.S. citizens. The applications also note potential fines and penalties if false information is provided.\n\n\u201cBy law, non-citizens may NOT register to vote or cast a ballot in any local, state or federal election conducted by the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCity officials have repeatedly said that the CityKey ID program does not change that. In other words, it has no effect on state or federal laws requiring that voters be U.S. citizens.\n\nSeparately, Chicago Public Schools do hold their own elections for Local School Councils \u2014 bodies that represent each school \u2014 and noncitizen parents have been permitted to participate in that process since the 1980s.\n\nBut noncitizens would be committing voter fraud if they used a CityKey ID to vote in any local, state or federal election conducted by the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nChason, Rachel. \u201cNon-citizens can now vote in College Park, Md.\u201d Washington Post. 13 Sept 2017.\n\nChicago City Council. \u201cO2017-1950, Amendment of Municipal Code Title 2 by modifying Sections 2-12-010 and 2-160-065, and adding new Section 2-176-010 regarding establishment of Municipal Identification Card program.\u201d (as passed by City Council 19 Apr 2017.)\n\n\u201cCity Clerk Valencia and Mayor Emanuel Officially Launch the Chicago CityKey Program.\u201d Press release, Chicago Office of the City Clerk. 26 Apr 2018.\n\nSpencer, Saranac Hale. \u201cNoncitizens Get Narrow Access to Polls in San Francisco.\u201d FactCheck.org. 26 Jul 2018.\n\n\u201cStatement regarding IDs that may be used for voter registration.\u201d Press release, Chicago Board of Election Commissioners. 21 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
