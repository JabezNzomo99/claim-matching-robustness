However, such a post was not visible on her page on Sept. 24, which means we cannot verify that it originated there, though it is possible the post had been deleted or removed from public view by then.\n\nWhatever the origins of Potter\u2019s post, the images contained in the collage were either doctored, did not show Thunberg, or included a misleading description.\n\nThe above image does not show Thunberg. It was taken during a Quran recital contest hosted by Isis members in Aleppo, Syria, in 2013, as we outlined in an earlier fact check article.\n\nThis image does show Thunberg, but the face of financier and philanthropist George Soros has been digitally superimposed onto the body of the man standing next to her. The original photograph actually pictured former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and was posted to Twitter by Thunberg in December 2018:\n\nThe doctored image was created by the French website SecretNews, which presents its content as satire, as part of an Aug. 28 article with the headline (translated), \u201cGreta Thunberg is the granddaughter of left-wing billionaire George Soros.\u201d Others, apparently unaware of the \u201csatire\u201d label applied to all SecretNews content, have mistakenly understood that article to be genuine and promulgated the false claim that Thunberg and Soros were family relatives:\n\nThe underlying image in this meme was the only one of the three photographs that was authentic, unedited, and also showed Thunberg. She posted it to her Twitter account in July 2019 as part of a campaign to promote the band The 1975, which featured a speech by Thunberg and was set to be the opening track on The 1975\u2019s forthcoming album \u201cNotes on a Conditional Form.\u201d\n\nThe original photograph showed the band\u2019s lead singer Matt Healy sitting next to Thunberg, who wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cAntifascist All Stars\u201d:\n\nOpposing fascism or wearing an \u201cAntifascist All Stars\u201d T-shirt does not necessarily make one a member or supporter of \u201cAntifa,\u201d a frequently misunderstood and misused term that describes a movement of typically militant and sometimes violent left-wing activists in the United States and beyond.\n\nDespite those nuances, Thunberg appears to have received criticism from some quarters for her decision to wear the T-shirt, and she eventually deleted the original photograph from her social media account. In a subsequent tweet, she offered an explanation that made it clear she had intended only to express her opposition to fascism, and that she rejected the use of violence:\n\nGiven the inherent ambiguity of meaning in wearing the T-shirt, as well as Thunberg\u2019s subsequent explanation and deletion of her tweet, it is difficult to support the characterization of the photograph contained in the meme, which claimed Thunberg had \u201caligned\u201d herself with Antifa.\n\nThe description of Antifa as a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d is also questionable. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not currently list Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, but the summer of 2019 saw increasing calls for such a designation.\n\nIn July, Republican Senators Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) and Ted Cruz (Texas) introduced a U.S. Senate resolution calling for \u201cgroups and organizations across the country who act under the banner of Antifa to be designated as domestic terrorist organizations.\u201d In August, President Donald Trump warned, in a tweet that \u201cMajor consideration is being given to naming Antifa an \u2018organization of terror.'\u201d\n\nAside from the lack of any official designation, no fixed, universally accepted definition of \u201cterrorist\u201d or \u201cterrorist organization\u201d exists, so the question of whether Antifa \u2014 which is more a transnational movement than a traditional, hierarchical organization \u2014 should be labeled as such is ultimately a matter for subjective argument.", "lang": "en"}
