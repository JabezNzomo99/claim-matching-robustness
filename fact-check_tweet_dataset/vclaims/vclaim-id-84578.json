He shared his happiness regarding being appointed as a Minister on his Twitter account. Over the course of six tweets, he thanked the Prime Minister, people from his Uttar Kannada constituency, BJP President Amit Shah and the party itself. However, as one scrolls down his Twitter timeline, some of his tweets raise grave question marks over his appointment as a Minister.\n\nIn the image above, not only is the Minister pushing a fake narrative, he seems to have an issue with a man and a woman having a friendly relationship. Report by ABP News on this issue states, \u201cWe found that the woman in photograph was not a teacher but a research scholar named Somya Mani Tripathi. The woman had shared the picture on her Facebook profile, in which Kanhaiya and she were sharing a friendly laughter. She had uploaded the pictures on March 5. Some miscreants took out the picture and shared the derogatory post. She later clarified on her Facebook post that she didn\u2019t find laughing with her friend wrong.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s tweeted multiple times attacking JNU. He also retweeted a tweet which said, \u201cBring in Army and Crush these A**holes\u201d while referring to students of Ramjas college. So, we now have a Union Minister who wants to \u2018crush\u2019 rebellious students with the Army.\n\nIslam needs to be held by its horn, Church is just a commercially operated Religious conversion platform, and if not for Buddhism, Akhand Bharat could have been realized \u2013 These are his views on religion in a multi-cultural, multi-religious country like India of which he is a Central Minister now.\n\nHere are his views on Ayodhya.\n\nFurther, in a press conference, he had stated, \u201cTill the time Islam exists in the world, no one can stop terrorism. If we want to keep a place like Bhatkal peaceful, then we should throw Islam away from this world and we should shut Islam.\u201d\n\nPresstitute is a derogatory term which is essential a combination of Press+Prostitute. The Minister uses it routinely on his Twitter timeline.\n\nPhoto captions are usually added by editors based on feedback from photographers. Here the Minister holds Barkha Dutt responsible for a photo caption while referring to her as presstitute.\n\nIn another tweet, he was found outraging about a fake news report about Dawood Ibrahim being killed and suggesting that \u201cpresstitutes and bollywood actresses\u201d would feel tremendous loss. Why attack only actresses and not actors even if you are livid about Bollywood\u2019s connection with Dawood?\n\nHe also wants journalist Rana Ayyub under surveillance for her \u2018anti-national\u2019 misdeeds. This tweet came a few days after Rana Ayyub\u2019s book Gujarat Files was released.\n\nIn this tweet, Mr Hegde refers to Indira Gandhi as Maimuna Begaum, a name that fake news sites like PostCard News often use for Indira Gandhi.\n\nAssociating a Muslim name to political leader is not limited to Indira Gandhi. In another tweet, he refers to Mamta Banerjee as Mumtaz.\n\nAddressing Indira Gandhi as Maimuna Begaum and Mamta Banerjee as Mumtaz is what trolls on Twitter do. Here we have a Union Minister doing the same. Also, it yet again shows his mindset towards Muslims since he thinks that addressing a person with a Muslim name brings down his/her character.\n\nIn real life too, Mr Hegde\u2019s career hasn\u2019t been short of controversies. Recently, he was caught on camera thrashing a Doctor at Karnataka Hospital as reported by NewsMinute.\n\nIt is shocking that a person with so much apparent hate for various religions has been chosen to be a minister in a multi-cultural country like ours. It is shocking that a man who retweets tweets wanting to \u2018crush\u2019 students and thinks that a woman laughing with a man is to be looked down upon has chosen to be a minister. Out of 280 BJP MPs, is this the talent that PM Modi has \u2018thoughtfully\u2019 chosen to be the Minister of Skill Development?", "lang": "en"}
