It is evil itself\" and then promptly deleted the tweet. People are saying this is a confession of a gigantic coverup by the government and Nasa also connected to the Flat Earth theorizers.http://beforeitsnews.com/conspiracy-theories/2016/12/a-mysterious-tweet-by-astronaut-buzz-aldrin-2478714.html\n\nOn 7 December 2016, conspiracy web site SuperStation95 published a post reporting that 86-year-old astronaut Buzz Aldrin (who had just been evacuated from the South Pole due to health concerns) had mysteriously and alarmingly tweeted a photograph of a mountain along with a chilling comment:\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are all in danger. It is evil itself.\u201d and showed a photograph of a pyramid located at the South Pole as show here. Mr. Aldrin seems to be referring to this object, as seen in an serial photo from Google Earth \u2026 As has been reported by worldwide media, US Secretary of State John Kerry recently traveled to the South Pole, allegedly to become better informed about \u201cClimate Change.\u201d Kerry was the highest ranking US government official ever to visit the South Pole, and his visit struck many as unusual. Few saw any purpose whatsoever to sending America\u2019s top Diplomat to the farthest reaches of the earth to see \u2026 ice. Now, with Buzz Aldrin\u2019s tweet, and its strange deletion, folks are wondering if sending America\u2019s top Diplomat to no-man\u2019s land, perhaps had something to do with Diplomacy after all. Is there some entity there with which we need Diplomatic contact? \u2026 If so, why did Buzz Aldrin warn that we are all in danger? Why did he call it \u201cEvil itself?\u201d\n\nThe blog post, which was a pparently inspired by a 6 December 2016 thread on the conspiracy forum Before It\u2019s News, cited two tweets as a first and second source for the photograph. One included an embedded video which referenced the SuperStation95 post as its source, making it useless as supporting confirmation:\n\nImages of the purported tweet circulated widely after 7 December 2016, but there were a number of visual cues the graphic was altered:\n\nFor contrast, here\u2019s a screenshot taken of a then-recent tweet sent via Aldrin\u2019s @TheRealBuzz account:\n\nThe first tweet did not have a date, share count, number of replies, number of favorites, or number of retweets; all could be used to determine whether Twitter\u2019s archive backed the claims made by the sites. Additional irregularities existed in the background display of Aldrin\u2019s account: The suspect tweet didn\u2019t display in the same manner it did in our screenshot. Aldrin\u2019s account data was oddly arranged, and his blue verification checkmark was missing.\n\nSuperStation95 did not provide a date, time, or sturdy source for the screenshot of the tweet. Using Twitter\u2019s \u201cadvanced search\u201d tool, we were able to determine that no retweets or \u201cmodified tweets\u201d (a form of copying and pasting a retweet) existed anywhere on Twitter. The first verbal mention of the purported tweet appeared on 8 December 2016, one day after the blog post linked above.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just skeptics questioning the authenticity of the claim. YouTube\u2019s SecureTeam (the self-described \u201cnumber one source for breaking news and exposure of the alien phenomenon\u201d) examined the claim, quickly dismissing it as a forgery:\n\nAfter appearing in late 2015, Superstation95 began using what were often legitimate tragedies or unfortunate events (such as Buzz Aldrin\u2019s evacuation from Antarctica in December 2016) with falsified and often frightening details. Among the most prominent were claims that a large group of Muslim men had fired randomly upon campers and hikers in California, Fukushima radiation caused severe mutations in ocean-dwelling creatures, cargo ships mysteriously ground to a halt signaling nothing short of an imminent global economic catastrophe, a deadly Las Vegas strip car crash involved a driver shouting \u201c Allahu Akbar ,\u201d the San Bernardino shooting was provoked by pork served at a holiday party shortly before the massacre, the Earth\u2019s \u201c magnetosphere \u201d inexplicably collapsed for two hours, a (nonexistent) suicide note left by a genuinely deceased ICE agent revealed impending FEMA camp implementation and mass enslavement, and that articles about the Orlando shooting appeared on Google News hours before the attack. Although the pieces sometimes contained details of real-life events, the claims were always willfully distorted to peddle a false and upsetting conclusion.\n\nSuperstation95\u2018s opportunistic leveraging of tragedy has never borne out as the real thing, despite the innumerable grandiose claims made since the site\u2019s inception. However, despite them, no one has yet gone to FEMA camp, the global economy has not melted down, the magnetosphere caused no space-based catastrophes, and no hikers were reported injured or dead as a result of roving Muslim shooters.", "lang": "en"}
