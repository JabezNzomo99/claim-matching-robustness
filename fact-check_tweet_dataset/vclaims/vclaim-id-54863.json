The video appears to have been taken in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced April 16 that the state\u2019s stay-at-home order will be extended until at least May 15, asking people to stay home as much as possible. Under the original executive order, all nonessential businesses had to close, and all nonessential gatherings canceled, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPosted on Facebook on March 29, the video purportedly shows Brooklyn residents singing the song \u201cJuicy\u201d by late rapper The Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls, while under quarantine in their homes. Its caption reads, \u201cWowwwww. Brooklyn!!! This will give you chills. The entire good rapping Biggie.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s claim is false, however. There are no people visible singing in the video, and many of the windows in the surrounding apartment buildings appear to be closed.

He paid tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. by having the DJ play the songs \u201cJuicy\u201d and \u201cOne More Chance,\u201d according to MTV.\n\nNor was the video taken in Brooklyn. The view of Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum at the beginning of the video indicates that it was actually taken in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, according to Reuters.\n\nWhile the video doesn\u2019t show a real community sing-along, people across New York City did join together on April 16 to sing Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York\u201d from their windows, balconies and yards. The citywide sing-along came after the nightly 7 p.m. clapping salute to health care workers fighting the coronavirus on the frontlines, according to CBS 2 New York.", "lang": "en"}
