He repeated the claim five days later, according to our database of Trump\u2019s sketchy statements. Then, nearly a month after that, Trump\u2019s number grew to 70,000. (\u201cWe\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization,\u201d he said on April 18, 2017.)\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing industry employed 17.18 million workers at the end of 2000, a net loss of 120,000 from 17.3 million at the end of 1970, he said. \u201cBy comparison, in December of 2007, before the start of the Great Recession, manufacturing employment was down to 13,750,000, a drop of 3,430,000 jobs in just seven years,\u201d Baker said.\n\nSetting aside the number of manufacturing jobs, their share relative to the total U.S. workforce has been in decline since the end of World War II. In January 1944, they made up 38.5 percent of U.S. non-farm employment, but in February 2018, they accounted for 8.5 percent, according to BLS data.\n\nWhen nations began to lift trade barriers in the 1980s and 1990s, few predicted that China\u2019s then-sleepy economy was on its way to becoming an industrial colossus. China\u2019s economic boom was a shock to the system that upended economists\u2019 consensus view on the effects of trade, according to \u201cThe China Shock,\u201d a 2016 study by Autor and economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the University of Zurich and the University of California at San Diego.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, China idled many state-owned manufacturing enterprises, moving toward compliance with WTO provisions that sanction state subsidies for domestic industries,\u201d Autor and co-authors David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson wrote. \u201cCapital and labor were then reallocated from smaller, less productive state-owned companies to privately owned manufacturing plants, raising productivity and output in the sector. . . . Joining the WTO also forced China to phase out requirements that had obligated many private establishments to export through state intermediaries. Such restrictions constitute barriers to export, which the WTO forbids expressly.\u201d\n\nThis is not a consensus view among economists. Baker says, \u201cAutomation is productivity growth. We\u2019ve been seeing it forever, it is not a new story. If anything, the pace has slowed in the last dozen years, not sped up, so the people who place the blame on automation are being misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cAutomation is certainly one factor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was also broadly a period of slow economic growth in the U.S., and that may have depressed demand for manufacturing, among other things. In truth, aside from the China Shock, it\u2019s hard to think of what large, sudden change in the U.S. economy or global economy could otherwise account for the implosion of U.S. manufacturing employment.\u201d\n\nThe economists we spoke to agree with Trump\u2019s overall argument that China\u2019s industrial rise caused millions of job losses in the United States and thousands of factory closures. The president accurately says 60,000 factories shut down since 2001, but he goes too far in claiming that 6 million jobs were lost since China joined the WTO. It\u2019s more like 4.3 million to 4.7 million.\n\nThere\u2019s no definitive estimate of how many of these jobs were lost, or how many of these factories closed, specifically because of China. The research on this question is limited, indicating that China had an outsized impact but that there were other factors at play, such as automation.", "lang": "en"}
