The posts contain references to Sri Lankan Muslims converting to Hinduism. The photos are being used in a misleading context; they have been taken from news reports about the mosque\u2019s destruction that do not mention Hinduism; local police told AFP that \u201cno religious conversions took place\u201d.\n\nMultiple posts, for example this one published to Facebook on June 13, 2019, and shared more than 150 times since, contain two photos of a light-blue building being razed by men wearing skullcaps and holding sledgehammers.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption translates into English as: \u201cIn Sri Lanka, Muslims are themselves destroying a mosque and converting to Hindu religion. Muslims say that they have now understood the reality of abomination and hatred in the religion.\u201d\n\nIt was published around two months after multiple suicide bombings in Sri Lanka on April 21, 2019, which left more than 250 people dead. Here is an AFP report about the attacks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same photos and claim have been posted elsewhere on Facebook, for example here, and on Twitter, for example here.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photos appeared in this article published May 29, 2019, on the website of Sri Lankan newspaper the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe report is headlined \u201cNTJ mosque in Kekirawa demolished by Muslims\u201d and its first paragraph says:\n\n\u201cA mosque used by the National Thawheed Jama'at (NTJ) at Madatugama in Kekirawa was yesterday demolished by the area Muslims and devotees of the main mosque.\u201d\n\nKekirawa is a town in north-central Sri Lanka. National Thowheeth Jama'ath is an extremist group named by Sri Lankan authorities as the perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bombings. Here is an AFP report dated April 27, 2019, which says the NTJ has been banned.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Daily Mirror report:\n\nOther local media reported on the mosque\u2019s demolition, for example here and here, and the Daily Mirror also published this video of the event on its verified YouTube page.\n\nThe media reports do not state that the Muslims involved in destroying the mosque also converted to Hinduism.\n\n\u201cThe land was previously allocated to construct a children's library and was handed over to its rightful owner\u201d, he added.\n\nThe mosque\u2019s chairman M H M Akbar Khan, who led the movement to tear down the building, also told AFP: \u201cIt was not demolished because of any link between that building and the NTJ or because any religious conversion took place.\"", "lang": "en"}
