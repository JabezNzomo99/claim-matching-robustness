Although today (according to the latest Eurostat data, for the 3rd quarter of 2018), this limit is exceeded by half of the EU countries, and by an average of nearly 1.5 times.\n\nThe EU, as an organization, is also a member of the G20, and together the two groups account for more than 80% of the world economy. Among all of the G20 member countries, Russia has the lowest public debt (as percentage of GDP).\n\nWe prepared a comparative chart using the estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from its latest semi-annual review of the world economy, published in early April. These estimates refer to IMF forecasts in terms of total public debt (\u201cgeneral government gross debt\u201d) for the countries of the world in 2019:\n\nOf the approximately 180 countries included in the IMF review, only four have a total public debt (in terms of percentage of GDP) less than that of Russia: Botswana (13%), Estonia (7.6%), Afghanistan (6.9%) and Brunei (2.6%).\n\nHowever, Kudrin also noted the \u201chigh cost\u201d of Russia\u2019s national debt -- that is, the interest on it, the amount investors are willing to pay to buy this debt, assessing their own risks. We are talking primarily about the domestic public debt of Russia, 95% of which is today financed by \u201cfederal loan obligations\u201d (or OFZs, to use the Russian abbreviation). As of the beginning of March 2019, foreign investors accounted for more than a quarter (25.9%) of all investments in Russian OFZs, according to the Russian Central Bank.\n\nHow investors assess their own risks on certain bonds is reflected in their current yield of those bonds (in percentage per annum). The higher the bond yield is, the riskier the paper and the lower its price. Therefore, the most risky bonds, called \u201cjunk bonds,\u201d have the highest yield.\n\nConversely, the most reliable bonds in the debt market have a minimum yield (and at the same time \u2013 a high price), and in some cases that yield can be negative. That is, the investor \u201cpays extra\u201d for the right to own such paper.\n\nMost often, the key to assessing investors' risks on a country's debt obligations is the current yield of 10-year bonds issued by its government. According to this indicator, Japan is the leader among all G20 countries today, with a \u201cnegative\u201d yield \u2013 despite the fact that its public debt (as percentage of GDP) remains the highest.\n\nThus, Russia is among the bottom five countries of the G20 in terms of bond yields despite the fact that it has the lowest public debt of any G20 country:\n\nThe story was adapted from Factograph.info.", "lang": "en"}
