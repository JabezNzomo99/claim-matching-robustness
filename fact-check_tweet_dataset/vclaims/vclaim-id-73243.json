The map shows Indian-administered Kashmir and India's western state of Gujarat redrawn as part of Pakistan. But the claim is false; the image has been doctored to include the map in the background.\n\nThis Facebook post which carried the photo was shared on February 23, 2019. It received more than 1,200 shares in a public group entitled \u2018One step towards Hindu nation\u2019, which has nearly a million members.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAnother Facebook post which carried the photo was shared on February 23, 2019.\n\nIt received more than 450 shares in a public group entitled \u2018Pappu\u2019s Political Disorder\u2019, which has more than 83,000 members.\n\nThe caption in Hindi language translates to English as: \u201cFriends, don\u2019t look at Kanhaiya, instead carefully look at the map of India behind him\u2026.and some people say that Kanhaiya is innocent.\u201d\n\nThe photo shows Kumar giving a speech with a map behind him. The map contains words in Urdu language; it highlights Pakistan in dark green along with Indian-administered Kashmir and the Indian state of Gujarat in the west.\n\nA reverse image search found the image had been doctored to include the map.\n\nAn earlier version of the photo without the map in the background can be seen in this news story published by Indian news website The Hindu.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the Hindu news article published on March 12, 2016:\n\nThe caption listed Kumar as a president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU). Here is a report published by NDTV on March 4, 2016, which states he was president of JNUSU.\n\nThe photo, which does not include a map in the background, is credited to photographer Sandeep Saxena. The report does not contain specific details about when the photo was taken.\n\nSandeep Saxena, a staff photographer for The Hindu, told AFP he took the image of Kumar in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe photo of Kanhaiya Kumar is taken by me during JNU\u2019s (Jawaharlal Nehru University) 2015 presidential debate. The event happened in September and I was there covering it.\u201d\n\nBy conducting a keyword search online for Kumar\u2019s speaking events while he was JNUSU President, AFP found multiple videos showing the same September 10, 2015 university student union presidential debate.\n\nThis video was shared on May 10, 2016 and entitled \u201cKanhaiya Kumar JNUSU, Firing Speech | A Must Watch Video For All\u201d.\n\nThe caption reads in English: \u201cJNU Kanhaiya Kumar's strong view on Indian Politics. Firing speech, a must watch video. The beauty of JNU' election, AISF Kanhaiya Kumar and NSUI Shah debate during presidential election 2015.\u201d In the video, Kumar starts speaking at one minute four seconds.\n\nIn the clip, there is no map behind him and he can be seen wearing identical clothing as the misleading Facebook photo.\n\nIn this second clip showing the same event, Kumar can be seen brandishing a pencil and pointing his finger in exactly the same gesture as seen in the Hindu photograph and misleading image.\n\nAgain, in the second clip, there is no map behind him and he is wearing identical clothing as the misleading Facebook photo.\n\nHere is a screenshot from the video which corresponds with the original photograph on The Hindu\u2019s report:", "lang": "en"}
