This is false; experts say masks do not need to be 100 percent effective to help reduce the spread of the virus, and can curb transmission by blocking the larger respiratory droplets that contain it.\n\n\u201cThe average size of dry wall dust particles is 3 microns. The average size of a corona virus particle is 0.3 microns,\u201d says a July 9, 2020 Facebook post that features two images of a man with a surgical mask under his chin, his face coated in white dust.\n\n\u201cIf masks cant prevent dry wall dust getting through how can they possibly prevent something 10 X smaller from getting through?\u201d the post says.\n\nThe claim also appears on Facebook here, here and here, with some versions giving different sizes for drywall dust or for the virus.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic -- which has killed more than 569,000 people worldwide, nearly a quarter of them in the US -- health authorities recommended mask use for people who were sick or those caring for them.\n\nThat recommendation has since been expanded to the general population due to the risk of people who are asymptomatic transmitting the virus, sparking a major backlash from those who balk at the inconvenience of wearing masks or view them as an impingement on their personal freedom.\n\nBut whether or not a mask can block drywall -- used in construction and also known as plasterboard or wallboard -- dust is not a measure of its effectiveness in curbing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cA mask doesn\u2019t have to be 100 percent effective in order to have a big effect on slowing down the outbreak,\u201d Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThere are good studies now showing that a mix of homemade and surgical masks are effective at dramatically reducing the spread of COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Julian Leibowitz, an expert in coronaviruses who is a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M\u2019s College of Medicine, agreed.\n\n\u201cThere is now plenty of evidence that even cloth masks cut down the risk of transmission if either the person who is infectious or the unexposed person are wearing one. If both are wearing a mask it cuts down the risk by between 75-90 percent,\u201d he said by email.\n\n\u201cIn addition the size of the viral particle is irrelevant. It is the size of the droplets that contain the virus that counts,\u201d Leibowitz said.\n\nNeuman said that the coronavirus measures around 100 nanometers, while \u201cthe respiratory droplets that are the best candidate for spreading coronavirus range up to about 20 micrometers (20,000 nanometers) in size\u201d -- substantially larger than the figures given for drywall dust in the Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cMasks can give some protection even by blocking just the largest droplets,\u201d and the idea is to \u201cuse whatever means are available to everyone to block as many respiratory droplets as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes the danger of asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus and recommends cloth face coverings as a means to reduce this risk.\n\n\u201cYou could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick,\u201d it says, adding: \u201cThe cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 550 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
