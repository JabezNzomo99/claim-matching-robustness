In their response through email, the restaurant denied the claim and told us that the image was photoshopped.\n\nA reverse image search led us to a few URLs carrying the same picture sans Wing Commander Abhinandan's image on the cafe's signboard.\n\nWe also matched the address of the outlet carrying the photoshopped image of Abhinandan with Chaiiwala outlets in London and found that they were one and the same.", "lang": "en"}
