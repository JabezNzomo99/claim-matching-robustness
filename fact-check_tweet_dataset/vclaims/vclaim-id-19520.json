One Kashmiri sent across this video requesting to spread it all over since Indian media blacked out the massive rally.\n\n\"Please share this video as widely as possible, to let the world know how the Kashmiris are being repressed in India. #FreeKashmir.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\n\n\nIn the video, the women can be heard shouting pro-Independence slogans saying \u2018Azadi\u2019 -- an Urdu word that translates into English as freedom.\n\nThe Indian government on August 5, 2019, issued a presidential order to scrap Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s semi-autonomous status.
