The students demanded punishment to those who led the harassment and victimisation at the behest of the RSS-BJP which led to the death of Rohith. The students were demanding action against HCU VC Appa Rao and Union ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani, and they were brutally beaten up by the police, joined in by RSS goons. Many media persons also were beaten up and their cameras smashed by the police. Our fight for justice for Rohith would go on, our struggle against casteism will move forward, battling casteist and communal-fascist forces like the RSS at every step.", "lang": "en"}
