That\u2019s more than any other council area in Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation splits the country into nearly 7,000 small areas with about 760 people living in each. It then works out the deprivation in each area by looking at a wide range of things from pupils\u2019 performance at school and travel time to a GP, to unemployment levels or crime in the area.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s telling us what proportion of areas falling within Glasgow City Council are part of the most deprived fifth of areas in Scotland.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as saying that 48% of people in Glasgow are living in deprivation. The Scottish government points out that people who are income deprived do not necessarily live in deprived areas. Likewise people who are not income deprived may live in a deprived area.\n\nThe Scottish government also says that \u201cpeople who live in areas up to 40% most deprived may also experience difficulties.\u201d Including these, 65% of areas in Glasgow were in the 40% most deprived in the country.\n\nOn the flipside, around 9% of areas in Glasgow were in the 20% least deprived in the country.\n\nThis is a different measure of poverty than Full Fact normally looks at which is based solely on household income.", "lang": "en"}
