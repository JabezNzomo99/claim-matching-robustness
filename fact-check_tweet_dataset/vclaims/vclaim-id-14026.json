The font, size and colour of the words \u201c\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 (Hindu)\u201d and \u201c\u0995\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09be \u09a4\u09c7 (cry)\u201d do not match the words in the rest of the sentence. They are not in perfect alignment, are larger than the other words and are in a deeper shade of black.\n\nWhen we searched for the clipping on Facebook, we found that a user had uploaded the original photograph of the newspaper even though he had shared it with the false claim viral on social media.\n\nAs evident, a few words of the original headline have been replaced. The word \u201c\u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2\u09bf (Delhi)\u201d has been edited to \u201c\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 (Hindu)\u201d and the word \u201c\u0995\u09be\u0981\u09aa\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 (shake)\u201d has been replaced with \u201c\u0995\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09be \u09a4\u09c7 (cry)\u201d. The original headline reads, \u201c\u09ea\u09e8\u099f\u09be \u0986\u09b8\u09a8 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8, \u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2\u09bf \u0995\u09c0\u09ad\u09be\u09ac\u09c7 \u0995\u09be\u0981\u09aa\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09b9\u09df \u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac: \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be (Give me 42 seats and I will show you how to shake things up in Delhi.)\u201d\n\nWe also found the Bartaman article on the daily\u2019s website. According to the report, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee made the statement at an election rally for TMC candidate Apurba Sarkar in Berhampur on April 19.\n\nThe newspaper clipping floating on social media is photoshopped. Recently, Congress president Rahul Gandhi was also targeted using a fake newspaper clipping.", "lang": "en"}
