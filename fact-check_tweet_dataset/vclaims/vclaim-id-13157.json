The claim is false; the photo was taken in Iraq in 2015 by international news agency Reuters and shows Shiite militia fighters, not IS members.\n\nThe false claim has been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here, where it has been shared more than 1,500 times since it was published on February 26, 2018, and Twitter, for example here.\n\nThe Facebook posts' caption says, in Hindi: \u201cRecognize him?? This is our Najeeb.. from JNU... the one who was part of revolutionary gang... He got a placement in ISIS after obtaining doctorate from JNU. He sends his salutations to Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal from Syria.\"\n\nNajeeb Ahmed is a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, who has been missing since October 2016.\n\nHere is a report on Ahmed\u2019s disappearance by the Times of India.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nRahul Gandhi is the president of the opposition Indian National Congress party and Arvind Kejriwal is the chief minister of Delhi and head of the Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nA reverse image search found that the original photo was published here on March 7, 2015 \u2013 seven months before Ahmed went missing \u2013 on the Reuters image website.\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption says: \u201cShiite fighters stands near a wall painted with the black flag commonly used by Islamic State militants in the town of Tal Ksaiba, near the town of al-Alam, March 7, 2015.\n\n\u201cIraqi security forces and Shi'ite militia fighters struggled to advance on Saturday into the two towns of al-Alam and al-Dour near Tikrit, their progress slowed by fierce defence from Islamic State militants.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as it appears on the Reuters site:\n\nThe misleading posts do not say which of the men in the photo is allegedly Najeeb.\n\nMultiple Indian media reports ran photos of Ahmed alongside their reports, for example here and here.\n\nDelhi police also have details of Najeeb Ahmed\u2019s disappearance which can be found in their missing person database.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the police records:\n\nThe image of Najeeb in the Delhi police records and the photographs published by Indian media do not correspond to anyone featured in the misleading image.\n\nThe traditionally left-leaning JNU has been targeted by nationalist groups and accused of fostering sedition. Here is an AFP report on student protests there in 2016.\n\nThis claim has also been debunked by Indian fact-checking organisations such as Altnews.in here.", "lang": "en"}
