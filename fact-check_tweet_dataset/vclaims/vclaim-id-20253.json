Soldiers converted battle ground into love for each other.\u2026 \"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nShared hours before Abhinandan was scheduled to return to Indian territory, the post can be seen all over Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIAF personnel Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was taken captive by the Pakistani security forces on February 27, 2019 after the MiG-21 Bison he was flying was shot down.\n\nOn February 28, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that the IAF pilot would be released on March 1 as a gesture of peace.\n\nBOOM analysed the video closely. It is clear that none of the soldiers seen dancing in the video bear any resemblance to the IAF pilot. Moreover, the soldiers are dressed in fatigues that are not worn by the Indian Air Force personnel.\n\nWhen we searched the internet with keywords 'Pakistani soldiers dancing', we found the same video on YouTube days before India's airstrike on Balakot on February 26.\n\nThe same video with varying claims has been also tweeted from several Twitter handles. However, a common claim with these videos is, 'pak Army dance - After surgical strikes on chita chola.'\n\nWe also zoomed in and captured the screen shots of the two soldiers shown dancing in the clip and none of them bear any resemblance to Abhinandan Varthaman.", "lang": "en"}
