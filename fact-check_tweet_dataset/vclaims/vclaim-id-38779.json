He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST.\"\n\nWilliams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that \"somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he could\u2019ve given every American a million dollars.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s an incredible way of putting it,\" Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen.\n\nIf that sounds too good to be true, it\u2019s because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but it\u2019s not breaking the bank.\n\nWilliams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished.\n\n\"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math,\" Williams said after a commercial break. \"I\u2019m speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar.\"\n\n\"The tweet is wrong,\" he said.\n\nGay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was \"buying a calculator, brb.\"\n\nAs for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, \"I know, I\u2019m bad at math.\"\n\nBloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people.\n\nBut even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didn\u2019t spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. That\u2019s bad math.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
