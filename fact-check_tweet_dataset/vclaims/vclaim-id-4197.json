It\u2019s based on management information and is not an official statistic, so should be treated with some caution.\n\n90-95% of doctor and nurse vacancies are being filled by temporary staff\u2014so it\u2019s not the case that nobody is doing these jobs. However, there is evidence that temporary staff cost the NHS more, and NHS Employers says that the vacancies are leading to some delays in treatment.\n\nRestrictions on the number of \u201cTier 2\u201d visas granted to people from outside the European Economic Area mean that some international doctors are not able to come to the UK to fill vacancies. NHS Employers says over 400 doctors have been refused a visa since December 2017.\n\nWhere does the 100,000 figure come from?\n\nThere were just over 97,000 vacancies in NHS trusts in England between October and December 2017, according to NHS Improvement (NHSI), which manages NHS trusts in England. That\u2019s around 8% of the workforce. Around 10,000 of these vacancies were for doctors, and 35,000 were for nurses.\n\nNHS trusts include all NHS services except GP surgeries\u2014and there were 1.1 million people employed by NHS trusts in England in the same period.\n\nThis vacancy level is higher than the UK average for all jobs. From October to December 2017, there were 2.7 vacancies for every 100 filled employee jobs\u2014the same level as for January to March 2018. In the NHSI data, there are around 9 vacancies for every 100 filled jobs.\n\nThese NHSI figures are whole-time equivalent (WTE), so if two half-time jobs were vacant for example, these would only count as one WTE vacancy.\n\nThe 100,000 figure should not be treated as certain\n\nThis is the first year in which this NHSI data on vacancies has been recorded, and there are still some things we don\u2019t know about how it\u2019s put together.\n\nNHSI says that its vacancies data is \u201cbased on management information from the sector\u201d so these aren\u2019t official statistics. As we don\u2019t know how this information was collected, it\u2019s hard to know quite how reliable it is. For instance, we don\u2019t know if the data was collected using a standardised data collection system, or if there was room for trusts to interpret \u201cvacancy\u201d in different ways. NHSI told us that they don\u2019t have much information on this.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust think tank told us that there are lots of different ways a vacancy can be defined. For instance the classification may, or may not, include vacancies filled by temporary staff, or those where the post is not currently being advertised.\n\nA minimum of 88,000 NHS jobs were advertised from July to September 2017\n\nThere are also official statistics on vacancies in the NHS in England, but these only look at the number of job adverts posted, rather than the number of empty jobs.\n\nThe latest figures on this are for September 2017, when there were around 28,000 advertised full-time equivalent (FTE) vacancies for permanent or fixed-term jobs. Across the three months from July to September 2017 there were around 88,000 vacancies advertised. 81% of these jobs were permanent ones.\n\nBut as these figures look at the number of adverts, rather than individual vacancies specifically, they can\u2019t be used to say exactly how many empty posts there were in the NHS in England. One advert can be used to fill one vacancy or several, and NHS trusts don\u2019t have to use the system that records these figures.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t a complete figure for vacancies, only the minimum possible number.\n\nConfusingly, a vacancy is not the same as nobody doing the job\n\nAccording to the NHSI data, 95% of doctor vacancies, and 90-95% of nursing vacancies were being filled by temporary staff. These are either supplied by the NHS Staff Bank, or an agency.\n\nSo many of these vacancies are actually occupied by temporary staff. Is this a problem in itself?\n\nOne issue is cost. NHS Improvement notes that, while trusts underspent on agency staff by about \u00a3108 million compared to what was planned in October-December 2017, they overspent on bank staff by \u00a3664 million.\n\nThe National Audit Office noted in 2014/15 that \u201cPrevious reports suggest that agency doctors routinely earn 50% more than permanent staff, and hospitals might pay up to \u00a33,500 for a doctor to work a single shift.\u201d\n\nThere is also the question of whether the widespread use of temporary staff affects patient care. The Nuffield Trust, focusing on nurses in particular, says \u201crelatively little\u201d is known about this.\n\nNHS Employers says that failing to recruit doctors leads to shortages on rotas, extra costs, delays in treatment, and clinics being cancelled.\n\nWhy are international doctors being turned away?\n\nDespite these vacancies, there are numerous reports that doctors being recruited from abroad have been denied visas by the Home Office.\n\nNHS Employers says it has heard that, since December 2017 \u201cat least 400 doctors who we\u2019ve being trying to recruit to come and work within the NHS in England haven\u2019t been able to enter the country and take up posts.\u201d\n\nThis is happening because of a cap on the number of Tier 2 visas being granted by the government. That\u2019s the type of visa which doctors from countries outside the European Economic Area normally need in order to work here. Around 1,300 Tier 2 visas were granted in March 2018, and around 2,200 in April 2018. In January, the government estimated that a third of Tier 2 visas went to the NHS.\n\nPriority is given to visa applicants for jobs where there is considered to be a \u201cshortage\u201d in the UK. Nurses, and some doctor roles, are on the \u201cshortage occupation list\u201d.\n\nBecause visa applications are oversubscribed, the minimum salary level needed to get a visa for non-shortage occupations is inflated. Without oversubscription it would be \u00a330,000 (in most cases), but in March it was \u00a360,000, and in April it was \u00a350,000. Some, but not all, doctors earn that much. We\u2019ve written more about how salary thresholds are calculated and set here.\n\nNHS Employers says that the biggest NHS shortages are among nurses. Because nurses are a shortage occupation, they get Tier 2 visas as a priority\u2014but that means the NHS has \u201cfewer work permits available for doctors\u201d who aren\u2019t in a shortage role. NHS Employers argues that applicants for shortage occupations shouldn\u2019t be included in the cap on Tier 2 visas, which would free up more visas for doctors in non-shortage roles.", "lang": "en"}
