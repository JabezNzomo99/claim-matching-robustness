The BBC told AFP that they have issued no such report on their website or social media accounts -- the screenshot was doctored. Kenya\u2019s foreign ministry also described the claim as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nThe screenshot was shared on the Group Kenya Facebook group, which has more than 1.9 million followers -- we\u2019ve archived the post here. \u201cSad! Sad! Sad! Just like that, we're coming back home,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nThe screenshot was also posted in the closed Kenyan Facebook group Uhuru Kenyatta Supporters, which has more than 900,000 followers.\n\nA close look at the screenshot provides telling signs that it doesn\u2019t show a real tweet -- the font does not match the one usually seen in tweets, and the text in the link is too close to the left-hand side. The text is also slightly ungrammatical, which you would not expect in a post from a major news organisation.\n\nThe post is nowhere to be seen on the @BBCBreaking Twitter account which supposedly published it, and the link given in the screenshot doesn\u2019t work.\n\nA text search on Google for keywords in the screenshot -- \u201cUAE Kenya fake gold\u201d -- also yields no sign of such a BBC story.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman confirmed that the post was fake.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of a fake story with BBC News branding circulating on WhatsApp about Kenya and the UAE. The story did not originate from the BBC and is not published on any of the BBC's digital or social platforms. We advise those who access BBC News via social media to check and verify any suspicious story that purports to come from the BBC on our website,\u201d she said.\n\nKenya\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs also dismissed the claims in the screenshot as untrue.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give fake news mileage. The story holds no water,\u201d Edith Fortunate from the ministry press office said via a WhatsApp message.\n\nThere has been speculation in Kenya recently that diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates could take a downturn over a shipment of gold that was ordered by a Dubai-based company but confiscated at Nairobi\u2019s airport in February.\n\nHowever, the UAE's Nairobi embassy tweeted on May 20 that relations between the two countries remained strong.", "lang": "en"}
