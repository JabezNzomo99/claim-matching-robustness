Those affiliated with the firm in question gave just $17,700 to Clinton.\n\u2022 Discussing the case of a Russian firm indicted for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, Putin said, \u201cSo far, American court has not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. There\u2019s an ongoing legal dispute over pretrial evidence. There is, however, plenty of evidence in the indictments.\n\u2022 Putin denied that a video played during his annual state of the nation address showed an animated depiction of nuclear warheads raining down on Florida \u2014 not far from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago private resort and golf club. But it did.\n\nPutin spoke after he and Trump held a summit in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16.\n\nWe don\u2019t typically fact-check foreign leaders, but in this case, Putin\u2019s comments were part of a high-profile event with the U.S. president. And besides, there are no fact-checking organizations in Russia, according to the Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab.\n\nIn the July 16 joint press conference, Putin claimed that business associates of William Browder evaded taxes in Russia and gave \u201ca huge amount of money \u2014 400 million \u2014 as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence of such large contributions to Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBrowder is no longer a U.S. citizen. Those affiliated with a U.S. investment firm the Russian government has linked to Browder gave just $17,700 to Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and a total of $1.76 million to candidates, committees and outside groups in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nWhile $1.1 million went to Democratic candidates and committees, another $205,600 was given to Republicans.\n\nClinton raised a total of $563.8 million, and outside groups supporting her campaign raised another $231 million.\n\nPutin made an offer that special counsel Robert S. Mueller could come to Russia to observe questioning of the 12 Russian military intelligence agents indicted on July 13 for hacking into Democratic Party and Clinton campaign computer networks \u2014 but in exchange Putin wanted Russian law enforcement to be able to sit in on interviews with \u201cofficers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States, whom we believe have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia.\u201d He then mentioned Browder.\n\nBrowder, founder and CEO of investment firm Hermitage Capital Management, was born in the United States but renounced his citizenship in 1998. He helped get Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which banned some Russians from entering the United States and froze their assets held in U.S. banks. The act is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who worked for Browder and exposed a tax fraud scheme linked to the Kremlin. He was arrested in Russia and died mysteriously in jail in 2009.\n\nIn retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, Russia prohibited U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children.\n\nBrowder told CNBC on July 16 that Putin\u2019s allegations about funneling money to the Clinton campaign were false. \u201cI did not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a U.S. citizen. I don\u2019t live in the United States. I\u2019ve been living in Britain for 29 years. I make no campaign contributions, and so that\u2019s not true.\u201d (Browder also wrote in Time magazine about Putin\u2019s claim and Browder\u2019s history with the Russian government.)\n\nThis charge against Browder also came up in the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr., other Trump campaign officials and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Donald Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after he had been promised incriminating information on Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya told the Wall Street Journal in July 2017 that she wanted to give the Trump campaign information about Browder. The Journal reported that \u201cshe said she wanted to inform the Trump campaign of allegations that an American firm Mr. Browder worked with, Ziff Brothers Investments, had dodged taxes in Russia and later donated to Democrats.\u201d\n\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s talking points for that meeting, obtained and published by the New York Times in 2017, claim the Ziff Brothers \u201ctook part in financing both Obama\u201d campaigns and that \u201c[i]t cannot be ruled out that they took part in financing the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThose affiliated with the Ziff Brothers gave $17,700 to the Clinton campaign. And donations to other Democratic committees \u2014 $1.1 million \u2014 don\u2019t come anywhere close to Putin\u2019s $400-million accusation. For the record, affiliates of Ziff Brothers gave $22,362 to President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign in 2012, and $20,750 to Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe U.S. Case Against \u2018Putin\u2019s Chef\u2019\n\nIn an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, which took place shortly after the summit between Putin and Trump, Putin pushed back at the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s finding that Russia interfered with the 2016 election to help Trump.\n\nFirst, Putin made the curious defense that \u201cevery single grain\u201d of information contained in the pilfered emails was \u201ctrue and the Democratic leadership admitted it.\u201d Second, he said there is no trace of interference \u2014 at least as it involves a company controlled by one of his close associates, Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a man described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cook\u201d or \u201cPutin\u2019s chef.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccertain private company in Russia\u201d referenced by Putin is Concord Catering. Prigozhin and his two companies, Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering, were indicted by special counsel Mueller on Feb. 16. In all, the indictment included charges against three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals, which resulted in U.S. sanctions against all defendants, including Prigozhin and his companies.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office alleges that Concord financed an extensive social media campaign designed to help Trump win the presidential election. Concord entered a not guilty plea on May 9.\n\nPutin says the \u201cAmerican court has not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever\u201d on Concord, but the case hasn\u2019t progressed very far. It has yet to even get to the discovery phase, which has resulted in a flurry of charges and counter-charges between the government and Concord\u2019s lawyers.\n\nAt a court hearing on May 16, Eric Dubelier, one of Concord\u2019s American attorneys, complained that the government refused to turn over pretrial evidence that it has amassed on his client. In a court filing on June 29, Mueller\u2019s office said the attorneys for Prigozhin and his companies should not get access to pretrial evidence unless the Russian businessman comes to court.\n\nOn July 16 \u2014 the same day as Putin\u2019s press conference with Trump and his interview with Wallace \u2014 Prigozhin\u2019s lawyers asked the court to dismiss the charges, claiming that a conspiracy did not exist and the underlying law used by the U.S. government to bring charges was \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d\n\nAt this point, no evidence has been brought to trial \u2014 as both sides wrangle over discovery materials \u2014 so to declare that the U.S. court \u201chas not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever\u201d on Concord is misleading. There is, however, plenty of evidence in the indictment.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office alleges that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian-based online propaganda company, oversaw the pro-Trump social media campaign, and Concord \u201cspent significant funds\u201d to finance the organization\u2019s pro-Trump activities.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency, described in the indictment as the \u201corganization,\u201d began in April 2016 to \u201cproduce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton.\u201d In June 2016, it began to stage political rallies. For example, the defendants paid \u201cone U.S. person to build a cage on a flatbed truck and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform\u201d for a \u201cFlorida Goes Trump\u201d rally in August, the indictment says.\n\n\u201cConcord controlled funding, recommended personnel, and oversaw [the Internet Research Agency\u2019s] activities through reporting and interaction with [the organization\u2019s] management,\u201d the indictment says. Mikhail Ivanovich Bystrov, the general director and highest-ranking official of the Internet Research Agency, \u201cfrequently communicated\u201d with Prigozhin about the social media campaign.\n\n\u201cPrigozhin approved and supported the organization\u2019s operations, and defendants and their co-conspirators were aware of Prigozhin\u2019s role,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nBy September 2016, the Internet Research Agency\u2019s monthly budget was more than $1.25 million U.S. dollars. To conceal the payments, Concord paid the Internet Research Agency through 14 bank accounts held in the names of various Concord affiliates.\n\nPutin seems to be following the Concord case closely. He knew the company had hired a U.S. law firm to represent it, and he seemed to be familiar with the dispute between the government and the company over pretrial evidence. But his statement that the court \u201chas not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever\u201d distorts the facts.\n\nIn his interview with Wallace, Putin also denied that a video played during his annual state of the nation address showed an animated depiction of nuclear warheads raining down on Florida. But it did.\n\nWallace asked Putin about the video, which highlighted a new generation of Russian missiles that Putin described in March as \u201cinvincible\u201d intercontinental cruise missiles capable of evading U.S. missile defenses. Given that the video \u2014 unveiled at Putin\u2019s annual state of the nation address at the beginning of March \u2014 showed warheads hitting Florida, Wallace asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you escalating the arms race, and aren\u2019t you being deliberately provocative?\u201d\n\nPutin countered that the footage \u201cdid not specify that it \u2014 the missile is about to hit the United States.\u201d He said Wallace needed to \u201clook at [the video] more carefully.\u201d Putin went on to say that there was no \u201ccaption\u201d on the map indicating that it was Florida, and he scolded Wallace, saying, \u201cdon\u2019t try to scare your population with make-believe threats.\u201d\n\nCiting anonymous \u201csources with direct knowledge,\u201d Axios reported on July 15 that the video enraged Trump, and that Trump later \u201clashed out at the Russian president in a phone call.\u201d The article notes that \u201cthe motion graphic in Putin\u2019s video appeared to show missiles raining down on Florida \u2014 the home of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club.\u201d We would also note that U.S. Central Command, known as CentCom, is headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.\n\nHere\u2019s the full exchange from the Fox News interview:\n\nWallace: Last year, Defense Secretary Mattis said that Russia is the greatest threat \u2014 Russia is the greatest threat to the United States and, he has since made it clear, an even greater threat than terrorism. In March, you introduced a new generation of Russian missiles, including what you called an invincible missile you said \u2014 that could evade \u2014 defeat all of our missile defenses. And you even released a video that showed this super missile flying over the United States and hitting Florida very near where President Trump\u2019s estate is at Mar-A-Lago. Aren\u2019t you escalating the arms race, and aren\u2019t you being deliberately provocative? Putin: As far as the footage is concerned, well, they did not specify that it \u2014 the missile is about to hit the United States. You have to look at it more carefully. Secondly \u2013 Putin: It \u2014 that was not signed Florida. There was not a caption saying Florida. They could \u2014 take a more careful look at it. There was never a caption, \u201cFlorida.\u201d Wallace: No, but you can see it on the map. Putin: It was flying over the eastern coast of \u2014 no, no, no, it couldn\u2019t be seen on the map. Just take a closer look, and don\u2019t, don\u2019t try to scare your population with make-believe threats. And now \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure I can give you as a present this footage.\n\nSo was it Florida?\n\nFormer CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden certainly thought so. On the day after Putin\u2019s video was unveiled, Hayden told CNN \u201cone of the stunning aspects of the demonstration\u201d was that Russia \u201cwould actually use an absolutely recognizable part of the United States to show where the targeting was.\u201d\n\nIt looks like Florida to us, but just to be sure, we reached out to David Folch, a professor in the Department of Geography at Florida State University. He teaches several courses in Geographic Information Systems and, well, he lives in Florida.\n\n\u201cDefinitely Florida,\u201d Folch told us via email. \u201cYou can see the shape of the Tampa Bay area, outline of Cape Canaveral, Lake Okeechobee, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll allow that, as Putin said, there was no caption identifying the land mass in the video as Florida. But it\u2019s Florida.", "lang": "en"}
