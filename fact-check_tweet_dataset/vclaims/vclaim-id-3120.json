Did the arresting police officer mysteriously die?\n\nA: No. Those false stories originated on websites that claim to publish satire.\n\nFormer first daughter Malia Obama was not among a group of people arrested for a \u201cracist antifa attack\u201d on an elderly white woman. The alleged assault never happened.\n\nThat false story originated in November on America\u2019s Last line of Defense, a self-described satirical website that presents \u201cfiction as fact,\u201d according to its \u201cabout us\u201d page.\n\nIt claimed that Obama, a freshman at Harvard University, was among 10 students who attacked the woman as she was coming out of a church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But we examined the Cambridge Police Department\u2019s daily logs for November and found no mention of any such crime.\n\nThat made-up story has since been removed from lastlineofdefense.online, but an updated version was recently published on factiven.com and flagged by Facebook users as potentially false.\n\nThe latest version claims that \u201cObama was able to walk free\u201d due to \u201can error in the paperwork,\u201d and that her arresting police officer, \u201cPatrick Farley,\u201d later died of a heart attack \u201cunder pretty suspicious circumstances.\u201d\n\nFactiven.com credited the story to nativeamericanapache.com, but it first appeared last year on Reagan Was Right, another so-called satire website that we have previously written about.\n\nAlso, the photo of \u201cFarley\u201d included in the story on reaganwasright.com really shows Brad Miller, a former Arlington, Texas, police trainee, who was fired in August 2015 after fatally shooting an unarmed black teen at a car dealership.\n\nJeremy Warnick, the director of communications and media relations for the Cambridge Police Department, confirmed to FactCheck.org in an email that \u201cMalia [Obama] was never arrested by the Cambridge Police, and we don\u2019t have an officer by that name [Patrick Farley] in the department.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nSteele, Tom. \u201cNo charges filed against Arlington police trainee who fatally shot unarmed teen at car dealership.\u201d Dallas Morning News. 08 June 2016.\n\nWarnick, Jeremy, director of communications and media relations for the Cambridge Police Department.
