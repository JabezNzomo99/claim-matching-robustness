The false report uses video and an image from an unrelated 2016 murder case to make its claim, and lacks any other supporting evidence.\n\nThe report claims that three of the young men in the video were murdered. A screenshot of the report is below.\n\nThe photo montage below also appears with the false report. It has a headline that, when translated to English, says: \u201cThree young men tagged as \u2018MARIJUANA BOYS\u2019 were abducted in different places and tortured before they were killed\u201d.\n\nThe initial video of the young men that went viral is on Facebook here. \n\n\n\nLocal media reports said the six young men surrendered to authorities on August 28, 2018 after the video implicating them was posted online. Two of those reports are here and here.\n\nFootage of them in custody was also published on the Facebook page of DK Zarate, a reporter for RMN DZXL 558 Manila.\n\nThe inset photo of the montage in the false report includes a screengrab of the young men from the above video. The screenshot is taken 12 seconds into the above video.\n\nThe much bigger photo showing a crime scene, which purports to depict their corpses after the murder, is from an earlier crime.\n\nThe misleading photo is a screengrab from a report by local TV station ABS-CBN that shows victims of a 2016 slaying in the central Philippines. The scene where the screengrab was taken is at 51 seconds in the report below:\n\nThe false online post also contains a shortened version of the ABS-CBN report on the 2016 slaying, which happened two years before the \u201cMarijuana Boys\u201d video went online.\n\nThe false report gives no other supporting evidence to make its claim.\n\nWhile many media outlets covered the young men\u2019s viral video and their subsequent surrender, none have reported they were tortured and killed.\n\nThe issue of the \u201cMarijuana Boys\u201d has received a lot of attention online and in traditional Filipino media because Duterte has led a crackdown on drugs in the Philippines that has seen thousands of people killed.\n\nRights groups allege police have conducted widespread abuses in the crackdown, including murdering drug users and addicts.\n\nDuterte, who took office in the middle of 2016, insists he is conducting his drug war properly and surveys show widespread support among Filipinos.", "lang": "en"}
