The graphic images were shared with the caption which when translated reads, \"In Delhi's Maujpur and Shiv Vihar area, Hindu homes were forcefully entered into and Mother and sisters were killed.\"\n\nThe photos are being shared in light of the violence in many parts of North East Delhi which left atleast 21 dead, with the numbers increasing.

The photos show deep wounds on the woman's shoulder and arms. Local police had then told BOOM that both accused and victim are Hindus.\n\n\n\nWe had then found news reports about the incident on news websites such as Dainik Jagran, SiwanNews, and Prabhat Khabar which reported that the incident happened in Nehrua Kala village in Kateya area of Gopalganj district.\n\nBOOM found that the other third and fourth photos are also old and unrelated. A reverse image search for the third photo of a woman lying in a pool of blood led us to a blog on Medium published in 2018. The blog did not give any details on the location or the incident which led to the woman's death.\n\nThe fourth image, of two deceased women on the floor, could be traced back online to 2015 on a blog page.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the location or details of image number 3 and 4.\n\nAlso Read:Dated Picture Of Cop Holding Stones Spun As Police Violence In Delhi", "lang": "en"}
