In an ambulance with people they don\u2019t know. To a room they don\u2019t know. To be with people they don\u2019t know. You will be at home without them in their time of need\u201d. Some of the posts replace the word \u2018ambulance\u2019 with \u2018van\u2019 and messages about staying home or keeping children at home are also included in some posts. The text is frequently shared within an image.\n\nThe UK's National Health Service (NHS) confirmed to Reuters that this was not true and that the ambulance service allowed parents to travel with their children. The official NHS visitor guidance, dated March 25, 2020, states that children, women in labour and patients receiving end-of-life care are the three exceptions to strict rules against visitors (here). The guidelines state that only one visitor, an immediate family member or carer, can visit in these circumstances.\n\nFalse: the claim that children infected with coronavirus will be taken to hospital alone does not tally with NHS policy.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
