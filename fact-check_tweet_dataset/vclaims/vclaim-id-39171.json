The claim that the image was taken in New York\u2019s Times Square is false -- the real image on the billboard was digitally altered.\n\nThe image (below) was published in this Facebook post on February 27, a few days before the Adwa victory celebrations.\n\nThe billboard is inscribed with Amharic text at the bottom, which translates as \u201cAdwa\u201d.\n\nThe photo has been shared here as well, with the caption: \u201cCelebrating Adwa at Times Square in New York City, NY\u201d.\n\nThe picture shows portraits of Emperor of Ethiopia Menelik II and, below him, his wife, Taitu Betul. Both are venerated heroes of the Battle of Adwa, which took place in March 1896 and led to an Ethiopian victory over the Italian army.\n\nThe photo purported to show them in Times Square, however, has been manipulated.\n\nAFP ran a reverse image search using TinEye and found the same image altered in various ways.\n\nThe original picture can be found on Shutterstock, a website that allows users to download stock images. According to the user who uploaded the picture, the image was taken on September 5, 2011.\n\nThe photo collage below shows how the original image has been manipulated in different ways.\n\nWas this picture really taken in New York?\n\nSome details confirm the original image was taken in New York City.\n\nThe photo below was uploaded by a user to Pinterest and shows Sbarro Pizzeria, which is also evident beneath the doctored billboard with Adwa\u2019s couple.\n\nThe manipulated image of Times Square was taken on the corner of W47th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nThe Google street view shows how much the neighbourhood has changed in nearly a decade, including the building with the billboard. Some details, however, are still the same.\n\nCircled in red are buildings surrounding the big billboard, showing three structures that are visible in the doctored image: the two grey towers behind the billboard, as well as the brown building to the right of the building.", "lang": "en"}
