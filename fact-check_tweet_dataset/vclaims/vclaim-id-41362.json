There are variants of the claim wherein the location of the crash changes. A WhatsApp forward claims that it happened in Amboli Ghat (Goa), a Twitter user posted it saying that it happened in Amboli Ghat, Belgaum and on Facebook, a user posted it with the message \u2013 \u201cAmboli Ghat (way to Goa)\u201d.\n\nA simple search on Google told us that Amboli Ghat is in Kegad, Maharashtra which is about 1 hour 45 minutes away from Belgaum, Karnataka, and is about 3 hours away from Goa.\n\nAlt News used InVid to break down the video into multiple frames and then performed a reverse image search of one of the frames on Yandex. This led us to a CGTN (China Global Television Network) video posted on YouTube. The description of the video says that the incident happened in the Autonomous Region of Tibet in SW China on October 3, 2018. It further says that \u201caccording to the local police, the incident was an act of nature and nobody was seriously injured.\u201d\n\nUsing this information, Alt News did a keyword search on Google. This led us to other news articles and videos by Daily Mail, The Weather Channel and Newsflare, that corroborate CGTN\u2019s report.\n\nThe article published by Daily Mail provides some more details. It states that the car was travelling on G318, one of the longest Chinese National Highways, running from Shanghai to Tibet Autonomous Region. \u201cDashcam footage of the incident on October 3 shows a massive boulder smashing into an SUV travelling in the opposite lane after tumbling down the roadside hill in Bome county in Tibet,\u201d per the report.\n\nThis video is currently viral in the Indian social media ecosystem claiming that the incident occurred in Amboli Ghat, Maharashtra. However, the video is actually of an incident which took place on October 3, 2018, on G318, one of China\u2019s National Highways.", "lang": "en"}
