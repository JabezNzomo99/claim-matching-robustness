Only about half of students graduated before 2002. The change allowed Bloomberg to appoint a manager of the school system to replace the Board of Education.\n\nThe legislature has since renewed mayoral control four times, with a sunset scheduled for 2019 unless lawmakers extend control again. De Blasio has been unable to convince Republicans in the State Senate to give permanent control to the city\u2019s mayor.\n\nIs de Blasio right that the graduation rate has increased by 50 percent since then?\n\nAbout 17,000 more students graduated from New York City schools in 2016 than 2005, according to the New York City Department of Education.\n\nThe graduation rate was 46.5 percent in 2005. The state changed the way the graduation rate is calculated that year, so numbers prior to 2005 are not comparable.\n\nThe graduation rate increased each year until 2011, when the rate dropped from 61 percent to 60.9 percent. The rate also decreased in 2012, but has increased each year since.\n\nThe most recent data shows the graduation rate for New York City schools at 69.6 percent in 2016. The rate for 2017 had not been released.\n\nThe 2016 rate is about 23 percentage points higher than the rate for 2005, a 50 percent increase between the two years.\n\nThe numbers count students who graduate in June of their fourth year of high school.\n\nThe state also began tracking the graduation rate for students who graduate in August after their fourth year of high school in 2008. The graduation rate was 72.6 percent in 2016 when the August graduates are counted.\n\nThe same success has not been felt in every district. District 8 in the Bronx still had a June graduation rate of 50 percent in 2016, up slightly from 44.6 percent in 2005.\n\nDe Blasio said \"the graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years.\"\n\nThe increase between 2005 and 2016 is about 50 percent.", "lang": "en"}
