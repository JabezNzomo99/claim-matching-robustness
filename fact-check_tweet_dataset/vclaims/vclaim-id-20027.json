What is this number and can it be used to help find missing persons, even when their phone is off?", "author": "africacheck.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20027", "url": "https://africacheck.org/reports/can-trace-missing-person-using-phones-imei-number-even-off/", "vclaim": "What is an IMEI number?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity, or IMEI, number \u201cis essentially a serial number\u201d Arthur Goldstuck, the managing director of\n\n\u201cEvery phone has a unique IMEI number. As with a human ID number, this in turn allows the phone to be linked to a range of information, including manufacturer and model number,\u201d Goldstuck added.\n\nAs Mbalula had tweeted, the number can be accessed by dialling *#06# on a cellphone, Dr Dustin van der Haar, the deputy head of the\n\nBoth Goldstuck and Van der Haar told Africa Check the IMEI number can be used to track the location of a mobile device.\n\nHowever, tracking \u201ccan only be done by the mobile network operator to which the phone is connected. Usually, this can only happen when there is a court order requiring the operator to track a specific phone,\u201d Goldstuck said.\n\n\u201cIt is usually a last resort, and in extreme cases, as the operator is most commonly asked to trace and intercept calls via a regular phone number.\u201d\n\nVan der Haar told Africa Check that tracking is possible but requires \u201cthe appropriate legal documentation\u201d. The\n\n(RICA) provides allowances to do this, Van der Haar added.\n\nThe act allows law enforcement \u201cto see which new SIM cards are put into a stolen device and retrieve [details of] the SIM card owner from the RICA database, thereby aiding in the investigation,\u201d Van der Haar said.\n\nThough Brigadier Vish Naidoo, spokesman for the police\u2019s operational services, declined to comment on the matter (stating they \u201c\n\nare unfortunately not at liberty to discuss such matters in the public domain as it borders on police operations\u201d) two other police officials confirmed to Africa Check that the IMEI number is used to track missing people.\n\nPolice ministry spokesman Vuyo Mhaga said the IMEI number \u201cworks like a tracker\u201d and that it \u201cis part of the alerts we use as police to find missing persons\u201d.\n\nColonel Fanie van Deventer of the police\u2019s Missing Persons Bureau confirmed that tracking a person\u2019s location using the IMEI number is a technique the Bureau has previously used in finding missing persons.\n\nPhone can\u2019t be traced when switched off\n\nHowever, using the IMEI number as a tracking tool requires certain conditions be met.\n\n\u201cThe phone can only be tracked when it connects to the mobile network,\u201d Goldstuck told Africa Check. \u201cWhen it's switched off, it can't be tracked, unless additional surveillance devices with their own power supply have been installed surreptitiously. This is highly unlikely if those doing the surveillance have not had direct physical access to the phone.\u201d\n\nAlthough the phone needs to be powered up, a change of SIM cards won\u2019t affect the use of the IMEI number as a tracking tool, Goldstuck and Van der Haar told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe IMEI number is not affected by the SIM card, so it does not matter how many times the SIM card is changed, the phone itself can still be tracked,\u201d Goldstuck said.\n\n\u201cAgain, this would require a court order to a specific operator, and it would largely depend on the user of the phone still using the same operator or using the phone in the same geography and not having had the IMEI number changed.\u201d\n\nConclusion: The claim is mostly correct\n\nPolice minister Fikile Mbalula tweeted that providing law enforcement with your cellphone's IMEI number will enable them to track you \u201cif the worst happens\u201d.\n\nTechnology experts told us that it is possible since the 15 digit IMEI number acts like a cellphone's identity number. It can therefore help find the last or current location of a cellphone, even if the SIM card was changed.\n\nHowever, tracking a person\u2019s movements or location using their cellphone\u2019s IMEI number requires a court order. And unlike the minister tweeted, the phone can't be traced when it's switched off. Based on this qualifier, we rate the claim mostly correct.\n\nNumber can find a phone's recent location.In the wake of increased media coverage of people going missing, South Africa\u2019s newly appointed police minister took to social media to offer advice.\u201cAssist us in finding you if the worst happens,\u201d Minister Fikile Mbalula tweeted. \u201cYour IMEI number can be of great use\u201d.The minister had attached an image which encouraged the public to find out what their IMEI numbers are, as these could help trace the last or current location of the phone user \u201ceven if the sim card had been removed from ur phone [sic]\u201d the image\u2019s text read.\u201cGive ur IMEI NUMBER to family and friends so that when u disappear without an explanation and ur phone is off or rings unanswered, they can make the case easy for the police by providing them with this number which can then be used to track ur movements,\u201d it further said. readers asked us to check if this really works.Your phone's IMEI number can be accessed by dialling *#06#.\" />Edited by Anim van Wyk", "lang": "en"}
