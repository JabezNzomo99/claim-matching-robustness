It comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nBrady signed a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in March, Sports Illustrated reported. Prior to joining the Buccaneers, he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots, according to The New York Times.\n\nA post shared on Facebook alleges Brady threatened to quit if his teammates knelt during the national anthem. (RELATED: Did Kansas City Chiefs Owner Clark Hunt Say He Would \u2018Immediately Fire\u2019 Players And Staff Who Don\u2019t Stand For The National Anthem?)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, an act of treason,\u201d the post quotes Brady as saying. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for it. I won\u2019t stand for your kneeling. Let me be perfectly clear, if anybody on this team kneels, I will walk. I will be off the field and out the door in an instant.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Brady saying the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement doesn\u2019t appear on any of his social media pages, and the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports quoting him as saying it.\n\nThe quote appears to contradict what Brady has previously said about players kneeling during the national anthem, further adding to the attribution\u2019s dubiousness.\n\n\u201cI respect why people are doing what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re doing it for different reasons, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Brady told Oprah Winfrey in a June 2018 interview. \u201cYou can do things for your reasons, they can do things for their reasons, and you have respect for that. But I thought it was great.\u201d\n\nThe statement circulating on Facebook comes from an article published by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that creates \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d On its \u201cAbout Us\u201d page, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense states, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
