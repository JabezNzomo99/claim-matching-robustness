The caption says \"#\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0928\u093e\u0921\u0941 \u092e\u0947\u0902 3 #\u0926\u0932\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b #RSS \u0915\u0947 #\u0917\u0941\u0902\u0921\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 #\u092a\u0940\u091f\u093e #\u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 #\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0936\u092c\u0940\u0928 \u092c\u0928\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0907\u0928\u0915\u093e #\u0915\u0938\u0942\u0930 \u092c\u0938 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0907\u0938 #\u0939\u094b\u091f\u0932 #\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915 \u0915\u094b \u0907\u0928\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947 #\u091c\u092f\u092d\u0940\u092e \u092c\u094b\u0932 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e\"\n\nThis translates to \"3 Dalit men were beaten by RSS thugs in Tamil Nadhu while the police remained as spectators. The only fault of these men was that they said Jai Bhim to this hotel owner.\"\n\nBhim Sena's post which has now been restricted by Facebook due to graphic content has received around 5100 shares and more than one lakh views at the time of writing this story.\n\nThe same video is being shared on Facebook with the same false narrative but from Gujarat.\n\nThe truth about the video\n\nBOOM's verification had revealed that one of the three men in the video is Shailesh Dhandhaliya, a notorious gangster from Bhavnagar who is a history-sheeter with cases registered against him for extortion, robbery and kidnapping. And, the plain-clothes policeman in the video beating the accused with a laathi is Deepak Mishra, police inspector, Crime Branch, Bhavnagar.\n\nBOOM spoke to Mishra who said that he had paraded the accused to 'rid the public of fear'. Gangster Dhandhaliya had served a jail term of 10 years but was arrested again for another crime. When we pointed to Mishra that parading an accused publicly is against the law and the men's hands were tied up while they were beaten, he said that it was done for the public and to teach the gangsters a lesson. He said that the accused were showing the police where they had stored weapons.", "lang": "en"}
