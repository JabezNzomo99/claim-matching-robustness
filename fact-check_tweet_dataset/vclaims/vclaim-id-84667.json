So, when you think about it, he\u2019s really kind of a hero!\u2019 --- #BernieOnDespots,\u201d said another.\n\nThe tweets parodied Sanders\u2019s remarks on Castro, which have drawn fire from both Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, another Democratic presidential hopeful.\n\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d released on February 24, 2020, Sanders defended positive comments he made in the 1980s on education and health care under Castro.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba, but, you know, it\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhen Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing, even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d\n\nBloomberg tweeted a video clip from the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, saying: \u201cFidel Castro left a dark legacy of forced labor camps, religious repression, widespread poverty, firing squads, and the murder of thousands of his own people. But sure, Bernie, let\u2019s talk about his literacy program.\u201d\n\nThe series of fake quotes is not the first misleading material to come out of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign.\n\nFollowing his Democratic debate debut in Nevada, the candidate tweeted a video that had been edited to make it appear that a comment he made had left his rivals speechless for a lengthy period, when in fact he quickly resumed speaking.\n\nAnd one of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign ads attacking President Donald Trump used footage that dated to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s time in office.", "lang": "en"}
