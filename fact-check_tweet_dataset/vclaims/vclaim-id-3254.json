That\u2019s down from $108.9 million in 2015, and from $172.6 million in 2014.\n\nThat led to headlines in conservative news outlets about the decline, including on Breitbart \u2014 \u201cClinton Foundation Donations Plummeted Following Hillary\u2019s Election Loss\u201d\u2013 and in the New York Post \u2014 \u201cDonations to Clinton Foundation plunged along with Hillary\u2019s election defeat.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton Foundation officials say the decline in contributions was expected, and not tied to Clinton\u2019s election loss.\n\nAccording to Cookstra, there are \u201csome very clear reasons\u201d for the drop in revenue. The Clinton Foundation wrapped up a three-year, $250 million endowment campaign in 2015, and so contributions spiked during those years (and dropped off after), he said. The voluntary restrictions placed on fundraising during the campaign also negatively impacted fundraising, he added.\n\nIn a letter accompanying the foundation\u2019s tax returns, Clinton Foundation CEO Kevin Thurm wrote: \u201cAs has been previously reported this year, we saw a decline in revenue in 2016 that we had anticipated. Part of this is attributable to closing out the endowment campaign that ended in 2015, which has helped make our programs more sustainable. In addition, starting in 2015 when Secretary Clinton launched her presidential campaign, we voluntarily adopted restrictions on fundraising. But, as the examples of our progress listed above demonstrate, our programs\u2019 strong work continued in 2016 \u2013 and right into 2017.\u201d\n\nSome of the expanded programs undertaken by the foundation in 2017 include work to address the opioid crisis, improve community health access and improve school nutrition \u2014 all of which has been well-documented in various media outlets.\n\nIn August, Charity Navigator gave the Clinton Foundation a rating of four out of four stars. Guidestar says the foundation participates at its platinum level for transparency. And the Better Business Bureau concluded that the foundation met all 20 of its standards for charity accountability. It also enjoys an \u201cA\u201d rating from CharityWatch, a project of the American Institute of Philanthropy. (Early in the last presidential campaign, we debunked Republican claims that only a fraction of donations to the Clinton Foundation go to charitable works. The figure is closer to 88 percent, according to one independent philanthropy watchdog.) Forbes listed the Clinton Foundation as the 36th largest U.S. charity in 2016.\n\nIn early 2017, the Clinton Foundation did dramatically scale back the Clinton Global Initiative, which held an annual conference for corporate, government and nonprofit leaders to brainstorm on how best to tackle world issues. The New York Times reported in February that most of the initiative\u2019s 100 employees had been laid off.\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that while the high-profile annual meeting had been discontinued, CGI did not shut down completely, and would continue to host its CGI University meeting, which annually attracts more than 1,000 student leaders from around the globe. CGI also continues to convene community and government leaders on specific issues, such as a meeting this year to focus on improving women\u2019s access to health care in the Caribbean.\n\nConway also said that since the Clinton Foundation doesn\u2019t exist anymore (again, it clearly does), it \u201cmeans they aren\u2019t taking gazillions of dollars from countries that don\u2019t respect women and girls, wink wink.\u201d During the campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump criticized the Clinton Foundation for accepting millions of dollars from countries that \u201ctreat women horribly.\u201d The Washington Post reported that Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman were among the countries that have contributed.\n\nDuring the campaign, Clinton announced that she was stepping down from the foundation board, and that the foundation would only accept foreign donations for certain \u201ceconomic development or climate-focused work,\u201d namely from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. In August, BuzzFeed reported that the foundation is once again applying for grants from foreign governments. According to Cookstra, in the past year, the government of Germany made contributions to the foundation for the specific purpose of building health clinics in Malawi. He did not provide information on any other foreign donations.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans have been pushing U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate unsubstantiated accusations that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations in exchange for Clinton\u2019s help in allowing Russia to take control of Uranium One, a company with uranium mining rights in the U.S., when she was secretary of state. In November, Sessions asked federal prosecutors to \u201cevaluate\u201d whether the department should open an investigation. During a House judiciary hearing, Sessions rejected the idea that the department is dragging its feet, telling a Republican congressman, \u201cYou can have your idea but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it meets the standards it requires.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office about Conway\u2019s false claim that the Clinton Foundation \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d but it did not provide a response for publication.", "lang": "en"}
