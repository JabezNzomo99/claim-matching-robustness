The viral graphic is a collage of 3 images.\n\nThese two images are being shared with the claim that \"The Simpsons\" predicted that a police station would be set ablaze. However, image 2 is actually an unfinished housing complex, as reported by Snopes. The original photograph is attributed to the Associated Press. \"A multi-story affordable housing complex under construction near the Third Precinct, burns on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minn. Protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer Monday. (Mark Vancleave/Star Tribune via AP),\" reads the caption of the image. Image 1 is indeed from an episode of 'The Simpsons'. The image, however, has no connection to the protests, George Floyd, or police brutality. It refers to a joke the sitcom made about police incompetence. The episode from where the image is taken is titled, \"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\". It is the episode 6 of Season 11 of the show. In this, one of the main characters of the show, Homer decides to avoid traffic by driving along the grassy area next to the highway. He is subsequently pulled over by Springfield's Police Chief Wiggum. Homer then replies \"over there\" and points to burning Springfield police station. Below is a GIF of the moment:\n\n\n\nThe third image in the viral graphic shows Chief Wiggum kneeling on an African American's neck. This scene is similar to footages shot by witnesses which showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, with his knee on Floyd's neck. Lisa Simpson, another significant character of the show can be seen holding a \"Justice for George\" sign. This image is not from any episode by the Simpsons. A reverse image search of only image 3 led to a post on Instagram created by a user called Yuri Pomo. The image was posted on May 30, five days after Floyd's death.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Did 'The Simpsons' Writers Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak 27 Years Ago?", "lang": "en"}
