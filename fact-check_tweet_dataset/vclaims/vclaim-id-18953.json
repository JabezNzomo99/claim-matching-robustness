(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nDomain records show that the City News website was registered in China last month for a period of one year \u2014 a telltale sign that the site is bogus.\n\nMichael Pecha, public information officer for the Omaha Police Department, told PolitiFact in an email that the story is false; the OPD has had \"no incidents of this nature.\" We also reached out to the Des Moines Police Department and we\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.\n\nBut not all the stories on Facebook about police foiling shooting attempts are made-up.\n\nOn Aug. 1, federal agents in Lubbock, Texas, arrested a man they say was planning a mass shooting. William Patrick Williams, 19, reportedly told his grandmother that he had purchased an assault rifle and planned to \"shoot up\" a local hotel.", "lang": "en"}
