The only exception to this rule is the Prime Minister.\n\u2022 Ministers cannot use official vehicles for political activity.

Attempts have been made by the government to amend the Representation of People's Act, 1951; adding sections to add punitive teeth to punish infractions listed in the MCC. However, this amendment bill has not been passed.\n\nTherefore, the MCC as of now only stands as a guiding principle with no authority to punish.", "lang": "en"}
