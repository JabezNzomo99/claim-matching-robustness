Iran and Russia are protecting Syria and it\u2019s sort of amazing that we\u2019re in there fighting ISIS in Syria so we\u2019re helping the head of Syria who is not supposed to be our friend although he looks a lot better than some of our so-called friends. It\u2019s really rather amazing, maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS, let them fight and then you pick up the remnants.\u201d\n\nThe Fix counted 100 plus times that Trump has said the United States was a laughingstock. In the fall of 1987, Trump took out full-page advertisements in The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Boston Globe to argue that the United States should charge Japan for help protecting its oil tankers passing through the Persian Gulf. \u201cThe world is laughing at America\u2019s politicians as we protect ships we don\u2019t own, carrying oil we don\u2019t need, destined for allies who won\u2019t help,\u201d Trump wrote at the time.", "lang": "en"}
