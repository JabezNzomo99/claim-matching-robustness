Initially it was not a government initiative, but in April 2020 the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced in the daily coronavirus briefing that the government would be adopting it as \u201ca single brand for social care\u201d.\n\nA website for the badge company, which was run by everyLIFE Technologies, currently says: \u201cCARE badge brand rights have now been transferred to the Secretary of State for Health & Social Care.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo prevent the possible lopsided distribution of both CARE badges and information about their use, we have halted issuing badges and associated logos until the necessary new details are finalised.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the site, it says: \u201cBadges are no longer available from the CARE badge Community Interest Company.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the badge is currently available to purchase elsewhere.\n\nBadges were previously available from the website for \u00a31.20 each plus VAT and for a minimum order of 100 badges. It said that all profits went to care-related causes and charities.", "lang": "en"}
