It gives some examples of how to keep your pet restrained, like putting a dog in a harness attached to a seatbelt. Failing to do so, it claims, could mean you\u2019re given a fine of up to \u00a32,500 and penalty points on your licence, and says this may also invalidate insurance claims after accidents.\n\nIt is not an offence to travel with an unrestrained pet, but it could count against you if you have an accident. It\u2019s also unsafe for you and your pet.\n\nRule 57 of the Highway Code in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland says:\n\n\u201cWhen in a vehicle, make sure that dogs and other animals are suitably restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or injure you, or themselves if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of restraining animals in cars.\u201d\n\nBreaking the Highway Code isn\u2019t on its own an offence, but it can be used in court to show that you\u2019re liable for what happened after an accident if you didn\u2019t follow it.\n\nDriving with an unrestrained pet could contribute to something that is an offence, for example \u201ccareless and inconsiderate driving\u201d. Police can issue a fixed penalty notice on the spot\u2014which amounts to a fine of \u00a3100 and three points on the driver\u2019s licence\u2014in \u201clow harm\u201d cases. The driver has the option of refusing the fine and choosing to go to court instead. In more serious cases police can report the driver to be summonsed to court.\n\nThe Highway Code says this offence carries the possibility of an unlimited fine, possible disqualification from driving and between three and nine points on your licence.\n\nIf your case goes to court and you are sentenced then one of the factors that determines the extent of any fine, points and driving ban is how culpable you were in the offence.", "lang": "en"}
