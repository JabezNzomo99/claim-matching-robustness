If it isn\u2019t, then we\u2019re no closer to knowing how much will be spent on mental health.\n\nThe announcement is about where money that\u2019s already committed to NHS England will go\u2014it will be spent on mental health services rather than other parts of the NHS. It doesn\u2019t mean any new money from the government.\n\nWhat\u2019s new is the commitment from NHS England that \u00a31 billion will be invested in mental health services specifically. Even then, some of that had already been announced by the Prime Minister in January.\n\nNHS England told us the \u00a31 billion is a cash terms rise for mental health services.\n\nThe overall NHS England budget is set to grow by about \u00a319 billion by 2020/21 in cash terms, from \u00a3101 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a3120 billion.\n\nThe \u00a31 billion announcement makes up 5.4% of the total rise.\n\nLast year 11.9% of NHS England\u2019s budget went to mental health. It spent \u00a311.7 billion on mental health services in 2014/15 according to figures it reportedly released to social care website Community Care. That was out of a total budget of \u00a398.1 billion.\n\nThat means that for mental health spending to grow at the same rate as the rest of the NHS, around 11.9% of the \u00a319 billion extra that is given to NHS England needs to be spent on mental health. This works out at roughly \u00a32.2 billion.\n\nMost mental health spending is done by clinical commissioning groups, local bodies which receive money from NHS England and then purchase services from hospitals and other providers. There\u2019s nothing to stop them diverting more of their money to mental health services, and so the total NHS spend may well go to \u00a32.2 billion or over.\n\nThe fact is we don\u2019t know yet\u2014we don\u2019t know the commissioners\u2019 plans for this year, never mind in 2020/21. A panel of experts has recommended the commissioners should have to publish how much they spend on mental health from 2017/18 onwards.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know how much will be spent on mental health services by other parts of the government. Currently over half of spending on mental health services comes from outside the NHS, notably from local authorities.\n\nOverall, then, despite last week\u2019s announcement it\u2019s too early to know how much money will be available to mental health services in coming years.\n\nThe recommendations made by the mental health taskforce will be funded\n\nThe spending announcement follows recommendations given to NHS England by an independent taskforce. The taskforce thinks these will cost \u00a31 billion.\n\nSome of the money had already been announced.\n\nIn January the Prime Minister announced programmes which he said were worth \u00a3940 million over a period of five years.\n\nNHS England has confirmed to us that this spending is included in the annual \u00a31 billion. It gave us this statement:\n\nSo the recent announcement tells us there\u2019ll be at least \u00a31 billion extra for NHS mental health services, in five years\u2019 time, on top of what\u2019s spent today.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t tell us what the total amount spent on NHS services will be, or what will happen to overall funding for mental health.", "lang": "en"}
