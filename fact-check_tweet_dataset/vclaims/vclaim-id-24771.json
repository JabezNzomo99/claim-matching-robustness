It is being claimed that the man is Sudhanshu Trivedi, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP.

In the comparison posted below, it is evident that the two have distinct features.\n\nThis video of an unidentified man dancing with a woman at what seems like a private party is being maliciously shared with the narrative that it depicts the newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP, Sudhanshu Trivedi.
