It was actually written by Everett Dean Martin in a 1939 academic paper.\n\nSmith, an 18th century Scottish political economist and philosopher, was best known for his 1776 work \u201cAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,\u201d which explores the topics of division of labor, productivity and free markets in relation to national prosperity.\n\nWhile Smith supported limiting government control over the economy, he did not author the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying is not present in any of Smith\u2019s works. (RELATED: Did Immanuel Kant Say A Quote About Science And Wisdom?)\n\n\u201cAdam Smith did not write that,\u201d Wake Forest University political economist James Otteson told the Daily Caller via email. \u201cA phrase like \u2018industrial relations\u2019 sounds distinctly twentieth-century to my ears.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the saying was actually written by professor and adult education advocate Martin in a paper presented to the Annual Convention of the Investment Bankers Association of America in 1939, according to Quote Investigator. The words, however, were Martin\u2019s characterization of Smith\u2019s economic philosophy, not a direct quotation from Smith.", "lang": "en"}
