No, that's not true: It was a quote made up and tweeted by comedy writer Dan Lyons. The \"Silicon Valley\" writer later acknowledged it was fake, but only after it spread virally on social media and was believed by many.\n\nThe fake quote originated in a tweet posted by @realdanlyons on July 30, 2019 (archived here) which read:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAfter hours of Twitter going crazy over the quote, Lyons eventually conceded it was fake and he apologized -- sort of -- in another tweet:\n\nLyons apparently tweeted the fake quote as a joke, playing on a story about a Trump supporter who blamed Obama for the 9/11 attack and Trump's recent statement that he was on the ground after the attack.\n\nOf course, Obama was a state senator in Illinois in 2001 and would not have been aboard Air Force One with Joe Biden.\n\nAnother clue about Lyon's motivation for making up the quote and sharing it to his 38-thousand twitter followers may be in this earlier tweet from him:\n\nWe wrote about twitter.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Proof Of Life: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Confirms She's \"Very Much Alive,\" Disproving QAnon Conspiracy Theory\n\u2022 Fake News: Crayola Does NOT Rename Crayon Color in Honor Of Late Rapper Nipsey Hussle\n\u2022 Fake News: Warren Buffett Did NOT Tweet That Quote About Continuing To Suffer\n\u2022 Fake News: It Is NOT So Hot in Montgomery County That Corn Is Popping In The Field\n\u2022 Fake News: Rashida Tlaib Did NOT Tweet \"Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people.
