The claim is false; the photo actually shows a Buddhist ceremony in Thailand in 2015.\n\nThe posts, for example this one published to Facebook April 9, 2019, and shared more than 1,500 times since, claim that the photo was taken at a rally for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling BJP.\n\nModi is seeking re-election in national polls which began on April 11 and run until May 19. Here is an AFP report about India\u2019s election.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption says, translated to English: \u201cThis is the scene of a BJP rally in Bengal. This is Cooch Behar rally. Today Mamata and Bengal would've lost their sleep\u201d.\n\nCooch Behar is a district in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal; here is its local government website. Mamata refers to the chief minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, who belongs to the All India Trinamool Congress party. Here is her official Twitter page.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the false post:\n\nThe same photo has also been shared elsewhere with a similar claim, for example here on Twitter and here on Instagram with the caption \u201cModi Tsunami in Mangalore #NamoAgain #ModiOnceMore\u201d.\n\nIt was also shared on Facebook here on June 15, 2018, alongside a Hindi-language caption that references Bengal and Hinduism.\n\nIt says, translated to English: \u201cThe most difficult task in the world is to write \u2018Jai Shree Ram\u2019 with Bengali Hindus and share. Let\u2019s see how many Hindus can do this hard work\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found that the photo does not show a rally in India, but was taken in Thailand in 2015 during a Buddhist ceremony in the central city of Samut Sakhon, where more than 10,000 monks gathered to receive alms.\n\nThe photo appeared in this report on the Thai online Buddhist broadcaster DMC TV, headlined: \u201cTen thousand monks receive alms at Samut Sakhon\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the top of the report, which contains dozens of images of the event:\n\nThe first line of the English-language report says: \u201cOn October 25, 2015 the club of Buddhist tradition inheritance of Samut Sakhon and government-private sectors of Samut Sakhon organized the 2nd Alms-Offering ceremony to 10,000 Buddhist monks at Ekkachai Rd.\u201d\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the false Facebook post (L) and the photo as it appears on the DMC TV website (R):\n\nEkkachai Road, also spelled Ekachai Road, can be found here on Google Maps in the centre of Samut Sakhon city.\n\nThere are multiple similarities between the photo in the false Facebook post and images of that location on Google Street View.\n\nThese include a distinctive building painted yellow and white, the shape of the telegraph poles on the left of the road, and the surrounding landscape.\n\nSome of these have been circled in red in the comparison image below:", "lang": "en"}
