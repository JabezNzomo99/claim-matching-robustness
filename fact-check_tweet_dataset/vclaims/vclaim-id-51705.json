As time goes by, the media\u2019s obsession with the case is rapidly soaring. Singh\u2019s family had filed an FIR blaming his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty for his demise. Chakraborty, however, claimed that Singh\u2019s relationship with the family soured after his sister Priyanka molested her in April. The actor\u2019s family members subsequently released several videos to \u2018prove\u2019 that he was neither depressed nor had a bad relationship with them. In this backdrop. Aaj Tak\u2019s editor-in-chief Anjana Om Kashyap tweeted a video claiming it shows Singh dancing with his niece. \u201cSee this video of Sushant Singh Rajput.

It is noteworthy that both platforms of the India Today Group have dedicated fact-checking desks. In fact, the English vertical is a Facebook fact-checking partner and signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN).\n\nThe video has been published or aired across news organisations including, ABP News, Hindustan, Patrika, The Times of India, Times Now, India TV, News Nation and ABP News. \u201cAnother video of Sushant Singh Rajput has surfaced. In this video, Sushant is having fun with his niece Mallika. Uncle-niece duo is dancing together. This video clearly shows the kind of relationship Sushant shared with his family. Because Rhea is continuously alleging that his relationship with the family was bitter,\u201d wrote Aaj Tak.\n\n\u201cIn a new video, Sushant can be seen dancing with his niece. After watching Sushant having fun in such a video, it seems unlikely that he had ever been depressed,\u201d wrote News Nation.\n\nThe woman dancing with Singh is not his niece but Punjabi choreographer Manpreet Toor. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe all the news we read in the newspaper,\u201d she wrote sharing the same video on August 18.\n\nIn 2017, Toor had worked as a choreographer for a song in Singh\u2019s film \u2018Raabta\u2019. She had uploaded a photo with him on June 4, 2017, where both can be seen in the same clothes.\n\nFurthermore, on June 7, 2017, Toor had also shared a clip of the song from \u2018Raabta\u2019 where they can again be spotted in identical clothes.\n\nSeveral mainstream media outlets, therefore, ran a video of Sushant Singh Rajput dancing with his choreographer as his niece. Channels went to the extent of using the clip as \u2018evidence\u2019 of Singh\u2019s healthy relationship with his family. Prominent channels broadcast shows and discussions on the actor\u2019s niece after she wrote a lengthy comment on Instagram to counter the claims levelled on her family. Singh\u2019s death has been mired in controversies, most promoted by the media in the garb of \u2018journalism\u2019. The circus which is prime time news is not even close to the finish line as more and more unverified theories are propagated every day. As of this writing, out of the aforementioned channels, Aaj Tak and its editor-in-chief Anjana Om Kashyap tweeted a correction however their report remains to be updated. Aaj Tak had earlier published a false report on the \u2018last tweets\u2019 made by the actor. The tweets in question were posted by a fake account. The channel had also aired fake tweets of Singh\u2019s father KK Singh.", "lang": "en"}
