But Facebook posts, like these, chronicle story after story of truckers attempting to get meals at popular fast-food restaurants only to be turned away when they attempt to walk up and order at these drive-thru windows:\n\n\"***Glenshaw***This McDonalds is Refusing to serve truckers, because they can\u2019t drive through the drive-thru. The manager was disrespectful. They are out supplying (sic) are stores with food for all of us. They are out all night and can\u2019t eat or get a coffee?\"\n\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, there's more truth to the claim than not.\n\nFast-food restaurants including McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, KFC and Taco Bell recently announced they were shutting down dining rooms amid the coronavirus outbreak and switching to a to-go model, emphasizing delivery and drive-thru orders.\n\nSocial media posts say truckers can\u2019t maneuver their rigs through drive-thru lanes, so their only option is to walk up to the windows.\n\nTrucking news website Transportation Nation reported that one trucking group reached out to McDonald\u2019s on March 18 asking for changes to be made to allow truckers easier access to food.\n\n\"Truckers are having a difficult time finding food on the road due to various closures because of the national emergency,\" wrote James Lamb, president of the 15,000-member Small Business in Transportation Coalition. \"We are told they are being refused service when they walk up to your drive thru windows because they are not in sedans and their 80,000 lb. big rig trucks do not fit through your drive thru driveways.\"\n\nLamb asked the company to make temporary accommodations for trucker customers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s responded by creating a curbside ordering system. The fast-food chain pointed PolitiFact to a March 23 statement that addresses the issue:\n\n\"As the world continues to address the quickly changing landscape, we are in this together with you, our valued friends in the trucking and transportation industry. Thank you for everything you are doing to keep essential parts of our economy going.\n\n\"However, at some locations, only Drive-Thru and McDelivery are available. We realize that you can\u2019t bring your rig through the Drive-Thru and for safety reasons, we cannot accept walk up orders at the Drive-Thru window.\"\n\nMcDonald\u2019s instructed truckers to use its mobile order and pay app and then walk to \"the designated Trucker curbside sign on the sidewalk outside our designated door.\" An employee will bring the order out when it\u2019s ready.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just McDonald\u2019s. Reports of similar incidents at Wendy\u2019s and Burger King have also surfaced. We reached out to both, but only heard back from Wendy\u2019s. A spokesperson sent a statement saying Wendy\u2019s is \"particularly appreciative of the nation\u2019s truck drivers who are a vital part of our supply chain.\"\n\nIt continued: \"We are continuing to explore options to continue to make Wendy\u2019s food available to as many of our loyal customers as possible during this difficult time, but of course we must continue to focus on safety and security at our restaurants as a top priority.\"\n\nSocial media posts claim truck drivers are being turned away from fast-food restaurants with shuttered dining rooms since they can\u2019t fit their rigs in drive-thru lanes.\n\nThis is really happening. It\u2019s worth noting that McDonald\u2019s has responded with a curbside ordering app at some locations to help accommodate truckers. And Wendy\u2019s says they are exploring options.\n\nThese reports are accurate but need additional, updated information. We rate them Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
