They are not privileges exclusively awarded to Mr Duncan Smith. Around half of the claims are correct, subject to certain conditions, and the rest are not.\n\nMPs can claim for food, but it\u2019s not as much as \u00a377\n\nAll MPs are entitled to food expenses of up to \u00a325 per night if they stay overnight outside of their constituency and London. This can be for food bought during the day, but alcohol cannot be claimed as part of these expenses.\n\nMPs can claim expenses for some types of travel\n\nThey can claim back the cost of travel by public or private transport, taxis and hire cars if the travel is in support of the MP\u2019s parliamentary functions and:\n\u2022 they\u2019re going from Westminster to their constituency (unless they\u2019re a London MP and they\u2019re going to their home),\n\u2022 they\u2019re travelling within their constituency, unless it\u2019s between their home and constituency office,\n\u2022 they\u2019re taking extended UK travel for things like select committee matters, or constituency matters outside of the constituency,\n\u2022 they\u2019re taking journeys to and from other states in Europe.\n\nMPs\u2019 staff are eligible to claim for most of the same travel costs as MPs. Mr Duncan Smith claimed around \u00a32,800 in travel expenses in 2018/19, mainly for travel by his staff.\n\nMost MPs can claim for a second residence\n\nMPs are allowed to claim expenses for rent on a second residence or hotel costs if their constituency is outside London and they do not \u201cby virtue of any particular office held, occupy \u2018grace and favour\u2019 accommodation in London.\u201d As Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s constituency is in London, he can\u2019t claim accommodation expenses.\n\nMPs living in \u2018grace and favour\u2019 homes are also essentially receiving \u201cfree\u201d accommodation (for example, Boris Johnson lives rent free in the flat above 11 Downing Street).\n\nThey can claim for calls made from mobiles\n\nAll MPs are allowed to claim expenses for running constituency offices, which includes telephone costs.\n\nThis does seem to include mobile phone bills, as we found a number of MPs who had claimed back such costs, including Mr Duncan Smith.\n\nThe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) says MPs should only claim for the proportion of telephone calls that \u201chave been incurred for parliamentary purposes\u201d.\n\nMPs can claim for stationery used in their offices, as part of their budget to \u201cmeet the costs of renting, equipping and running\u201d their constituency offices. They are not allowed to claim for stationery provided by the House of Commons.\n\nMr Duncan Smith claimed back \u00a31,364 on purchases classed by IPSA as office stationery in 2018/19.\n\nThere is a gym for parliamentary staff, including MPs, but it\u2019s not free. The gym told Full Fact that MPs have to pay a monthly fee to join, which is around \u00a325 to \u00a335 per month depending on whether they want to use the gym at peak times or not.\n\nMPs (as well as parliamentary staff and visitors) can eat and drink in parliament\u2019s bars and restaurants. While this food and drink is not directly subsidised, catering services across the House of Commons run at a loss, meaning that public money is effectively spent subsidising the overall catering operation.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where the claim that taxpayers subsidise \u00a37 in every \u00a310 of MPs\u2019 food comes from. In 2018/19, the total costs of the catering service (which the House of Commons classes as the cost minus the sales income) was \u00a32.6 million.\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information request in 2018, the House of Commons said MPs \u201cmake up a very small proportion of overall customers who use the catering services of the House of Commons\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
