England and Wales have seen the fewest new homes completed per year during peacetime since the 1920s, according to official statistics.\n\n2010 saw the lowest level, with 112,000 homes being built across England and Wales. In 2015 this increased to 149,000.\n\nBut the number of new homes has been falling since the 1960s. Before 2010, the period with the second lowest level of house building was seen under Labour in the early 2000s.\n\n\n\nThis isn't a new claim; we\u2019ve looked at it before in more detail.\n\nWe updated this piece to make it clearer when the lowest levels of house building were.", "lang": "en"}
