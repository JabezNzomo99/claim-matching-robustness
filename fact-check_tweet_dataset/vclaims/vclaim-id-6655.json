The fact that a free school has been approved implies that there\u2019s bottom-up demand and the Department for Education has agreed there\u2019s a need.\n\nBut that \u2018need\u2019 isn\u2019t always a basic need for more places.\n\nIt is much of the time. 83% of free schools since 2013 were started in areas that didn\u2019t have enough school places, according to the Department for Education.\n\nBut not all of them were. As the National Audit Office point out, 46 secondary free schools (21% of the total) are in council areas which haven\u2019t needed more places overall since 2009/10, and won\u2019t need more up to 2019/20.\n\nFree schools can also be approved if the standard of local schools is poor, judged either in terms of poor Ofsted ratings or pupil performance.\n\nHalf of new places in mainstream free schools opening between 2015 and 2021 will help meet a shortage in the area, according to estimates from the Department for Education. It expects the other half to create spare capacity in the local schools system.\n\nAnd that\u2019s part of the plan. One idea behind the Free Schools Programme is that giving parents more choice increases competition between schools and drives up standards overall. If new free schools prove more popular with parents then they\u2019ll draw away pupils from other schools, and those pupils take government funding with them.\n\nFor now, too few free schools have been running long enough to say whether this works in practice, according to the National Audit Office. There isn\u2019t enough data to say whether free schools push standards in other local schools up or down.", "lang": "en"}
