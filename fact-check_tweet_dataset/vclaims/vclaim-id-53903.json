But the nice part is that it's been around for a long time so we know that if it \u2013 if things don't go as planned it's not going to kill anybody. When you go with a brand new drug, you don't know that that's gonna happen. You have to see and you have to go long tests, but this has been used in different forms, very powerful drug in different forms.\n\n\"And it's shown very encouraging \u2013 very, very encouraging early results. And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that's where the FDA has been so great. They \u2013 they've gone through the approval process; it's been approved.
