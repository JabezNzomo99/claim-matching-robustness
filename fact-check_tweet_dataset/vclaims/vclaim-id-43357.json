We\u2019ve included screenshots of the most relevant tweets below:\n\nFactually speaking, we didn\u2019t find much to quibble with in Boggs\u2019 thread.\n\nTriscuit crackers were developed in the early 1900s, and early advertisements did tout the \u201cwheat biscuits\u201d as being \u201cbaked by electricity.\u201d For example, this ad was published in The Montgomery Advertiser in September 1903:\n\nAt first, however, we weren\u2019t entirely convinced that this electric baking method served as the inspiration for the Triscuit name. In fact, Boggs\u2019 thread left us with more questions than answers. Wouldn\u2019t the letters \u201cele\u201d better signify this product\u2019s relationship to electricity? Why not \u201cElescuits\u201d? And aren\u2019t Triscuit snacks marketed today as crackers, not biscuits? Why not \u201cTricker\u201d? Does \u201ctri\u201d really not refer to \u201cthree\u201d? Not thrice-baked, not three ingredients, not three of anything?\n\nAnd what exactly does \u201cbaked by electricity\u201d mean? In short, we just don\u2019t trust these crackers.\n\nWe went digging in the archives to learn more about the origins of Triscuit. Our working theory was based on the etymology of the word \u201cbiscuit,\u201d which was derived from the medieval Latin word \u201cbiscoctum,\u201d meaning \u201ctwice-baked.\u201d The quiz show Jeopardy used this logic for a clue during a 2018 episode, positing: \u201cThe name of this cracker that\u2019s been around since 1903 suggests that it was baked 3 times.\u201d\n\nHowever, we were unable to find any advertisements or company materials describing the Triscuit as a thrice-baked cracker.\n\nIn fact, what we did find about the Triscuit cooking process supported the idea that it was truly an electric biscuit. The story of the Triscuit starts in the late 1800s when a man named Henry D. Perky developed a machine to produce little square biscuits made of shredded wheat. (You can see one of Perky\u2019s early patents from 1900 here).\n\nPerky\u2019s inventions not only produced a tasty treat, they were also a major development in food manufacturing. A 1904 article in Western Electrician described how Triscuit crackers were baked, and praised the Natural Food Company for making \u201cthe largest development of electric cooking in the world\u201d that had been \u201csuccessful in every way.\u201d\n\nIn the winter of 1902-3, about a year and a half ago, the Natural Food Company of Niagara Falls, N.Y., began the manufacture of a new product they call Triscuit, it being a cracker of shredded wheat baked or toasted by having heat applied to both sides at the same time. The operation consists of passing the product through a machine between two endless link belts enclosed except at one end. The links of the belts are electric stoves, and are so arranged that the Triscuit is fed in and held pressed between the faces of the two stoves throughout the complete circuit of the machine. The operation is continuous. Each machine has about 2,500 stoves and has a product of 17,500 triscuits an hour. They are operating about 10,000 of these stoves, and their failures up to date have been less than one per cent from all causes. This is the largest development of electric cooking in the world, and is successful in every way; the cost for baking, including labor, being less for the same amount of product of triscuits than for shredded whit biscuit using coal.\n\nWhen we first came across the \u201celectric biscuit\u201d advertisement in Boggs\u2019 thread above, it seemed to be more of a clever advertising gimmick then a core aspect of a Triscuit. However, as noted in the article in Western Electrician, the electric baking process of a Triscuit was a major development in the food production world.\n\nA cookbook of shredded wheat recipes presented by the Shredded Wheat Company in 1911 also noted that the Triscuit cooking process had \u201cattracted the attention of electricians from all over the world\u201d:\n\nThe following advertisement from a 1903 issue of American Motherhood called the Triscuit \u201cthe highest achievement known to the science of food production.\u201d\n\nAnother pair of early advertisements from 1903 emphasized the \u201celectric\u201d aspect of this shredded wheat snack:\n\nWhile we were busy combing through information from the 1900s, the answer to this pressing question popped up in a more modern medium: The official Twitter account for Triscuit caught wind of Boggs\u2019 thread and updated the company\u2019s profile to include lightning bolts and the text: \u201celecTRIcity biSCUIT\u2026 but you can just call us Triscuit #ifykyk.\u201d (If you know, you know.)\n\nTriscuit also posted a message in response to Bogg\u2019s thread, reading: \u201cWe had to go all the way up the ladder but we CAN confirm.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. Triscuit crackers were named not because they contain three ingredients, or comprise three layers, or because they were baked three times, but because they were baked by electricity.\n\nOur search into the origins of the Triscuit came with quite a few surprises, but the most shocking (pun intended) to us cracker-eaters was how Triscuit was advertised as something of miracle food. It was good for children, made purely of \u201cGod\u2019s creation\u201d (wheat), and could be eaten at any time of day, according to promotional materials. We also found several cookbooks featuring Triscuit recipes, and while many sounded appealing, such as Triscuit with cheese, butter, or jam, we must direct your attention to the \u201cKing\u2019s Menu\u201d from volume 16 of the 1903 book The King and His Navy and Army.\n\nThe King\u2019s Menu included three Triscuit dishes: Triscuit Croutons, Cream Fruit Triscuit, and Pigeons on Triscuit Toast:", "lang": "en"}
