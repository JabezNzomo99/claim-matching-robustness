I don't mean to disturb. Just help share so my son can get more prayers. 8YEARs OLD BOY NEED CHAIN PRAYER. He have Coronavirus\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the picture is misleading. The picture has been circulating on the Internet for over a year and it has nothing to do with coronavirus.\n\nThe post, uploaded on April 29, has been shared more than 2.04 lakh times till the filing of this story. Over 63,000 Facebook users have reacted to it. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the post.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found that the viral picture has been available on social media for more than a year. A Facebook page by the name \"Anddy World\" had posted the picture on February 28, 2019, with a caption in Spanish. At that time, the world was not infected with coronavirus.\n\nWe could not ascertain the identity of the kid or what he was suffering from, but it is certain that the picture is more than a year old and not related to coronavirus.\n\nThis is not the first time that random or old pictures have been passed off on social media with false claims related to Covid-19. A few days back, a set of three unrelated images were shared as an appeal by a man to help his wife and daughter, both of whom are infected with coronavirus according to the claim.\n\nAFWA had debunked this misleading post too. Such fake posts are created deliberately to trap social media users emotionally for more shares and clicks.", "lang": "en"}
