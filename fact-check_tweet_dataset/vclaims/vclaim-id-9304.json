Viktor Komoyedov, Chairman of the Defense Committee in the Russian State Duma, did not elaborate in his August 24 comments. Polling data, however, shows attitudes toward the alliance remain largely favorable in its member states.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "August 24, 2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9304", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-nato-policies-western-opinions-/28088151.html", "vclaim": "In his August 24 comments, Komoyedov does not specify which \u201caggressive\u201d NATO policies are not supported by \u201ca majority of people in Europe and the United States,\u201d or explain how analyzing critical statements by opposition factions in the West would reveal this lack of support.\n\n\n\n It is true that polling data shows wariness among NATO members about a military confrontation with Russia. A Pew Research Center survey published in spring 2015 found that around 50 percent or fewer respondents in six of the eight NATO nations surveyed supported using their countries\u2019 military forces to defend a NATO ally neighboring Russia in the event that \u201cRussia got into a serious military conflict\u201d with that nation.\n\n\n\n But available polls don't specifically ask about NATO\u2019s \"aggressive policies,\" perhaps because such a question would reflect a value judgment.\n\n\n\n Overall attitudes toward NATO remain largely positive among member nations, according to a spring 2016 Pew Center survey. A median of 57 percent of respondents across the 11 nations surveyed expressed a favorable opinion of NATO, while a median of 27 percent voiced an unfavorable view, according to the poll. The survey was published two years after Russia\u2019s seizure and annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea territory and the start of the subsequent war between Kyiv\u2019s forces and Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country. NATO has been a staunch supporter of Kyiv and a fierce critic of Moscow in the conflict, which has prompted the alliance to endorse new major troop deployments in Eastern Europe in response to Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n Komoyedov, a former commander of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, was responding to remarks by U.S. General Joe Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who on August 23 accused Russia of seeking to \u201cundermine\u201d NATO with its actions in Eastern Europe and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.", "lang": "en"}
