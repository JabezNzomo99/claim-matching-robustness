Her Facebook post making this claim ignited a firestorm that resulted in the language being removed from the final legislation. In 2011, the Obama administration even deleted all references to end-of-life planning in a new Medicare regulation when opponents interpreted the move as a backdoor effort to allow such planning.\n\nSince the death-panel issue supposedly had been eliminated, the Fact Checker reached out to Akins to find out why he thought it was still relevant. He responded that he had conflated two pieces of information, and so had bungled his comment. Here\u2019s what he says he was trying to say.\n\nAkins spoke up at a town hall event hosted by Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis (R-Fla.). Akins said the session had been packed with Democrats, eager to confront the lawmaker over plans to repeal Obamacare. Akins, who is secretary of the Pasco County Republican Executive Committee, rose to pose his own question. He said he was not speaking as a GOP official, but identified himself because others at the meeting had given their political affiliations. He now says that was a mistake, in part because \u201cI think it closed some ears.\u201d\n\nWhen he referred to a death panel, Akins said he was actually talking about something in the law called the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The IPAB, to be made up of 15 experts appointed by the president and subject to Senate confirmation, is primarily charged with helping to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending.\n\nAkins said he was concerned that, in the absence of an appointed board, the power would rest with the secretary of Health and Human Services, and he wanted Bilirakis\u2019s assurance that it would not be used to create death panels. (The new HHS secretary is former congressman Tom Price (R-Ga.), a longtime foe of the law.)\n\nThe IPAB actually appears to mimic the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which was designed in the late 1980s by then-Rep. Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) with the backing of the Reagan administration. That commission was empowered to make politically difficult decisions of closing military bases, thus limiting the influence of lobbyists and in effect letting Congress off the hook in making the tough decisions.\n\nIn the interview, Akins acknowledged that the health-care law explicitly says that the recommendations cannot lead to rationing of health care. (See page 428.) But he believed such guarantees were worthless, ticking off other examples of when Congress later changed its mind. \u201cIPAB is like a little ticking time bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be death panels.\u201d\n\nHe said he was referring to a provision in the law in which the ACA was advising doctors that some medical procedures were no longer necessary after a certain age. \u201cI read the age 74 in one article,\u201d he said. \u201cI confused the testing that can no longer be done with the actual IPAB. It was an understandable conflation.\u201d\n\nThe email was based on a letter to the River Cities Tribune (circulation 5,000), written in August 2009, by a former county judge named David Kithil of Marble Falls, Tex. Back in 2011, he told the Fact Checker that he had assessed an earlier version of the law and that some of his concerns had been addressed. In any case, Kithil is not a health-care expert and many of his claims have long been debunked.\n\nThe dispute over the IPAB centers on a philosophical divide between the two major parties. Democrats would rely on independent experts (such as doctors and consumer advocates) to recommend the cuts; Republicans, through the Medicare plan advanced by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), would rely on the insurance marketplace to control costs. We cannot fact check deeply held philosophical beliefs, except to note that such differences sometimes loom larger than they really are and prevent people from acknowledging obvious similarities in their ultimate goals.", "lang": "en"}
