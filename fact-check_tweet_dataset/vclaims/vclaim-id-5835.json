Reuters has contacted Harris to ask whether this image is an authentic reproduction of her birth certificate, and this check will be updated accordingly. Regardless of authenticity, the claim that this image proves that Harris\u2019 birth certificate identifies her as \u201cCaucasian\u201d is false.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nThe image of the birth certificate shows a red circle around the portion of the certificate that would ostensibly prove the claim. A closer look at the image shows that this section indicates the \u201ccolor or race of the mother,\u201d listed as \u201cCaucasian.\u201d A few lines beneath it, the \u201ccolor or race of the father,\u201d is listed as \u201cJamaican.\u201d\n\nThe image of the certificate does not appear to specify Kamala Harris\u2019 race, contrary to the posts\u2019 claim.\n\nThe senator\u2019s late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Tamil Indian-American. Gopalan graduated from the University of Delhi and then received a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology from UC Berkeley, ( here ).\n\nHarris\u2019 father, Donald Harris, immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica in 1964 to pursue a doctorate degree in economics at the University of California, Berkeley, ( here ).\n\nJamaica\u2019s population largely consists of those descended from enslaved Africans brought by the English to work the island\u2019s sugar estates, ( here ). As of 2012, 90% of Jamaicans were of African origin, ( here ).\n\nUntil the landmark 1967 Supreme Court case ruling, Loving v. Virginia, a person was considered white \u201conly if they had \u2018no trace whatsoever of any blood other than Caucasian.\u2019\u201d ( here ).\n\nBirth certificates and associated data collection have been revised over the years, ( go.nature.com/3iDIYob ). Prior to 1989, if parents were not of the same race, a child's race was tabulated as the race of the non-white parent. If neither parent was white, the child\u2019s race was assigned as the race of the father, with exception to Hawaiian parents, ( here ).\n\nReuters previously debunked similar claims related to Kamala Harris\u2019s background and ancestry ( here ).\n\nFalse. Image purportedly of Kamala Harris\u2019s birth certificate does not identify her as \u201cCaucasian.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
