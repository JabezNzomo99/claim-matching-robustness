The latest figures only go up to students who started in 2014/15, so we don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s happened more recently yet.\n\n6.2% of UK young, full-time undergraduate students at university for the first time dropped out after their first year in 2014/15, up from 5.7% in 2012/13\u2014the year that \u00a39,000 tuition fees were introduced.\n\nSo that\u2019s a 0.5 percentage point change over two years, not a percentage change year on year.\n\nDrop-out rates also rose in Scotland after 2012/13, where students don\u2019t have to pay fees, before falling back slightly in 2014/15. Scotland also has the highest dropout rate of UK countries at 6.5%.\n\nThese figures only cover students who don\u2019t start their second year. Overall, it\u2019s projected that 10.3% of students on their first degree will leave without a degree or being transferred to another programme, up slightly from 10.1% in 2012/13 but lower than as much as 16% in the late 1990s.\n\nDrop-out rates are low historically, and higher for mature and disadvantaged students\n\nThese rates are still lower than the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the UK rate hit nearly 8% and in Scotland and Northern Ireland peaked at around 11%.\n\nOverall mature students are more likely to drop out of full-time degrees than younger students. The same figures show 11.7% of mature first-time undergraduates dropped out in the UK in 2014/15, which was down slightly from 11.9% in 2012/13.\n\nDisadvantaged students are also more likely than their peers to drop out. For the 20% most disadvantaged students, the rate increased from 7.6% in 2012/13 to 8.8% in 2014/15. We\u2019ve factchecked the figures in more detail before.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the exact reasons why dropout rates have crept up\n\nThe Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)\u2014which publishes the data on dropout rates\u2014doesn\u2019t have figures on why students are choosing to drop out of their courses.\n\nThe effect of tuition fee rises on dropout rates isn\u2019t easy to predict, and there are actually arguments that increases in fees may reduce dropout rates because only students less likely to drop out in the first place may choose to apply.\n\nThis can work both ways though\u2014the same researchers behind those arguments have also said in the past that the large increase to \u00a39,000 a year could make students more reluctant to borrow money, and so increase dropout rates.\n\nWe can expect data on this subject later this year, so we\u2019ll know a bit more then about the effect the 2012 changes may have had.", "lang": "en"}
