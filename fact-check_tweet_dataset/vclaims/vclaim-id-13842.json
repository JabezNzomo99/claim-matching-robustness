He added that the \u201cso-called Novichok\u201d could be produced anywhere in Europe.\n\nThis contradicts the testimony of one the scientist-developers of Novichok \u2013 Vil Mirzoyanov, outlined in his 2009 book, State Secrets: An Insider's Chronicle Of The Russian Chemical Weapons Program.\n\nWhen pushed on the presence of GRU agents \u201csightseeing in Salisbury\u201d on the day of the poisoning, Yakovenko replied that this was \u201cthe story of the British press and also the government, but unfortunately it\u2019s not supported by the facts.\u201d\n\nYakovenko cited the interview the suspects conducted with RT\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan, in which the men \u201cofficially\u201d said \u201cthey are not part of the GRU,\u201d as proof the British version of events is not correct.\n\nHe added that the British side could have the \u201copportunity\u201d to question them but Russia was \u201cnever asked for that.\u201d\n\nOn April 6, Yakovenko also met with Charlie Rowley, who along with his partner Dawn Sturgess, was poisoned after using a perfume bottle suspected to have been designed to conceal the Novichok employed in the Skripal attack.\n\nRowley noted the bottle he presented to Sturgess as a gift had been unopened, leading to speculation that another perfume bottle, and possibly another assassination team, were involved in the operation against Skripal.\n\nWhile Rowley would survive with a number of persisting health complications, Sturgess died.\n\nWhen asked about that meeting, Rowley said the \u201crevelatory\u201d meeting was short on answers, adding the Russian ambassador fed him \u201cRussian propaganda.\u201d\n\nA Russian state media report on that meeting characterized Rowley and other victims as \u201cbeing kept in the dark about what really happened to them.\u201d\n\nAnother victim of the attack, Detective Sgt Bailey, who came into contact with the nerve agent after being sent to the Skripals' home, told the BBC \"he had lost everything\" because of Novichok.\n\nIn September 2018, The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed that the same chemical nerve agent that poisoned Sturgess and Rowley was employed in the attack on the Skripals.\n\nIn April of that year, the OPCW backed the UK government\u2019s findings that that agent was the military-grade nerve agent Novichok. But the OPCW was not able to determine the origin of the Novichok. The identity of the poisoning suspects, however, is another matter.\n\nThe suspects, operating under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, claimed during their interview with RT to be \u201cjust friends, civilians, tourists who went to Salisbury to visit the famous cathedral.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ambassador Karen Pierce, UK Permanent Representative to the UN, the trail of evidence is quite clear.\n\n\u201cCCTV and other evidence records their travel to and from Salisbury and crucially, there are images which clearly places them in the vicinity of the Skripal\u2019s house at 11:58 A.M. on Sunday, 4 March. This was moments before the attack took place, which involved placing the substance on the Skripal\u2019s front door handle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe police timeline had the suspects returning to Moscow on the same day the Skripals were poisoned.\n\nIn November 2018, British authorities released CCTV footage showing the suspects, whom Bellingcat identified as GRU agents Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga (Boshirov) and Dr. Alexander Mishkin (Petrov), walking past a gas station on Wilton Road near the Skripals\u2019 home -- despite the fact that the cathedral, whose spire is visible from the train station, is in the opposite direction of the Skripal\u2019s home.\n\nTraces of Novichok were later found in the London hotel where the two men stayed.\n\nBellingcat determined that Chepiga grew up in a small village near Russia\u2019s border with China. That fact was later confirmed by local residents.\n\nOne woman told the Russian daily Kommersant that Chepiga served in \u201cthe secret service\u201d in various \u201chot spots\u201d after graduating from a military academy. Another told the BBC: \"I know where his parents used to live, that he was a military man. An officer. He fought in war zones, then he was in Moscow.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"It's him in the photos, of course.\"\n\nFormer neighbors also confirmed that Petrov was in fact Mishkin.\n\nYevgeny Sergeyevich, who grew up in Miskhin\u2019s home village of Loyga, told the Telegraph: \u201cHe [Mishkin] became a Hero of Russia three or four years ago. I heard about it from acquaintances in Loyga who are still in touch with him.\u201d\n\nAt the Far Eastern Military Academy where Chepiga was enrolled, Radio Liberty also found his portrait among those who had received the Hero of the Russian Federation award.\n\nBellingcat would also discover that a third GRU agent, Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeyev, was in the UK at the time of the poisoning.\n\nAs for the UK declining to question them, the UK has charged Chepiga and Mishkin in absentia for conspiracy to murder, attempted murder and use of the nerve agent Novichok.\n\n\"As the Russian ambassador is aware, the Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to face criminal charges overseas. However if either of the two individuals charged in this case travel outside of Russia, we will make every effort to ensure that they are brought to the UK to face justice in a British court. The UK has repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury in March last year, and they have replied with obfuscation and lies.\"\n\nBased on the available evidence, Polygraph.info finds Yakovenko\u2019s claim that Russia\u2019s involvement in the poisoning is \u201cnot supported by the facts\u201d to be false.", "lang": "en"}
