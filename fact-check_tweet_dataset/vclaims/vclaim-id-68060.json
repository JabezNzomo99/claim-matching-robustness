Sarah Palin tried to take a hammer to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama\u2019s postpartisan campaign tack.\n\n\u201cNow, Barack Obama, of course, he\u2019s pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line,\u201d Palin said, questioning whether he could reduce polarization in Washington.\n\nIn fact, Obama \u2014 who joined the Senate in 2005 \u2014 has voted with his party 96 percent of the time, according to a study by Congressional Quarterly . CQ\u2019s calculation of party unity measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. By comparison, rival Sen. John McCain has voted with his fellow Republicans at an 81 percent clip over the entire Bush presidency.\n\nBut as PolitiFact has reported before , voting studies can be skewed depending on a lot of factors, such as attendance, the roll-call votes picked and the issues that arise during the course of the year.
