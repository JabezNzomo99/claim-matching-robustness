The family claimed that the doctor administered some injection, half an hour after which he died. Later he was declared as COVID-19 positive. His friends and family questioned why a COVID test was not done and why an injection was administered before a test was done. Since it was later told to them that the patient had bee COVID positive, the family asked why the treatment was not done on those lines right from the start.\n\nDr R. N. Cooper Municipal General Hospital is a public hospital located in Mumbai. It is owned by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and is operated under a public-private partnership. Addressing the allegations, BMC said that the boy was treated following the guideline laid down by the ICMR. \"He was bleeding from the mouth and was immediately given primary aid. Symptoms of pneumonia were seen. Symptoms of pneumonia & COVID are similar, cause of death was registered as pneumonia & suspected COVID. As per ICMR protocol, his body was handed over to Police but the family got agitated,\" the civic body said. Calling the allegations on the hospital and municipal authorities unfortunate, BMC added that \"hospital management did what was prescribed under ICMR guidelines & patient was immediately admitted and was given the required treatment.
