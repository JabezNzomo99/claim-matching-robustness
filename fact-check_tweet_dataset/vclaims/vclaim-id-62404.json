Contrary to popular belief, a Red Notice is not an arrest warrant.\n\n\u201cA senior Iranian judge says INTERPOL Red Notices have been issued for the prosecution of dozens of military and political officials of the United States, including President Donald Trump, on charges of planning and implementing a terrorist attack in the Iraqi capital that assassinated Iran\u2019s top general Qassem Soleimani and his companions,\u201d Press TV stated.\n\nLater on the same day as the Iranian announcement, INTERPOL issued a statement saying that it would refuse to consider such red notice requests. It noted that article 3 of the organization\u2019s governing constitution strictly forbids \u201cintervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info attempted to reach INTERPOL for additional clarification, but received no response. The White House also declined to comment on the matter. A search of INTERPOL\u2019s Red Notice database reveals no such notice for Donald Trump.\n\nQassem Soleimani was commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, a covert force that has had a hand in conflicts throughout the region and which the United States and other countries have designated as a terrorist organization. On Jan. 3, Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike while in Baghdad after Iranian-backed Iraqi militias launched rocket attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq, killing one U.S. citizen.\n\nINTERPOL\u2019s own claim that it rejects any red notices that are politically motivated is itself somewhat misleading, as the organization has a long been criticized for issuing red notices on behalf of authoritarian governments for the purpose of persecuting or silencing dissidents.\n\nRussia has issued a number of red notices seen as politically motivated. They included red notices for Ukrainian citizens and for Bill Browder, a British citizen and prominent Putin critic.\n\nA U.S.-born businessman, Browder co-founded Hermitage Capital in Russia and was forced out of the country in 2005. After his firm\u2019s lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky, died in Russian prison, Browder became a leading force for the Global Magnitsky Act, a law that allows imposing sanctions against persons involved in human rights violations and corruption.\n\nBrowder\u2019s involvement with the West's sanctions policies made him a target of the Russian government. On seven occasions, Russia has asked Interpol to issue red notices for Browder, most of which were rejected on the grounds that they were political. However, in 2018, Browder was briefly detained in Spain and later denied entry to the U.S. on the basis of a Russian INTERPOL warrant.\n\nPresident Trump has what is known as head-of-state immunity, similar to diplomatic immunity, meaning he cannot be arrested or detained upon arrival on foreign territory.\n\nINTERPOL is the International Criminal Police Organization, an inter-governmental law enforcement collaborative with 194 member countries.", "lang": "en"}
