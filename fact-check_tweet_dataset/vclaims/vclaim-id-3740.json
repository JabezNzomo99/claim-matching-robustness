The caption reads:\n\nHowever, the post does not mention that McDole was actually shot and killed on 23 September 2015. The incident led to anger toward police and a lawsuit filed by McDole\u2019s family which resulted in a $1.5 million settlement being awarded to them in December 2016.\n\nAccording to reports, police encountered McDole after receiving reports about a man in a wheelchair who had allegedly shot himself. Cellphone camera footage of McDole\u2019s death shows an officer approaching him with his gun drawn yelling, \u201cShow me your hands!\u201d The camera moves down as a gunshot can be heard. Seconds later, more officers approach McDole with their own weapons drawn. McDole\u2019s hands can be seen moving from his waist to his legs and he can be seen adjusting himself in the chair, which he used after being shot when he was 18 years old.\n\nAs McDole\u2019s hands move toward the front of his jeans, the officers fire on him. Despite being described as having a gun, no firearm is visible near him. Investigators later said that they recovered a .38-caliber handgun by his side, an allegation that McDole\u2019s family questioned.\n\nThe family sued both the city of Wilmington and the police department in March 2016, saying that McDole was the victim of \u201cgrossly excessive and wanton lethal force\u201d on the part of police.\n\nTwo months later, the state state Department of Justice released a report stating that the four officers involved \u2014 Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose, Cpl. Thomas Lynch, Cpl. James MacColl, and Senior Cpl. Danny Silva \u2014 would not be charged in connection with McDole\u2019s death.\n\nIn January 2017, the United States Justice Department also said that it would not pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officer, saying there was insufficient evidence to disprove the officers\u2019 claims that they shot McDole in self-defense.", "lang": "en"}
