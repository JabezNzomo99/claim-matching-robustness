No, that's not true: a meme making that claim uses an image that has been found to be a forgery by fact checkers working with Facebook at the time it was originally posted. The banner in the original photo the meme was based on read \"Trump makes America hate, our students make America great\", it did not call for anyone to be assassinated. Facebook has policies in place that ban incitement to violence and that aim to reduce the spread of false news.\n\nAn example of the meme can be found in this post (archived here) where it was published on September 20, 2019. It contained an image of protesters holding a banner that appeared to read \"Assassinate Republicans that defeat Democrats, Make America Great\" along with a yellow caption that read \"openly calling for Assassination\" and a white one that went like this\n\nHere is the image in question:\n\nFirst of all, Facebook's Community Standards on hate speech do not apply here, since the definition they use does not include political affiliation:\n\nThe statement might run afoul of the Community Standards on \"Violence and Criminal Behavior\" though, specifically the section on \"Violence and incitement\":\n\nThreats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following:\n\u2022 Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or\n\u2022 Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to represent violence; or Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or assassin against a target.\n\nSo if you spot calls for assassination on Facebook, go ahead and report them and they should be taken down.\n\nBut this image also runs counter to Facebook's policy on \"False News\":\n\nReducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take seriously. We also recognize that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we don't remove false news from Facebook but instead, significantly reduce its distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed.

Read on...\n\nIt appears the photo started out like this:\n\nIt was apparently taken at a 2016 rally in Chicago, you can see the same people and the same banner in a Tweet that was posted at the time:\n\nLater it got digitally altered to add captions and a falsified slogan on the banner:\n\nThen somebody cropped the image and added a different caption in yellow:\n\nThose version of the image were fact checked and found to be false by Snopes in 2018, when they were still working with Facebook as part of their partnership with independent third-party fact checkers:\n\nYet here we are in 2019 and people are reposting this image with yet another caption layered over it. And as you can see we just added our own caption (\"Layered Hoax\") because we are now also part of the third-party fact checking partnership and it is our job to inform people about hoaxes like these.", "lang": "en"}
