He promised to ban semi-automatic firearms and large-capacity magazines used in mass shootings, and criticized Trump for fueling a \u201crising tide\u201d of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the El Paso shooting, police believe that the alleged shooter, Patrick Crusius, 21, posted an anti-immigrant manifesto shortly before the shooting. \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,\u201d reads the document, which echoes some of the language that Trump has used to describe immigrants seeking asylum or trying to cross the border illegally.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem with this rising tide of supremacy, white supremacy in America, and we have a president who encourages and emboldens it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut Biden got his facts wrong in one example of what he called Trump\u2019s \u201ctoxic tongue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump regularly used the term \u201cinvasion\u201d when referring to illegal immigration at the southern border. USA Today found that he used that word at least 19 times in 64 rallies since 2017.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t say immigrants would \u201ccarve you up with a knife.\u201d He said that about gang members at an Oct. 22, 2018 rally in Houston for Sen. Ted Cruz. At the time, Cruz was running for reelection and facing an unexpectedly tough challenge from then-Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Rourke even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to deport them. He says they\u2019re people. They\u2019re people. They carve you up with a knife, but they\u2019re people.\u201d\n\nA 2005 National Gang Threat Assessment report said MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a \u201cprimarily El Salvadoran\u201d gang that originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s and spread to the East Coast. The gang includes U.S. citizens and immigrants, including some illegal immigrants.\n\nThe gang\u2019s brutal methods for killing its victims have been a staple of Trump\u2019s political events for quite some time. He often relates how MS-13 gang members prefer knives, instead of guns, because they inflict more pain.\n\nTrump, July 25, 2017: One by one we are finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals and killers. And we are sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in. Believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and prey on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful, innocent young people will find no safe haven anywhere in our country. And you\u2019ve seen the stories about some of these animals. They don\u2019t want to use guns, because it\u2019s too fast and it\u2019s not painful enough. So they\u2019ll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. Trump, July 28, 2017: Together, we\u2019re going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities, and we\u2019re going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, MS-13, and many other gangs. But MS-13 is particularly violent. They don\u2019t like shooting people because it\u2019s too quick, it\u2019s too fast. I was reading \u2014 one of these animals was caught \u2014 in explaining, they like to knife them and cut them, and let them die slowly because that way it\u2019s more painful, and they enjoy watching that much more. Trump, June 23, 2018: They\u2019re killing people and they don\u2019t kill them with guns. You know, you hear so much about guns. They kill them with knives because they cut them into little pieces because it\u2019s much more painful. They\u2019re taking beautiful young women off the street. You know the father and the mother, two of them, they had a daughter. Two daughters killed so violently by MS-13. Cut up. Cut up. Not shot, cut up, because it\u2019s more painful. Trump, Jan. 2: If you look at the numbers, you look at the crimes, you look at what we do, what we\u2019re doing now \u2014 we\u2019re taking out thousands and thousands of people that are in, as an example, MS-13, the gang \u2014 it\u2019s a brutal gang, a vicious gang. They love using knives because they\u2019re far more painful than guns.\n\nTrump\u2019s right about the group\u2019s brutality. There have been numerous news stories and law enforcement accounts over the years of MS-13 gangs using knives, machetes and baseball bats, among other things, to kill people.", "lang": "en"}
