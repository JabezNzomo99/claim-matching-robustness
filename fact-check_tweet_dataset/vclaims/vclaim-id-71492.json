Mitt Romney endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president.\n\nThere is no record of Romney endorsing Biden. The claim comes from a satirical news website.\n\nThe claim that Romney endorsed Biden for president is accompanied by a quote attributed to the Utah senator.\n\n\u201cI cannot, in good faith, and with hands raised to Heavenly Father, throw any manner of assistance towards the President and risk having four more years of his ineptitude and sheer criminality screwing over our country,\u201d Romney is quoted as saying. \u201cJoe Biden is at least sane, capable, and not Representative of Nazis and racists. I intend to contribute my, and my State\u2019s efforts to the rising Joementum movement in order to save America from a severely mentally handicapped evil gorilla and his pea-brained followers. Amen.\u201d\n\nBoth the quote and the claim come from Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The article, which puts up the headline \u201cRomney Endorses Joe Biden,\u201d was posted under the \u201cDeep State fan Fiction for the Derp State\u201d category.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about Romney endorsing Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Biden\u2019s campaign also has not mentioned anything to that effect in a press release, nor has Romney\u2019s office.
