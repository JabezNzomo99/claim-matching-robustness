In the photo, Modi\u2019s image is put beside this text to suggest that this is an initiative of Modi. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Modi has launched an initiative for women safety by setting up a helpline number that helps in keeping GPRS track of the vehicle that women are travelling in. Fact: It is an old, inoperative \u201cwomen safety\u201d initiative taken up by Mumbai Police in 2014. This is now being circulated as PM Modi\u2019s latest initiative for the safety of women. Hence, the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen googled about this initiative using keywords \u201chelpline no. 9969777888\u201d, it was found that in 2014, Mumbai Police under their \u2018Travel Safe When Alone\u2019 initiative, had started an SMS helpline for women travelling alone. As part of the initiative, women travelling alone at nights through autos or taxis can SMS their vehicle\u2019s registration number to 9969777888 that helps Police to keep track of the vehicle that the woman is taking and would get her location through GPS.\n\nBut this special helpline was later on shut down by Mumbai Police owing to the poor response from Women users.\n\nThe same news about this helpline number was spread in different cities of the country. The Police there have clarified that the existence of such helpline in those cities as untrue.\n\nFinally, an old and inoperative \u201cwomen\u2019s safety\u201d initiative taken up by the Mumbai Police in 2014 is circulated as PM Modi\u2019s new initiative\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
