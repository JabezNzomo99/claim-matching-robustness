Was a case of sedition slapped on him or not? If Modiji and Rajnath (Singh) have guts, then let them slap a case of sedition).\n\nNaseem Khan was referring to Sri Sri Ravishankar and the \u2018World Culture Festival\u2019, the mega event organised by him in Delhi in 2016. At the event, Ravishankar had said that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 should go hand-in-hand with \u2018Jai Hind\u2019, a statement which had caused some controversy.\n\nThe original clip was taken down after this fact-check was published however it can be watched below.\n\nIt may be noted that the video clip in question is from 2016, and edited. Congress MLA Naseem Khan had not said \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019, but was referring to a statement by Sri Sri Ravishankar. This was earlier fact-checked by Boom.\n\n[Update: This article was updated on February 7, 2020, to include BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra\u2019s tweet.]", "lang": "en"}
