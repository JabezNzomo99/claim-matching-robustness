The account\u2019s handle spells Anjem Choudary\u2019s surname incorrectly, and the Twitter bio is \u201cActually yet another of Anjem\u2019s imaginary friends\u201d. Other tweets from the account strongly suggest it is not the actual Anjem Choudary tweeting.\n\nAnjem Choudary was released from prison last year, after serving time for supporting ISIS.
