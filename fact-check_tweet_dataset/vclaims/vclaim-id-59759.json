The claim is false; the photo has circulated online since February 2020, weeks before the government imposed COVID-19 restrictions and made mask-wearing mandatory in public.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on July 21, 2020.\n\nGerald Anderson, an ABS-CBN actor, can be seen in the photo flanked by a crowd carrying posters that call for the renewal of the network's franchise.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \"A SIGN FOR IGNORANCE / This is very irresponsible. Without a mask, ABS-CBN network supporters take for granted Covid-19 and do not even wear masks. Social distancing and wearing a mask are disregarded upon seeing celebrities.\"\n\nThe photo circulated days after ABS-CBN celebrities and employees staged a protest against the refusal by Philippine legislators in early July 2020 to approve the broadcaster\u2019s operating licence application.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo was featured in this report published by Philippine news organisation Rappler on February 28, 2020, weeks before the government imposed COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe February rally, Rappler reported, featured TV stars and network employees \"who gathered for another prayer rally calling for the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the Rappler photo (R):\n\nRappler\u2019s photo and its account of the February 28 event also correspond to this video report aired by ABS-CBN on the same day.
