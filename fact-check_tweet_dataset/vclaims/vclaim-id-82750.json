And that\u2019s why my plan will make quality child care more available, and more affordable.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cSince paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\u2019s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cThis Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cI want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn\u2019t derail anyone\u2019s dreams.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cLet\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let\u2019s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\u2019t just free, but fair.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cI call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cBecause the world\u2019s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we\u2019ve got.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
