This is fake news.\n\nThere are no news reports of Padilla being involved in a road mishap.\n\nHer Instagram account also shows several proofs of life: she published several posts in support of her network ABS-CBN on July 10, and an Instagram Story the same day where she is shown speaking in front of a camera.\n\nWebsite gmanewsupsimelda.blogspot.com published at least two versions of the same story, differing only in the headlines:\n\u2022 BREAKING NEWS:Bella Padilla Pinagbabaril sa Loob ng Kanyang Sasakyan.Dead on Arrival sa Hospital (Bela Padilla shot in her car, dead on arrival at hospital)\n\u2022 GMA NEWS:Bella Padilla Patay na! Matapos Pagbabarilin sa Loob ng Kanyang Sasakyan.Dead on Arrival sa Hospital (Bela Padilla, now dead! After being shot in her car, dead on arrival at hospital)\n\nWhen clicked, both redirect to randomnames.club, which has a history of publishing fabricated reports. Its landing page features an imitation of a post on YouTube by Buzzfeed News and even has a fake \u201cview count\u201d as well as \u201csubscribers\u201d and \u201clikes.\u201d\n\nTo support their claim of Padilla\u2019s \u201cdeath,\u201d the stories embedded a January 2019 report by GMA News about a woman who was shot in her vehicle in Quezon City.\n\nIt plays for three seconds, only showing news anchor Ivan Mayrina saying, \u201cPinagbabaril sa loob ng kanyang kotse... (Shot inside her car...)\u201d before stopping abruptly. It says the video has to be shared first before the rest of the clip can be played, but it does not do so even after sharing.\n\nApart from gmanewsupsimelda.blogspot.com, a Facebook (FB) user published a screengrab of the fake story and also claimed Padilla has died. She then asked netizens to view the \u201cvideo report\u201d on her profile.\n\nIt has received over 200 interactions, although the comments section shows many of those who read her post did not believe her.\n\nFinally, two more YouTube videos misled netizens with false headlines. While its content debunked the death hoax on Padilla, YouTube channel Showbiz CareerPH published its video with the untrue and clickbait headline: \u201cBELA PADILLA PATAY DAW MATAPOS PINAGBABARIL SA LOOB NG KANYANG SASAKYAN | Showbiz CareerPH (Bela Padilla supposedly dead after getting shot in her vehicle).\u201d\n\nYouTube dokinz bulabog on the other hand featured a recording of gmanewsupsimelda.blogspot.com\u2019s hoax as its content, and titled it, \u201cBella Padilla pinagbabaril sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan (Bela Padilla shot in her vehicle).\u201d\n\nPadilla\u2019s death hoax coincided with the Congressional hearings on the media network's bid for a new license to operate. The House franchise committee on July 10 denied ABS-CBN's franchise application. Padilla is one of the more vocal artists of the network.\n\nShowbiz CareerPH\u2019s misleading video has been viewed over 41,000 times while dokinz bulabog has been watched more than 2,300 times.", "lang": "en"}
