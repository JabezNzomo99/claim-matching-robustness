(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe blog post features CNN\u2019s logo and the words: \"CNN Breaking News.\" Beneath that it says \"1 hr ago,\" which would suggest that the website posted the news of Eastwood\u2019s (hoax) death one hour before we read about it, but the timestamp never changes.\n\n\"The actor, filmmaker, musician, and politician dies of heart attack at 89,\" the post says. \"He was filming a commercial.\"\n\nAn embedded video titled \"Rest In Peace\" \u2014 with an image of Eastwood and CNN\u2019s logo again \u2014 plays for a couple seconds before stopping with a message that users must share to verify their ages because there\u2019s graphic content ahead.\n\nBut CNN hasn\u2019t reported on Eastwood\u2019s death, nor could we find any other credible coverage reporting that he has died.\n\nRather, we found stories like this Sept. 2 dissection of the mechanics behind this particular hoax and this Sept. 3 item from the Independent: \"Clint Eastwood death hoax: Why the internet keeps saying celebrities are dead when they are not.\"\n\nEastwood actually has a new movie he directed coming out in December: a biopic called \"Richard Jewell\" about a security guard who became a suspect in a pipe bombing during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
