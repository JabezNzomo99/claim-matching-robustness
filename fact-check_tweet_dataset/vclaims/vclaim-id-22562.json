In a previous attack ad, the Congressional Leadership Fund flashed an image of the Twin Towers burning on 9/11 while playing one of Delgado's lyrics, \"God bless Iraq.\" Here's a fuller look at the lyrics from which that line was plucked: \"We must fight with love and goodness in our hearts and peace in our minds if democracy, equality and freedom are truly to prevail. God bless America, God bless Iraq, God bless us all.\" Another set of lyrics from that song: \"More than 40 times the lives lost on 9/11 and 10 times just for the lives of Iraqi civilians; $283 billion and counting is what we're spending, but terror alive and well, it seems further from ending.\"\n\nThe Cisneros campaign sent us a statement from Thomas Rivera, the candidate\u2019s personal aide. Rivera denied Fazli\u2019s claim and said he was with Cisneros at the convention when they ran into Fazli. \u201cI accompanied Gil Cisneros throughout the night of February 24th,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWhile walking to the SEIU-United Healthcare event, we ran into Melissa Fazli, who asked for a campaign donation, which Gil declined. Gil was not intoxicated, nor did he make any suggestive joke or ask. Minutes later we met and spoke with Jim Gallagher.\u201d Fazli denied that Rivera witnessed the encounter.", "lang": "en"}
