But Transparency International says it \"captures corruption levels effectively.\" Other sources of information, including surveys of ordinary Russians, point to similar conclusions about Russia's levels of corruption.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 07, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1832", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/corruption-russia-transparency-international-ranking/28285284.html", "vclaim": "A top official of the All-Russia People\u2019s Front (ONF) \u2013 a political mobilization organization founded by Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 criticized the results of the annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) report published by global corruption watchdog, Transparency International.\n\n\u201cThe index does not reflect an objective picture as it is based solely on surveys among experts and entrepreneurs,\u201d said Ivan Yastreb, the deputy chief of ONF.\n\nTransparency International uses a score from zero for \u201chighly corrupt\u201d to 100 for \u201cvery clean\u201d to compile the perceptions index of corruption worldwide.\n\nIn the 2016 index, Russia remained at the 2015 level with a scoring of 29 out of 100. Russia fell down 12 places in the index to rank 131st of 176 countries - tied with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Iran. The score keeps Russia rated as one of the world\u2019s most corrupt nations.\n\nOver the last decade or so, there has been criticism of Transparency International's CPI as to whether it is a fair and accurate metric to measure corruption by experts who study global good governance.\n\nYastreb references one of the most prominent criticisms\u2014that the CPI rankings are based upon the subjective opinions of country experts and those who do business in the country, which some experts say may not reflect how a country\u2019s broader society experiences or views corruption.\n\nYastreb suggests that \u201cfor receiving a more accurate picture, it would be necessary to also interview ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\nHowever, Transparency International says that its ratings are based upon strong, reliable data.\n\nIn an email to Polygraph.info, spokeswoman Marwa Fatafta said that the CPI \"is computed using up to 13 different surveys that capture the perceptions of experts or business executives on issues surrounding public sector corruption.\n\n\"The CPI uses surveys from reputable organizations that have a transparent data collection process as well as several rounds of validations to ensure high level of data quality,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile others have criticized the CPI\u2019s reliance on subjective perception metrics, Fatafta said the index \"relies upon perceptions because many forms of corruption are hidden from the public eye and take place behind closed doors that are not easily captured by any objective measure.\n\n\"While objective measures of corruption exist, such as the number of corruption cases prosecuted, such measures are limited to specific types of corruption,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey also are more an indicator of the efficacy of judicial system, for example, than a real corruption indicator. Hence, we believe perceptions based measures capture corruption levels effectively,\u201d she said.\n\nDan Hough, a professor of politics at University of Sussex and author of an article critical of Transparency International's index, told Polygraph.info in an email that \"the CPI makes no claim to be an objective measure of corruption.\"\n\n\"The clue is in the title - it's about perceptions,\" he said. \"Whilst using perceptions as a guide has its problems, perceptions do still matter.\n\n\"People act on what they think reality is,\" Hough said. \"So if someone perceives something to be true then they base their actions on that perception. Perceptions therefore matter rather more than critics perhaps care to acknowledge.\"\n\nMoreover, surveys of \u201cordinary citizens\u201d tell much the same story about corruption in Russia as Transparency's CPI ranking.\n\nPolls of Russian citizens conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Levada Center show results and trends that generally concur with those of the Transparency findings.\n\nThey generally reflect a Russian society with broad and serious corruption that has improved modestly over time. A page from the organization which leads the Russian government\u2019s anti-corruption efforts shows a series of infographics that demonstrate similar popular pessimism.\n\nIn an email to Polygraph.info, Stephen Blank, a Senior Fellow for Russia at the American Foreign Policy Council, said that \u201cin Russia, corruption is the system. The government would collapse, along with the economy, without it.\"\n\nThe European Council\u2019s anti-corruption authority, known as the Groups of States against Corruption (GRECO) said in a compliance report in November 2016 that Russia has \u201cimplemented or dealt with in a satisfactory manner with 11 of the 21 recommendations\u201d the authority made in 2003 for Russia to rid itself of corrupt practices.\n\n\u201cThe other ten recommendations have been partly implemented,\u201d the report said, adding that there are other areas of concern.\n\nGRECO said that latest reform of corruption-related provisions in Russia\u2019s Penal Code represents \u201ca significant step backwards compared to the previous draft legislation.\u201d GRECO said the public sector bribery section of the code no longer conforms to European standards.\n\n \n\n Thus, considering that public opinion polls, expert opinion, and Russian compliance with international guidelines good governance all seem to align with the conclusions represented by the CPI, Yastreb's complaint about Transparency International's index being 'not objective' is, at the very least, seriously debatable.", "lang": "en"}
