Egemba, a qualified medical doctor, urged his audience to wash their hands and sanitise with\n\nWhen asked for evidence, Egemba told Africa Check he was referring only to \u201cinfectious diseases\u201d and not all diseases. He termed the claim \u201can error in dissemination\u201d.\n\n, he had not made any correction on Twitter.\n\nBut are nearly all diseases in the world transmitted by hand? We checked.\n\n, or WHO, in its advice on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19,\n\nwash their hands with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based hand rub. The health agency has not endorsed any particular brand of soap or hand sanitiser.\n\nis any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism. It is generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and is different from physical injury.\n\n, according to the\n\nare caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. These can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another, through a number of ways:\n\nNoncommunicable diseases are also known as chronic diseases. They are not passed from person to person and include cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The WHO\n\nas the leading cause of death globally. (\n\nand viruses are carried in the mouth, nose, throat and respiratory tract. Diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis (TB) and some influenza infections can be spread by coughing, sneezing, and saliva or mucus on \u201cunwashed hands\u201d.\n\nWe therefore asked experts if Aproko Doctor\u2019s claim could be accurate. They variously described the claim as misleading, exaggerated or outright incorrect.\n\nThe WHO told Africa Check it did not have information showing the share of communicable diseases transmitted by hand or touch.\n\n\u201cThe WHO doesn\u2019t have this kind of data,\u201d said\n\nThe claim is misleading according to Dr Mary Stephen, a technical officer for the agency\u2019s Africa unit. While most infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person or by feco-oral transmission, the hand \u201cis not the only way diseases are transmitted\u201d, Stephen said.\n\n\u201cIt is better to say infectious diseases are commonly transmitted from person to person through direct contact, droplets or contact with contaminated fomites [inanimate objects], surfaces or objects,\u201d she said.\n\nThe claim does not appear to be \u201cwholly correct\u201d,\n\nis a faculty member at the infectious disease division of the\n\n\u2019s department of medicine in the US.\n\n\u201cA large proportion, but not all, of communicable diseases are transmitted through the hands or contact, but the big ones worldwide such as malaria and TB are not,\" Safdar said.\n\nThe claim is incorrect, Prof Tanimola Akande, from\n\nOf the major diseases, only a few such as\n\nor diarrhoea are transmitted by hand, Akande said.\n\n\u201cThe claim may be referring to diarrhoeal diseases. Food and water-borne diseases are not necessarily transmitted by hands. Malaria, which is one of the most common diseases in the tropics, is not transmitted by hand,\u201d Akande said.\n\nConclusion: No evidence 80% of diseases transmitted by hand\n\nWhile promoting a new brand of hand sanitiser,\n\nFidelis Egemba, known as Aproko Doctor on Twitter, told his 500,000 followers that \u201cover 80% of all diseases in the world are transmitted by hands\u201d.\n\nEgemba told Africa Check he meant infectious diseases only.
