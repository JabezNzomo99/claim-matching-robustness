The ship was identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy's 7th Fleet. It was unclear why the destroyer was not able to see the building and take evasive action, or why it was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area.\n\nThe story is clearly not true since the photo that went with the story is obviously photoshopped:\n\u2022 The name of the ship is mirrored. It reads \"Mustin\" if you hold a mirror next to it. The USS Mustin is an actual Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.\n\u2022 It looks like the ship was cropped out of this photo on Wikipedia, including the bird.\n\u2022 The \"reflection\" of the ship in the water covers part of the trees.\n\u2022 The skies are clear and it is not raining, so the cityscape was obviously not photographed today.\n\nThat, and the disclaimer of Duffel Blog reads:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.
