The December 11 report was false; the government had not announced any extra holidays when it was published.\n\nThe Philippine News website claims that \u201cMalaca\u00f1ang Palace\u201d has proclaimed December 26, 2018, and January 2, 2019, special non-working holidays, following the approval of President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang refers to the presidential palace, and is a commonly used shorthand for the executive branch of government.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe Philippine government lists public holidays on an official gazette available online.\n\nThe holidays for 2018 are specified in Proclamation No. 269, which was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 17, 2017.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the holidays listed by Proclamation No. 269. December 26 is not listed as a holiday:\n\nThe holidays for 2019 are listed in Proclamation 555, signed by Duterte on August 15, 2018.\n\nHere are the dates for the holidays in 2019. January 2 is not one of them:\n\nUPDATE: this story has been updated to reflect the fact that on December 17, 2018 -- six days after the misleading report was published -- the government issued a memorandum saying that January 2, 2019 will be a holiday, but only for government employees. and students from state-run educational institutions.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the government issued a circular which suspended work also for government employees on December 26, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
