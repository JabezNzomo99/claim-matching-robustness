The infographic is misleading; Honduras does not ban its citizens from owning guns, nor does it have the highest homicide rate in the world; Switzerland does not require its citizens to own guns and does not have the lowest homicide rate in the world.\n\nThe misleading infographic was published in this Facebook post on September 8, 2019, and has been shared more than 18.000 times since.\n\nThe infographic states: \u201dHONDURAS POP: 8.2 MILLION, BANS CITIZENS FROM OWNING GUNS, HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.\u201d\n\n\u201cSWITZERLAND POP 8.2 MILLION, REQUIRES CITIZENS TO OWN GUNS, LOWEST HOMICIDE RATE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.\n\n\u201cJUST SHOW THEM FACTS! THEY REALLY HATE FACTS!!!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe infographic was also shared here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nIt has also been shared here on Reddit and here on a Christian blog.\n\nThe infographic is misleading; Honduras does not ban its citizens from owning guns, nor does it have the highest homicide rate in the world; Switzerland does not require its citizens to own guns and nor does it have the lowest homicide rate in the world. The population figures in the infographic are also not accurate.\n\nHonduras recently tightened its gun laws. In May 2019, the government introduced a new law which permits citizens over 21 years old who do not have a drug or alcohol addiction to own up to three firearms. This press release published by the National Congress of Honduras on June 18, 2019, gives details of the gun law changes.\n\nPreviously, Hondurans could own up to five firearms if they obtained a permit which lasts for four years, according to page 10 of this report titled \u201cFirearms Trafficking in Honduras\u201d published by non-profit group InSight Crime and Honduras\u2019 Asociaci\u00f3n para una Sociedad m\u00e1s Justa in 2017.\n\nBased on the most recent data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime published here, El Salvador topped the 2017 chart of homicide rate, followed by Jamaica and Honduras, while at the bottom of the list are Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the chart of homicide rate by countries sorted from the highest to the lowest (L), and vice versa (R):\n\nHonduras was not the country with the highest homicide rate, neither was Switzerland the one with the lowest. Below is a screenshot of UNODC data on where they stand:\n\nGovernment data published by Honduras\u2019 National Institute of Statistics here states Honduras has a population of more than 9.2 millions as of October 2019.\n\nIn Switzerland, citizens are not required to own guns. Applications to carry a weapon are granted if an individual can prove that he or she needs a weapon, for example while working as a private security officer.\n\nIndividuals must also pass an exam on how to use a firearm. This web page published by Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Police gives details on the gun regulations.\n\nEach of Switzerland\u2019s 26 cantons (states) are responsible for issuing weapons permits.\n\nThis Swiss government web page states military service is compulsory for men and voluntary for women in Switzerland, which includes mandatory firing practice. But if citizens feel unable to carry out military service due to a conflict of conscience, they can carry out their service in a civilian role instead, which would not involve gun use.\n\nThe Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research centre, estimated in 2017 that there were around 2.3 million firearms in circulation in Switzerland.\n\nSwitzerland has a population of more than 8.6 millions in 2019, according its Federal Statistical Office.", "lang": "en"}
