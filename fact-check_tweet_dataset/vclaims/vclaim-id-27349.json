And it\u2019s flawed to assume all income tax payers have the same tax burden.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-27349", "url": "https://fullfact.org/news/cost-of-corbyn-figure-flawed/", "vclaim": "Another flawed \u201ccost of Corbyn\u201d figure from the Conservatives\n\nThe Conservatives have claimed that every taxpayer in the UK will have an additional bill of \u00a32,400 per year under Labour. But problems with the calculation make this claim largely meaningless.\n\nThey estimated the total cost of Labour\u2019s policies over five years, and then estimated that, of that sum, \u00a3374 billion would not be covered by Labour\u2019s previous pledges on additional borrowing or taxes. They call this a \u00a3374 billion funding \u201cblack hole\u201d which taxpayers will have to cover, and claim it translates into a cost of \u00a32,400 per income tax payer per year, over five years.\n\nBut, as we\u2019ve already said, the Conservatives\u2019 estimate of the total cost of Labour\u2019s policies has serious problems.\n\nThey can\u2019t know what the Labour party\u2019s policies will cost because Labour hasn\u2019t released its 2019 election manifesto yet and we don\u2019t know exactly what all its policies will be.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 calculation includes a number of policies that Labour hasn\u2019t so far said will be in its manifesto, and one which it has ruled out.\n\nOther calculations made by the Conservatives seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully-fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in.\n\nBecause this \u00a32,400 a year figure is derived from that larger estimate, it suffers from the same flaws.\n\nThose problems aside, it\u2019s not possible to convert the supposed \u00a3374 billion funding \u201cblack hole\u201d into a uniform cost of \u00a32,400 for every one of the UK\u2019s 31 million income tax payers, as the Conservatives have done.\n\nThat\u2019s because if Labour had to raise this extra revenue, it wouldn\u2019t be obliged to do it through income tax. It could, for example, look at corporation tax or VAT instead, which would still be a cost but to different groups and spread out unevenly. And even if it raised the revenue through higher income tax, higher earners pay more income tax\u2014meaning they would pay more than lower earners.\n\nBBC Reality Check also points out that the Conservatives\u2019 assumptions about Labour\u2019s tax-raising plans rely on documents which Labour has not formally adopted as party policy.", "lang": "en"}
