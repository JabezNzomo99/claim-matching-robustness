The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to winnow fake news from users\u2019 feeds.\n\nILoveNativeAmericans.us ostensibly is a site filled with stories about or of interest to Native Americans. But there\u2019s evidence it\u2019s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that \"this is real, it was on TV.\"\n\nWe received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in Kosovo.\n\nThe story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, \"I\u2019ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can\u2019t trust these Indians.\"\n\nAlso included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it\u2019s quite easy to fake a tweet from any account, and Trump is a popular target. There\u2019s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans.\n\nMoreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which first posted the article on Feb. 13.\n\nThe-Postillon.com calls itself \"honest news\" on its banner, but its FAQ section notes that \"everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up.\" Unlike many parody sites, the FAQ also lists several staffers, and gives readers explicit permission to repost edited articles with attribution. The site is registered in Roubaix, France.\n\nThe story has made it onto other suspect aggregators similar to I LoveNativeAmericans.us. One version appeared on WeLoveNative.com on Feb. 28, while it showed up (and was then removed) on NativeAmericans.news on March 4. Both websites also are registered to addresses in Kosovo.\n\nThere has been some concern that Trump\u2019s immigration efforts may affect Indians in the United States \u2014 some 300,000 illegal immigrants are Indians, according to the Times of India. Possible changes in the H-1B temporary visa program also are likely to affect Indians here.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t make these statements, and there\u2019s no executive order deporting Native Americans to another country.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
