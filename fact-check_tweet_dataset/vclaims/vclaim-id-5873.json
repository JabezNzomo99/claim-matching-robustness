The posts imply Biden\u2019s campaign is being negligent by miscaptioning this old footage.\n\nAn example of the claim is visible here . The images of a busy rally are accompanied by text reading, \u201cMask? Only you SHEEP need masks! No 6ft distance or masks here! They must all be immune to covid!\u201d\n\nThe photographs are from a March 9, 2020 campaign event for Joe Biden held in Detroit, Michigan. Reuters photographs from the day, with Harris, Whitmer and Biden\u2019s clothes matching the screenshots in the claim, are visible here . Video footage of the event is visible on C-SPAN here and shared by ABC (as visible in the claim\u2019s screenshots) here .\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website archive for March 9 (here rb.gy/y80m2o) shows that face-coverings were not recommended for people who were well at the time, but only for those who showed symptoms, health workers and caretakers (here rb.gy/olqhaa). As of this Check\u2019s publication, the CDC does recommend people wear masks in public settings (here).\n\nOn this date, the CDC also provided guidance for recommendations in carrying out large events and gatherings (here rb.gy/a4szjp), which have been updated since (here).\n\nBiden, who earlier this month picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, has been holding socially-distant campaign events, see here , here and here .\n\nFalse. Pictured Democrats are not breaking face-covering guidance. The event is from March 9, 2020.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
