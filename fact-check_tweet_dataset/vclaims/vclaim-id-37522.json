No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on January 12, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Chelsea Clinton's Drunken Rampage Lands Her Behind Bars\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nChelsea Clinton was carried by her security detail from the Limelight Night Club in New York City last night after passing out on the dance floor. Clinton was doing a 1995 version of the Macarena when she \"started spinning in circles.\" She reportedly looked at her bodyguard and said, \"Just you shut your mouth.\" and passed out cold. According to the bartender, Three-Thumbed Willy, Chelsea was ordering Yaeger Bombs and buying bloogies like they were going out of style until she finally couldn't take it anymore: \"She just doesn't know when to quit, that one. Last week she was in here with her tongue down Liam Neeson's throat. A month ago she was on the bar for 'Dancing Queen.' People were throwing lettuce at her. We still don't know where it came from.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\n\"Bloogies\" are a fictional type of drug invented by the creators of the site. The article was posted under the category \"SATIRE ISN'T ALWAYS FUNNY\" and the header of the site has the phrase \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\" in it.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
