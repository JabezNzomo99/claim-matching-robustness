It will involve more than 40,000 troops from alliance member states\n\nWhile NATO has held several large-scale exercises over the last few years, they have not been comparable with the massive war games Russia has been conducting at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThe exercise \u2018Trident Juncture 2018\u2019 scheduled for this October will be larger than previous exercises, but that is a reflection of growing NATO concern about Russia,\u201d Steven Pifer, former Ambassador to Ukraine (1997-2000) and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Polygraph.info.\n\nHe added that the NATO exercise is taking place against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, hostile rhetoric and own large-scale military exercises.\n\nLast September, the Zapad 2017 joint Russia-Belarus military exercise took place in close vicinity to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, all NATO members. While Russian officials claimed only 12,700 troops participated, experts say that more than 100,000 troops in fact took part in the massive joint strategic military exercise. Polygraph.info reported how these large-scale drills posed conventional military threat to the West.\n\nHeather A. Conley, Senior Vice President for Europe, Eurasia and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, confirmed NATO has publicized details and notified the Russian government about its upcoming Trident Juncture exercise during a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council this past May. \u201cIt was in advance of NATO\u2019s planned major military exercise this fall and we invited Russian representatives as observers,\u201d she said.\n\nConley added that both individual countries and alliance frequently conduct military exercises, but she warned that last year\u2019s Zapad 2017 was directed against NATO forces.\n\n\u201cRussia knows this well,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is the transparency of these exercises to ensure there is no miscommunication or miscalculation about the intent of the exercise. NATO has closely followed international protocols, in particular the Vienna Document.\u201d\n\nThe Vienna Document is an agreement on confidence and security building measures between participating states of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n\u200bSince Russia annexed Crimea and incited armed conflict in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, it has extensively militarized the region, supplying separatists in eastern Ukraine with military equipment, training and troops.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu last week announced a military exercise much larger than Zapad 2017, which will project Russia\u2019s image as a global \u201csuperpower.\u201d Vostok 2018 will be held September 11-15 and involve 300,000 troops, 1,000 aircraft and 900 tanks, with servicemen from China and Mongolia also participating.\n\nShoigu boasted that the drills will be \u201con an unprecedented scale both in terms of the area covered and in terms of the numbers.\u201d\n\nThe last time Russia held a training exercise this large was in 1981, in the middle of the Cold War, Reuters reported.\n\nThus, based on the information from Russia\u2019s own defense minister, Zakharova is misleading the public by denouncing NATO\u2019s upcoming \"Trident Juncture 2018\" military exercise, given that the Russian military holds much larger military drills, wages wars in two countries and has deployed troops in several others.\n\nRussia\u2019s Western Military District borders Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and is home to a large number of military bases, airfields and communications installations.\n\nVostok 2018 will involve all of the Russian military\u2019s airborne units and both the Northern and Pacific naval fleets, Shoigu said. In all, almost half of the country\u2019s armed forces will take part in this exercise.\n\n\u201cImagine 36,000 pieces of military equipment moving together at the same time \u2014 tanks, armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles,\u201d Shoigu said. \u201cAnd all of this, of course, in conditions as close to combat as possible .\u201d\n\nWhile this massive military exercise is being prepared, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said on August 30 that naval drills involving 25 battleships and 30 aircraft will be held in the Mediterranean Sea from September 1-8.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s so-called hybrid war techniques include holding large-scale military drills and projecting the image of global \u201csuperpower\u201d by targeting propaganda against NATO. These techniques also involve the use of \u201cactive measures\u201d against EU states, including the incitement of ethnic hatred and nationalism, and financing fringe groups and extremist political parties on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nThe main internal threat to President Vladimir Putin is \u201cnot the liberals or democrats, but tougher guys \u2013 the soldiers and security forces,\u201d Russian political analyst Dimitri Oreshkin wrote recently. \u201cThey like exactly what Putin is doing because it, first of all, increases their self-esteem and, secondly, makes them first in line for the Kremlin\u2019s subsidies for defense, the production of tanks, as well as stars [promotions] for generals and colonels. In general, they feel at home; war is their motherland.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
