Using the date of birth and address listed on the criminal complaint against Chauvin for Floyd\u2019s death ( available here ), Reuters found that Chauvin was not registered to vote in Minnesota, according to the state\u2019s voter registration search ( here ).\n\nReuters did find, however, that Chauvin is registered to vote in the state of Florida, where he owns another home, by entering his name and date of birth into Florida\u2019s voter information lookup site ( here ). The site lists his address in Windemere, a town in Orange County, where two women were arrested May 29 \u201con criminal mischief charges after throwing paint on the front door of Derek Chauvin\u2019s home\u201d, according to the Miami Herald ( here ).\n\nSearch results on the Florida voter information lookup site list Chauvin\u2019s party affiliation as the \u201cRepublican Party of Florida\u201d and his voter status as \u201cActive\u201d ( here ).\n\nReuters could not confirm whether Medaria Arradondo, the chief of the Minneapolis police ( here ) is a registered Democrat. Doing so would require knowledge of Arradondo\u2019s current voting address and date of birth.\n\nThe claim that Arradondo was \u201cvoted into office by Democrat voters,\u201d however, is false. The police chief is not voted into office, but rather appointed by the mayor. Former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, a Democrat, appointed Arradondo in 2017 ( here , here ).\n\nReuters could not corroborate the claim that Chauvin\u2019s police union, the Minneapolis Police Federation, is \u201cDemocrat controlled.\u201d Union president Lt. Bob Kroll, however, spoke at a rally for Donald Trump in Minneapolis on Oct. 10, 2019 ( here ). During the rally Kroll told the crowd, \u201c(Mayor Jacob Frey) said the President wasn\u2019t welcome but the Police Federation of Minneapolis begs to differ.\u201d Ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance, the Minneapolis Police Federation had also sold \u201cCops for Trump\u201d T-shirts on its website ( here ). Reuters reached out to the Minneapolis Police Federation to confirm whether it officially endorses political candidates; it did not respond by the time of this fact check's publication.\n\nThe claim that Minneapolis is a \u201cDemocrat-controlled city\u201d is true, as the mayor is member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and the city council is majority Democrat ( here , here ).\n\nThe claim that Minnesota is a \u201cDemocrat-controlled state\u201d is partly true. While Governor Tim Walz is a Democrat and the State House is majority Democrat, the State Senate is majority Republican ( here , here , here ). U.S. Senators for Minnesota Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith are both Democrat (here) while out of eight Representatives, three are Republican (here).\n\nAccording to New York Times reporting, at least 17 misconduct complaints were raised against Chauvin during his two-decade career with the Minneapolis Police Department (here).\n\nSpeculation that Amy Klobuchar, the senior U.S. Senator and former candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, declined to press charges against Chauvin in 2006 arose in the days following Floyd\u2019s death. Klobuchar previously served as the top prosecutor for the Minnesota county that includes Minneapolis. Some black advocates said recently that Klobuchar\u2019s record on police misconduct should disqualify her from consideration as Biden\u2019s running mate in the upcoming election. \u201cAmy Klobuchar is an absolute no-go,\u201d said Keith Williams, chairman of the Democratic Party Black Caucus in Michigan. Klobuchar has ruled herself out of consideration as Biden\u2019s VP, urging him to choose a woman of color instead.\n\nDerek Chauvin was involved in a fatal shooting in 2006, when Klobuchar was county attorney. The senator said on MSNBC that reports she declined to prosecute him were \u201ca lie\u201d because the decision was left to her successor after her election to the Senate. She also defended her record, saying African-American incarceration rates dropped during her tenure. The county attorney\u2019s office confirmed in a statement that Klobuchar had no role in the 2006 case (here).\n\nPartly false. Derek Chauvin is a registered Republican. The rest of the post makes a mixture of true and partly false claims.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
