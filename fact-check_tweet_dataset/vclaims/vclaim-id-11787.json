A Nov. 23 Philippine Star report quoted \u201cWalt Disney Philippines\u201d as saying it has \u201cno plan yet to build a park\u201d in the country.\n\nDavao Construction\u2019s fake post went viral two weeks after a Mickey Mouse mascot, sporting a barong Tagalog, went around famous tourist spots in Manila as part of WDC\u2019s celebration of his 90th birthday.\n\nPhoto from Oh My Disney Asia Facebook page\n\nSpeculations on plans to develop a Disney theme park in country started in 2012 when former Pampanga Representative Carmelo Lazatin in an open letter appealed to WDC to consider doing so in the Clark Freeport Zone.\n\nIt resurfaced in 2016 when then President Benigno Aquino III met with WDC executives to discuss the latter's tapping into the pool of Filipino creatives, as well as the company\u2019s commercial partnership with big Philippine corporations.\n\nThe fake Facebook post has garnered almost 30,000 shares, and over 2,900 comments and 24,000 reactions.", "lang": "en"}
