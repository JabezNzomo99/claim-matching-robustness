The man was slumped on the ground with his right arm straightened and wrapped in cloth. It was captioned:\n\nFour hours later, the page re-uploaded the same image with two other photos of Paraan, this time explicitly mentioning her name and insinuating that she was connected to the CPP and NPA in its caption:\n\nAnother FB page, Enlightened Youth, republished as original content Enlightened PINOY\u2019s second post a minute later.\n\nThe photo does not show any CPP-NPA activity.\n\nPublished by Mindanews, the image was shot seven years ago by photojournalist Vic Kintanar during the first \u201cAll-Women Risk Awareness and Media Safety Training\u201d in March 2013 conducted by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) at the Gardens of Malasag Eco-Tourism Village in Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental.\n\nParaan, then NUJP chair, led a session on first aid during the training. According to a recent article released by MindaNews, the viral photo was actually of a \u201csimulation exercise\u201d where participants, who were all women journalists from Mindanao, were giving first aid to a supposedly injured person -- the lone man in the image, who is also a reporter.\n\nNUJP, in a statement issued two days after the FB posts first made rounds on social media, said the 2013 training even \u201cincluded sessions facilitated by officials of the Army\u2019s 4th Infantry Division.\u201d\n\nBoth MindaNews and NUJP condemned the \u201cmalicious\u201d use of the 2013 photo, saying it endangered not only the life of Paraan but of all journalists seen in the photograph.\n\nThe same day Enlightened Pinoy and Enlightened YOUTH published their false posts, Paraan shared MindaNews\u2019 2013 article on her personal FB account, saying the circulating posts were \u201cusing the Mindanews\u2019 photo to mislead others.\u201d\n\nThe pages\u2019 posts, which were the first versions to circulate on social media, have garnered over 1,500 reactions, 1,900 shares, and almost 500 comments on FB as of May 19, and collectively could have reached around 105,000 netizens. It has been reposted as a screengrab by at least one netizen.\n\nEnlightened PINOY and Enlightened Youth were created about five months apart, the former in January 2019, and the latter the following May.\n\nThe false posts red-baiting Paraan came a few days after Presidential Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Marie Badoy, speaking for the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF ELCAC), on May 10 accused the CPP of exploiting ABS-CBN\u2019s shutdown \u201cas an opportunity to sow chaos and division.\u201d\n\nNTF ELCAC\u2019s Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade Jr. echoed Badoy\u2019s claim two days later, saying the CPP is \u201cfreeriding\u201d on the ABS-CBN issue. He then red-baited, among others, a number of media and student groups, calling them \u201ccreations of the CPP itself\u201d and daring them \u201cto expose themselves.\u201d\n\nABS-CBN went off-air on May 5 after it was served a cease and desist order by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) following the expiration of its legislative franchise expired a day prior. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: NTC backpedals on ABS-CBN franchise)\n\nVERA Files published in 2018 a fact sheet on red-tagging, which, in the worst cases, could lead to warrantless arrests, torture, and even extrajudicial killings, according to a 2012 International Peace Observers Network study. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Why \u2018red-tagging\u2019 is dangerous)\n\nRed-tagging, or red-baiting, is the act of harassing or persecuting a person on the basis of \u201cknown or suspected communist sympathies,\u201d as defined by Oxford University\u2019s Lexico.com.\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, in his dissenting opinion in Zarate vs. Aquino III, said it is the act of \u201cstereotyping or caricaturing\u201d individuals or groups critical of the government as \u201cmasterminds\u201d of crimes, making it easy for government agents \u201cto silence or cause untold human rights abuses on vocal dissenters.\u201d\n\nDespite previously claiming he is the country\u2019s \u201cfirst left-leaning president,\u201d President Rodrigo Duterte in December 2017 declared the CPP-NPA as a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d\n\nUnder the Human Security Act of 2007, this pertains to any group of persons who commits acts of terrorism \u201cto sow and create a condition of widespread and extraordinary fear and panic among the populace in order to coerce the government to give in to an unlawful demand.\u201d\n\nThe law, however, requires a court clearance applied for by the government before an organization is officially considered \u201cterrorist.\u201d A petition filed by the Department of Justice in February 2018 to officially declare CPP as a terrorist group, initially dismissed in January, was revived last February by the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 19. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Badoy errs in claiming NDF tagged as terror group in PH, other countries)\n\nOnce the CPP is officially labeled as a terrorist organization, suspected members of the group could be subjected to close surveillance, detention without charges, restricted liberties, and frozen assets.\n\nMindaNews, MindaNews\u2019 2013 photo on media safety training maliciously used to red-tag journo in 2020, May 15, 2020\n\nNational Union of Journalists of the Philippines, NUJP denounces red-tagging of ex-chair Paraan, May 15, 2020\n\nPhilippine News Agency, Reds using ABS-CBN closure to sow divisiveness: exec, May 10, 2020\n\nNational Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, \u201cREDS freeride on ABS-CBN issue,\u201d May 12, 2020\n\nCNN Philippines, ABS-CBN goes off air following NTC order, May 5, 2020\n\nThe New York Times, Leading Philippine Broadcaster, Target of Duterte\u2019s Ire, Forced Off the Air, May 5, 2020\n\nPresidential Communications Operations Office, Speech of President Rodrigo Duterte during the Meeting with the Filipino Community in Singapore, The Max Pavilion and Hall 9, Dec. 16, 2016\n\nThe Official Gazette, Proclamation No. 374, Dec. 5, 2017\n\nThe Official Gazette, Republic Act No. 9372, March 6, 2007", "lang": "en"}
