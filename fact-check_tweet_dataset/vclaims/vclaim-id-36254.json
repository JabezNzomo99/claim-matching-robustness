The title does not have the word \"Novel,\" contrary to how the source was cited in the claim.\n\nThe study was meant to assess the risks posed by coronaviruses like SARS on surfaces. However, since there are safety challenges in working with the SARS virus itself, the study used \"surrogate coronaviruses\" from animals: transmissible gastroenteritis virus and mouse hepatitis virus.\n\n\"The use of surrogates for studying the environmental survival of SARS-CoV can increase our understanding of the survival and persistence of this virus on environmental surfaces, the possible role of such surfaces in the transmission of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and the risk posed by contaminated surfaces in outbreak settings,\" said the study.\n\nAccording to the study, the survival data for the two surrogate viruses \"suggest that enveloped viruses can remain infectious on surfaces long enough for people to come in contact with them, posing a risk for exposure.\" However, it also said that the risk \"is still poorly understood, and more work is needed to quantify the risk of exposure and possible transmission associated with surfaces.\"", "lang": "en"}
