Usually we start out by mentioning the title of the article (for example: \"BREAKING: Anthony Weiner Banned From Facebook After Sending Tomi Lahren D*ck Pics\"), followed by a few quoted paragraphs, like so:\n\nWe would then typically follow up by doing a reverse Google image search on the main picture used in the article to prove it was unrelated, call out a few inconsistencies in the story (such as the fact that Weiner is still incarcerated and not scheduled for release until 2019, look it up here) and end by pointing out the satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page.\n\nAfter that we would maybe add a few words about the publisher behind the site and the network it is part of and move on to the next story.\n\nBut this time we did a little more digging since the screenshots looked a bit weird:\n\nThe font and background in the title bar looked totally off. A reverse image search didn't immediately turn up anything so we did a little searching for the phrases in the screenshots. That brought us here:\n\nWhich led to this:\n\nWe tried archiving the tweet at archive.is but it seems like somebody beat us to it. This revealed the original tweet it was replying to:\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. Nowadays Cassandra Fairbanks writes at Big League Politics (a very right-leaning website), where her bio says:\n\nBut she used to write at Addicting Info until the end of 2015, a very liberal-leaning site. Her switch from the left to the right was noteworthy enough for the BBC to publish a story about it.\n\nAccording to research by Buzzfeed Addicting Info is run by two men in Illinois: Matthew Hanson and Daniel Gouldman. And Gouldman was revealed by GotNews to be behind the byline \"Icarus Verum\" used on the site. Which is interesting since a variation on that name seems to be used in the original screenshots posted by Fairbanks:\n\nIt looks like the twitter accounts of Fairbanks and Addicting Info (@CassandraRules and @AddInfoOrg) had been arguing on July 25th 2017 about the reason for her departure, when Fairbanks claimed:\n\nTo which the person behind the Addicting Info account replied:\n\nLater the account mentions 'my business partner', wich seems to indicate Matthew Hanson is the person speaking:\n\nThat seems to be confirmed here:\n\nTo which Fairbanks comes back with this screenshot:\n\nThat thread is archived here, in case it goes down. There's more archived stuff too.\n\nOn July 26th 2017 Fairbanks seems to confirm it is Hanson behind the other twitter handle:\n\nSo, what do you think? Did Daniel Gouldman of Addicting Info send a dick pick to Cassandra Fairbanks while he was her boss? Or are the screenshots fake? The accusations date back from this summer and her tweets are still visible. And we haven't found any reports about lawsuits being filed. Another case of #MeToo? Or just revenge porn being posted out of spite?\n\nIn any case, rest assured Anthony Weiner is still in jail and not sending dick pics to Tomi Lahren.", "lang": "en"}
