What is available shows the UK at or near the top of the list in terms of testing, but it\u2019s possible the UK\u2019s testing figures count things that other countries don\u2019t.\n\nAccording to a compilation of testing statistics put together by Our World in Data (a project from the University of Oxford and Global Change Data Lab), the UK was doing 127,153 tests on 59,312 people per day, based on a rolling three day average taken on 20 May. This ranked second out of around 30 European countries behind Russia which was doing more tests per day, but which does not submit data on how many people it tests per day.\n\nAdjusting for population, the UK is behind Lithuania (if you look at the number of tests performed) and Denmark (when you look at the number of people tested). It\u2019s also potentially behind Luxembourg and Belgium, though it\u2019s unclear as to whether these countries publish data on the number of tests or the number of people tested. If it\u2019s the number of tests, then they rank below the UK, but if it\u2019s the number of people, they\u2019re above the UK.\n\nThese rankings don\u2019t mean that much for various reasons.\n\nFor one we can\u2019t be sure the UK data on testing is particularly comparable with other countries. For example, the UK data includes tests that have been sent out but not necessarily processed, which may not be the case in other countries.\n\nAlso, Our World in Data is limited by which countries actually publish their testing data day-by-day and so this ranking excludes a number of European countries including France and Germany.\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute in Germany reports 317,979 tests in the latest week\u2019s data. We\u2019ve not been able to find recent data for France, but Reuters reported at the end of April that France was aiming to do 700,000 nasal swab tests a week which would mean \u201ctripl[ing] its current capacity\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
