But reverse image searches reveal that the pictures do not show the crash in northern Kenya, which killed four American tourists along with the pilot. They are images of previous accidents, two of which happened in the United States.\n\nAs reported by AFP, the helicopter -- which belonged to Ruto -- crashed in the Central Island National Park in Lake Turkana on March 3, killing all five people onboard including Ruto\u2019s pilot, Marious Magonga.\n\nShortly after news of the accident began spreading on March 4, posts began circulating which included photographs of crashed choppers. Clearly, they do not show the same helicopter -- one post shows the wreckage of a red aircraft; in another, it\u2019s white; in another, it\u2019s blue. So at least two of the posts had to be misleading, showing aircraft from accidents other than the one involving Ruto\u2019s helicopter.\n\nIn fact, all three of the posts feature images of earlier helicopter crashes. None of the posts indicated that they were using photos from previous accidents, which would leave many readers assuming they were seeing pictures of the aircraft that had just crashed in Kenya. Let\u2019s look at the first one.\n\nIt was posted in a Facebook group called Group Kenya, which has more than 130,000 followers. Here\u2019s an archived version of the post which shared the photos.\n\nA reverse image search on Google showed that the photo first appeared online in October 2018 on articles describing a helicopter crash on a farm in Delaware in the United States. Among other places, it can be found here on the Delaware State Police website, dated October 2018.\n\nThe second photo, showing the wreckage of a white aircraft, was posted on Twitter by the blogger Robert Alai, who has more than a million followers. Here\u2019s an archive link to the tweet.\n\nBut a reverse image search revealed that the photo was taken during an accident in Kenya\u2019s Great Rift Valley region on February 13, 2019.\n\nHere's the same photo, used in a news report at the time:\n\nComments on the tweet indicated that some Twitter users had correctly identified the image used as an old one.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the image of the blue helicopter which was posted on this Facebook group with more than 950,000 followers.\n\nA reverse image search, however, showed the photo first appeared online after an accident in February 2018 in a remote part of the US state of Utah when an elk jumped on to the tail of the low-flying research helicopter.\n\nThe local sheriff\u2019s office posted images of the crash at the time.", "lang": "en"}
