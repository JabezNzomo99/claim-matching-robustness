This gravely serious accusation was not based on police reports, firsthand accounts, financial records, or deep investigative reporting. Rather, it was based on the fact that some items on Wayfair were listed at exorbitant prices compared to other, similar items.\n\nThis rumor appears to have originated on the \u201cconspiracy\u201d section of Reddit on July 9, 2020. That post noted that Wayfair was selling utility closets from WFX that were priced at more than $10,000, and offered child trafficking as a possible explanation. That post, like so many other conspiracy theories, offered this notion as a mere possibility and said that it would be stomach churning \u201cif \u2026 true.\u201d\n\nThis post led to other users combing the Wayfair website in search of other oddities. One Twitter user, for instance, found a set of pillows and shower curtains that were listed for $9,999. As similar items on the website were listed for only $99, this person assumed that the only logical explanation was that the higher priced item was being used to traffic children.\n\nGenerally speaking, the images showing expensive cabinets and large price differentials on pillows, shower curtains, and other items on Wayfair\u2019s website are real. However, it takes quite a leap in logic to arrive at the conclusion that this is evidence that the store is engaged in child trafficking.\n\nIn fact, the more we pondered this claim, the more nonsensical it appeared. Would a large business really use their official website to allow people to purchase children online? As these items are available to anyone with internet access, wouldn\u2019t it be possible for someone to accidentally become involved in child trafficking? Why would a child trafficking operation use a method that would be so easy to track?\n\nThis claim is largely based on the idea that $10,000 is simply too expensive for a cabinet, and that there has to be some other explanation \u2014 child trafficking \u2014 to justify its cost. In a statement to Newsweek, however, Wayfair noted that these were industrial grade cabinets, and that they had been accurately priced. Wayfair said that they temporarily removed these items, as the accompanying descriptions did not accurately explain the reason for the price point.\n\nWe reached out to Wayfair for more information about the expensive pillows and shower curtains, but have yet to receive a response.\n\nAs this rumor circulated on social media, people chimed in with additional \u201cevidence\u201d of Wayfair\u2019s supposedly nefarious activities. For instance, some claimed that searching for the stock keeping unit number (SKU) associated with these items preceded by the term \u201csrc usa\u201d on the Russian search engine Yandex returned images of young female children. This is, bizarrely, true. However, searching for just about any random string of numbers preceded by the \u201csrc usa\u201d returns similar results. It\u2019s possible that these search results are connected to the Russian image hosting website \u201cImgsrc,\u201d which has previously hosted child pornography images. We reached out to Yandex for more information about these search results, and will update this article accordingly.\n\nOthers claimed that these products carried the names of children who had gone missing. One cabinet, for instance, appeared on Wayfair as the \u201cAnabel 5-shelf storage unit.\u201d This, according to proponents of this theory, corresponded with an Anabel Wilson who had gone missing in Kansas. While this may seem suspicious to those seeking a pattern, it should be noted that there were more than 400,000 entries for missing juveniles in the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center in 2019. In other words, the fact that some of these product names were the same as the first names of children who had gone missing could easily be nothing more than a coincidence.\n\nFurthermore, some of the missing children cases this theory attempted to connect to Wayfair have already been solved. The \u201cAlyvia\u201d shelf, for example, was supposedly connected to Alyvia Navarro. This autistic child went missing at the age of 3 in 2013 and, unfortunately, was found dead shortly after she went missing, having drowned in a nearby pond.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, proponents of this theory started sharing a mugshot of a man in a Wayfair shirt and claimed that he had recently been arrested as part of a trafficking ring.\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of Fredrick Walker Jr. who was arrested on June 21, 2020, during a prostitution sting in Barnesville, Georgia. However, those sharing this image as \u201cproof\u201d of this Wayfair conspiracy theory failed to mention that this person was just one of nearly two dozen people who were arrested during this sting, that none of the other people arrested were wearing Wayfair shirts, that news reports about the arrest made no mention about any connection to the store, and that there\u2019s no evidence that the victims in this case were children.\n\nThe claim that Wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person\u2019s confusion over an expensive cabinet. This conspiracy theory, like so many conspiracy theories, started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually true. As of this writing, absolutely no credible evidence has been offered to back up this accusation.\n\nBut the conspiracy theory did have real impact. According to a July 20 press release from Polaris, its National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888) received such an \u201cextreme volume\u201d of reports related to this rumor (none of which contained information beyond what was already reported online) that it struggled to respond to other calls from people potentially in need. The statement encouraged callers to learn more about \u201cwhat human trafficking really looks like.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
