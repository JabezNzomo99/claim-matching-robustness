Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, and CNN commentator Keith Boykin picked it up:\n\nThose four tweets collected more than 350,000 likes and 72,000 retweets. In the clip, Mnuchin is heard to say, \u201cthese checks in the mail or direct deposit. It's really bridge liquidity for people as they go through these difficult times.\u201d After being asked how long the bridge liquidity is expected to last, Mnuchin responded: \u201cI think the entire package provides economic relief overall for about 10 weeks.\u201d\n\nIn their tweets, Westbrook and the others are referring to the checks of up to $1,200 (plus $500 for every dependent under the age of 18) going out to Americans making under $99,000 annually. However, the video is edited to leave out Mnuchin\u2019s comments immediately before those included in the clip. Directly before the comments in the clip in which he referred to the \u201centire package,\u201d Mnuchin said the law included \u201cthree components\u201d: small business loans, enhanced unemployment benefits, and the checks. But the edited clip in the tweet only included the last one\u2014the checks.\n\nMnuchin added later in the interview: \u201cif for whatever reason, this takes longer than we think, we will go back to Congress and get more support for the American economy.\u201d\n\nTaken in their entirety, it is clear the secretary\u2019s comments were intended to include the small business loans that the administration hopes will allow businesses to keep employees on payroll and the enhanced unemployment benefits that will provide $600 per week more than usual. Based on that, it is inaccurate to say Secretary Mnuchin believes that Americans can live on $1,200 for a 10-week period.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
