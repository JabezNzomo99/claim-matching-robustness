(\n\nBut the two studies focused on western Kenya, not Kibera. And Unicef did not have any role in either of them,\n\nwho was involved in their research, told Africa Check.\n\nOne of the studies\n\nthat one in 10, or 10%, of 15-year-old girls admitted to having transactional sex to get money for pads, Phillips-Howard said. But of the 3,418 women aged 13 to 29 surveyed overall, only 1.3% said they had done this.\n\nlooked at how menstrual hygiene affected the school attendance and reproductive health of 644 girls aged 14 to 16 in western Kenya. It did not mention sex for sanitary pads at all.\n\nUnicef: The number is \u2018neither new nor ours\u2019\n\nIn a subsequent call, Unicef told Africa Check that the research used in the Independent\u2019s article was \u201cneither new nor exclusive nor ours\u201d.\n\nWe also found the 65% figure in a\n\nHere it was attributed to \u201c2011\u201d research by the\n\n, which campaigns for the education of girls and women.\n\nBut the Nairobi-headquartered organisation had not done such a study, spokesperson Juliet Kimotho told Africa Check.\n\nDr Stella Chebii focuses on gender and communication at Kenya\u2019s\n\nShe told Africa Check the Independent\u2019s statistics \u201care way too high\u201d. Her work did find that not enough sanitary towels were available to girls in Kibera, \u201cbut not such statistics on trading sex for sanitary towels\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility that girls could receive money in exchange for sex which ends being used to buy items that include sanitary towels, but the motive to exchange money for sex in most cases is not motivated by the lack of sanitary towels,\u201d Chebii said.\n\nStigma on menstruation also meant such an exchange would be difficult as women and girls would have to hide that they were on their period, she added.\n\nChebii said if it were true that such a high share of females traded sex for pads, it would be a significant setback to the efforts by many to improve the lives of women and girls. The issue, she said, was not just biological but social.\n\nConclusion: No research supports Independent and Unicef claim that 65% of Kibera females trade sex for sanitary pads.\n\nThe UK-based Independent newspaper said \u201cnew exclusive research by Unicef\u201d had found 65% of females in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum had traded sex for sanitary pads.\n\nUnicef told Africa Check that the research used in the Independent\u2019s article was \u201cneither new nor exclusive nor ours\u201d.\n\nsaid that while sanitary pads were in short supply in Kibera, no research showed that women and girls traded sex for them. Transactional sex may take place, but not specifically to buy menstrual pads. And stigma would make it difficult for females to trade sex during their periods.", "lang": "en"}
