Her tweet reads, \u201cChristian Missionaries & Jihadis in Kerala are terrorizing Hindus. This Hindu woman was beaten because she was worshiping.\u201d\n\nLynn has been featured in an earlier Alt News fact-check report when she falsely claimed that a Hindu monk was beating by Muslims for entering a train compartment that was occupied by predominately Muslim people. The monk was beaten for misbehaving with a child.\n\n\u201cShocking: Elderly Hindu woman brutally attacked, idol and temple desecrated by Muslims in secular Kerala. Why is Bollywood silent? #Asifa #islam,\u201d read a tweet by fake news portal Shankhnaad last year. A second tweet read, \u201cJihadi attack on Hindus, Temple vandalism continue in Kerala during protest for Asifa. Worse fate awaits if Hindus continue with their ignorance and one-way secularism\u201d. Alt News has exposed Shankhnaad several times in the past for circulating misinformation.\n\nThe same was also shared by a parody handle @BhaiyyaBabu with a similar text in Hindi, \u201c\u0915\u0947\u0930\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092a\u0942\u091c\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0947\u0907\u091c\u094d\u091c\u093c\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e ,\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0924\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0936\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u0926\u0942\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947\u0964 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u094b \u0924\u093e\u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0940\u0921\u093c\u093f\u0924 \u092e\u0939\u0940\u0932\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0907\u0902\u0938\u093e\u092b \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0938\u0915\u0947.#HinduDeniedEquality\u201d.\n\nThis was also shared on a group called \u201cWe Support Narendra Modi\u201d which has over 26 lakh members andd the post was shared more than 2500 times.\n\nThe image circulated by these handles was shared by a Bangladeshi Facebook page called Suptodisha in October 2017. According to the Facebook post, the incident happened in Chittagong district in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Bengali text accompanying the Facebook post reads, \u201cThis woman is Panchabala Karmakar, resident of Jaldhi village, under Banskhali Police Station of Chittagong district. This poor and helpless woman was beaten up badly in a pre-planned attack by his influential neighbour Pradip Ghosh and his son Biswajit. Her situation is now precarious. There is now no one to take care of her or treat her. Kindly share this.\u201d One of the individuals in the images above is wearing a T-shirt with Bengali text on it.\n\nWhile we were unable to independently verify the images, it certainly does not represent a recent incident from Kerala.\n\n[This article was updated on April 29, 2020, with Reene Lynn\u2019s tweet.]", "lang": "en"}
