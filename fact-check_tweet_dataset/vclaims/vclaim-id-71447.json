This is false: the word is not included in the legislation and there never was an exemption for Muslims.\n\n\u201cTHIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL AND SETS MY HAIR ON FIRE!!! What does this word mean? Dhimmitude,\u201d a May 17, 2020 post starts before claiming the term is in the law. \u201cIt's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists,\u201d the post continues. \u201cThe ObamaCare bill is the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia\u201d Islamic law, it adds.\n\nThe reforms that took effect under former US President Barack Obama in 2010 allowed millions of previously uninsured Americans to obtain health insurance. Although his successor Donald Trump has unsuccessfully sought to repeal the law, the incumbent president\u2019s policies have made it harder to sign up under the market exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMuslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured,\u201d the post says. \u201cNon-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude,\u201d it continues.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Religious Literacy Project, a dhimmi -- where the word \u201cdhimmitude\u201d comes from -- \u201crefers to a non-Muslim subject of the Ottoman Empire\u201d who was given protection by the state in return for specific taxes. The dhimmi status was abolished in 1839.\n\nThe full version of the Affordable Care Act can be found here and contains no mention of the term \u201cdhimmitude.\u201d\n\nIn its original form, the health care reform required Americans to buy medical insurance or face a financial penalty. Republican lawmakers in 2017 suppressed that provision, years after the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to do so.\n\nBefore 2019, a series of exemptions were required to avoid paying a penalty when uninsured. Members of an approved religious sect or division opposed to accepting insurance benefits could ask for a health coverage exemption, and therefore not be required to pay a penalty if they were uninsured.\n\nClaims about the Affordable Care Act with a similar or identical text -- here or here -- have been circulating in email chains, forums and Facebook posts since the bill was introduced, and some were previously fact-checked.\n\nFactCheck.org in 2010 obtained a list of all the groups that had successfully applied for exemptions and would meet the definition under the health care law. At the time, no Muslim group, and no non-Christian group, had ever qualified \u201cfor an exemption under the statute used to define exempt religious groups in the health care law,\u201d they found.\n\nThe post also claims that \u201cas a Christian,\u201d someone could face \u201chard prison time\u201d for refusing \u201cto buy insurance or pay the penalty tax.\u201d This is also false. As of 2019, there is no longer a federal penalty applicable for being uninsured.", "lang": "en"}
