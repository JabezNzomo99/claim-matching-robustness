But there\u2019s no evidence any of them voted, fraudulently or otherwise.\n\u2022 And as he has in the past, Trump claimed there\u2019s \u201ca lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country.\u201d Experts say voter fraud is rare.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest round of voter fraud claims came as Wisconsin struggled with an election at a time when residents were wary of going to polls during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome Wisconsin Democrats, including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, urged to hold the election by mail and suspend in-person voting. Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers tried to move the state\u2019s April 7, but after a Republican challenge, the state Supreme Court ruled the governor\u2019s decision was unconstitutional and the election went off as scheduled on April 7 with long lines and fewer polling places.\n\nWith uncertainty about the safety of voting in the presidential election November, some Democrats have called for mail-in voting to be considered as an alternative. Former Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has suggested that a mail-in ballot should be sent to every voter in the country.\n\nAt a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 7, the day of the Wisconsin election, Trump made clear that he opposes any expansion of mail-in voting, saying it is \u201cdangerous\u201d and rife with fraud.\n\nElection experts told us that Trump is exaggerating the amount of voter fraud via mail-in ballots. They say it is more common than in-person voting fraud (something that Trump has repeatedly distorted), but still rare.\n\n\u201cElection fraud committed with absentee ballots is more prevalent than in person voting but it is still rare,\u201d Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, and author of \u201cThe Voting Wars,\u201d told us via email. \u201cStates can and do take steps to minimize the risks, especially given the great benefits of convenience \u2014 and now safety \u2014 from the practice.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed published in the Washington Post, Hasen cited a database created by News21, a national investigative reporting project that tracks cases of election fraud. News21 found absentee-ballot ballot fraud was the most prevalent type of election fraud, comprising about 24% of reported prosecutions between 2000 and 2012.\n\n\u201cBut the total number of cases was just 491 \u2014 during a period in which literally billions of votes were cast,\u201d Hasen wrote. \u201cWhile certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee-ballot scandals, problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail, including the heavily Republican state of Utah.\u201d\n\nThe five states that already vote primarily by mail are Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon. And, of course, all states allow some form of absentee voting by mail.\n\nIn fact, as the New York Times noted, Trump voted absentee by mail in Florida\u2019s election in March and in the 2018 midterm elections. Vice President Mike Pence also voted via a mail-in absentee ballot for the primary and general elections in 2018.\n\nTrump was asked during the press briefing on April 7 how he reconciled his comments about mail-in ballots being \u201ccorrupt\u201d with the fact that he voted by mail in Florida\u2019s election the previous month.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m allowed to,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cWell, that\u2019s called \u2018out of state.\u2019 You know, why I voted? Because I happen to be in the White House and I won\u2019t be able to go to Florida to vote.\u201d\n\nTrump suggested \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that ballots mailed from outside the state are more secure.\n\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s a big difference between somebody that\u2019s out of state and does a ballot and everything is sealed, certified, and everything else,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nBut elections experts told us states apply the same rules and processes for in-state and out-of-state mail-in ballots.\n\n\u201cDomestic absentee voters in or out of state are treated the same,\u201d Lonna Atkeson, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico and expert in election administration, told us via email.\n\nJustin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University and voter fraud expert, told us that while he is not aware of any valid statistics on the prevalence of fraud in mail-in ballots, \u201cI do collect anecdotal reports, and it is clear (and I think most observers from across the political spectrum agree) that misconduct in the mail voting process is meaningfully prevalent than misconduct in the process of voting in person.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisconduct still amounts to only a tiny fraction of the ballots cast by mail (and is far less prevalent than the President\u2019s rhetoric suggests, which may well be why he\u2019s felt comfortable voting by mail in the past),\u201d Levitt added.\n\nPerhaps the most widely-reported recent example of absentee ballot fraud was a case during the 2018 midterm election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District. Election results were overturned after it was learned that a Republican political operative improperly collected and possibly altered or discarded ballots to sway the election in favor of Republican Mark Harris. That operative was ultimately indicted on felony ballot tampering charges, and Harris dropped out of the race prior to the new election.\n\nOne of the problems with tracking the prevalence of mail-in voting fraud is that \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find,\u201d Atkeson said in a phone interview. \u201cThe fact is, we really don\u2019t know how much fraud there is.\u201d\n\nFor example, she said, when signatures don\u2019t match, \u201cIs it a messy signature or someone trying to sign someone else\u2019s ballot?\u201d (State and local election officials have procedures for verifying signatures, as we will explain later.)\n\n\u201cThere is a little bit of fraud,\u201d Atkeson said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t millions of fraudulent votes, but there are some.\u201d\n\nLorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud,\u201d agrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can give you a reliable measure of the prevalence of voter fraud with mail-in ballots, but my sense is that it is not much more frequent than in-person voter fraud, which rarely occurs,\u201d Minnite told us via email.\n\nThere are two features of mail-in voting that make it \u201cslightly less secure\u201d than in-person voting, Minnite said.\n\nFirst, she said, \u201cthe \u2018chain-of-custody\u2019 of the ballot is broken with mail-in voting because the ballot is released by election authorities into the U.S. mail, and voters, therefore, are unsupervised when they vote, they do not record their votes in the presence of election officials.\u201d\n\nSecond, she said, \u201cthis creates an opening for illegal activity by political operatives that would not otherwise exist if all voting was conducted in-person at official polling sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most egregious cases of fraud involving mail-in ballots that I\u2019ve seen \u2026 are cases of political operatives engaging in illegal activity, conspiracies to use mail-balloting to intimidate voters to vote a certain way, sometimes through vote-buying schemes, or to rig electoral outcomes by stealing ballots and marking them for their candidates,\u201d Minnite said, citing the example of the North Carolina 9th Congressional District fiasco.\n\nBut there are measures states can take to track ballots to voters, Minnite said, and to verify them through some form of identification authentication.\n\n\u201cThe most common method for verifying ballots is signature matching,\u201d Minnite said. \u201cA signature is considered a biometric identifier, unique to you, and voters usually sign affidavits that inform them of the penalties involved for providing false information or forging their identity when they vote by mail.\n\n\u201cThe process for verifying signatures varies across the states, but usually it involves matching the signature to an existing signature on file and having more than one person (it could be a bipartisan team) do the match,\u201d Minnite added. \u201cMost states have procedures in place for dealing with discrepancies that involve contacting the voter to correct the problem. Some states require voters to include a photocopy of a form of identification with their ballot for verification.\u201d\n\nConcerns about people applying for absentee ballots on behalf of others have been \u201csubstantially cut down\u201d due to identity verification such as Social Security or drivers license numbers, signature matching and flagging IP addresses with a suspicious number of absentee requests, said Levitt, the Loyola Marymount University professor.\n\nFamily members who cast ballots on behalf of recently deceased relatives tend to be caught, either through death records or signature matching, Levitt said. And elections officials are getting better at comparing voting records across jurisdictions to catch people voting in person and them casting an absentee ballot in another jurisdiction, he added.\n\n\u201cI think the primary concern is that someone other than the ostensible voter may help complete the ballot itself, even if the voter signs the return envelope, or coerce the voter into voting a certain way: members of the household, or in some cases, allegedly, campaign workers,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite difficult to police.\u201d\n\nThere are other logistical issues with mail-in voting. States would need more money, to improve their voter files, to provide prepaid postage for ballots, and to expand ballot drop-off sites (some states have special election drop boxes). Many states would also need to hire more people to process and count the ballots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging and expensive,\u201d Atkeson said. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping this doesn\u2019t happen [in November]. If we are going to do something like that, the states need to start preparing as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nLevitt said mail-in voting may not be the optimal choice in November, but its limitations may need to be weighed against concerns about the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIn a time of global pandemic, the question is not about the best voting system in the abstract,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cService members often don\u2019t have the luxury of voting in person, which is why the remote ballot system is so very vital to ensuring that they\u2019re able to exercise the franchise. Given wide displacement of polling places and poll workers during a pandemic, we may all be in situations far more akin to service members than we\u2019re accustomed to. And both the benefits and limitations of mail ballots \u2013 including the potential for misconduct, which happens occasionally \u2013 have to be assessed in that context.\u201d\n\nThe day after making his disparaging remarks about voter fraud with mail-in ballots, Trump was asked for evidence to back up his claim. He doubled down on his misleading claim without providing that backup and added a couple other bits of misinformation \u2014 including the false claim that California admitted in a court settlement that a million people voted improperly.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened. In January 2019, the conservative group Judicial Watch announced that it had reached a settlement requiring the county of Los Angeles to purge the names of inactive voters from its voter rolls after a period of time, pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act (and a 2018 Supreme Court decision that found such removal is mandatory). California also agreed to send a written advisory to all counties to comply with the law about removing names of inactive voters.\n\nPer the settlement, the county sent notices to people it determined to be inactive, and agreed that if they did not respond, or did not vote in the next two federal general elections, their names would be removed from voter rolls. California agreed to notify its other counties to do the same.\n\nThe settlement noted there was no admission of wrongdoing by the state or Los Angeles County. It also made no mention of voter fraud.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Trump\u2019s comments go astray.\n\nNo one alleged or provided any proof that any of those people on the inactive roster actually voted, fraudulently or otherwise. Judicial Watch said \u201cthere were approximately 1,565,000 registrations on Los Angeles County\u2019s inactive file of registered voters.\u201d As Judicial Watch noted in its January 2019 press release, \u201cInactive voter registrations belong, for the most part, to voters who have moved to another county or state or have passed away.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how much he repeats them, Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud are patently untrue,\u201d California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement to FactCheck.org in June 2019. \u201cSpecifically, the settlement with Judicial Watch, Los Angeles County, and the Secretary of State contains absolutely no admission to or evidence of \u2018illegal votes.\u2019 The President\u2019s claims are untrue and yet another distortion aimed at undermining confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nAs part of his case for voter ID laws, Trump has conflated this issue before, citing statistics about invalid or inaccurate information on voter rolls and wrongly suggesting those represented a list of fraudulent voters. As we wrote in 2016, those statistics don\u2019t represent instances of fraud, but rather are evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems.\n\nTrump ended his attack on mail-in voting on April 8 with his usual call for voter identification laws that require voters to present valid identification at a polling place in order to be allowed to vote. Voter ID laws are justified, he said, because, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, numerous researchers who have studied the issue, say it\u2019s simply not true that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of fraudulent voting\u201d in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe best facts we can gather to assess the magnitude of the alleged problem of voter fraud show that, although millions of people cast ballots every year, almost no one knowingly and willfully casts an illegal vote in the United States today,\u201d Minnite wrote in her book, \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, a team of students led by the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University analyzed 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000 and concluded that \u201cwhile fraud has occurred, the rate is infinitesimal, and in-person voter impersonation on Election Day, which prompted 37 state legislatures to enact or consider tough voter ID laws, is virtually non-existent.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread voting by immigrants in the country illegally, or by people voting on behalf of dead people, as Trump has repeatedly alleged. There is no evidence of busloads of people from Massachusetts pouring into New Hampshire to skew voting there. There is no evidence that millions of illegal votes caused Trump to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016. And mismatched signatures on mail-in ballots\u2013 often the result of handwriting changing over time \u2014 aren\u2019t proof of \u201celectoral corruption.\u201d\n\nSeveral months into his presidency, Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity \u2014 which was to examine \u201cfraudulent voting,\u201d among other issues. The commission was dissolved just months after it was created without reporting any proof of widespread fraud.", "lang": "en"}
