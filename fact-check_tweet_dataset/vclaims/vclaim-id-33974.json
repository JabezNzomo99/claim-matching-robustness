We reached out to Mangaluru police officials who told us that eight Malayali media persons were detained by the police. They also informed us that the reason behind the detention of the journalists was that they were not carrying accreditation cards.\n\nWe could independently verify that the journalists who had come to Karnataka were detained where they were covering the post-mortem of the two protesters who died in the Mangaluru police firing.\n\nSpeaking to AsiaNet News, one of the detained journalist Mujeeb Rahman said, \u201cKannada journalists were quoting Mangalore Police. We think Mangalore Police fabricated this story and fed it to the media.\u201d\n\nThe two protesters were killed in police firing during protests in Karnataka. The victims, Jaleel (49) and Nauseen (23) had suffered bullet injuries when the police opened fire to quell the violent protests against recent amendment in Citizenship Act.\n\nAccording to a report by The News Minute, \u201cThe media persons from four prominent Malayalam news outlets \u2014 Asianet News, News 18, MediaOne and TwentyFour News \u2014 were taken to the Karnataka-Kerala border and handed over to the Kerala police.", "lang": "en"}
