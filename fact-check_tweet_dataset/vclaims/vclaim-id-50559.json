The claim is false; the photo actually shows Sharif at a 2017 reception dinner with politicians in the eastern Pakistani city of Gujranwala.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on January 23, 2020.\n\nIt has been shared more than 22,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \"A painful scene from an ICU of a British hospital\".\n\nSharif, Pakistan\u2019s longest-serving Prime Minister who reigned over three non-consecutive terms, was ousted of power in 2017 and imprisoned on corruption charges. He was serving a seven-year prison term when the judiciary granted him medical bail on November 19, 2019, and allowed international travel to London for a medical treatment. Sharif has since failed to adhere to the terms of his bail, refusing to send Pakistani courts his medical reports; and according to this AFP report dated March 4, 2020, Pakistan has \u201cwritten to British authorities seeking his return\u201d.\n\nThe photo was also published here on Facebook and on Twitter here, here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; a Google reverse image search found the photo has circulated online since at least 2017.\n\nAFP found the photo published in this August 12, 2017 report by Pakistan-based English-language newspaper The Nation, headlined \u201cPML-N leadership in Gujranwala holds reception for Nawaz.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cFormer prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday visited the house of sister of Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir Khan where he was warmly received by the hosts along with other leaders of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).\n\n\u201cThe former prime minister thanked veteran politician and senior PML-N leader Ghulam Dastagir Khan for the reception to which the latter said that Nawaz came to Gujranwala after four years.\u201d\n\nThe photo was also published in this article headlined: \u201cSpecial breakfast for Nawaz Sharif in the City of Wrestlers\u201d, published by the local Urdu-language newspaper Daily Pakistan on the same date.\n\nGujranwala is often referred to as the \u201cCity of Wrestlers\u201d after it produced some of the country\u2019s best sportsmen.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photos published in The Nation and Daily Pakistan (R) :", "lang": "en"}
