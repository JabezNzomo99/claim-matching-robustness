{"title": "The IFS and the benefit cap", "subtitle": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the benefit cap used to almost exclusively affect families with a lot of children or high rents, but not any more.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16131", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/ifs-benefit-cap/", "vclaim": "The IFS and the benefit cap\n\nWhen the IFS said this, it was commenting on the effects of the benefit cap before changes to it came into force today.\n\nFrom 7 November the maximum that people can claim in total for certain benefits will be lowered to \u00a323,000 for families in London, or \u00a320,000 outside London. For single people without children it will be \u00a315,410 per year in the capital and \u00a313,400 in the rest of the country.\n\nThe IFS says that two key changes will take place regarding the people it affects.\n\nThe first is that \u201cits impact will be somewhat less concentrated on households with lots of children\u201d.\n\nThe second is that it is now much more likely that the Benefit Cap will affect families outside of London. Under the previous cap, 42% of households affected were in London. From today the benefit cap will affect a lot more people than before, but a smaller proportion of that total (22%) will live in London.\n\nWhy are there changes to the types of families affected?\n\nThe IFS\u2019s analysis found that families with lots of children or high rents were more affected than any others previously because \u201cthere is almost no other way to be getting so much in benefits\u201d. It said that more than half of households previously affected had at least four children, and so received more in Child Benefit.\n\nAs 42% of all households affected were in London, they had high rents and so received more in Housing Benefit than other households.", "lang": "en"}
