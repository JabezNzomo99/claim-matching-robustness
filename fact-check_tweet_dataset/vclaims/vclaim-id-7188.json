Now there was a little time in which there was some dispute about that, but they acknowledged to us orally that they understand that they can\u2019t violate the Justice Department rules. \u201cWe think it\u2019s bigger than that. We think it\u2019s a constitutional rule, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to confront that because nobody\u2019s ever going to indict a sitting president. So, what does that leave them with? That leaves them with writing a report.\u201d\n\n\u201cA necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court in connection with it \u2026 would interfere with the President\u2019s unique official duties, most of which cannot be performed by anyone else. It might be suggested that the same is true with the defense of impeachment proceedings; but this is a risk expressly contemplated by the Constitution, and is a necessary incident of the impeachment process. The Constitutional Convention was aware of this problem but rejected a proposal that the President should be suspended upon impeachment by the House until acquitted by the Senate. \u2026 \u201cTo wound him by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs. It is not to be forgotten that the modern Presidency, under whatever party, has had to assume a leadership role undreamed of in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
