The show was anchored by Abhisar Sharma and has since attracted attention on social media for the wrong reasons.\n\nDuring the program, Sharma flashed a photoshopped image of an Aaj Tak promo on Chandrayaan-2. This was pointed out by several social media users who shared a video created by \u2018Political Kida\u2019.\n\nAaj Tak anchor Chitra Tripathi, who was featured on the photoshopped promo, tweeted about the misinformation.\n\nThe HW News broadcast carried a morphed image of a July 22 broadcast by Aaj Tak on the launch of Chandrayaan-2. The original promo was tweeted by Tripathi on the same day.\n\nAs evident, the original image has the words \u2013 \u201c\u0905\u092c \u091a\u093e\u0902\u0926 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u091f\u094d\u0920\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 (The moon is now in our clutches),\u201d while the photoshopped infographic included Prime Minister Modi\u2019s name in the sentence \u2013 \u201c\u0905\u092c \u091a\u093e\u0902\u0926 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u091f\u094d\u0920\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 (The moon is now in PM Modi\u2019s clutches.)\u201d\n\nThe photoshopped promo has been available online since before its appearance on HW News.\n\nAfter the error was brought to the notice of HW News and Abhisar Sharma, the channel took down its broadcast and uploaded it again after deleting the misinformation. A clarification on the same has been posted on its YouTube channel but is missing from its website, Facebook page and Twitter handle.\n\nSharma has also not added a clarification while tweeting the updated video titled, \u201c\u0930\u0935\u0940\u0936 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0948\u0917\u094d\u0938\u0947\u0938\u0947 \u0905\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0921 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0916\u093c\u093e\u092e\u094b\u0936\u0940! (Modi\u2019s silence on Ravish\u2019s Magsaysay award.)\u201d\n\nA photoshopped Aaj Tak promo thus featured on an HW News broadcast anchored by journalist Abhisar Sharma. HW News had in December last year broadcast a show anchored by journalist Vinod Dua which misled viewers on Union Minister Nitin Gadkari\u2019s statements on stalled projects and NPAs. The channel later took down the program and provided an elaborate clarification.\n\nThe photoshopped tweet had also made an appearance in a September 8 report by The Wire.", "lang": "en"}
