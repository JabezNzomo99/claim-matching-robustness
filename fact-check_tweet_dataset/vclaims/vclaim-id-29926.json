Looking at the average over a number of recent years, it is an underestimate.\n\nBut while cold weather is a major contributor to these deaths, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that they are all a result of people \u2018freezing to death\u2019. The increase in deaths can be due to a number of causes (such as the severity of influenza outbreaks) and can be influenced by a wide range of factors.\n\nIn 2018/19, there were an estimated 25,260 excess winter deaths according to official statistics across Great Britain (England and Wales and Scotland). Across Great Britain in 2018/19, at least 18,570 of these deaths were people aged 75 and older. Figures from Northern Ireland aren\u2019t yet available for this year so we can\u2019t look at the full picture across the UK.\n\nThe ONS does not classify excess winter deaths by pension age in England and Wales.\n\nThe latest figures from Northern Ireland estimate that there were 1,500 excess winter deaths in 2017/18. In total there were 55,720 in the whole of the UK in 2017/18, at least 42,250 of which were in people aged 75 and older.\n\nThe number of excess deaths estimated in 2018/19 is less than half the number in 2017/18 (even if you just look at Great Britain). However, it is common to have large fluctuations in the estimated number of excess winter deaths between years. To account for this discrepancy, it is preferable to use the average of all estimates over the last five years. In Great Britain, the average number of excess winter deaths over the last five years was 39,142.\n\nExcess winter deaths are calculated as the difference in the number of deaths over three months of winter compared to the three months before and after this period.\n\nWhile these deaths are not the result of older people literally \u2018freezing to death\u2019 as the post claims, they are linked to the colder weather during the winter months. The leading cause of excess winter deaths in 2018/19 was respiratory disease, followed by dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe Facebook post also refers to the 39 people found dead in a lorry container in Essex on 23 October 2019.", "lang": "en"}
