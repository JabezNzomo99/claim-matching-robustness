The claim is false; the video is a computer-generated simulation that was created in 2015 by a YouTube user.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on August 13, 2020. It has been viewed more than 1.3 million times.\n\nThe two-minute 57-second video shows fireworks exploding in front of Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji. Gioachino Rossini\u2019s William Tell Overture can be heard in the background.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cIt is rumoured that the fireworks were set off for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games to be held in Japan this year. The Olympics cannot be opened because of the new crown epidemic, but these fireworks cannot be stored until 2021, so the Olympic fireworks were set off under the beautiful Mount Fuji in advance, which is too spectacular. Tears 2020! !\u201d\n\nOn March 30, 2020, organisers of the Tokyo Olympics decided to postpone the event until July 23, 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook here, here and here; and on YouTube here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA reverse image search and subsequent keyword search on Google found the clip was originally published on December 1, 2015 on YouTube here by user hiramu55bocaboca, who regularly posts firework-related videos.\n\nThe caption, translated from Japanese to English, reads: \u201cA new work in almost a year. Like the last work, I based it on a fantasy imagination, like \u2018We held a major fireworks festival in winter at Lake Kawaguchi with full cooperation from Lake Kawaguchi Fisheries Association in order to celebrate Mt. Fuji\u2019s recognition as a World Heritage site.\u2019 So the background is Lake Kawaguchi. My ability as a director has not grown even compared with a year ago. But thanks to a wonderful tool developed by Mr. Anonymous, the quality of the bullets have improved immensely! Please feel the destruction force of critical bullets. Also, this time, I included reflections on the lake surface! Well, anyway, with up-tempo tunes, it really kills Mr. Fuji in the background, doesn\u2019t it^^; Does it not seem like a good decision?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of various scenes from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, YouTube user hiramu55bocaboca told AFP by email on August 17, 2020: \u201cIt's not real fireworks.\u201d\n\nThe user, who revealed his name is Hisashi Kinoshita, explained that he used a simulation software, FWsim, which \u201ccan design fireworks balls and combine them to design a fireworks show...The picture in the background can also be changed, so I used Mount Fuji in Japan as the background.\u201d\n\nJapan staged several firework displays across the country on June 1, 2020 \u201cto cheer up the public, urge the gods to end the coronavirus pandemic and provide practice for struggling pyrotechnic artisans\u201d, as reported by AFP here.", "lang": "en"}
