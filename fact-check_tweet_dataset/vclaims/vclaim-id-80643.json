This was done in part to ensure that small cigarette makers didn\u2019t gain a market advantage because they would be able to sell cigarettes at reduced prices.\n\nWhich brings us to the loophole. Under current Missouri law, the smaller companies can trim the amount they pay into the escrow fund. Missouri is the only state that has yet to take steps to prevent this.\n\nIn order to close the loophole \u2014 and return $50 million to Missouri \u2014 the legislature would have to pass Senate Bill 1096. The bill would require all nonparticipating manufacturers to either join the master settlement or be subject to modified escrow rules which prevent the companies from gaming the system to keep their escrow money.\n\nSB 1096 has supporters on both sides of the aisle, but it is not without its opponents. Small tobacco companies have been fighting different versions of the bill for more than a decade, calling it a tax on their products and a move on the part of big tobacco to earn more market share at their expense.\n\nSB 1096 has yet to pass either chamber of the General Assembly, and the consequences are already being felt. Because the bill failed to pass before April 15, Missouri can no longer receive the $50 million for 2016. In order to receive the money in 2017, the bill must be signed by Gov. Jay Nixon by June 3.\n\nIt certainly has cost the state. In October, Nixon withheld $46.1 million of the state's budget, relying on the passage of SB 1096 to fill the gap. Turner said that money would have gone to the Mental Health Department and the Department of Social Services, among others.\n\nAll things being equal, if the bill passes, taxpayers would win no matter what the state does with the money. If it\u2019s spent on services, citizens get the benefit of $50 million worth of services. If the state cuts spending and lowers taxes, they save money when they file their taxes in April.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just in 2017. If the loophole isn\u2019t closed, Missouri could lose additional money in the years to come. The big tobacco companies have begun arbitration concerning Missouri\u2019s diligent enforcement of the escrow laws in 2004. If an arbitration panel were to find against Missouri again, the state could be forced to forfeit more money.\n\nThe tobacco settlement and the arbitration that followed is complicated, but ultimately, Koster did reach a settlement to return $50 million dollars to Missouri. If the legislature passes SB 1096 by June 3, that money would come to the state in 2017. If it doesn\u2019t, the state could potentially be on the hook for even more.", "lang": "en"}
