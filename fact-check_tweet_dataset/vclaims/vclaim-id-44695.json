This morning, headlines declared that over one million children were set to be kept off school.\n\nThis was based on survey results published by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) which found that senior school leaders estimated on average that 46% of families would keep their children at home when schools \u201copen more fully\u201d and the fact that there are around two million children in total in the three year groups going back to school today. NFER told us that it did not calculate the one million figure.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in that 46% figure though, as it\u2019s based on what senior teachers thought in the first half of May when asked, rather than a survey of families\u2019 intentions.\n\nAssuming that senior teachers\u2019 estimates of families\u2019 intentions are correct, 46% of families doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to 46% of all children in these years, as the Mirror pointed out, because many families will have more than one child returning to school.\n\nThe number of children going back to school\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that there are around 2.1 million children in the year groups allowed back to school today which is around 43% of all primary school children. It also said there are \u201cup to 680,000 families that could expect all of their children to return to school\u201d. That\u2019s around 17.5% of families with children in early years or of primary school age.\n\nNFER sent a survey to all 20,553 state funded mainstream primary and secondary schools in England between 7 and 17 May. It received responses from 1,233 senior leaders (head teachers, principals and deputy head teachers) as well as 1,821 other teachers. This particular question was based on the responses of senior leaders.\n\nNFER asked senior leaders \u201cWhen schools open more fully, what percentage of families do you think will keep their children away from school?\u201d and it told us the teachers then had to indicate a response between 0% and 100% by moving a slider to their chosen response number, or they could choose the option \u2018not sure\u2019. 949 senior leaders responded from 898 schools, providing an answer somewhere between 2% and 96%. NFER told us that half of all teachers\u2019 responses fell between 30% and 59%. Another 200 responded \u2018not sure\u2019.\n\nNFER then weighted the data to make it representative of schools in England.\n\nIt found \u201cSenior leaders predict that when schools open more fully, 46 per cent of families will keep their children at home\u201d. NFER told us that 46% was the mean average after the results were weighted.\n\nNFER also says to \u201cnote that because senior leaders were answering questions over a ten-day period, some responses pre-date the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement on the 10th May and the publication of DfE guidance from the 12th to the 25th May\u201d. This refers to the Prime Minister\u2019s speech on 10 May when he announced that Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 would be reopening \u201cat the earliest\u201d by 1 June as well as other guidance from the Department for Education on schools reopening.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the figure produced by the NFER survey. It is an average based on what teachers think rather than families themselves, the survey was done in the first half of May and we don\u2019t know how or if attitudes may have changed since then and the question didn\u2019t specify a situation where only specific year groups may have returned (as is the case today).\n\nBut even assuming it is correct that 46% of families will keep their children home today, that doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to 46% of all children in those year groups that can go back to school today. Some families will have multiple children who are eligible to return to school, while other families may have some children who can return and others who cannot. It\u2019s possible such factors could affect how likely a family is to send their children back to school, which could mean that 46% of families might not translate to 46% of children. It could be more, or less.\n\nThe only way to know for sure will be through attendance information submitted daily by schools to the Department for Education.", "lang": "en"}
