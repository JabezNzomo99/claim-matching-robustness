In his attempt to gain leverage in negotiations, his administration has imposed tariffs, for example, on the importation of solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminium, as chronicled by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nOn July 6, the U.S. began imposing tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports. China retaliated with equal tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods, including on U.S. soybeans, wheat, corn, sorghum and beef.\n\nAs we wrote in a previous article, soybeans were the top U.S. agricultural export in 2017 at $21.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Agricultural economic experts we spoke with for that story warned that a prolonged trade war would hurt U.S. farmers in general and soybean farmers in particular.\n\nIn a July 20 tweet, the president said that \u201cFarmers will WIN!\u201d under his trade policies, which is his opinion. But he made false claims in supporting that position in two recent tweets:\n\nIt is simply not true that \u201cFarmers have done poorly for 15 years.\u201d\n\nU.S. farms have seen net farm income generally decline in the last five years. But they \u201cexperienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,\u201d according to a February report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nAccording to USDA data, net farm income in real inflation-adjusted dollars reached a record $133.6 billion in 2013. (That was due in large part to the 2012 drought, as we\u2019ll explain.)\n\nNet farm income has been in decline since 2013, as the USDA chart below shows.\n\nIt is also not true that the recent \u201cdownward trend,\u201d as Trump called it, is due to trade.\n\nAs Wallace E. Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, told us for a previous story: \u201cThe ag sector is seeing some hard times, but it is because of lower prices and not trade. Weather has been pretty good, production high, and prices therefore lower.\u201d (See \u201cTrump Distorts Facts on Agricultural Trade\u201d for more information.)\n\nAs for soybeans, Trump is generally correct that soybean prices are down from five years ago \u2014 but not as much as he says and not for the reason he claims.\n\nA July 16 USDA report shows that soybean prices received by U.S. farmers were $14.40 per bushel in the 2012/2013 marketing year, which is from September through August. The price in the 2017/2018 marketing year was $9.35 per bushel \u2013 a decline of $5.05 per bushel or 35 percent.\n\nMonthly USDA data show that the peak price for soybeans since 2009 came in August 2012, when it reached $16.20 per bushel. As of May 2018, the most recent month for which data are available, the price was $9.84 \u2014 a 39 percent decline from the peak.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite 50 percent, but it is a considerable drop. What caused the decline in prices? Trump says \u201ca big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries.\u201d That\u2019s false.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s claims on soybeans, we again contacted Tyner, the Purdue agricultural economics professor. Tyner told us that the decline in prices for soybeans \u201cwas not due to trade policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember that 2012 was a severe drought year, so the prices were high because of low production \u2013 not policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you start from a high number, the change looks larger. Look at the non-drought years.\u201d\n\nHow bad was the 2012 drought?\n\nIn November 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report on the impact of the 2012 drought on crops. BLS called it \u201cthe most severe drought the United States has seen since the 1950s.\u201d\n\nBut, the report said, \u201cthe severe drought that has affected much of the nation drove crop prices up.\u201d U.S. soybeans had their \u201csmallest harvest in 9 years,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the price of soybeans peaked in the 2012/2013 marketing year.\n\nAn Aug. 30, 2013, report by the Congressional Research Service on U.S. farm income said the unexpected drought caused a \u201cdramatic reversal of fortunes\u201d for U.S. farmers.\n\n\u201cThe 2012/2013 growing season will be remembered for the dramatic reversal of fortunes where by early springtime prospects for record harvests and low commodity prices were transformed in a two-month period into an outlook of supply shortages and record-high commodity prices,\u201d the report said.\n\nSo, contrary to the president\u2019s claim, \u201cbad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries\u201d are not to blame for the drop in soybean prices from five years ago.\n\nThe prices have, in fact, returned to those in non-drought years, as Tyner said and as the chart below shows.", "lang": "en"}
