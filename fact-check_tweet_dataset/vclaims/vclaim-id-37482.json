That\u2019s when her father, a Montgomery Ward salesman, had a heart attack, and so her mother started to earn money by answering phones in the catalogue department at Sears, Roebuck and Co. \u201cA job at Sears allowed my mother to eke out a living for a family of three,\u201d wrote Warren in her memoir. She turned 12 in 1961.\n\nIt makes a difference in determining whether Warren is right. At $1, her mother would have earned an annual wage of $2,080. (We are assuming a full-time job of 40 hours a week for 52 weeks.) That is well below the Census Bureau\u2019s average poverty threshold for a three-person family of $2,383 in 1961 \u2014 and also the level the Warren campaign urged us to consider: female head of household for a family of three. That was $2,164.\n\nWarren\u2019s broader point is largely correct if you use the official poverty rate. The minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. In the 1960s, a minimum-wage job may have kept a three-person family out of poverty. Now, such a job would not keep a single mother with a child out of poverty.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate debate about whether the official poverty measures adequately capture the range of services available to poor Americans, but we are going to keep this simple and focus on the official rate. Many experts say the official rate excludes social policies that the United States has developed and expanded to reduce poverty, and so the Supplemental Poverty Measure was developed. (See chart below.) \u201cIn 2012 alone, the combined effect of all federal tax, cash and in-kind aid programs was to lift approximately 14.5 percent of the population \u2014 over 45 million people \u2014 out of poverty,\u201d according to the 2014 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nThe Warren campaign said Warren\u2019s parents signed a $13,900 mortgage in 1960 that stipulated monthly payments of $87.57. That would have been 44 percent of the $1.15-an-hour wage and more than 50 percent of a $1 wage. A general rule is that no more than 30 percent of income should go to housing so money would have been tight under either wage scale.\n\nThe Warren campaign referred us to a more detailed account in her memoir, \u201cA Fighting Chance.\u201d It describes how, after the heart attack, the family car was repossessed and her father could not get his old job selling carpet back. He got a different job in which he was paid on commission, not a regular paycheck. Her mother took the minimum-wage Sears job when they were in danger of losing their house. \u201cShe got the job answering phones at Sears,\u201d Warren writes. \u201cLater, Daddy left his job as a salesman at Montgomery Ward\u2014 or maybe he was let go, I don\u2019t really know. He got work as a maintenance man cleaning up around an apartment building.\u201d\n\nThe timeline is not entirely clear though it appears that for some period of time, the family lived on more than just a minimum-wage paycheck. The Warren campaign said it did not know how long her father did not have a job.\n\nAs we noted, Warren\u2019s overall point is correct: The federal minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation. In 1961, it could have kept a three-person family out of poverty. But today, it wouldn\u2019t even keep a two-person family out of poverty, at least according to the official poverty rate. Her case glosses over the fact that the official poverty rate may not be the best metric, but there is little debate that the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation.\n\nAs for our reader\u2019s question, the answer depends on whether Warren\u2019s mother in 1961 qualified for a minimum wage of $1 or $1.15. She was either close to the edge of the poverty line or just under it, depending on the data you examine. Since we do not know what she earned, we will leave this unrated.
