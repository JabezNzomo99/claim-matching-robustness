In the backdrop on this, Mahesh Vikram Hegde\u2019s Postcard News shared an image on social media that juxtaposes quotes attributed world leaders \u2014 Israel, Russia, America and Japan.\n\nThe following quotes are given in the infographic:\n\n1. Those who are planning to attack India need to face us \u2013 Israel (Benjamin Netanyahu)\n\n 2. We are always with India \u2013 Russia (Vladimir Putin)\n\n 3. India is our friend & we are always with India \u2013 America (Donald Trump)\n\n 4. If in case china attacks India then the end of China will begin \u2013 Japan (Shinzo Abe)\n\nOn May 30, fake news portal Postcard News posted this image on their Facebook. It was shared over 850 times (archive link).\n\n[Also read: Postcard \u2018News\u2019 \u2013 A mega factory of fake news that continues to spew venom]\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News searched for all the quotes mentioned in the viral image but could not find any relevant results. In fact, the US and Russia have given official statements on the stand-off between India and China but they are not even minutely close to what is being shared on social media.\n\nOn May 27. US President Trump offered to mediate between the two Asian giants.\n\nThe next day, President Trump claimed that he spoke with PM Modi who told him that he wasn\u2019t in a \u201cgood mood\u201d over the \u201cbig conflict\u201d between India and China.\n\nBut the Government of India dismissed President Trump\u2019s claim that he spoke with PM Modi on the issue of the Line of Actual Control, as untrue.\n\nOn June 1, Russian envoy Roman Babushki while speaking with India Today commented on the border dispute. He said, \u201c\u2026there are dedicated special mechanisms and tools developed by both countries, including hotlines, special representatives dialogue and even informal summits. We are confident that Indian and Chinese friends are duly equipped to find the way out for mutual satisfaction. We would encourage every endeavour in this regard.\u201d\n\nJapan and Isreal have not made any public comments on the issue. It is pertinent to note that over the past few years China has increased trade with the latter each year since 2004, as per a report by Nikkei Asian Review. In an interview with the organisation, Professor Shaul Chorev, Director of the Maritime Policy and Strategy Research Center at the University of Haifa, said that Israel is \u201cvery happy\u201d with Chinese investment and it should not be expected to \u201cwork only according to US wishes.\u201d\n\nThus, the viral image doesn\u2019t indicate the respective country\u2019s support to India if tensions between India and China escalate. Over the past few weeks, due to border skirmishes, there has an increase in misinformation about India and China. On May 29, Alt News reported that Times Now aired old videos during a broadcast on the recent tensions. On May 21 and June 2 we reported that old videos were floating on social media with similar claims.", "lang": "en"}
