The incident was so notorious by local standards that the police chief posted security camera video of it on the police department's homepage.\n\nSo, instead of watching six dozen humans butchered, enjoy this exhibit of really bad truck driving.\n\n\n\nLead Stories' motto is \"Just because it's trending doesn't mean it's true.\" Our Trendolizer scours social nets around the world for the hottest hoaxes.
