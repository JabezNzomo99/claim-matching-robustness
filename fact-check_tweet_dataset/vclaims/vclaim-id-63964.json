As a 501(c)4 tax-exempt organization, it also accepts charitable donations.\n\nEither way, any money paid to AARP through membership dues or donations does not go \u201cdirectly\u201d to the Democratic party.\n\nThe AARP lobbies the government on behalf of causes that affect people aged 50 and older. Those activities may include taking a stand on health care and Social Security.\n\nIn terms of candidates and political parties, however, AARP\u2019s official position is that it is non-partisan. The organization states it \u201cdoes not support, endorse or contribute to political candidates or parties.\u201d\n\nInstead, per AARP, the organization\u2019s role in terms of election politics is \u201cconnecting voters to information about where the candidates stand on issues most important to them including the future of Social Security and other critical issues related to financial security, health and well-being.\u201d\n\nWe checked the AARP\u2019s federal campaign finance data using the website Open Secrets, a project operated by the government accountability organization The Center for Responsive Politics. We found no contributions to any political candidates or parties, Democratic or otherwise, from AARP, the organization. However, contributions from individuals who work for AARP is another matter.\n\n\u201cAARP does not have any record of direct contributions to political parties or candidates based on my review of federal campaign finance and tax filings covering recent years, but AARP\u2019s officers [executives] and employees can still make political donations in a personal capacity, and contributions from donors listing AARP as their employer in Federal Election Commission records have primarily gone to Democratic candidates in recent years,\u201d said Anna Massoglia, a researcher for The Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAARP policy prohibits employees or officers from engaging in any personal political activity using AARP resources or during work hours.\n\nAccording to campaign finance data tracked by Open Secrets, individual donors associated with AARP made a total of $96,381 in political contributions as of this writing in the 2020 federal election cycle, the majority (87.45%) of those donations going to Democratic candidates.\n\nMassoglia said that as a 501(c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity. But their activities have been issue-oriented and bipartisan. For example, a 2018 AARP ad praised U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing policy. The organization has also supported upholding the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law signed by Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama.\n\nAARP spokesperson Jason Young told us by phone that the organization, as a 501(c)4 non-profit, is prohibited by law from making political contributions. \u201cNot only does AARP not make donations of this sort, we never have and we don\u2019t have a PAC,\u201d Young added.\n\nYoung said that although some AARP employees have made political contributions in a personal capacity, the sum of donations is relatively small.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we are largely absent form this type of political engagement, and that\u2019s because AARP as an organization is focused on policy, not politics,\u201d Young stated.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s true that individuals who work for AARP have donated primarily to Democratic candidates, individual donations are not the same as contributions by an organization. Because AARP as an organization has not contributed to the Democratic party or its candidates, we rate this claim, \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
