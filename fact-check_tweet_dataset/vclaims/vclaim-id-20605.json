Let me set out the position: the import or export of medical radioactive isotopes is not subject to any Euratom licensing requirements. Euratom places no restrictions on exports to countries outside the EU so after leaving Euratom our ability to access medical isotopes produced in Europe will not be affected.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how our ability to access nuclear medical materials will be affected if we leave Euratom\u2014a body which regulates and creates a common market for nuclear materials in Europe. To say that access \u201cwill not be affected\u201d by leaving\u2014which is the government\u2019s current intention\u2014seems to overstate what we currently know.\n\nThere are two key features of Euratom being debated here: the common market it creates in the trade and transport of nuclear materials, and that fact that Euratom has ownership rights over certain sensitive nuclear materials produced by member states\u2014for instance those that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Some of these materials are subject to special licenses when trading with countries outside the EU (and Euratom can place restrictions on their use), but this doesn\u2019t extend to the medical materials being discussed.\n\nSo leaving wouldn\u2019t produce any particular licensing restrictions on medical radioisotopes, but this doesn't mean there will be no issue in accessing them if we leave Euratom. Simply leaving the common market it creates might make it harder for the UK to guarantee a future supply.\n\nWhy people are talking about Euratom and medicine\n\nIn January this year, the government introduced a bill to give the Prime Minister the power to start Brexit. That became an Act of Parliament, and paved the way for the Prime Minister to formally notify the EU that the UK was leaving in March.\n\nIn a footnote to the bill and later the Act, the government said that not only did it intend to withdraw from the EU, it also intended to leave the European Atomic Energy Community\u2014or \u2018Euratom\u2019. That\u2019s been followed up in the recent publication of the Brexit 'repeal bill' and a position paper released setting out the UK's aims on nuclear materials and their safeguards.\n\nEuratom creates a single market for nuclear energy in Europe and regulates the movement of certain nuclear materials. It\u2019s not technically part of the EU, but in practice it is intertwined within EU institutions.\n\nThat\u2019s caused some disagreement among legal experts over whether the UK can remain in Euratom while leaving the EU. The European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator said recently that this wouldn\u2019t be possible. That said, even without full membership, it\u2019s possible that some form of associate membership could be negotiated.\n\nThis matters in medicine because some procedures rely on nuclear materials called \u2018radioisotopes\u2019 and their related equipment. They\u2019re used, for example, to diagnose or treat different types of cancer. The UK doesn\u2019t have any reactors that produce these, so we have to import them.\n\nThere\u2019s a catch too: some of these materials decay very quickly\u2014within hours or days\u2014and can\u2019t be stored. That\u2019s why we work a lot with nearby countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands to bring the materials in quickly, and delays or disruption to this supply can be costly.\n\nThere are concerns that leaving Euratom could disrupt the UK\u2019s ability to do this. This came to prominence last week when the London Evening Standard reported that the government faced a rebellion on the plans to leave Euratom from Conservative MPs. In addition, the Royal College of Radiologists expressed concern that leaving Euratom could threaten the supply of vital medical material to the UK.\n\nThe government describes these reports as \u201calarmist\u201d, causing \u201cunnecessary worry\u201d for cancer patients.\n\nEuratom creates a nuclear common market\u2014which is similar in concept to the single market. One function of this is it bans member states from imposing customs controls on the imports or exports of certain nuclear products.\n\nOne such product covered is what\u2019s called \u201cartificial radioactive isotopes\u201d, which has been interpreted as including the medical radioisotopes we\u2019ve been discussing.\n\nIf that is the case, then member states can\u2019t impose controls on the imports or exports of these isotopes.\n\nSo if we leave the nuclear common market, it does open up the possibility that additional barriers to trading these products could be introduced, although it\u2019s not clear how likely that would be in practice.\n\nIn addition, the UK may find it harder to guarantee the supply of these materials if there are interruptions in supply, according to the Institute for Government. Euratom oversees the supply chain, and it\u2019s not clear what priority the UK would be given if there were a shortage of supplies. Such interruptions have happened before, and might again in the future.\n\nWe don\u2019t know that either of these things will happen if the UK leaves Euratom. A lot will depend on whether transitional arrangements are made, and on what kind of relationship the UK strikes with Euratom from the outside, which will be subject to negotiations.\n\nThe government\u2019s response to these concerns was set out in fuller form yesterday. Rather than look at the consequences of leaving the common market, it makes a separate point that these medical materials aren\u2019t owned by Euratom so there would be no special restrictions on accessing them if we left:\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that leaving Euratom will have any adverse effect on the supply of medical radioisotopes. Contrary to what has been in the press, they are not classed as special fissile material and are not subject to nuclear safeguards, so they are not part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is the driver of our nuclear safeguards regime\u201d\n\nThis particular point is right. The treaty establishing Euratom gives it ownership rights over \u2018special fissile materials\u2019 produced in the EU. It also has rights over contracts made for trading these materials from inside the EU or outside.\n\nSpecial fissile materials don\u2019t include the kind of medical radioisotopes we\u2019ve been discussing, and so\u2014as far as we\u2019ve seen\u2014they aren\u2019t subject to the same rules.\n\nEven so, this doesn\u2019t mean leaving the organisation won\u2019t adversely affect the UK\u2019s access in other ways, as we\u2019ve set out above.\n\nThanks to Marcus Shepheard, a researcher at the Institute for Government, for assistance in writing this article.", "lang": "en"}
