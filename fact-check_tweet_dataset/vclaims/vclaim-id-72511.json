John Thune, R-S.D., said one of the first acts of the new Senate will be to force President Barack Obama\u2019s hand on the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nThe controversial project has been in the works since 2008 and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs. Opponents say the pipeline will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills.\n\nSpeaking about the pipeline on , Thune said, \"We think the president ought to sign that into the law. His administration has done five environmental impact statements, all of which have said it would have a minimal impact on the environment, and his own State Department said it would support 42,000 jobs.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at the jobs claim several times ( the number of permanent jobs is about 50 ) and in this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on Thune\u2019s comments about the environmental impact statements.\n\nThune\u2019s office sent us a list of five studies. All were conducted by the U.S. State Department, which has jurisdiction because the project crosses the border between Canada and the United States. Whether you see them as five separate studies depends on how you look at the environmental impact statement process.\n\nBefore an agency issues a Final Environmental Impact Statement, it first releases a draft version. Citizens, businesses and interest groups then submit comments that may or may not shape the final report.\n\nThe State Department ultimately produced two final reports on the Keystone XL pipeline. The first one from was preceded by two drafts. The department wrote a second report, partly because it couldn\u2019t meet a legislative deadline to grant final approval, but more fundamentally, because the pipeline project changed. It became shorter and took a different route to avoid a particularly environmentally sensitive area. That second report, released in , also initially appeared in draft form.\n\nSo we have two final environmental impact statements, and three other draft reports. Thune\u2019s office sees that as five studies. Others take a more nuanced view.\n\nJames Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University told PolitiFact that while there were five documents, \"they're all really draft and finalized versions of the same analysis.\"\n\nSo that\u2019s the reasoning for or against five statements.\n\nNow, what do they say?\n\nThune contended that Obama\u2019s administration found that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. That is a fair paraphrase of the State Department\u2019s findings.\n\nOn the key issue of greenhouse gas emissions, the State Department\u2019s final word was that the project was \"unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands\" in Canada. In short, one way or the other, companies in Canada would continue to extract oil -- meaning the rate of pollution was unlikely to grow simply due to the pipeline alone.\n\nBut the administration has not spoken with a single voice. The tagged the State Department\u2019s draft from April 2013 with the label \"Environmental objections -- insufficient information.\"\n\nThe EPA said, among other things, that the pipeline might have a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the State Department concluded. The focus here was on how fast oil would come out of the Canadian fields. Pulling oil from the tar sands is costly and even more so when you tack transportation costs on top.\n\nThe EPA felt that the State Department had not looked carefully enough at the impact of the pipeline if oil prices fell. When oil prices fall, the lower shipping costs that come with the pipeline matter a whole lot more to keeping the enterprise viable.\n\nThe State Department found that with high oil prices, the tar sands would be mined for oil, pipeline or no.\n\nColeman told PolitiFact that finding is now in question.\n\n\"The State Department\u2019s analysis was predicated on its assumption that West Texas Intermediate would not fall under $75 per barrel and it is now under $55. At that level, State said things could change,\" Coleman said.\n\nThe that with prices between $65 and $75 per barrel \"higher transportation costs could have a substantial impact on oil sands production levels, possibly in excess of the capacity of the proposed Project.\" But with the pipeline, transportation costs drop and production would be higher. That would affect greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe EPA also raised objections to the State Department\u2019s examination of potential oil spills.\n\nThune said that the administration had done five studies that all found that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. The State Department produced five documents, but in reality, all were versions of the same analysis.\n\nThe State Department did conclude that the pipeline by itself would have no significant impact on the extraction of oil from Canada. However, that was the finding of one government department. The Environmental Protection Agency raised questions, based on the price of oil. The State Department\u2019s final analysis also included the caveat that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on tar sands extraction only if oil prices remained above $75 per barrel.\n\nSince then, oil prices have fallen well below that point.\n\nThune\u2019s claim overstates the number of separate studies the administration has done, glosses over the differences of opinion within the administration, and fails to account for the caveat included in the State Department\u2019s analysis.\n\nHelp fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.", "lang": "en"}
