Have heard rumors it's because he is listed as white. Or that because he isn't a U.S. born citizen.\n\nIn April 2011, President Barack Obama sought to put end to rumors claiming that he was not a natural-born citizen of the United States by obtaining and releasing a copy of his long form birth certificate issued by the state of Hawaii. Officials from that state certified that the copy of the certificate they provided to President Obama was authentic:\n\nThe Hawaii State Health Department recently complied with a request by President Barack Obama for certified copies of his original Certificate of Live Birth, which is sometimes referred to in the media as a \u201clong form\u201d birth certificate. \u201cWe hope that issuing certified copies of the original Certificate of Live Birth to President Obama will end the numerous inquiries related to his birth in Hawaii,\u201d Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy said. \u201cI have seen the original records filed at the Department of Health and attest to the authenticity of the certified copies the department provided to the President that further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii.\u201d On April 25, 2011, pursuant to President Obama\u2019s request, Director Fuddy personally witnessed the copying of the original Certificate of Live Birth and attested to the authenticity of the two copies. Dr. Alvin Onaka, the State Registrar, certified the\n\n copies.\n\nAs they had with the Certification of Live Birth made public by the Obama campaign in June 2008, birthers immediately claimed that the long form birth certificate was also a forgery. The primary arguments advanced to demonstrate that the certificate was forged were claims that some textual elements of the certificate were anachronistic, and that the existence of layers found when the PDF file was opened with Adobe Illustrator proved that it had been altered. All of these arguments are erroneous.\n\nThe claims of anachronism stemmed from three elements in the certificate:\n\n1. Back in 1961 people of color were called \u2018Negroes.\u2019 So how can the Obama \u2018birth certificate\u2019 state he is \u2018African-American\u2019 when the term wasn\u2019t even used at that time? 2. The birth certificate that the White House released lists Obama\u2019s birth as August 4, 1961. It also lists Barack Hussein Obama as his father. No big deal, right? At the time of Obama\u2019s birth, it also shows that his father is aged 25 years old, and that Obama\u2019s father was born in \u201cKenya, East Africa\u201d. This wouldn\u2019t seem like anything of concern, except the fact that Kenya did not even exist until 1963, two whole years after Obama\u2019s birth, and 27 years after his father\u2019s birth. How could Obama\u2019s father have been born in a country that did not yet exist? Up and until Kenya was formed in 1963, it was known as the \u201cBritish East Africa Protectorate\u201d. 3. On the birth certificate released by the White House, the listed place of birth is \u201cKapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital\u201d. This cannot be, because the hospital(s) in question in 1961 were called \u201cKaui Keolani Children\u2019s Hospital\u201d and \u201cKapi\u2019olani Maternity Home\u201d, respectively. The name did not change to Kapi\u2019olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital until 1978, when these two hospitals merged. How can this particular name of the hospital be on a birth certificate dated 1961 if this name had not yet been applied to it until 1978?\n\nClaims that these elements are anachronistic to 1961 (the year of Barack Obama\u2019s birth) are incorrect:\n\u2022 Nowhere on Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate does the term \u201cAfrican-American\u201d appear. The space for \u201cRace of Father\u201d is filled in with the word \u201cAfrican,\u201d which at the time was a descriptor that blacks who were actually native-born Africans (like Barack Obama\u2019s father was) were more likely to use for themselves than \u201cnegro\u201d (the latter being synonymous with \u201cslave\u201d in Euro-colonial countries such as Kenya).\n\u2022 In 1895 the British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate, the forerunner of the country now known as the republic of Kenya. Although Kenya did not achieve complete independence from the United Kingdom until 1963, it was known as the Kenya Colony from 1920 onwards and was typically referred to as Kenya long before 1963. A search of news reports from 1961 (the year of Barack Obama\u2019s birth) turns up hundreds and hundreds of news articles referencing that entity simply as \u201cKenya.\u201d\n\u2022 The former Kapi\u2019olani Maternity Home became the Kapi\u2019olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (where Barack Obama was born) in 1931, and it retained that appellation until 1971, when its name was shortened to Kapi\u2019olani Hospital. The Kauikeolani Children\u2019s Hospital (where Barack Obama was born) was a separate entity which merged with the Kapi\u2019olani Hospital in 1978 to become the Kapi\u2019olani Medical Center for Women and Children.A listing of social services available in the Hawaiian islands documents that the facility bore that name prior to 1961: Moreover, a copy of a birth certificate issued to a child born in Honolulu one day after Barack Obama also shows \u201cKapi\u2019olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital\u201d listed in the \u201cName of Hospital\u201d field.\n\nAs for the argument that opening the birth certificate\u2019s PDF file in Adobe Illustrator reveals the presence of multiple layers, which proves that the image was altered, that claim was debunked by an Adobe-certified expert:\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for some of President Obama\u2019s doubters to claim the long-awaited birth certificate posted online by the White House had been altered or might be a fake.The doubters have latched onto the idea that Adobe Illustrator \u2014 the premier program for computer graphic artists \u2014 \u201creveals\u201d evidence of document manipulation in the Obama birth certificate. They note Illustrator reveals nine separate layers of the document, and claim it\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d the file has been altered. But that\u2019s not so, says Jean-Claude Tremblay, a leading software trainer and Adobe-certified expert, who has years of experience working with and teaching Adobe Illustrator. He said the layers cited by doubters are evidence of the use of common, off-the-shelf scanning software \u2014 not evidence of a forgery. \u201cI have seen a lot of illustrator documents that come from photos and contain those kind of clippings \u2014 and it looks exactly like this,\u201d he said. Tremblay explained that the scanner optical character recognition (OCR) software attempts to translate characters or words in a photograph into text. He said the layers cited by the doubters shows that software at work \u2014 and nothing more. \u201cWhen you open it in Illustrator it looks like layers, but it doesn\u2019t look like someone built it from scratch. If someone made a fake it wouldn\u2019t look like this,\u201d he said. \u201cSome scanning software is trying to separate the background and the text and splitting element into layers and parts of layers.\u201d Tremblay also said that during the scanning process, instances where the software was unable to separate text fully from background led to the creation of a separate layer within the document. This could be places where a signature runs over the line of background, or typed characters touch the internal border of the document. \u201cI know that you can scan a document from a scanner [and] most of the time it will appear as one piece, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no software that\u2019s doing this kind of stuff,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s really quite common.\n\nJohn Woodman, author of Is Barack Obama\u2019s Birth Certificate a Fraud?: A Computer Guy Examines The Evidence for Forgery, also debunked the \u201clayers\u201d argument in a series of videos:\n\nThe March \u201cCold Case Posse\u201d investigation of Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate conducted by Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio produced no new evidence demonstrating that document to be a forgery; that entity\u2019s report by Mara Zebest simply recycled old arguments that had long since been thoroughly debunked in detail. Likewise, a July 2012 announcement from Sheriff Arpaio repeated more rumors that had already been debunked.", "lang": "en"}
