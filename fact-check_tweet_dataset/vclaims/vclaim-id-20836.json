There are two key reasons why: the available data is very bad at answering this sort of question, and for most projects it\u2019s not possible to single out who benefits. A lot of projects benefit people across the UK, others across several connected regions, like a long-distance railway for example.\n\nThe main published data also doesn\u2019t include all spending by devolved governments, so it\u2019s even more difficult to do comparisons outside of England.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the caveats on infrastructure spending before. For now, here\u2019s what we can say from the available figures.\n\nOf projects allocated to specific regions, London and the North West currently receive more spending per head than other parts of England.\n\nThe government calculates that, comparing English regions, London is set to get around \u00a32,500 per head from central and local government from 2017/18 to 2020/21, just counting funding that could be allocated to a specific place. The London figure includes spending by Transport for London, so the comparisons aren\u2019t very accurate.\n\nThe North West is similar at \u00a32,300 per head, while the North East and Yorkshire are behind at around \u00a31,300.\n\nJohn Mann represents a constituency in the East Midlands, which does get relatively little funding per head from central and local government: about \u00a31,400.\n\nOther spending comes from private companies, which doesn\u2019t change the picture hugely (the South West gets a huge bump in private funding from the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station project\u2014though that\u2019s also an example of a project which will be felt beyond the region it\u2019s allocated to).\n\nWales overall gets much less per head from central government, with North Wales taking most of that from a single construction project. But that leaves out all the money from the Welsh government.\n\nSeparate figures from the Welsh government suggests it plans to fund around \u00a36.5 billion on projects currently in the pipeline. Not all of those have necessarily started yet. One example is the biggest single project listed: a new M4 Corridor around Newport, in South Wales, due to start construction at the end of this year.\n\nIt\u2019s much more difficult to pinpoint projects that go specifically to North Wales, and how that translates per head. As a very rough guide, and factoring in the devolved funding, Wales as a whole is on a better footing than most English regions but still some way behind London and the North West, in terms of their public infrastructure spending per head.\n\nThe Welsh government told us that while Welsh and UK infrastructure spending figures aren\u2019t directly comparable, the types of project and the information they hold is broadly similar.\n\nIt said better figures were provided by the Treasury on spending comparisons per head between UK regions, although this only gives current funding for projects and not expected future financing.", "lang": "en"}
