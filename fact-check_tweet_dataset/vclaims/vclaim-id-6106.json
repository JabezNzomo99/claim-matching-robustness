A frightened dog barks louder. I\u2019d like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world.\"\n\nLater in the statement, Kim said, \"Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\"\n\nTrump responded on Twitter: \"Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!\"\n\nWhere this war of words will lead is anyone\u2019s guess. PolitiFact recently reviewed the issues surrounding North Korea as a preview to Trump\u2019s speech at the United Nations, and we fact-checked Trump\u2019s speech as well.", "lang": "en"}
