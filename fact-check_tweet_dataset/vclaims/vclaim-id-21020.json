The latter is the political action committee of Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend and supporter of Hillary and Bill Clinton.\n\nWe previously wrote about the donations in October, when Trump mentioned them during a campaign rally. This time, he brought them up in a series of tweets in which he criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not removing the current head of the FBI.\n\nBut the contributions didn\u2019t come from Clinton or her campaign, and Andrew McCabe wasn\u2019t \u201cin charge\u201d of the FBI\u2019s investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails at the time of the donations, either.\n\nJill McCabe\u2019s campaign received $467,500 from McAuliffe\u2019s PAC and another $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party for the November 2015 election. McCabe wasn\u2019t the only candidate to receive \u201cbig dollars\u201d from McAuliffe\u2019s PAC that year. Common Good VA gave $803,500 to state Senate candidate Jeremy McPike, who won his race, and $781,500 to Daniel Gecker, who lost his. These donations were all part of a failed effort by the Democratic governor to help the Democrats take control of the state Senate that year.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Clinton had any say in the contributions to McCabe\u2019s campaign or even knew about them.\n\nAlso, McCabe had lost the election by the time her husband became deputy director of the FBI in February 2016. It was in that role that he \u201cassumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails,\u201d according to an FBI spokesman quoted by the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story about the donations.\n\nThe Journal wrote that while McCabe \u201cwas part of the executive leadership team overseeing the Clinton email investigation \u2026 FBI officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. [James] Comey, who served as a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George W. Bush.\u201d Comey was FBI director at the time.\n\nFor more, read our original article, \u201cClinton\u2019s Connection to FBI Official.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
