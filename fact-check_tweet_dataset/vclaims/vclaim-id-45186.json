Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: Video of an obese Diego Maradona playing with the ball. Fact: The man in the video is not Diego Maradona. It is Roly Serrano who played the character of Diego Maradona in the Italian movie \u2013 \u2018Youth\u2019, which was released in 2015. The clip is also from the movie. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a similar video was found in the search results. It was posted in 2015 with the title \u2013 \u2018Youth (2015) dir: Paolo Sorrentino\u2019. The \u2018Youth\u2019 is an Italian movie which was directed by Paolo Sorrentino and was released in 2015.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords, an extended version of the same video was found on YouTube with the title \u2013 \u2018Maradona PELICULA Juventud played by Roly Serrano HD\u2019 (translated in English). So, when searched for the character of Roly Serrano in the \u2018Youth\u2019 movie, it was found that he played the character of Diego Maradona and the posted video is related to the movie. The interview of Roly Serrano regarding his character (as Maradona) in the movie can be watched here.\n\nTo sum it up, the obese person kicking the ball in the video is not the real Diego Maradona. It is Roly Serrano playing the character of Diego Maradona in an Italian movie.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
