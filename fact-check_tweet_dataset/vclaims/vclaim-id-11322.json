Elizabeth Warren released the results of a genetic test showing she has a small but detectable amount of Native American DNA. The report concluded there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d she had a Native American ancestor approximately six to 10 generations ago. But many have misconstrued the results \u2014 including President Donald Trump, who wrongly claimed Warren \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any Indian blood.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s release, which was widely interpreted as a sign that she intends to run for president in 2020, comes after years of controversy over her heritage. Warren has previously said she was part Cherokee and Delaware Indian, based on stories she heard growing up. Her ancestry first became a political issue in 2012, when she ran for Senate in Massachusetts. Critics questioned whether she received any advantages from claiming Native American ancestry \u2014 an idea we\u2019ve addressed before (there\u2019s no evidence she benefited).\n\nSubsequently, Trump took to calling her \u201cPocahontas,\u201d and during a rally this past July, challenged her to take a DNA test, saying he would donate $1 million to charity \u201cif you take the test and it shows you\u2019re an Indian.\u201d\n\nThe new findings support Warren\u2019s claim that she has at least one Native American ancestor, although they cannot reveal whether that individual was a member of any specific tribe. The results were not peer-reviewed, as they would be in a formal scientific publication, but four anthropological geneticists told us the methodologies were valid and the conclusions reasonable.\n\nTrump, however, interpreted the findings differently. Over a series of tweets, he called the test \u201cbogus\u201d and said the results showed Warren might have less Native American DNA than the \u201caverage American.\u201d\n\nIn campaign rallies in Montana, Arizona, Texas and, most recently, Illinois, the president has claimed to be more Native American than Warren.\n\nOn each of these points, Trump is wrong or comes to an unsubstantiated conclusion:\n\u2022 None While scientists don\u2019t think of ancestry in terms of \u201cblood\u201d \u2014 the clues are in genetic sequences, passed down to children by parents \u2014 the evidence suggests it\u2019s false to say Warren has \u201cno Indian blood.\u201d Warren\u2019s DNA test, which was analyzed under the supervision of a respected geneticist at Stanford University, demonstrates she very likely has a Native American ancestor.\n\u2022 None With the information provided and the data collected to date, there is no way to tell if Warren has more or less Native American DNA than the \u201caverage\u201d American \u2014 a dubious concept to begin with, given vast differences in ancestry across various geographical regions of the country. Notably, Warren has not claimed to be \u201cmore\u201d Native American than anyone else, just that she descended from someone with Native American ancestry.\n\u2022 None Given that by Trump\u2019s own admission he has no Native American ancestry \u2014 and the fact that all four of his grandparents were born in Europe \u2014 it is exceedingly unlikely that Trump could have more \u201cNative blood\u201d than Warren, whose DNA results indicate a clear signal for at least one Native American ancestor. His logic is faulty.\n\nBefore explaining more of the science, it\u2019s important to say, as others have done elsewhere, that DNA tests like the one Warren took have no bearing on Native American identity or tribal membership. As a result, even if Warren\u2019s test showed she had a substantial amount of Native American DNA, that would not make her \u201cNative American.\u201d Native identity is socially and culturally determined, and cannot be reduced to a DNA ancestry test.\n\nWhile lineage often matters to tribal membership, it is not established by modern genetic tests that assess overall ancestry. Some, but not all tribes, for example, use a system called \u201cblood quantum,\u201d which requires members to meet certain cutoffs, such as one-quarter or one-half, to officially join as citizens. (This system, it should be noted, began as a forced policy under the federal government, and is therefore viewed as problematic by many.) Other tribes, including the Cherokee Nation, don\u2019t have specific blood quantum requirements, but require proof of descent from an enrolled member in the historical record.\n\nFor tribes using blood quantum, these fractions do not correspond to an exact percentage of Native American DNA a person might have \u2014 thanks to a quirk of biology that we\u2019ll explain later, it\u2019s more variable than that. Instead, they use an approximate value, such as whether an individual has one fully Native parent or grandparent. Tribes might use basic DNA tests, such as paternity tests, in an effort to establish links to certain individuals, but none accepts results from the type of test Warren took.\n\nWarren has stated that she understands the difference \u201cbetween citizenship and ancestry,\u201d and that she is not claiming anything other than ancestry. But many people in indigenous communities, including the Cherokee Nation, found Warren\u2019s decision to release her DNA results offensive. We won\u2019t be wading into that debate any further. Instead, we\u2019ll stick to addressing the scientific claims surrounding Warren\u2019s test.\n\nHow the Test Was Done\n\nWe don\u2019t know all the details about how the test was done because the Stanford geneticist, Carlos Bustamante, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. But based on the released report, the general methods are similar to what would happen if you sent your DNA to a company like 23andMe or Ancestry.com.\n\nThe technique is a form of genotyping that uses something called a DNA microarray, or what is more popularly known as a DNA chip. The chips are essentially glass microscope slides covered with tiny dots of DNA, and they can reveal a person\u2019s DNA sequence at hundreds of thousands of spots across their genome. These spots, many of which are single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are useful to check because scientists already know something about them.\n\nFor one, they\u2019re known to be variable across different populations and between individuals. This is important, since humans share the vast majority of their DNA with each other. Second, the SNPs are usually selected because they tend to associate with certain health conditions, physical features or ancestries. In this way, someone can get a lot of information about their genome without having to sequence it. Sequencing is a different method that reads out the entire string of DNA letters, or bases \u2014 all of the A, T, C and Gs \u2014 in a given piece of DNA. It is much more expensive than chip-based genotyping, especially when applied to the 3 billion bases of a person\u2019s genome (or 6 billion, if covering both sets of chromosomes).\n\nAncestry information ultimately comes from comparisons of a person\u2019s tested genetic variants to those of other individuals. In Warren\u2019s case, scientists compared 660,173 spots of genetic variation to those of 148 people who had had their entire genomes sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project. The 1000 Genomes Project was a collaborative effort by scientists across the globe to better understand human genetic variation, and involved sequencing more than 2,500 genomes from 26 different populations. These genomes are handy as references genomes, which is how they were used here. Warren\u2019s comparison group was equally split between Europeans, Africans, East Asians and those with Native American ancestry. The analyst made the comparisons using a computer program called RFMix, which Bustamante\u2019s group developed and previously established as a reliable tool.\n\nTo confirm evidence of Warren\u2019s Native American ancestry, researchers also compared Warren\u2019s DNA data to two other sets of reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project: 99 people from Utah with European ancestry, and 86 people from Great Britain, also with European ancestry.\n\nAccording to the report, Warren\u2019s test results show that she is of \u201cprimarily European descent,\u201d but also that she has at least five genetic segments that are \u201cNative American in origin at high confidence.\u201d\n\nOne of these segments is larger than the others, spanning about 4.7 million bases, and further analysis indicates this DNA chunk has a genetic signature one would expect from a person having European and Native American heritage. The total length of all of Warren\u2019s Native American-assigned segments is about 12.3 million bases, which the report states is about 12.4 times greater than the average in the Great Britain reference population, and 10.5 times greater than the average in the Utah population. Bustamante concludes there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d for a Native American ancestor roughly six to 10 generations ago.\n\nAll of the anthropological geneticists we consulted felt the test was performed as well as it could have been, given the available data.\n\n\u201cCarlos Bustamante is a very respected researcher,\u201d said Jeffrey Long of the University of New Mexico in a phone interview. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen makes sense to me.\u201d (Bustamante is also an adviser to both 23andMe and Ancestry.com.)\n\nLong added that while Warren doesn\u2019t appear to have a lot of DNA from a Native American ancestor, it\u2019s \u201cprobably proof\u201d there was one, and that the six to 10 generations figure was \u201cappropriately cautious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe methods that they used are among the best that are out there today,\u201d said Deborah Bolnick of the University of Connecticut in a phone interview.\n\nShe said the test still had limitations, largely because of the lack of available Native American data sets, but that the limitations \u201cdon\u2019t influence the idea that she had an indigenous ancestor.\u201d\n\nFor example, in the analysis, the Native American samples came from people from Mexico, Peru and Colombia. Ideally, Warren\u2019s DNA would be compared to that from Native Americans living in the United States \u2014 but that data isn\u2019t publicly available.\n\nThese other samples can still be used, however, because there is enough shared ancestry. Many people living in North and South America today, Bolnick explained, still retain genetic variants that emerged in more ancestral populations, and therefore these people can serve as legitimate comparisons to determine whether an individual descended from the first people of the Americas.\n\nWhile the results are clear on the basic findings, things get murkier when people attempt to extrapolate beyond them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say more than, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s clear she has Native American ancestry,\u2019\u201d said Long.\n\nShortly after Warren\u2019s release, critics began to question whether she has more Native ancestry than other white Americans. Using the six to 10 generations figure, a Republican spokesman and an op-ed writer converted this to fractional ancestry (1/64 to 1/1024), which they then compared to a number appearing in a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. The paper, which was written by 23andMe researchers and colleagues, analyzed the genetic ancestry of more than 160,000 23andMe customers who self-identified as either African American, Latino or European American. For European Americans, the genome-wide \u201cmean estimate\u201d of Native American ancestry was 0.18 percent (given in table 1). Because this percentage is higher than the equivalent percentage for the 10 generations fraction (0.098 percent), these critics concluded Warren might have less Native American ancestry than the \u201caverage\u201d white American.\n\nTrump appears to have picked up this line of thinking, saying in an Oct. 16 tweet that the test showed that Warren \u201cmay be 1/1024, far less than the average American,\u201d and in his Oct. 18 speech in Montana that \u201cthe one good thing about her test is that there was so little she had less than the average American.\u201d\n\nThis is problematic for several reasons, the first being that the Bustamante report never specifies a fraction or percentage, so these estimates are derived from a back calculation from the six to 10 generation estimate. As others have written, this incorrectly assumes equal inheritance through time from all of your ancestors \u2014 something that simply doesn\u2019t happen. Biology is more random, and because of the way DNA is passed down, these fractions may not represent the true amount of DNA a person retains from each ancestor.\n\nIn fact, there is a surprisingly high chance that a person will receive no DNA from a relatively recent ancestor. Graham Coop, an evolutionary and populations geneticist at the University of California, Davis, for example, has estimated there\u2019s about a 13 percent chance a person will not get any genetic material from an ancestor from eight generations ago. At 10 generations, this jumps to about a 50 percent chance. This reveals a fundamental discrepancy between ancestry and genetics, since a person\u2019s ancestry can still be true, and yet they might not have any trace of it in their bodies.\n\nEven if we had a more precise estimate of the amount of Native American DNA Warren carries, it still would be inappropriate to use the 23andMe study to come to definitive conclusions about how Warren stacks up.\n\nThat\u2019s because, Bolnick explained, the 23andMe percentages were calculated using different genetic data and different statistical tools. \u201cThey\u2019re not comparable,\u201d she said.\n\nFurthermore, because the 23andMe data come from customers, the information is not necessarily representative of all of white America, as this population had the interest in and the means to pay for a genetic test. While this may be the best estimate we have, it\u2019s still not a random sample.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s way off, but we\u2019re talking about really small numbers here,\u201d cautioned Long.\n\nOthers have pointed to the Utah reference population \u2014 which had on average just a tenth of Native American DNA as Warren\u2019s sample \u2014 as a more relevant comparison. But Bolnick and Long don\u2019t think this population is representative of the entire U.S., either.\n\nSeveral of the anthropological geneticists we spoke to also found the entire concept of an \u201caverage\u201d Native American ancestry in white Americans questionable, as this ancestry fluctuates a great deal based on geography and past events.\n\nIn the end, with respect to the \u201caverage\u201d claim, Bolnick said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough data to answer whether she does or does not have more.\u201d\n\nThe most that can be concluded, then, is that Warren\u2019s test results are consistent with someone who has a small amount of Native American ancestry.", "lang": "en"}
