Headline has been updated from \u201cFact check: Biden has not publicly chosen running mate, Harris eligible\u201d to \u201cFact check: Biden chooses Harris as running mate; false claims about her eligibility.\u201d\n\nSome posts on social media claimed that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had chosen California Senator Kamala Harris as running mate for vice president prior to his public announcement on Tuesday, August 11. The posts further claim that if elected and Biden were unable to complete his term in office, Harris would be ineligible to take his post by \u201cconstitutional law,\u201d due to her family background, making House Speaker Nancy Pelosi next in line to assume the role. This claim was false prior to his VP announcement, and remains false.\n\nExamples of the claim: here and here .\n\nAs of this Check\u2019s initial publication on Aug. 10, 2020, Biden had not made his pick for a running mate. He announced Harris as his VP in the afternoon of August 11, 2020.\n\nHis search for a vice presidential candidate has drawn intense scrutiny, in part because he would be the oldest president in U.S. history at 78 on Inauguration Day. He had vowed to choose a woman as running mate.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the process that is expected to wrap up this month, contenders under final consideration included Harris, former National Security advisor Susan Rice, Representative Val Demings, Representative Karen Bass, as well as Senators Tammy Duckworth and Elizabeth Warren ( here ). Other possibilities are New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAt the time these Facebook posts began to surface, it was false that Biden has already publicly chosen Harris as his vice presidential pick.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section I, Clause 6, in case of the removal of the president from office, whether due to death, resignation, or inability to complete the term, the vice president will assume the role ( constitutionus.com/ ).\n\nOn July 18, 1947, President Harry Truman signed the Presidential Succession Act, declaring that if the vice president were also removed, the next official in line to assume the responsibilities of the presidency would be the speaker of the House, followed by the Senate president pro tempore ( here ).\n\nIt is therefore true that the speaker of the House, at present Nancy Pelosi, would succeed Biden\u2019s vice president in the case of removal.\n\nThe constitutional eligibility requirements to become vice president are the same as the eligibility requirements to become president: a person must be a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old, and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. ( bit.ly/3abexmc ).\n\nHarris fulfills all these requirements, despite the fact both of her parents were born outside of the country. ( here ; here ).\n\nIt is therefore false that Harris would be constitutionally ineligible to succeed Biden.\n\nFalse. Harris would be eligible to succeed Biden as President, were he elected and become unable to finish his term.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
