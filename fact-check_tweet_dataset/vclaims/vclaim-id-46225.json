The claim with the video is that the Kenyan government is using Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of the Kenya Government using a Maasai tribe man to impose social distancing in Kenya. Fact: The video is made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel \u2018Mbuzi Seller\u2019. It doesn\u2019t show a real-life incident. Also, there are no reports about the Kenyan government roping in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions in the wake of Coronavirus infections in the country. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe video in the post has the text \u2018Mbuzziseller\u2019 on it. So, when searched with that text, a YouTube channel with the same name was found in the results. In that channel, a longer version of the same video was found. When one goes through the video carefully, it can be found that the video was shot for \u2018Entertainment\u2019 purposes. In the description of the video, \u2018#Tanzania comedy\u2019 can be seen. When one goes through the other videos of that YouTube channel, the man can be seen in the same attire as in the video posted.\n\n\n\nAlso, when searched if the Kenyan government roped in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions, no reports were found. When the video went viral, a news website \u2018kenyans.co.ke\u2019 has debunked the claim, which can be seen here.\n\nTo conclude, a video made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel is being shared as \u2018Kenyan government using Maasai tribe men for carrying out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
