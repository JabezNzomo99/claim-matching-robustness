Supplies we need now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true the State Department was involved in delivering to China tons of personal protective equipment donated by American companies and organizations in early February. The State Department even lauded the donations as \u201ca testament to the generosity of the American people,\u201d and said they were an example of \u201cstrong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the medical supplies were not \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cours\u201d in the sense that they belonged to the federal government, which the ad\u2019s language may lead viewers to believe. The equipment was donated by those companies and organizations specifically for use by health care workers in China.\n\nThe 30-second commercial, titled \u201cTrust,\u201d started running this week in select media markets in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The super PAC said it\u2019s \u201cthe first wave of a $15 million campaign\u201d to counter TV spots airing from a pro-Trump group, America First Action.\n\nSo far, the ad has run in those three states \u2014 which Trump won by only about 80,000 votes combined \u2014 at a cost of nearly $190,000, according to Advertising Analytics.\n\nThe ad starts by highlighting complimentary remarks Trump made about China, which reporting shows was slow to report the outbreak of the new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan near the end of 2019. (We previously wrote about some of Trump\u2019s comments praising Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s response to what has now become a global pandemic.)\n\nThe ad\u2019s narrator then goes on to say: \u201cTrump gave China more than praise. He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies \u2014 our masks and supplies. Supplies we need now. Trump trusted China, sent China our supplies, and just look at the mess we\u2019re in now.\u201d\n\nActually, the supplies were donated by U.S.-based organizations and businesses in a humanitarian gesture at a time when nearly all of the reported cases of and deaths from the novel coronavirus were in China.\n\nOn Feb. 7, the director-general of the World Health Organization declared that there was a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, and that \u201c[f]rontline health workers in China require the bulk of PPE supplies.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the State Department had \u201cfacilitated the transportation\u201d of almost 18 tons of \u201cdonated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\u201d The donations were loaded onto State Department-chartered planes that were already headed to China that week to bring back hundreds of U.S. citizens stranded in the country.\n\nAbout a week later, the department provided a little more information about the delivery it helped coordinate with Project HOPE, an international health training and humanitarian organization that has worked in Wuhan since the 1990s.\n\nA spokeswoman for Project HOPE confirmed to FactCheck.org that the group received the donations.\n\n\u201cThe only supplies received by Project HOPE in China that were transported on State Department-chartered flights were the nearly 17.8 tons donated by American relief organizations and businesses to help China\u2019s doctors and nurses contain the COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d Rebecca Gustafson, senior director of global media relations at Project HOPE, said in an email.\n\nBoeing had already announced on Jan. 29 that it was preparing to donate \u201c250,000 medical-grade respiratory masks to address medical supply shortages in China.\u201d A spokesperson for the aviation giant told us in an email that the company\u2019s donation was included as part of the shipment for Project HOPE in China.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also announced on Jan. 29 that it was partnering with the humanitarian group and donating to China 220,000 respirator masks, 870 pairs of protective goggles and over 6,500 pairs of protective coveralls. The article on its website said the church\u2019s president decided to make the donation after inquiring and learning from \u201clongtime friends in China\u201d of a need for \u201cprotective equipment at the Shanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center, where supplies have been depleted because of the outbreak in Wuhan.\u201d\n\nIn an update to that article days later, the church said the supplies were delivered to China on Feb. 4 \u2014 the same day the planes chartered by the State Department arrived in China.\n\nAnd a spokeswoman for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an evangelical Christian disaster relief organization, told us it \u201cdonated 78 pallets of medical supplies and personal protective equipment to Hubei, China\u201d for coronavirus assistance. \u201cThe State Department facilitated the delivery of these items,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nOn the day all of the contributions were delivered, the WHO reported that there were more than 20,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and more than 400 deaths there due to the disease. At the same time, there were 11 confirmed cases in the U.S, and the first reported death from the illness in the U.S. didn\u2019t come until Feb. 29, more than three weeks later.\n\nThe super PAC told us its ad was simply stating the facts about the shipment.\n\n\u201cAs the Washington Post\u2019s own reporting and multiple fact-checking organizations have already verified, the president\u2019s own state department, as they said themselves, shipped 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies to China in February under the president\u2019s own direction,\u201d said Jeb Fain, spokesman for American Bridge. \u201cThose are the facts and they\u2019re not up for debate. This president doesn\u2019t get to avoid accountability now that he finds it politically inconvenient.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not for us to say whether the federal government should have been involved in delivering the much-needed materials to China when the U.S. would later experience a coronavirus-related PPE shortage of its own.\n\nBut readers should know that when the American Bridge ad says Trump sent \u201cour masks and supplies\u201d to China, it\u2019s a reference to equipment American companies and businesses donated specifically to help health officials in China. The PPE did not come from the government\u2019s own reserves nor was it assigned for use in the U.S.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Swing State Watch is an occasional series about false and misleading political messages in key states that will help decide the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
