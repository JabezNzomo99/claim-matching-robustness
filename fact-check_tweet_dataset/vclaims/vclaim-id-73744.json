Those remarks (in full) read as follows:\n\nMy father taught me the simple notion that everyone, everywhere is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. When it comes to LGBT people, that simple proposition has been painfully difficult to accomplish over the years. But in the last decade, thanks to the astounding bravery of the LGBT community and those who have championed their cause, the United States has made remarkable progress toward the ultimate goal of equality in law and in life. Our progress remains incomplete, but the momentum has shifted in the right direction. Progress has also been made in many places around the world. But in too many places, life for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals is actually getting worse. In too many places, LGBT community members face violence with impunity, mistreatment by police, the denial of healthcare, or religious condemnation and social isolation. The best mechanism to confront this hatred is to speak up in favor of universal human rights. Supportive voices must be heard. Today and every day, let us continue to defend the rights of LGBT people, whether from nearby cities or far-off villages. We cannot rest until everyone receives the dignity, respect, and equal treatment under the law that all people deserve.\n\nA few days later, Geoffrey Grider, the \u201cauthor and editor-in-chief\u201d of the Now The End Begins (NTEB) website (self-described as delivering \u201caggregate breaking news of the day from a biblical perspective\u201d; categorized elsewhere as a \u201cfar-right Christian conspiracy website\u201d) published an article under the headline \u201cJoe Biden Says Bible Believing Christians Violate LGBTQ Rights by Simply Existing.\u201d In the piece he asserted that, \u201cAccording to Joe Biden, the American Bible believing Christian who takes the Bible literally, is violating the \u2018rights\u2019 of the LGBT by trusting in God\u2019s word\u201d:\n\nBut the NTEB headline claim was not a remotely accurate or reasonable summary of what Biden actually said.\n\nThe vice president merely noted that LGBTQ community members face the challenge (among many others) of \u201creligious condemnation\u201d; he did not single out Christianity or \u201cAmerican Bible believing Christians\u201d as the sole source of that condemnation. Nor could Biden\u2019s words fairly be said to apply to all Christians, as interpretations of biblical passages that supposedly reference homosexuality, as well as official church positions on the issue of homosexuality, vary widely across different Christian denominations.", "lang": "en"}
