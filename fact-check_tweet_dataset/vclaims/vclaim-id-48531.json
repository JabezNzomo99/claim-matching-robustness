Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named Jay Legg reads: \u201cDrinking my miracle mineral solution. It has cured my autism, parasites and depression. You should too.\u201d The text is accompanied by a Wikipedia link of the miracle mineral solution. The photo uploaded in the post is that of a bleaching solution.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by clicking on the Wikipedia link available with the caption of the post. On clicking the link, we were redirected to a Wikipedia page of Miracle Mineral Supplement. The text on the page reads: \u201cMiracle Mineral Supplement, often referred to as Miracle Mineral Solution, Master Mineral Solution, MMS or the CD protocol, is chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach. It is made by mixing sodium chlorite solution with an acid (such as the juices of citrus fruits).\u201d\n\nIt further read that: \u201cMMS is falsely promoted as a cure for HIV, malaria, hepatitis viruses, the H1N1 flu virus, common colds, autism, acne, cancer, and much more.\u201d\n\nThis means that the Wikipedia page Miracle Mineral Supplement itself says that it is falsely promoted to cure various diseases.\n\nVishvas News further investigated and found an article on the official website of U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The article\u2019s headline read: Danger: Don\u2019t Drink Miracle Mineral Solution or Similar Products. The article further read: \u201cThe FDA warns you not to drink sodium chlorite products such as Miracle Mineral Solution. These products can make you sick.\u201d\n\nFDA warms people not to fall prey on the posts asking to consume miracle mineral supplements as it can cause various health problems. The article states: \u201cIf you\u2019re drinking \u201cMiracle\u201d or \u201cMaster\u201d Mineral Solution or other sodium chlorite products, stop now. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received many reports that these products, sold online as \u201ctreatments,\u201d have made consumers sick.\u201d\n\nMany other websites also published that miracle mineral supplement will not cure diseases. For example, a website named Vice published an article the screenshot of which is given below:\n\nThe image shown in the Facebook post is that of Clorox, which is a bleach. It is used as a disinfectant for cleaning purposes.\n\nVishvas News contacted Dr B.S. Arora who is a physiatrist. He said: \u201cThe claim stating that drinking miracle mineral solution can cure autism, parasites and depression is completely fake. In fact, this can cause serious problems if consumed.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that a miracle mineral solution can cure diseases is fake.", "lang": "en"}
