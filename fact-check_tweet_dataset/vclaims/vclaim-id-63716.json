In 2018, more than 31 million Americans voted by mail, representing one-quarter of election participants. Five states \u2014 Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington \u2014 use mail ballots as the primary method of voting.\n\nWendy R. Weiser, an election expert and vice president at the Brennan Center, previously told us that \u201cthe bigger problem is not forging signatures, but ballots being cast and not counted because the signature doesn't match.\u201d She cited \u201csignificant racial disparities\u201d in rejecting ballots based on signature matches, with African Americans and other minorities more likely to have their votes discounted.\n\nA bill spearheaded by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act, would make a series of changes to ease voting options during the coronavirus pandemic. Among those changes, Democrats are proposing that all states allow voters the opportunity to verify any ballot signatures deemed to be a mismatch.\n\n\u201cNotice of a discrepancy must be provided to voters by at least two methods including: regular mail, phone, electronic mail, and text message,\u201d according to a bill summary from Democrats. \u201cA voter has until the day before certification of election results to provide confirmation that the signature in question is their genuine signature. The confirmation can be provided through any of the notice methods. A final determination shall be made by three election officials, at least one of whom is of an opposing party, taking into account information provided by the voters, through a unanimous vote if a ballot is valid. Only through a unanimous vote that a ballot is not valid shall a vote not be counted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is wrong,\u201d Elias said of Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cWe have sued several states \u2014 from Georgia (who settled), to Florida (where we won), to Michigan (where they changed their practice). We are also suing Nevada and Arizona (over missing signatures) currently. In each and every case, we seek the same thing \u2014 uniform standards and training on signature matching, and an opportunity for voters to be notified and an opportunity to cure.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, Elias won a court ruling in 2018 that \u201cextends the deadline to cure vote-by-mail and provisional ballots to two days after the election; requires the secretary of state to provide signature matching training to supervisors of elections and canvassing boards; and requires any signature mismatch determinations to be made by a majority of the canvassing board, subject to a \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard.\u201d The state legislature and governor later enacted a bill that instituted a process to remedy signature issues. Not a ban.\n\nElias\u2019s group had alleged that Nevada\u2019s previous signature verification rules were so strict and arbitrarily applied they violated the constitutional right to vote. He asked a court to enjoin the state from enforcing those particular rules, not to ban any and all signature verification. When the state legislature acted in response to the lawsuit, Elias withdrew the case and stated in a court filing that it was in part because the new signature verification rules \u201cprovide clearer standards and more meaningful cure opportunities for Nevada voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen verifying signatures, evaluators should keep in mind that everyone writes differently, and no one signs their name exactly the same way twice,\u201d according to part of the guidance a federal judge approved for New Jersey election officials this year. \u201cSome variation in signatures is to be expected. There are many factors that can lead to signature variance, including but not limited to age, disability, underlying health conditions, writing implement/surface, level of concentration, and educational background. Studies have shown that evaluators are more likely to declare genuine signatures to be non-genuine than they are to accept a non-genuine signature as genuine.\u201d\n\nTo verify a ballot with a signature deemed deficient, New Jersey voters under this court ruling must return a \u201ccure form\u201d provided by the state and include a driver\u2019s license number or nondriving ID number from the state, the last four digits of a Social Security number, or \u201ca legible copy of a state-accepted form of identification, which shall include a sample ballot which lists the voter\u2019s name and address; an official federal, State, county or municipal document which lists the voter\u2019s name and address; or a utility or telephone bill or tax or rent receipt.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
