Chicago\u2019s next mayor will enter office as the city prepares to implement a federal consent decree that aims to overhaul how the department operates.\n\nShe also headed the Chicago Police Board, the department\u2019s civilian oversight body charged with disciplining police officers, but stepped down from that post last spring to enter the mayor\u2019s race.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Lightfoot stressed her reform credentials by pointing to data she said showed the police board under her watch was increasingly aggressive in getting rid of cops accused of misconduct.\n\n\"In hearings between 2011 and July 2015, the board fired 37% of officers\" read a graphic included in her tweet. It continued: \"Lori was president of the police board between July 2015 and April 2018. In hearings during that time period, the Police Board fired 72% of officers.\"\n\nThe graphic also highlighted a related disciplinary statistic: \"15% of officers (with pending disciplinary cases) chose to resign from CPD rather than face the board\" in the years before Lightfoot\u2019s tenure. \"When Lori was president, the number of officers who chose to resign rather than face the board doubled, from 15% to 30%.\"\n\nSuch sharp increases in the share of discharges and resignations sounded like the result of a pretty significant leap in officer discipline, so we decided to check it out.\n\nWhen we reached out to Lightfoot\u2019s campaign, a spokeswoman sent us disciplinary data summaries it got from the Chicago Police Board that back up Lightfoot\u2019s comparison of discharge case results before she headed the the police board and those from during her tenure.\n\nThe summaries make clear that Lightfoot is referencing two separate but related sets of numbers. The 72 percent figure refers to the share of officers whose cases went to a hearing and who were discharged after the board found them guilty of misconduct. The 30 percent figure deals with the share of all discharge cases referred to the board that ended in a resignation before a hearing took place.\n\nThe board documents also back up Lightfoot\u2019s claims about firings and resignations in the four plus years prior to her taking over the board.\n\nBut there\u2019s another way to look at the data Lightfoot culled her numbers from that takes some of the edge off her claim of increased disciplinary rigor. The board\u2019s total caseload is so small that adding or subtracting even a handful of the cases it hears can significantly alter the disciplinary scorecard if expressed in percentage terms.\n\nLightfoot served as president of the disciplinary board for less than three years, and during that time a total of 47 discharge cases were either heard by the panel or resolved before a hearing was held. In the comparable time period before Lightfoot took over, the board dealt with 63 discharge cases.\n\nThe hard count of officers fired increased incrementally from 19 during the comparable period before Lightfoot to 21 during her time as president. In percentage terms, however, that translated into a big jump because the board heard fewer cases than in the past.\n\nTo be clear, the lower number of cases that reached the board during Lightfoot\u2019s time was beyond her control. After allegations of officer misconduct have been made and vetted by one of several investigative bodies, it\u2019s up to the police department\u2019s superintendent to recommend cases to the board. But the fact that these variables play such a large role in the percentage increase Lightfoot touted suggests it\u2019s less a yardstick of her effectiveness as a disciplinarian and more of a math problem.\n\nSamuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and an expert on police accountability, told us so many factors affect police discipline data that it\u2019s problematic to focus on any one when evaluating the performance of a department or those who oversee it.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s tweet said that under her watch, the percentage of police board hearings that resulted in an officer being fired increased from 37 percent to 72 percent and that the share of discharge cases that ended because the cops involved decided to resign rather than face the board doubled from 15 percent to 30 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that the total number of discharge cases the board reviews is so small that just a minor increase in officer firings by the board translated into a huge increase in the share of cases that ended in dismissals.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s claim itself is accurate, but it doesn\u2019t do much to reinforce the self-portrait she is drawing on the campaign trail of a reformer who improved police accountability.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2014 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
