But here are two repeated claims that we have not had the opportunity to unravel previously. We will deal with them quickly in this roundup, so we won\u2019t be awarding Pinocchios.\n\nOn its face, calling the cupboard empty might seem like a strange assertion because Trump has been president for three years, so he bears some responsibility for what was in the stockpile and whether it was appropriate for a pandemic. \u201cThe stockpile has grown and evolved to a greater than $8 billion enterprise,\u201d wrote Greg Burel, the director at the time, in November 2019.\n\nA senior administration official suggested that Trump was specifically talking about the stockpile\u2019s inventory of N95 masks \u2014 fitted face masks that block most airborne particles. \u201cThe national stockpile was depleted of three-quarters of its N95 inventory during the H1N1 outbreak [in 2009], but the Obama administration failed to build it back,\u201d he said. The Washington Post reported that more than 85 million of those masks were distributed back in 2009, during the swine flu outbreak, but they were not replaced, despite warnings from industry officials in 2009 and 2010.\n\nBut the now-retired Burel, in an interview with Vice News, said officials faced \u201chorrible\u201d choices given the limited money ($650 million a year) received from Congress: \u201cWe had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time. I definitely want to see my healthcare workers protected; that\u2019s very important. But if I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can\u2019t get elsewhere?\u2019 there\u2019s no easy answer here.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the shelf life of N95 masks is generally five years, so in theory, any masks purchased in 2009 would have needed to be replaced. (Some 5 million masks in the stockpile were expired; 12 million were not.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said some masks in the stockpile dated to 2003, but in a study of 11 models, it found that most still appeared to work effectively.\n\nIn sum, Trump might have a point about Obama not replacing the masks, but his language is still misleading. He bears responsibility for choices made in the direction of the stockpile under his watch, including not prioritizing preparation for a pandemic. He cannot so sweepingly declare that an $8 billion stockpile was \u201cempty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt [AIDS] was a death certificate. And then, all of a sudden, they came up with some kind of \u2014 and now we have \u2014 we will be AIDS-free within eight years. We started 10 years. Should have started in the previous administration. They did nothing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Obama spent about $3.5 billion a year on research and prevention, according to an accounting by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is about the same as Trump\u2019s numbers in his first years as president. (Of course, the money that was spent had to be approved by Congress.) Obama also had a plan, first issued in 2010 and then again in 2015, called the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States. The 2015 version called for reducing the number of new diagnoses by 25 percent by 2020.\n\nTrump, in 2019, called for an even bolder goal, backed by increased funding \u2014 reducing new HIV infections in the United States by 75 percent within five years and by at least 90 percent within 10 years. The administration official said Trump\u2019s plan was \u201cfar more aggressive\u201d than the previous administration\u2019s 25 percent goal. \u201cThe president has been clear that this sort of bold, aggressive undertaking should have been launched long ago,\u201d he said.\n\nOkay. But that\u2019s not the same thing as doing nothing. (Sometimes, Trump has even claimed that Obama \u201cspent no money\u201d on AIDS or that Obama \u201cchose not to\u201d end the AIDS epidemic.) It\u2019s not clear whether Trump\u2019s goal is even attainable, and in any case his strategy clearly builds on Obama\u2019s earlier efforts. So, it\u2019s false to say Obama did nothing.", "lang": "en"}
