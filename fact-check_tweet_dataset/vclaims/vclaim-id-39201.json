Another Daily Express article about the new coronavirus, published on 11 March, repeated the claim that the study \u201csuggested Covid-19 has been tampered with\u201d.\n\nThis is incorrect. A new study has not claimed that the virus that causes Covid-19 may have been genetically engineered to spread more efficiently among humans. The Daily Express was wrong to report to this, and a number of virology experts have heavily criticised its claim.\n\nSince this article was first published we approached the Daily Express, asking them to correct the article. They have since edited the piece and added a correction note.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t suggest the new coronavirus was deliberately tampered with\n\nGenetic engineering refers to the deliberate alteration of the genetic makeup of an organism by humans.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Antiviral Research, compared the make-up of the new coronavirus with that of other existing coronaviruses, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\n\nIt suggested that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) may be more efficient at spreading between humans because of a difference in its DNA. The Daily Express incorrectly reported that the study \u201csuggests that this part of the DNA chain has been tampered with\u201d to increase the efficiency of infection among humans. This suggestion is not made anywhere in the study.\n\nThe study did find that SARS-CoV-2\u2014referred to by its former name 2019-nCoV in the report\u2014has a similar genome sequence to other coronaviruses. However, it also has a noticeable difference in the form of a \u201cpeculiar furin-like cleavage site\u201d which has not been seen in other coronaviruses.\n\nFurin is a protein found in humans and animals which can be exploited by viruses like coronavirus, HIV and Ebola to help them spread by activating the proteins which hold the virus, and are contained in \u201ccleavage sites\u201d.\n\nThe study said the \u201cfurin-like cleavage site\u201d in SARS-CoV-2 \u201cmay provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCov for efficient spreading in the human population\u201d compared to other coronaviruses.\n\nIn simple terms, this means that the presence of this site in the virus could be the reason why it is infecting so many people. However, the study makes absolutely no suggestion that the virus has been \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d to cause this.\n\nExperts have criticised the findings from the Express\n\nWe spoke to the Science Media Centre who asked experts what they made of the paper\u2019s claim.\n\nProfessor Ben Neuman, chair of biological sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana and visiting associate professor at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThe Daily Express\u2019s take is not based on science and appears to be rather inflammatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the furin-like cleavage site tells us is that this virus probably comes from another animal with a furin-like enzyme in its lungs, which includes pretty much any mammal or bird that you could name.\n\n\u201cThe paper makes no such claim about tampering\u2014it is referring to the process of evolution in general.\u201d\n\nProfessor Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said there is \u201cconvergent evolution\u201d present in SARS-Cov-2 but \u201cby genetic engineering design there\u2019s just no way scientists would have known how to achieve this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [Express] article has not really gone into the science in a way that can give the balanced argument,\u201d she said, adding that most data so far \u201cstrongly support the idea that the novel coronavirus emerged through natural recombination and evolution of coronaviruses of bats.\u201d\n\nDr Michael Skinner, reader in virology at Imperial College London, said experts \u201crecognise this kind of mutation as common in the natural evolution of viruses\u201d, particularly those like coronaviruses.", "lang": "en"}
