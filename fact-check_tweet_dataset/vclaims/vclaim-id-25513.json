However, Germany\u2019s foreign ministry told AFP that Maas has written no such letter.\n\nFormer senate deputy president Ekweremadu, who still represents Enugu state, was assaulted over the weekend by activists claiming to be from the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group as he attended a conference in southern Germany.\n\nMen reportedly from the group, which seeks the secession of southeast Nigeria, were seen beating up the politician and tearing his clothes in numerous viral videos filmed at the scene. Ekweremadu returned to Nigeria less than 48 hours later.\n\nIn it the letter attributed to Maas, the German foreign minister supposedly dismisses a Nigerian government request to prosecute those responsible and instead demands the authorities in the West African nation go after those behind \u201catrocities\u201d at home.\n\nOne such post, archived here and shared nearly 5,000 times, is captioned: \u201cBREAKING: EKWEREMMADU'S ATTACK BY IPOB, GERMAN GOVERNMENT REPLIES, BLAST NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT.\u201d\n\nThe text cites Maas as saying: \u201cI find it extremely provocative and unusually undiplomatic when a government that has created the conditions that exiled its citizens demands the same people's prosecution by the host country for demanding justice and justice from its government officials.\u201d\n\nIt continues: \u201cThe German Government will respond to your request to prosecute the demonstrators who have requested their representative to do his work in Nigeria as soon as you have your Fulani terrorists detained.\u201d\n\nSimilar posts, in some cases accompanied by a German translation, have been shared by blogs, elsewhere on Facebook, and in multiple groups on WhatsApp in Nigeria. We\u2019ve archived a couple of others here and here.\n\nNigerian media have reported that officials from the country are pressing German authorities to prosecute those who carried out the alleged attack on Ekweremadu.\n\nAFP reached out to the foreign ministry in Germany to ask if the supposed letter from Maas to Buhari was genuine, and we were told that it was not real.\n\n\"This letter does not come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor from Minister Maas,\u201d the ministry in Berlin said.", "lang": "en"}
