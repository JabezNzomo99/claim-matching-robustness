John Kitzhaber\u2019s claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up.\n\n \n\n In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that \"$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.\"\n\n \n\n The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University System\u2019s vice chancellor for finance and administration.\n\n \n\n Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation.\n\n \n\n Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars.\n\n \n\n After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual student\u2019s annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. That\u2019s actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too.\n\n \n\n So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, that\u2019s where Kenton\u2019s projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhaber\u2019s proposed reforms not be enacted.\n\n \n\n With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardson\u2019s statement. He said that \"$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.\"\n\n \n\n He\u2019s right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we haven\u2019t yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. It\u2019s still high, to be sure, but it\u2019s about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using.\n\n \n\n The ruling: Richardson\u2019s statement reads as if we\u2019ve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we haven\u2019t actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there.\n\n \n\n If we were writing a newsletter, we\u2019d have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither.\n\n \n\n Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
