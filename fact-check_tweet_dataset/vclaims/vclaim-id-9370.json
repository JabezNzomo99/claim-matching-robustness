I will admit that I am pretty \u2014 in my office, in talking to people that I am associated with, I am loose with my tongue on occasion, and I may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to that. I do not believe I have ever specifically \u2014 it would be inconceivable that I ever specifically referred to the NAACP as an un-American or commie organization, even kidding. I mean, I may have referred to my church, the Methodist Church, as probably a bunch of pinkos, maybe. But that is an awful thing to say, and it is not true.\u201d To Figures: \u201cYou ought to be careful as to what you say to white folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not correct, Mr. Chairman. I was in the office with Mr. Figures and we were chatting and a secretary came in. Some passing comments were made and Mr. Figures made a cutting comment to her. I thought that his comment was in bad taste. Mr. Figures \u2014 and he and I talked to this and he has told me this himself. He said, you know, one of the things I get in trouble about is I will make a joke and people take it seriously, and we had discussed that before. And I told him at that time, I said, you ought to watch what you say to folks; that hurt her feelings. And that is the way that went down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that that statement has been made [by Hebert], and I recall a conversation in which that was mentioned and I may have \u2014 I believe the statement was I had said, \u2018Maybe he is,\u2019 and that is really disturbing to me. I suppose \u2014 I do not know why I would have said that, and I certainly do not believe that. The lawyer in question is one of the finest lawyers in the country. I have defended him. I have heard people say he has gotten some fees, hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollar fees, or maybe even nearly $1 million in one, for prolonged litigation that he and his firm had been involved in, and they have won and they get this money. And I have defended him. I said he was representing those cases at a time when he did not get paid anything. And he is a fine \u2014 one of the best lawyers in the country, and it really pains me to think that people would \u2014 that I would be quoted as saying that, and I do not know how I could have said it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see, I simply did not make some of the statements that had been attributed to me, and the others were greatly distorted, tending to create a caricature of me. It is this caricature that you are asked to reject, not the Jeff Sessions that is sitting before you today. I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create. I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks. I supported civil rights activity in my state. I have done my job with integrity, equality, and fairness for all. I have served well as U.S. attorney. I am proud of that record, and I ask that you will consider that\n\n when you are making your evaluation. \u2026 Well, you say, Mr. Sessions, you have answered those questions, assuming you have. What do you say about these racially insensitive statements? Let me speak frankly. All of us know that when the confidence of a private conversation is breached by a party with ulterior motives or one who simply misunderstands what the speaker says or means, the speaker can always be embarrassed. I enjoy repartee and frequently engage in devil\u2019s advocacy. In short, when I talk to friends, I do not guard every word that I say because I think that I know they know that my commitment to equality and justice is real, and they would not twist my words or misinterpret what I am saying to them.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
