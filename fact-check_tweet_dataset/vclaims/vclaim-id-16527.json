If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Stalin ever saying or writing this.\n\nThis quote has floated around the internet for years. Former presidential candidate Ben Carson even attributed a similar expression to Stalin in 2016 and was quickly fact-checked for it.\n\nThe meme suggests that so long as Americans remain patriotic and upstanding, the country will persevere. There is, however, no evidence of Stalin ever saying the statement attributed to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound very Stalinist,\u201d Robert Gellately, a history professor at Florida State University who has written about Stalin, told The Daily Caller in an email. A search of his collected works returned no such quotation.\n\nThe meme may have gained new currency in the last couple years, with reports that Russian actors used social media to sow division among Americans ahead of, and after, the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2013 touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,\u201d Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, told The Guardian in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
