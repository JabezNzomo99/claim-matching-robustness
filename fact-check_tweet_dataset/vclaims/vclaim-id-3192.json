It\u2019s just as wrong now as it was then.\n\nThe original story that accompanied the headline includes a mixture of claims that are true, such as the fact that Spencer had proposed the bill, and claims that are not true, such as \u201cIslam is not a religion.\u201d\n\nIslam is the second largest religion in the world behind Christianity, and both share their roots with Judaism. Those three major religions are known as the Abrahamic religions since they all recognize Abraham as their first prophet.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nOfficial Code of Georgia. \u201c\u00a7 16-11-38.
