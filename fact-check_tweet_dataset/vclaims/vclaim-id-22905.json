So thoughtful, you know. We\u2019ve had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the president has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that the queen made such a statement. She rarely gives interviews or speaks publicly about politics.\n\nThis post appeared in response to Trump\u2019s state visit to the U.K., where he met with British leaders, including the royal family.\n\nWe traced the quote back to The Clover Chronicle, a site that shares conspiratorial news stories. \u201cA staffer at an unnamed MSM news outlet in the United Kingdom is claiming they were recently involved in an interview with Queen Elizabeth II where she unexpectedly complimented U.S. President Donald Trump,\u201d it wrote June 4. \u201cThe alleged insider said executives at the organization are \u2018fuming\u2019 because they couldn\u2019t salvage the piece due to her relentless praise of the POTUS.\u201d\n\nThe claim also appears on 4 Chan, posted anonymously.\n\nThe quote is immediately dubious because the queen rarely gives interviews. The BBC managed to secure a January 2018 documentary with the queen, which one of the producers says took more than two decades to arrange. Described as a \u201cconversation,\u201d the interviewer wasn\u2019t allowed to ask any direct questions.\n\nFurthermore, the queen is historically apolitical in public. She remained silent about Brexit, for example, except for what many interpreted as vague allusions when asking for Britons to find \u201ccommon ground.\u201d It is therefore unlikely that the queen would have spoken about Trump in a positive, or negative, light.\n\n\u201cAs Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to vote or stand for election,\u201d the royal family\u2019s website reads.\n\nNo news staffers have come forward about a scrapped interview with the queen, nor have any major news outlet reported on the quote. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace told Snopes that no such interview took place.\n\nWhen describing his recent visit with the queen, Trump said, \u201cI think I can say I really got to know her because I sat with her many times, and we had automatic chemistry, you understand that feeling, it\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
