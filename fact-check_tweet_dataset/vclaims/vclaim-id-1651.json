The report concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\nVOA\u2019s January 6 report was headlined, \"Moscow responds with complete silence to U.S. intelligence publication.\"\n\nIn the article, VOA reporter Galperovich noted that two days had passed without any comment by Russian officials, who typically react quickly to U.S. accusations against Moscow.\n\nHe reported that at the time, there had been no statements by the Kremlin, the Russian foreign ministry, Russian parliamentary committees dealing with foreign affairs or the Russian military.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did respond to the U.S. intelligence report three days after the VOA article on January 9 and rejected the U.S. intelligence findings as \"tiresome.\"\n\nVOA's Russian Service reported on the Peskov remarks that same day.\n\n\u201cVOA did publish Russia\u2019s response on the same day it was issued,\u201d Amanda Bennett, director of Voice of America, said in a statement.\n\nGalperovich, who is based in Moscow, expressed dismay at the Russian foreign minister\u2019s handling of the matter.\n\n\u201cLavrov\u2019 s comments make it appear that VOA is deliberately spreading false information,\u201d he said.\n\nLavrov made his comments about VOA\u2019s reporting by reading from a prepared text in response to a question from Russian state-run TV network RT. Galperovich said it was not clear why Lavrov incorrectly stated the date of his January 6 report as being January 9.\n\n\u201cIt was completely unprofessional of the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s media department to prepare such information for him,\u201d he told VOA.\n\nLavrov too was incorrect when he referred to VOA\u2019s funding source as being the U.S. State Department.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, VOA is funded by the U.S. Congress, not the State Department as Lavrov says,\u201d VOA director Bennett said.", "lang": "en"}
