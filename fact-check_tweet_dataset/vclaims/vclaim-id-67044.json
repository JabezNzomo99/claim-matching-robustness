We reverse searched the image on Google and found that they were featured in \u2018Bartaman\u2019, a local Bengali newspaper article dated October 19, 2019.\n\nWe later found another article by Dhaka18 which mentioned the student\u2019s name, Sangeet Roy, claiming that his pictures had gone viral. Hence, we tracked Sangeet\u2019s Facebook profile and confirmed that he is a resident of Malda and the exact posting date of these images, i.e October 2019.\n\nHence it can be concluded that these claims are false and the original images belong to West Bengal.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
