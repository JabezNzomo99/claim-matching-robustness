This claim is false; the image in the post has been doctored from a photo taken in 2015 which shows the lawmaker holding a message opposing an education law.\n\nThe doctored photo has been shared more than 100 times after it was posted here on Facebook on May 22, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Tagalog language text translates to English as: \u201cThank you Sarah Elago for supporting ROTC! Hopefully, under the leadership of KABATAAN PARTYLIST, your support to the Government will continue\u201d.\n\nThe woman shown on the far right of the photo is Sarah Elago of the Kabataan Partylist group, a sectoral political party for Philippine youth. She became the youngest member of the Philippines\u2019 legislature at 26 years old in 2016, according to this post on an official Facebook page for the Kabataan Partylist.\n\nHere is her official profile on the legislature website.\n\n\u201cROTC\u201d refers to \u201cReserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps\u201d, or military training for students.

Here is the Congress bill published on the website for the House of Representatives.\n\nThe claim in the misleading Facebook post is false; the image in the post has been doctored from a photo taken in 2015, which shows Elago holding a message opposing an education law.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found an earlier version of the image in the misleading Facebook post published in this May 20, 2015 article for Philippine news site Pinoy Weekly.\n\nIn the Pinoy Weekly photo, Elago is pictured holding a sign which states: \u201cJUNK Education Act of 1982!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the doctored photo (L) and the photo published by Pinoy Weekly (R):\n\nThe Pinoy Weekly article describes protests conducted by youth groups against a tuition hike approved by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).\n\nThe headline translates to English as: \u201cCHED approval on higher tuition condemned by youth\u201d.\n\nThe 2015 photo was taken by Darius Galang, the author of the article.\n\n\u201cYes, I took that photo,\u201d he told AFP via Facebook messenger on May 24, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
