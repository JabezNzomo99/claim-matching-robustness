See here, here and here, for instance.\n\nThe above quoted segment of the president\u2019s statement contains three contentious claims, specifically:\n\u2022 That Africa or Africans are free;\n\u2022 That African countries are democratic; and\n\u2022 That Africa is without civil wars and unrest.\n\nNamibia Fact Check has assessed the accuracy of these claims.\n\nWhile it is certainly true that Africa is free from external (as in Western) imperialism and colonialism, it certainly isn\u2019t the case that all Africans are free from foreign domination, as the Western Sahara case exemplifies.\n\nWestern Sahara is a disputed territory that is claimed and governed by Morocco. However, Namibia and other African states have expressed support for Western Sahara to gain independence from Morocco. In fact, in March 2019 Namibia was a co-host, along with South Africa, of a Solidarity Conference with the Saharawi people, which called for the end of Moroccan colonial rule of the territory.\n\nAs for the general state of political freedom \u2013 exercising political rights and civil liberties \u2013 on the continent, according to Freedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World 2020 Index:\n\u2022 22 countries are scored as not free;\n\u2022 24 countries are scored as partly free; and\n\u2022 Only 7 countries are considered free (Namibia is one).\n\nBased on all this, Namibia Fact Check rates the Geingob claim that Africa is free as mostly false.\n\nAs for the state of democracy on the continent, according to the influential Democracy Index 2019 of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU):\n\u2022 15 countries are classified as hybrid regimes; and\n\nThe Democracy Index scores countries on electoral processes and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture and civil liberties. The latest Democracy Index only rated 44 African countries.\n\nUsing the Democracy Index as a guide, Namibia Fact Check rates the Geingob claim that Africa is democratic as mostly false.\n\nAfrica is without civil wars and unrest\n\nThe basic fact is that, in 57 years Africa has not been free of war and violent unrest.\n\nIn 2013, African leaders made a pledge of silencing the guns by 2020, but in August 2019 the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), a paper titled \u2018Reality check: Africa\u2019s bid to silence the guns\u2018, wrote:\n\n\u201cAfter just six years of the whole initiative and barely three of the roadmap, it\u2019s no surprise that Africa remains far from silencing all or even most of the guns. Some successes in peace efforts have been registered, such as the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace accord, the Sudan peace deal, the revitalised South Sudan peace deal, the mediations in Madagascar and Central African Republic \u2013 although many remain tentative.\u201d\n\nAnd as Namibia Fact Check stated in a post on Africa Day 2020:\n\nIn another August 2019 paper on \u2018Silencing the guns beyond 2020\u2018, the ISS stated of the current war and unrest situation:\n\nBased on this, Namibia Fact Check rates the Geingob claim that Africa is without war and unrest as mostly false.\n\nIn the final analyses, when considering all the evidence, Namibia Fact Check concludes that president Geingob\u2019s claim that Africa is free, democratic and without war and unrest as mostly false.", "lang": "en"}
