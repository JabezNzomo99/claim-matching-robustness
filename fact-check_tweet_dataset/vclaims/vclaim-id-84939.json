The Trump campaign figure includes the number of people classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as \u201cunemployed\u201d (people who are available for work and actively looking for a job, but don\u2019t have one) and the number of those \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d (people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking, or are not interested, such as students).\n\nCounting people \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d in this 16- to 24-year-old population is especially problematic, because the number of people who aren\u2019t looking for jobs includes people who are in school full-time. Trump essentially equated the employment statuses of, for example, a 16-year-old high school sophomore with a 24-year-old with a master\u2019s degree and looking for a job.\n\nAfter our fact-check published, Trump and Conway stopped using the term \u201cunemployed.\u201d Instead, they now say the 58 percent figure refers to black youths who are \u201cnot working.\u201d It\u2019s a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s still misleading. The Trump campaign\u2019s formula greatly inflates the actual BLS unemployment rate for black youths, while minimizing black unemployment compared with Asian youth unemployment. But, as our chart below shows, the official results show Asian youths faring much better than black and white youths.\n\nWe urge TV hosts, like Wallace, to push the Trump campaign further on this new spin. Wallace appropriately noted the correct rate for black youth unemployment, but he shouldn\u2019t have let Conway get away with the new talking point.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
