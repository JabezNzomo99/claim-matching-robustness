It was published on Facebook on October 29 and was detected by Facebook\u2019s Claim Check dashboard on October 30.\n\nIn the humanitarian response plan by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) for Typhoon Yolanda, there is no mention of the rehabilitation funds being used for election campaigning.\n\nMeanwhile, the post embedded a Facebook video uploaded by page \u201cAgila ng Pilipinas\u201d on October 7. The video is an excerpt of an August 5, 2015 TV Patrol report on the criticisms of the Noynoy Aquino administration regarding the Yolanda rehabilitation funds.\n\nThe first criticism was supposedly from the UN asking the government where the funds for Typhoon Yolanda rehabilitation are, given the 20,000 still homeless families in 2014, a year after the typhoon hit. The organization also said in 2014 that only 20% of the funding provided has been used to rebuild homes.\n\nThe second was the Catholic Church\u2019s alleged concern about some of the rehabilitation funds supposedly having been used for vote-buying in the 2016 national elections. In the TV report, the Church compared the 3,000 homes they had built compared to the government\u2019s 2,000. (READ: How to fact-check reports during disasters)", "lang": "en"}
