What you do is punch in your pin # backwards. EX: if its 1234, you'll type 4321. When you do that the money will come out but will be stuck in the slot. The machine will immediately alert the local police without the robber\u2019s knowledge & begin taking photos of the suspect. Every ATM has the feature. Stay safe.\u201d\n\nwas published on 1 May 2019.\n\nIs there an emergency PIN technology that allows a besieged ATM user to quietly activate an alarm that discreetly alerts the police? No \u2013 and if it angers the mugger, you could be harmed.\n\ntold Africa Check. He said the reverse-PIN entry is a hoax that has been doing rounds online for years.\n\nIf you\u2019re attacked by an armed robber and forced to withdraw money from the ATM, the best option is to cooperate, Olaka said.\n\nThe PIN has only one function\n\nFidelis Muia, the association\u2019s director of technical services, said ATMs don\u2019t even recognise correct PINs \u2013 the bank\u2019s computer does that.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth to that story,\u201d he told us.\n\n\u201cAs designed, the ATM machine collects a card number, the PIN the customer entered on inserting said card, and sends that information to the issuing bank. It is the issuing bank that uses an algorithm to confirm the PIN and the associated card match, not the ATM machine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the algorithm gives a correct check, the issuing bank system gives an authorisation message to the ATM to dispense cash, otherwise it sends a decline message.\u201d\n\nOlaka said all ATMs in Kenya are fitted with cameras, \u201cbut cameras come in after the fact in terms of being able to trace and apprehend the person. Cameras are not preventative.\u201d\n\nalso says the advice is false.\n\n\u201cClaiming that entering your PIN in reverse will summon police to an ATM and the withdrawal will be successful, is totally false,\u201d says an association\n\nreleased in 2007 and updated in 2011.\n\n\u201cThe PIN has only one function - to allow the customer to access their account \u2013 and it must be entered correctly each time and kept confidential.\u201d\n\nand found it to be false. Snopes says it first appeared in 2006.\n\nIt is an old rumour that was\n\nFacebook page in September 2014, and again by a\n\nBut the claim has circulated in Kenya, such as in this\n\nLike many false rumours, it has some basis in fact.\n\n, a US agency consumer protection agency, the \u201creverse PIN\u201d technology is \u201can urban legend\u201d arising from a proposal for \u201cemergency PIN technologies\u201d. The \u201cemergency-PIN technologies have never been deployed at any ATMs\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn ATM reverse-PIN system called \u2018SafetyPIN\u2019 was invented by Joseph Zingher,\u201d the report say. \u201cAccording to Mr Zingher, SafetyPIN is a simple computer code \u201cthat would recognise reversed, inverted, or otherwise altered [PINs] as a distress signal, and [instruct] the teller machine to call the cops.\u201d\n\nThe electronic message relayed to an alarm company dispatcher would contain \u201cthe card holder\u2019s name, identifier and location\u201d.\n\nIt was never implemented, with ATM manufacturers cited in the report saying as much. The FTC report also says that if a bank customer is accosted\n\nan ATM withdrawal, they\u2019d have no way of using the hoax distress signal.\n\nAnd the danger is real.\n\n\u201cIt could potentially be dangerous given that it provides plain false information to people who would be in extremely dangerous and volatile situations,\u201d\n\nand rated it false. A 2015 blog published on the website of\n\nthe \u201creverse PIN\u201d advice as \u201cmyth\u201d and ruled that it was \u201cfiction\u201d. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
