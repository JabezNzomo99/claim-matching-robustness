On the night of the Notre-Dame fire, they were photographed smiling while the Paris cathedral burned in the background. An \u201cavalanche\u201d of online hate targeting them personally immediately ensued.\n\nOn April 15, two friends were sitting at a cafe in Paris when cell phone notifications alerted them to an ongoing fire at Notre-Dame. They rushed to the cathedral even as the smoke was already visible \u201ceverywhere\u201d around Paris. \u201cWe\u2019re architecture students, we wanted to see what was happening with our own eyes,\u201d S., 21, told AFP.\n\nFor \u201ca good half hour, maybe forty-five minutes,\u201d S. and J. -- whose identities were verified by AFP during an in-person interview on May 3 -- witnessed the Notre-Dame fire from the south shore of the Seine, the river that crosses Paris in its center. Notre-Dame sits on an island in the middle of the river.\n\nPolice officers then asked S. and J. to exit the security perimeter. As they crossed under the red and white security tape on Lagrange street (in Paris\u2019 fifth district), around 8pm, Paris time, the photo responsible for their future problems was taken.\n\nThe picture, published with no caption on the Sputnik France Facebook page at 9:37pm, was soon shared by far-right pages in France and the US.\n\n\u201cMuslims laugh as blaze destroys Notre Dame cathedral during Holy Week,\u201d US far-right influencer Pamela Geller wrote, as early as 10:45pm. The known anti-Islam activist has more than 1.3 million followers on Facebook, and this post was shared 33,000 times since its publication.\n\nShortly after, French-language Facebook page Infos-Israel.News published an article titled \u201cAllah is great\u2019: Muslims laugh at sight of Notre-Dame fire.\u201d\n\nIn a few hours, the photo spread across social media, including on forums like Reddit and 4Chan. Numerous online users accused S. and J. of rejoicing at the sight of the Notre-Dame tragedy. In the comments sections, racist and Islamophobic slurs rub shoulders with death threats.\n\n\u201cWonder how they would laugh if someone torched the Dome of the Rock!\u201d asks one commenter, while another suggests hanging the two friends (below).\n\nThe two young men received messages from school friends telling them of the publications the same evening. \"It was completely surreal,\" J. remembers.\n\n\u201cI was never the target of racism until now. With this, I got enough for two lives,\u201d S. said as he showed comments that he captured on his phone to an AFP journalist.\n\nSince the photo became viral, Sputnik France published an article to highlight that \u201cat no point did Sputnik insinuate that these two individuals were Muslim, nor that they were laughing because of the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe news agency was quite surprised by the fact that some, apparently, see fit to speculate about the religious beliefs of these two men based on their appearance only,\u201d according to the article.\n\nWhy were S. and J. smiling on the viral photo? \u201cAs we were going under the security tape, it caught my face. It made us smile,\u201d said S.\n\n\u201cWe visited Notre-Dame, we took photos of it, we studied it, and we made a 3D model of it, so how could we rejoice in the fire?\u201d he added. \u201cAs architecture students, seeing an architectural gem burning doesn\u2019t leave you unaffected.\u201d\n\nTo prove his sincerity, S. showed his smartphone screen to our AFP journalist, revealing messages sent by a relative on Snapchat during the fire:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I saw the spire fall,\u201d he wrote in one of these messages.\n\nBoris Rosenthal, their lawyer, said he sent \u201cabout fifteen\u201d formal notices to various websites for image right infringement, the right of individuals over images of themselves in French law.\n\nIn one of the notices made available to AFP, he decries an \u201cavalanche of fake news\u201d targeting his clients. \u201cSome online users showed a desire to find my clients and threatened them,\u201d he added, highlighting that they are \u201cfully identifiable\u201d in the picture.\n\n\u201cWe must sensitize people who read, as well as those who write or comment, to the fact that behind an unverified information, there are people who have to face direct consequence on their lives,\u201d Rosenthal further told AFP.\n\nS. worries about being recognized during an internship interview. \u201cIt could be a factor against me,\u201d he fears.\n\nFor the past three weeks, J. and S. have been careful not to be seen together, and try not to dress as they did on the photo. \u201cI look around me as I leave my home,\u201d S. said, worried that a \u201ccrazy\u201d person might assault him.\n\nA few days ago, the two friends saw camera crews from two French channels. They avoided them out of fear of being recognized.", "lang": "en"}
