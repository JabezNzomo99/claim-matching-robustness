Davis quickly noted that more blacks were arrested in 2012 than in 2018 (the last year for which there are data). Data supplied to the FBI show that 151 blacks and 75 whites were arrested in 2012, compared with 186 blacks and 96 whites in 2018. The number of blacks arrested dipped as low as 71 in 2013, but in every year, far more blacks than whites were arrested for marijuana possession, even though South Bend has a black population of about 27,000 and a white population of around 64,000. Between 2012 and 2018, 805 blacks were arrested vs. 449 whites. So even though blacks are about 30 percent of the population, they were arrested at twice the rate of whites.", "lang": "en"}
