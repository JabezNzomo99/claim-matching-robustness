To describe the motion and the Liberal Democrats decision not to support it as such is misleading and excludes important context.\n\nThe tweet was deleted after publication of this article.\n\nWhat is the Queen\u2019s speech and what role does parliament play?\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech is written for the Queen by the government. It lists the legislation which the government plans to introduce to parliament over the following session. After the speech, parliament debates its contents and then votes on issuing a \u2018humble address\u2019. This address essentially thanks the Queen for her speech.\n\nTo influence the government\u2019s policy agenda MPs can do a few things. They can vote against delivering the humble address, which is essentially a symbolic vote of no confidence in the government.\n\nThey can also place amendments on the address, to try and change the government\u2019s policy agenda. For example, in 2017 the government announced funding for Northern Irish women to have abortions in England, after an amendment from Labour MP Stella Creasy on that issue looked likely to pass.\n\nYesterday the Labour party brought forward a motion that would have added onto the address that parliament:\n\n\u201crespectfully regrets that the Gracious Speech does not repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to restore a publicly provided and administered National Health Service and protect it from future trade agreements that would allow private companies competing for services who put profit before public health and that could restrict policy decisions taken in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe vote failed with 282 MPs voting for, and 310 voting against. All 19 Liberal Democrat MPs abstained.\n\nWhat would this amendment have done?\n\nThe most important thing to note is that had the motion passed, the government would not have been required to scrap the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, nor end privatisation in the NHS.\n\nThe wording expressed regret the speech did not \u201crepeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to restore a publicly provided and administered National Health Service\u201d.\n\nThis would have placed political pressure on the government and indicated a parliamentary majority for that course of action, but would not have guaranteed any action.\n\nSo to suggest that \u201c19 Lib Dem MPs refused to support a motion to stop privatisation of the NHS\u201d exaggerates the motion by implying it would definitely have stopped privatisation of the NHS if it had a majority.\n\nWhat is the 2012 Health and Social Care Act?\n\nThe wording of Labour\u2019s motion implies that repealing the 2012 Health and Social Care Act would \u201crestore a publicly provided and administered National Health Service\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the case that there was no privatisation in the NHS in England before the 2012 Act. For example, private providers have been offering services to NHS patients since 2006, and a Cooperation and Competition Panel was established in 2009.\n\nThat said, the 2012 Act did contain provisions to increase the role of private providers. The independent health charity the King\u2019s Fund writes that the Act \u201cdid not begin the involvement of private sector providers in the provision of NHS services... However, the 2012 Act did extend a market-based approach to the NHS, emphasising a diverse provider market, competition and patient choice as ways of improving health care\u2026 [and] clarified the role of the competition authorities in relation to health\u201d.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the 2012 Act made other changes to the NHS too, for example making GPs responsible for buying and providing healthcare for their local areas. Labour\u2019s motion proposed repealing the entirety of the Act.\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said later in response to the question of why he did not vote for the motion: \u201cThe amendment talked of stopping privatisation- and if that was all it said, I\u2019d have voted for it... but it also entailed a massive, pointless restructuring of the NHS, which would be extremely daft.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
