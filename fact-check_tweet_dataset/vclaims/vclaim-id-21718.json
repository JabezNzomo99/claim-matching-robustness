Russia.\u201d\n\nThe court unanimously declared that Russia\u2019s accusations were baseless, and that by prosecuting the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Russia had violated multiple articles of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses World Headquarters communications office told Polygraph.info via email that both accusations are false.\n\n\u201cThe European Court confirmed each Witnesses\u2019 personal choice in regard to health care, stating that: \u2018\u2026the refusal of blood transfusion was an expression of the free will of the individual community members who exercised their right to personal autonomy in the sphere of health care protected both under the Convention and in Russian law,\u2019\u201d the group\u2019s communications office said.\n\nResponding to the accusation that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses group was \u201cpropagating exclusiveness,\u201d the statement said: \u201cAll religions preach some form of exclusivity - it is the very nature of religious conviction. They all claim to teach the correct \u2018truth.\u2019 People do not adhere to a religion unless they believe it to be the \u2018right\u2019 religion. Even the Orthodox religions claim to be the \u2018correct\u2019 religion, and yet there is no record of an accusation against it for \u2018extremist\u2019 activity because of this belief.\"\n\nRussia\u2019s law \u201cOn Countering Extremism\u201d was first adopted in 2002 but has since undergone several revisions, broadening the definition of \u201cextremism.\u201d\n\nIts current version has been the subject of wide domestic and international criticism, for being \u201cspecifically designed\u201d to help the government suppress any sort of dissent.\n\n\u201cThe anti-extremist law in Russia is essentially designed for selective use, and sometimes it is being arbitrarily used, including against religious minorities,\u201d said Tanya Lokshina, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Moscow-based Russia program director and senior researcher.\n\nThomas J. Reese, S.J., Chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), said in a statement last week: \u201cThe Russian government\u2019s latest actions appear designed to eliminate the legal existence of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
