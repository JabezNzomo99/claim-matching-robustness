Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent\u2019s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city\u2019s neighborhoods.\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls.\n\n\"This is the true picture of \u2018Milwaukee's Renaissance\u2019 after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership,\" Donovan\u2019s post began.\n\nThe post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was.\n\nSeveral hours after Donovan\u2019s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying:\n\n\"This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving.\"\n\nGonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015.\n\nDonovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying:\n\n\"Perhaps that's the case, Gilberto. But if you're familiar with the corner, you know too that there's about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city.\"\n\nThe Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city\u2019s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished.\n\nDonovan told us he didn\u2019t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn\u2019t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying \"I\u2019m certain we\u2019d have no problem locating another home that looks like that\" in Milwaukee\u2019s inner city.\n\nBut whether other homes look something like that one doesn\u2019t bear on whether Donovan\u2019s Facebook statement is accurate.\n\nIn the nearly six years of PolitiFact Wisconsin, we\u2019ve rated dozens of claims as Pants on Fire. That includes three made by Barrett during his gubernatorial campaigns against Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nBut none of the POFs were related to actual flames.\n\nDonovan said in a Facebook post: \"This is the true picture of \u2018Milwaukee's Renaissance\u2019 after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership.\"\n\nThe post included a picture of a dilapidated home, all right. But the condition is explained by the fact that the city Fire Department has set fires inside it and blasted holes in it for training.\n\nDonovan\u2019s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
