The one-minute-50-second video shows a man wearing a skull cap crawling through a narrow street, followed by a woman and girl holding babies in their arms, and a young boy. The woman and the girl are seen wearing hijab.\n\nAfter some time, the crawling man is seen resting in front of a house, following which he wears slippers, gets up and suddenly starts walking. Facebook user Sonu Pandit posted the video on October 31 with a sarcastic claim that Allah\u2019s miracle cured the legs of a disabled beggar. He went on to say that the incident is from Delhi.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the video is misleading. This particular video is not from India but Pakistan.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video has already been viewed by over 6.33 lakh users and shared more than 20,000 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of InVID tool, we found the viral video on a YouTube channel called Story Corner\u2019. As per this channel, the video is from Pakistan. It uploaded the video in March last year.\n\nA news report by Divya Bhaskar published in January 2019 also says that the incident, captured on CCTV, took place in Pakistan\u2019s Lahore.\n\nBy using related keywords, we also found a report by Pakistani channel Dunya News, which carried the viral video. The channel captioned the video as Look how fake beggars fool people.\n\nA verified Facebook page Show Ana Haber also claims that the viral video is from Pakistan. Show Ana Haber\u2019 is the official Facebook page of Turkish news website ShowTv.com\u2019.\n\nWe, however, could not independently verify in which city of Pakistan the incident took place or details about the man. But the given pieces of evidence are well enough to establish that the viral video has nothing to do with India.\n\nWe also could not find any news report from Indian mainstream media which claims that the video is from Delhi.
