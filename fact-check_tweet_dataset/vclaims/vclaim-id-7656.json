No, that's not true. The show was indeed cancelled over an innapropriate tweet but it wasn't picked up by NBC. That part was made up by a site that posts fake stories under the guise of satire designed to fool conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing over the top articles on social media so the site's fans can then mock them for it.\n\nEarlier the site already claimed the show was picked up and then cancelled by Netflix and that Roseanne was to become White Hous Press Secretary.\n\nThe NBC story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on May 30, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Roseanne Picked Up By NBC\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nRoseanne started her day by making a joke that a bunch of liberal snowflakes found offensive. The next thing she knew, she was being canned by ABC for making a joke that got more than 190K laugh reacts on Facebook: \"I didn't know what to think. I mean...people know I support Trump. What did they expect?\n\nDaily World Update comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nOne of the hints in the story was the fake name of the NBC CEO (who in reality is named Steve Burke) attached to a fake quote:\n\n\"Art Tubbols\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Netflix Did NOT Cave, Did NOT Cancel Roseanne After 'A Phone Call From Obama'\n\u2022 Fake News: George HW Bush NOT Dead After Overdosing On Wife Barbara's Pills\n\u2022 Fake News: Obama NOT Caught Smuggling Booze, Drugs And Underage Girls Into Enemy Territory\n\u2022 Fake News: Santa Fe Killer Did NOT Confess His Love For Obama", "lang": "en"}
