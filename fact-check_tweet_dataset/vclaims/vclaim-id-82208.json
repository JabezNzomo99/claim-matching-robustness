Huckabee said he \u201cpassed 94 tax cuts,\u201d while highlighting his achievements as governor. Arkansas\u2019s current governor, Asa Hutchinson (R), also said in his introductory speech that his predecessor \u201clowered taxes.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, The Fact Checker gave Huckabee Two Pinocchios for his claim. Other fact-checkers arrived at similar findings. The anti-tax Club for Growth attacked Huckabee (whom the group called \u201cTax Hike Mike\u201d) for his claim about tax cuts during the campaign in 2007, and it already has launched an ad about his record on taxes.\n\nDuring Huckabee\u2019s tenure as governor, from 1996 to 2007, there were 90 tax cuts. The cuts ranged from tiny cuts, such as a $500 sales tax break for manufacturing machinery, to larger items such as $2.7 million annually in car lease exemptions for the rental car tax, according to a detailed list that the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration provided us.\n\nSome of these cuts were narrowly tailored, such as an income tax deduction for organ donation ($76,000 a year), a sales and use tax exemption for the Salvation Army ($15,000) and a tax exemption for residential lawn care ($210,000). (It is unclear where exactly the figure of \u201c94 tax cuts\u201d comes from, but this number from the state does exclude some minor special revenue fees.)\n\nIn his first budget, Huckabee proposed a sweeping overhaul of the state\u2019s income tax system, resulting in a $70 million net tax cut package that was enacted in 1997. He also signed legislation to phase out the 6 percent capital gains tax, which the libertarian Cato Institute called a \u201csignificant pro-growth accomplishment.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of his term, however, Huckabee\u2019s record was more mixed. He repeatedly approved increases for tobacco, sales and gas taxes. At the same time, there were big increases in transportation spending, health care, anti-smoking campaigns and early education programs, according to the Cato Institute. He also agreed to a sales tax increase to make up for a budget deficit that, in part, was created by his spending increases, according to Cato.\n\nA review of tax legislation that passed under Huckabee shows a net tax increase of $505 million, adjusted for inflation and economic growth. That means although there were 90 laws that resulted in $378 million in lower taxes, there also were 21 others that totaled a tax increase of $883.1 million, according to the state.\n\nThe Cato Institute gave Huckabee a B grade in its 1998 Fiscal Policy Report Card on America\u2019s Governors, which is published every other year. The grade is generated based on 23 measures of fiscal performance, of the state\u2019s expenditure, revenue and tax rate. Huckabee received lower grades throughout his tenure: C in 2000 and 2002, D in 2004 and, in 2006, an F. He left office with an overall grade of D for his spending practices and tax increases.\n\n\u201cGovernor Huckabee\u2019s tax policies are a mixed bag at best,\u201d said Cato budget analyst Nicole Kaeding, who co-authored the report. \u201cDuring his tenure, the state increased the gasoline tax, the sales tax, the cigarette tax, the personal income tax, along with others. The large tax increases were necessary to finance the rapid increase in state spending during Huckabee\u2019s time in office.\u201d\n\nThe report card uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau, National Association of State Budget Officers, National Conference of State Legislatures and each state\u2019s budget offices of the governor and legislature. In most states, the report warns, the legislature and governor have had an equal influence on budget outcomes.\n\nThere indeed were 90 tax cuts when Huckabee was governor of Arkansas. But the effect of these cuts \u2014 many of which were narrowly tailored \u2014 was offset by 21 tax increases. That resulted in a $505 million net tax increase for Arkansas under Huckabee\u2019s leadership.\n\nHuckabee has the responsibility to retire or revise this talking point as he embarks on another presidential run. Despite repeated concerns about his statement seven years ago, he has repeated the same figure of 94 tax cuts in a high-profile speech. In other words, he was warned this was a problematic claim. Thus, we will boost his rating on this statement to Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
