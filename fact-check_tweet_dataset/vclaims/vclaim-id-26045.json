He has even wondered why reporters have not mentioned this astonishing bit of news.\n\nA White House official explained that the president was referring to information that can be found in Table 1.1.6 of the second-quarter GDP report. When discussing quarterly GDP figures, it is customary to refer to an annual figure for the GDP \u2014 in this case, $18.5 trillion \u2014 which is expressed in chained (2012) dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n\nThere are four key components that go into the calculations of the GDP \u2014 personal consumption expenditures, domestic investment, net exports and government expenditures \u2014 and this table breaks down the $18.5 trillion figure. It shows that the trade deficit was $902.4 billion in the first quarter and $849.9 billion in the second quarter, for a difference of $52 billion.\n\nTrump keeps saying that this is how much the trade deficit fell from quarter to quarter. But remember, these figures are expressed as annual numbers. So if you want to know what the difference is between two quarters, you need to divide by four, according to an official at the Commerce Department and economists we consulted. \u201cDividing the GDP trade values by four will result in quarterly rates,\u201d the official said.\n\nMoreover, if you wanted to talk about the actual trade deficit, as Trump does, you would not use the inflation-adjusted figures but the current-dollar figures. In the GDP report, it shows that on an annual basis, the trade deficit fell by $86.8 billion. Divided by four, that turns out to be $21.7 billion.\n\nThere are slight differences in what data is collected and reported in what are known as the international transactions accounts (ITAs) and the GDP accounts, but you can see that the result is roughly the same \u2014 about a $20 billion decline in the trade deficit from quarter to quarter, not $52 billion.\n\nEven a $20 billion decline may not be cause for celebration, because many experts think that the data was affected by the fact that companies overseas rushed to buy U.S. goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect. Net exports, for instance, added a full percentage point to GDP in the second quarter \u2014 an unusually high addition from that source. Goods exports also jumped from 8.1 percent to 8.4 percent of GDP in the quarter.\n\nThe White House official defended the use of the $52 billion figure, saying it was consistent with how GDP is expressed \u2014 in annualized, inflation-adjusted dollars. \u201cYour point about the trade deficit going up in first half of 2018 is only true on a year-over-year basis. But the 4.1% headline number, and all the investment numbers we reported, are seasonally adjusted annual rates in the second quarter for the four quarters of 2018,\u201d the official wrote in an email.\n\nWe doubt the president himself is digging into the details of the GDP report, so either he is being misled by his staff or misunderstood something in a briefing. He may be very disappointed when the third-quarter numbers are released, given that the year is already on track to have the largest trade deficit in a decade.\n\nWe generally are reluctant to give Four Pinocchios for a factoid based on government data. But the president is presenting this in such a misleading manner that we have little choice. In every instance, the president says the trade deficit fell by $52 billion from the first to the second quarter, calling it one of the \u201cbiggest wins\u201d in the GDP report. He may be convinced of it, but that\u2019s simply not true.", "lang": "en"}
