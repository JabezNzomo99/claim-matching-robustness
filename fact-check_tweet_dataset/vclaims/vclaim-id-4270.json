They indicate a surge in recorded moped, scooter and motorcycle related crimes in 2017, and falls over the course of late 2017 and early 2018. Most of the figures we use in this piece come from a press release given to us by the Met Police, which haven\u2019t all been published elsewhere.\n\nPolice figures on these kinds of crime aren\u2019t reliable indicators of trends over time in any case, as they\u2019re likely to be affected by improvements to the way crimes are recognised and counted on police systems.\n\nMore crimes in the past year than previously, but recently on a downward trend\n\nAbout 22,000 incidents of powered two wheelers (scooters, mopeds and motorcycles) used in crimes \u2013 an average of 60 a day \u2013 were recorded from June 2017 to May 2018. This is 50% higher than the 14,700 recorded in June 2016 to May 2017.\n\nThe police say that some of the rise is due to an improvement in these crimes being recognised and flagged on the system. This year\u2019s figure also includes the peak of around 2,600 in July 2017. Since then they say the numbers have been falling:\n\n\u201cIn October, November, December 2017 and Jan 18 there were 7869 offences recorded. In February, March, April and May 2018 there were 4838 offences recorded.\u201d\n\nSo the year-on-year figures mask a more recent month-by-month trend. At the peak in July 2017 there were an average of 84 crimes per day, most recently in May 2018 the average was 37.\n\nSlightly different figures are available online from questions to the Mayor of London and they show a similar trend.\n\nThere were 572 offences recorded in April 2015 where the suspect was on a moped, scooter or motorcycle. In April 2018 there were 1,245. This is well below the peak of 2,653 in July 2017.\n\nThe number of offences also varies a lot between boroughs. Camden recorded the most offences from 2015 to April 2018\u2013nearly 9,000\u2013while only eight were recorded in Heathrow and 36 in Harrow.\n\nThe Met Police released more figures recently showing that from 2011 to April 2017 the vast majority of these crimes involved robbing someone\u2019s personal property or other kinds of theft.\n\nOut of nearly 22,000 recorded offences, almost 15,000 were classed as \u201cother theft from the person\u201d and another 3,500 involved robbery of personal property.\n\nThere were also 64 gun crime robberies recorded between January 2011 and April 2017.", "lang": "en"}
