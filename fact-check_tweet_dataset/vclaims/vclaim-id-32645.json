The posts, written in traditional Chinese, were uploaded after months of protests in Hong Kong, during which some subway stations have been vandalised. But the video is being used in a misleading context; the footage actually shows German anti-terror police conducting a drill in Nuremberg in October 2019.\n\nThe footage, which appears to show armed police shooting a man in a subway station, was published here on Facebook on October 26, 2019, where it has been viewed nearly 100,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201c(Foreign police would shoot and kill the mob who vandalise the subway.)\u201d\n\nThe post was published after almost five consecutive months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have sometimes turned violent. Protesters have vandalised train stations during the unrest. Here is an AFP news report about the protests.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe three-minute and eight-second clip opens with a group of screaming people running away from a masked man who is aiming a gun towards them inside a train station.\n\nArmed police can then be seen approaching the scene from a nearby escalator. Moments later, they can be seen approaching a man who falls to the floor after the sound of gunshots rings out.\n\nSeveral people can be seen lying on the station floor while police subseqently patrol the area. The video then cuts to show three men in suits speaking to journalists inside the station.\n\nComments on the video from some Facebook users suggested some believed the video showed police firing live rounds.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of some of the comments:\n\nThey translate to English as: \u201cHong Kong police are so merciful\u201d; \u201cWhy Hong Kong doesn\u2019t do so? Even killing them is not your fault. It\u2019s caused by themselves and they cannot blame anyone\u201d; \u201cHong Kong police should work by following the international standard, to severely punish the mob with no mercy\u201d.\n\nThe same video was published here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here on YouTube with a similar claim.\n\nBut video actually show German anti-terror police conducting a drill in Nuremberg in October 2019.\n\nA keyword search found the same video published here on Facebook on October 20, 2019, five days before the first misleading post was published.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \u201cScreams, shots, explosions: Until well into the early morning hours ran in the Nuremberg main station a large-scale anti-terrorism exercise of the police. (Video: Alexander Brock)\u201d.\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons between the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video in the German-language Facebook post (R):\n\nGerman-language captions superimposed on the video can be translated to English as:\n\n\"Anti-terrorist exercise at the main station\"\n\n \"First security forces are on the move\"\n\n \"The situation is still unpredictable\"\n\n \"A second assassin appears\"\n\n \"... and gets shot\"\n\n \"Forces ensure the situation\"\n\n \"Minister of the Interior of the state of Bavaria Joachim Herrmann\"\n\nA keyword search for an anti-terrorism exercise in Germany subsequently found this October 16, 2019 video published by Russian state-owned media outlet RT.\n\nThe YouTube video\u2019s German-language headline translates to English as: \u201cLarge contingent at the Nuremberg station: Police practice anti-terrorist operation\u201d.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption translates to English as: \u201cAround 1,500 participants, including 300 police officers, conducted an anti-terrorist maneuver at Nuremberg train station on Wednesday night. This was completely closed for the exercise. Some of the officers staged an armed attack on the station, which was beaten back by the other police officers.\u201d\n\nScenes captured in the video in the misleading posts directly correspond with the RT video.\n\nBelow are three screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the RT video (R):\n\nJoachim Herrmann, Minister of the Interior of the state of Bavaria, is shown speaking to journalists in the final segment of the video.\n\nThe video corresponds with a Google user\u2019s image tagged here at Nuremberg Central Station on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on Google Maps:\n\nThe same exercise was reported on by German public-service radio and television broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk here on October 16.", "lang": "en"}
