This month, the lead was taken by mainstream media houses. A number of prominent news organisations in both print and television rushed to report news without basic verification and ended up committing a series of gaffes on a number of issues. Alt News has compiled these instances, and more.\n\nWhen the social media rage over actress Priya Prakash Varrier was at its peak, a quote by Maulana Atif Qadri was circulated widely, in which Qadri calls for a fatwa against the actress for hurting their sentiment. This quote was picked up by Aaj Tak and senior anchor Anjana Om Kashyap broadcast a show in which she attacked Qadri for his words.\n\nQadri had never said any such thing. The tweet that was being referred to was from a parody account called TiimesHow (T-I-I-M-E-S H-O-W) and not Times Now. This minor detail somehow completely escaped the channel.\n\nOn the day PM Modi landed in Abu Dhabi, Zee News reported, \u201cAs PM Narendra Modi lands in UAE, video of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince saying \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019 goes viral. WATCH\u201d. Other media houses too reported this news.\n\nThe person in the video was NOT Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, but Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi, a United Arab Emirates-based columnist and commentator on Arab affairs. By the time the false news was pulled down, it had already travelled far and wide.\n\n3. News of Sridevi\u2019s death due to heart attack floated by mainstream media\n\nStarting with Times of India, major news publications reported that actress Sridevi had died due to a heart attack, according to the forensic report. We traced the origin of this theory to this tweet by a Times of India journalist.\n\nThis news was also reported by Hindustan Times, First post and National Herald. As it turned out, the information was false. The autopsy report conclusively stated that the actress died due to drowning. There was no mention of heart attack. Yet, major news outlets reported it without verifying.\n\nBJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav and BJP Spokesperson Nalin Kohli were among those who spread the information that JNU student Najeeb Ahmad who had gone missing in 2016 had joined ISIS. Rajya Sabha member and senior columnist Swapan Dasgupta too spread this fake news.\n\nIt turned out the Najeeb in question who had joined ISIS was not the missing JNU student but 23-year old Najeeb, a student of VIT Vellore who went missing in Kerala in August 2017 and subsequently wrote to his mother that he had joined ISIS. Madhav and Dasgupta later untweeted the false info.\n\nFormer India cricketer Virender Sehwag posted a tweet after the incident of the lynching of a mentally challenged tribal man in Kerala with the words, \u201cMadhu stole 1 kg rice. A mob of Ubaid , Hussain and Abdul Kareem lynched the poor tribal man to death. This is a disgrace to a civilized society and I feel ashamed that this happens and kuch farak nahi padta\u201d.\n\nWhat Sehwag did not tweet was the names of the other accused, not all of whom were Muslim. This attempt to give a communal colour to the incident was severely criticised on social media, following which Sehwag deleted the tweet and issued an apology. Interestingly, he later deleted his apology as well.\n\nAfter senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai filed a police complaint against lawyer Prashant Patel Umrao for spreading fake news on social media, the latter accused Sardesai of having secured a medical seat for his son at Manipal University by flouting rules.\n\nAs it turned out, this accusation was blatantly false. Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose produced documents that showed their son Ishan Sardesai had gained admission at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal on merit through the \u2018General\u2019 quota and not \u2018NRI\u2019 quota as alleged by Umrao. This was confirmed by Manipal University in a tweet.\n\n7. MEA shares news about use of Saudi Arabian airspace which is denied by Saudi\n\n\u201cRiyadh allows Air India to use space for Israel flights\u201d, The official Facebook page of Ministry of External Affairs shared this news quoting Israeli daily Haaretz as its source. The news was also widely reported across Indian media and hailed as a \u2018historic first\u2019, a \u2018diplomatic win\u2019 and \u2018a sign of India\u2019s nimble diplomacy in the region\u2019.\n\nMEA had quoted the report of the Israeli daily The Haaretz, which retracted its story four hours after it was published. The headline of the story was changed from \u201cIn a historic first, Saudi Arabia allows flights to Israel over its airspace\u201d to \u201cSaudi Arabia denies report of historic approval of flights to Israel using its airspace\u201d. MEA also subsequently deleted their Facebook post.\n\nHowever, Reuters on March 6, 2018 reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said that Saudi Arabia had allowed the use of its airspace to Air India for flights to and from Tel Aviv.\n\nWill your mobile phone number have 13 digits by the end of the year? This is what the Congress party claimed on Twitter. In a Twitter poll, it asked, \u201cThe Department of Telecom (DoT) has issued a directive instructing all telecom operators in the country to start issuing 13-digit mobile numbers later this year. Are you happy with this decision? #IndiaSpeaks\u201d with the options being yes and no.\n\nThe truth is that there is no change in the numbering system for retail mobile numbers. The new numbers are to be provided for SIM based Machine To Machine (M2M) communication. It will NOT extend to retail mobile phone numbers, which will continue to operate on 10 digits.\n\n\u201cKamal\u2019s party website http://Maiyam.com is registered in Cayman Island.\u201d \u201cMaiyam Cayman Island link, Cayman Island is a Tax Haven, How did Kamal who is fighting Corruption, get people in Tax Haven to register his domain.?\u201d The aforementioned claims vis-a-vis the party website of Kamal Haasan\u2019s newly floated party were made by Hari Prabhakaran who claims to be an AIADMK member.\n\nThe allegation was completely baseless as the tweet betrayed ignorance of the basics of domain registration. However, it had been shared hundreds of times on social media.\n\nSerial faker and communal rabble rouser ShankhNaad tweeted that no one raised a hue and cry when a police officer in uniform openly promoted the Quran at an event by an Islamic organisation.\n\nContrary to what ShankhNaad was trying to portray, the event by the organisation Salaam Center had stressed on religious harmony, unity and brotherhood. It was attended by Hindu spiritual leader Swami Lakshmi Shankaracharya, among others. Shankhnaad also tried to malign Salaam Centre claiming it to be a \u2018Jihadi\u2019 organisation. As it turns out, this organisation is frequented by many politicians and celebrities of all hues.\n\n11. \u2018Chinese\u2019 declared an official language of Pakistan\n\nOn February 19, news reports emerged that Pakistan has declared Mandarin as one of its official languages. This information was first put out by the Pakistani news channel Abb Takk news. A number of Indian media houses too reported it.\n\nThe news turned out to be fake. The Pakistani senate had not passed any such resolution declaring Mandarin as an official language of the country. What had transpired instead was that the Pakistani parliament had passed a motion to offer Chinese Language courses for Pakistani students in order to enhance communication, reduce communication gaps and secure jobs under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.\n\nAnkit Saxena was murdered by the family of the girl he was in love with. The incident occurred in Delhi in February. Shortly thereafter, a conspiracy theory began doing the rounds of social media stating that the murder of Ankit Saxena was the handiwork of Hindutva elements, and that no Muslim family lived in the neighbourhood where the murder took place. This theory which was floated by Amaresh Misra who is a politician from U.P was reported by some publications.\n\nThe post was replete with falsehoods. The claims made in the post were contradicted by reports published by The Hindustan Times, Times of India and Indian Express. Alt News had published a detailed article debunking the theory, which can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
