This agreement struck by Bill Clinton\u2019s administration requires the federal government to release rather than detain undocumented immigrant children, first to their parents if possible, to other adult relatives if not, and to licensed programs willing to accept custody if no relatives are available. As a last resort, U.S. officials may place children in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d setting available.\n\nA federal judge in California ruled in 2015 that the Flores settlement covered all children in immigration officials\u2019 custody, regardless of whether they were apprehended crossing the border alone or with family. The judge\u2019s ruling also covered any accompanying parents. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed this part of the ruling and said the Flores settlement required only that children be released, not parents.\n\n\u201cUnder Obama it mainly referred to the practice of identifying and arresting a deportable or criminal alien and then releasing them without pursuing deportation or under \u2018supervision,\u2019 and they often failed to appear at hearings. Later, also under Obama, it also meant the practice at the border of apprehending aliens but releasing them if they had claimed to have arrived before 2014, even if they appeared to have crossed a few minutes ago.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
