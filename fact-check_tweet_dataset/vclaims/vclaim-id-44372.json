But AFP traced the story back to a satirical website.\n\nOne post shared more than 3,300 times on Facebook, archived here, alleges that a popular Ghanaian preacher known as Prophet Nigel Gaisie said: \u201cI Can Raise Kobe Bryant If 10% Of His Net Worth Is Given Me [sic]\". The post links to an article, which claimed the preacher told his congregation that he was able to resurrect Bryant and his teenage daughter, who died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020.\n\nAFP analysed the source codes of websites that posted the story and found the earliest version was published by News Bulleting on January 27, 2020 -- less than 24 hours after the news of Bryant\u2019s death rippled across the world.\n\nThe website\u2019s disclaimer states: \"News Bulleting is a satire news and humor website. All references, names and marks or institutions in this website are used as contextual elements, like in any novel or science-fiction story.\"\n\nShortly after it was first published on News Bulleting, the story began circulating as real news on news platforms across the continent. We archived some posts from Nigeria here, here, here and here. The same story has also spread via newspapers and blogs in Kenya, archived here, here, and here. In Zambia and South Africa, the claim has also been presented as genuine.\n\nGaisie is a real-life pastor famous for giving controversial sermons but has denied making any such prophecy about Bryant. His Prophetic Hill Chapel issued a statement threatening to sue those seeking to \u201cridicule and tarnish\u201d the preacher\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and the legal department of the church has been activated and any publication or utterance made by any person to ridicule and tarnish the unblemished reputation of the Great Prophet shall be met with proportionate and plausible force available,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe pastor also published Facebook posts warning against the false claim.", "lang": "en"}
