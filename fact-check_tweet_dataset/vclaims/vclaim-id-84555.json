Social media accounts have a habit of getting hacked just before a controversial post. In some cases, almost magically, they are also instantly restored after the tweet. And sometimes, the \u2018mischievous\u2019 tweets get deleted before the \u2018victim\u2019 gets back access to the account. Recently, in a shocking attempt of victim shaming, the twitter handle of BJP spokesperson, Shaina NC posted a misleading photograph of the victim of the Chandigarh stalking incident. As the outrage against the post built up, Shaina claimed that her account was hacked. Requests to substantiate the claim with a copy of the restoration email from twitter went unanswered.\n\nShaina is not alone when it comes to claims of account being hacked. Alt News has compiled an interesting list of some other notable instances.\n\nMuch earlier in 2013, BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi\u2019s account mysteriously tweeted the last name of the victim of the sexual assault case involving former Tehelka editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal.\n\nAs reported by DNA, Lekhi initially admitted her mistake and apologized but later denied her statement. She claimed her account was hacked.\n\nIn April 2017, the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia\u2019s twitter account retweeted a few tweets calling Anna Hazare a BJP agent and a fraud. Hazare had earlier blamed Arvind Kejriwal for the poor performance of the Aam Admi Party in the Delhi civic polls.\n\nIt was a unique \u201chacking\u201d situation where Sisodia had access to his account and was able to tweet that his account was hacked but was unable to delete the offensive tweets.\n\nThose who have been around on twitter for long enough know of this famous case where the twitter handle of the veteran right wing journalist Kanchan Gupta posted a porn link.\n\nOf course everyone believed Kanchan Gupta that it was not him but twitter doing \u201camazing things\u201d with his account. It is not always the hacker, you see.\n\nThe twitter onslaught against Arun Jaitley by BJP MP Kirti Azad\u2019s account went viral in December 2015. The handle tweeted, \u201cI was visited at home by so many agencies to take precaution against threat to my life. Dear @arunjaitley darta nahin hoon napunsako se.\u201d\n\nJust as speculation about the rift between the two went viral, came the anticlimax. Kirti Azad claimed his account was hacked.\n\nCricketer Suresh Raina also had a similar moment with an unsportsmanlike tweet. A tweet from Raina\u2019s account mocked the Pakistan cricket team after they were ousted from the tournament after losing a semi-final against Sri Lanka: \u201cEk do din late gaye ghar !!!! Woh bhi besharam ki tarah Gaye\u2026 Bye bye Pakistan!!!!\u201d\n\nAfter it was condemned widely on Twitter, Raina deleted the tweet and blamed his nephew.\n\nMore recently, just two weeks ago, the Twitter handle of the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) retweeted an anti-Congress post.\n\nMany similar cases have surfaced in recent times when the social media team member handling the account mistakenly tweets from the official government handle instead of his personal account. In this case however, IGIA claimed they were hacked. The airport apologized and claimed that its handle was \u201csubjected to a hacker attack\u201d. Interestingly, like in the case of Shaina NC, the alleged \u201chacker\u201d tweeted only one inappropriate post which was removed and the account recovered, all in a matter of minutes.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the collection. No, we are not insinuating anyone of any wrongdoing. Dogs are known to have eaten homework. Nephews and interns are known to have tweeted from people\u2019s accounts. Twitter is known to have done amazing things. It is not impossible.", "lang": "en"}
