He has said \u201cwe have won,\u201d that ISIS has been \u201cbeaten,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d and that there is \u201cvery little ISIS\u201d left. He\u2019s also said \u201cthe caliphate [is] almost knocked out\u201d and the United States has \u201cliberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been, I think, as clear as can be, when he talks about the defeat of the ISIS territorial caliphate,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cHe has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of ISIS in total. We know that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks were not nearly as clear-cut as Bolton suggests. Trump has previously used hyperbolic language to describe his administration\u2019s progress in Iraq and Syria. So, what is going on with ISIS? And what is going on with the territorial caliphate? What has been defeated? Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nWhen U.S. forces began to withdraw from Iraq in 2010, al-Qaeda in Iraq was a shadow of its former self because its leadership had largely been destroyed. Former CIA director John Brennan described the organization as \u201cpretty much decimated,\u201d with \u201cmaybe 700-or-so adherents left\u201d when U.S. forces left Iraq. It certainly did not control any territory.\n\nHowever, the civil war in Syria, growing sectarian tensions and a degraded military in Iraq created an opening, which breathed new life into the moribund organization. And by mid-2012, it had grown so much that the Defense Intelligence Agency warned that ISIS could \u201cdeclare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organizations in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nISIS did just that, declaring a caliphate in June 2014. The caliphate, self-described as the Islamic State, functioned like a government: It provided courts, religious schools and social welfare services; maintained public order; and even collected hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. And so while ISIS and the Islamic State are related, it\u2019s important to note they are not the same.\n\nAt its height, in late 2014, the Islamic State controlled 34,000 square miles of territory across Iraq and Syria. By the time Trump took office, the U.S.-backed international coalition had reduced Islamic State territory by about half and had retaken all Iraqi cities, except for western Mosul, and the northeastern section of Syria. As of June 2018, the Islamic State controlled 14,000 square miles. Today, it controls almost no territory, meaning the Islamic State, or the territorial caliphate, has been defeated.\n\nA report from the Pentagon inspector general noted that the Defense Department estimated 15,500 to 17,100 ISIS fighters remained in Iraq, with the caveat that the number of fighters fluctuated regularly. Regardless of the exact number, the organization has thousands more fighters than the 700 it had when U.S. forces last left Iraq.\n\nISIS has suffered \u201csignificant leadership losses,\u201d Haspel testified, just as it had in 2010. But that\u2019s not to suggest that there is no organization. A threat assessment from the U.S. intelligence community outlined that the group still has \u201ceight branches, more than a dozen networks, and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world,\u201d none of which existed when the United States last withdrew forces. Moreover, NDI Coats testified that the same political instability that allowed ISIS to resurrect itself \u201cpersists\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing now is not the surrender of ISIS as an organization but a calculated decision to preserve the safety of their families and the preservation of their capabilities,\u201d Votel said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on March 7. ISIS fighters are simply \u201cwaiting for the right time to resurge.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, ISIS, as a terrorist network, is still intact. It has tens of thousands of active members in Iraq and Syria, affiliates around the globe and a proven ability to continue to perpetrate terrorist attacks. In other words, declaring ISIS has been \u201cbeaten\u201d or \u201cdefeated,\u201d as President Trump did in December 2018, is flat-out wrong and would be worthy of Pinocchios.\n\nBut the president\u2019s language has become murkier. More recently, he has said that the United States has liberated \u201cvirtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria\u201d and that the caliphate is \u201calmost knocked out.\u201d These assertions are closer to reality. ISIS can no longer claim it has a territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria. It no longer controls land or operates a government.", "lang": "en"}
