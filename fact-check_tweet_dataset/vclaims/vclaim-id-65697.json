And though the number of weekly claims has gradually declined, more than 728,000 claims remained unpaid at the end of May.\n\nThe state Department of Workforce Development is working to hire additional workers to handle unemployment claims. But former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who lost to Democrat Tony Evers in 2018, has his own idea of how to tackle it.\n\n\"Assign all state employees who have been idle at home to process unemployment benefits,\" Walker said in a June 5, 2020 tweet.\n\nAre there really state workers sitting \"idle at home\" during the crisis?\n\nThe June 5, 2020 tweet wasn\u2019t the first time Walker, who is now president-elect of the conservative group Young America\u2019s Foundation, made such a claim.\n\nIn a May 20, 2020 New York Times Op-Ed, he wrote \"many state government employees are still receiving paychecks as they sit idle at home.\"\n\nWhen asked to back up the claim, a Walker spokesperson pointed to a March 23, 2020 memo to Wisconsin state employees from Department of Administration secretary Joel Brennan.\n\nA provision of the memo says non-essential employees who are unable to do their jobs from home are eligible to use up to 80 hours of paid administrative leave.\n\nEmployees eligible for the administrative leave are available for alternative assignments, including to support \"various activities around the state\u2019s COVID\u201019 response efforts,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe provision took effect March 25, 2020. Both non-essential employees and appointed employees are eligible for administrative leave, but those hired in response to the coronavirus pandemic are not. The memo says employees may use the money to cover normal work hours for those who are sick or deemed \"unable to telework\" by their supervisor.\n\nVidal said the policy allows employees who have not yet earned paid administrative leave benefits \"to access leave if they contracted COVID-19, needed to care for a family member with COVID-19 or due to the sudden closure of childcare facilities.\"\n\nShe emphasized that employees are required to use up all other leave options \u2014 such as paid vacation time \u2014 before being able to use this administrative leave.\n\nVidal added that 8 percent of eligible state employees are using the program -- or, about 2 percent of all state employees. These employees, she noted, are often custodians, facility repair workers and tour guides.\n\nBeyond that, hundreds of state employees have been temporarily reassigned to assist with the state\u2019s coronavirus response, according to Vidal. Some of the tasks include transporting testing supplies and becoming coronavirus contact tracers.\n\nWalker claimed there are state employees being paid to sit \"idle\" at home.\n\nAlthough there are state employees who are being compensated while unable to work due to coronavirus, there are stipulations that need to be met before a non-essential worker can qualify for paid administrative leave. What\u2019s more, some people in nonessential jobs and unable to work from home have been put on to other COVD-related tasks.\n\nOur definition of Half True is \"the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"", "lang": "en"}
