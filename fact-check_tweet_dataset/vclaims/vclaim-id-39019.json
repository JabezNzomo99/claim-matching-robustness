Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a lot riding on his appeal to blue-collar workers.\n\nSpeaking days ahead of the Michigan primary on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" Sanders said his opposition to major trade deals marked a sharp difference between him and Biden, the former Delaware senator and vice president.\n\n\"Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour, have resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs here in Michigan,\" Sanders said from Grand Rapids on March 8. \"I helped lead the effort, as you may recall, against these disastrous trade agreements. I worked with the unions, not with the CEOs of large corporations. On the other hand, Joe Biden strongly supported these agreements.\"\n\nWhile he voiced some reservations at the time, Biden voted for both bills \u2014 the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and normalization of trade with China in 2000.\n\nIn this fact-check, we look at whether the two agreements cost Michigan 160,000 jobs.\n\nTeasing out the impact of trade deals can be difficult. There\u2019s lots going on in the economy regardless of tariff agreements, including the 2008-09 financial crisis that plunged two of Detroit\u2019s hometown auto companies into bankruptcy. But overall, studies back up Sanders\u2019 claim.\n\nSanders\u2019 point hinges on trade with two countries, Mexico and China. But of the two, U.S. trade with China was much larger, and with that came a bigger impact.\n\nThe studies Sanders relied on estimated Michigan\u2019s job losses at nearly 44,000 (as of 2010) due to NAFTA, and about 112,000 due to China (as of 2018). We\u2019ll get to those estimates in just a bit, but add them together and you get 156,000, which is essentially Sanders\u2019 number.\n\nBut first, focusing just on China, the latest research by a group of economists from four universities offers a broad picture of what took place after 2000 when the United States gave it permanent normal trade status.\n\nThe group\u2019s study doesn\u2019t put a number to Michigan\u2019s losses, but it does highlight its struggles.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that the ultimate effect on jobs nationwide was neutral, neither a gain nor a loss.\n\nBut among regions of the country, the upheaval was substantial. Both the type of jobs and the location of jobs shifted.\n\n\"Chinese competition reallocated employment from manufacturing to services, and from the U.S. heartland to the coasts,\" the report said.\n\nA Midwest state like Michigan was on the losing end of the deal.\n\nThis research dug down to the level of individual companies and found that large multinational companies offshored manufacturing jobs and expanded service jobs, in areas such as research and management, in the U.S.\n\nThe study also found that the China effect disappeared after 2007.\n\n\"We find strong employment impacts from 2000 to 2007, but nothing since from 2008 to 2015,\" the authors wrote.\n\nSanders is correct that both NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China exposed Michigan to competition from factories that paid their workers much less and spent less on worker safety and environmental protection.\n\nBut the manufacturing employment numbers reveal one of the challenges to drawing quick conclusions on the impact of the two trade deals. The job numbers show different paths after passage of each trade agreement. (Passage of trade bills is marked in red.)\n\nAfter NAFTA, the number of manufacturing jobs rose to 888,000. After the China deal, the number fell to 638,000 (as of 2006 and before the Great Recession), a decline of 250,000 jobs.\n\nThe raw numbers support the idea that the China impact was great. For NAFTA, the analysis is more complicated.\n\nEconomist Susan Houseman at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said those rising manufacturing job numbers after NAFTA passed don\u2019t tell the whole story. She said the studies Sanders used are valid.\n\n\"The country was experiencing record job growth in the 1990s, so you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect the number of manufacturing jobs to fall,\" Houseman said. \"Rather you might expect for them to grow more slowly.\"\n\nThe fraction of all jobs that were in manufacturing did fall by one percentage point between 1993 and 2000, suggesting that NAFTA did more for sectors other than manufacturing.\n\nHouseman also said that the NAFTA impacts would play out over time, as companies built new plants in Mexico, something that could not happen overnight.\n\nThe analysis Sanders relied on came from economist Robert Scott at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nFor NAFTA, Scott took the rising U.S.-Mexico trade deficit and teased out how that translated into job effects at the state level. Between 1993 and 2010, and accounting for the Great Recession, Scott found a loss of 43,600 jobs in Michigan.\n\nHouseman said that is a conservative figure.\n\n\"The types of calculations in this, if anything, may understate job losses,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t believe there is any basis for calling the Sanders claim of job losses for Michigan wrong.\"\n\nThe primary caveat for Scott\u2019s estimate is that it\u2019s for 2010, which is a decade ago. Michigan\u2019s manufacturing sector has recovered a bit since then. However, for workers who lost their jobs during the first decade of the 2000s, the disruption was real. And even after rebounding, manufacturing remains well short of where it stood before NAFTA.\n\nMultiple studies also lend weight to Scott\u2019s overall findings of the impact on the Midwest from trade with China. Research by economists Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott at Yale University, suggests over 1 million jobs nationwide have been lost due to trade with China.\n\nSome economists argue that productivity gains played a major role in displacing manufacturing jobs, but recent work casts doubt on how productivity has been calculated. Studies of the impact of automation find that it has been significant, but much less than competition from China.\n\nThe latest studies go to great lengths to filter out the various factors that have shaped jobs in states like Michigan, and the trade deals emerge as a potent force.\n\nSanders said that NAFTA and normalized trade with China cost Michigan 160,000 jobs.\n\nThe studies he cited produced nearly that result. While precision is challenging, one economist said if anything, those studies underestimate the job loss due to trade.\n\nWe found four studies that concluded that both trade agreements hurt the manufacturing sector in Midwest states like Michigan.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
