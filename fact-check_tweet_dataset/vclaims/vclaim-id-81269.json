At this point, we don\u2019t know how many have actually paid their first month\u2019s premiums, but most analysts are assuming a rate of about 90 percent, which would be about 7.2 million. While the sign-up period has ended, people who have a change-of-life situation, such as a new child or a marriage, can still buy a new plan, so the year-end number is still a moving target. Charles Gaba, who closely tracks these numbers at ACAsignups.net, believes the number of paid enrollees is now about 7.7 million.\n\nAs we have explained before, the CBO estimate that formed the basis for Sebelius\u2019s earlier hope of 7 million sign-ups was a calendar-year estimate, not a prediction of how many people would be enrolled by March 31. Indeed, because of the stumbling start of HealthCare.gov, CBO lowered its prediction to 6 million.\n\nHere, Sebelius appears to be relying on an April report from HHS, which counted about 5 million new enrollees and about 1 million transferred from state programs for the poor. There\u2019s also another 2 million or so people who were previously eligible for Medicaid but never signed up; they came out of the \u201cwoodwork\u201d because of the publicity about Obamacare.\n\nExperts differ on whether they should be included or not, but Sebelius appears to have taken a conservative approach with this element of her calculation. There is no sign-up deadline for Medicaid, so that number has likely grown since April as well.\n\nThis is a two-year-old figure, based on a Health and Human Services Department estimate, and so it is a bit dubious. The Fact Checker dug into the more recent reports and found that it was based on a single quarterly figure that was not sustained in later quarters. At best, one could claim perhaps a gain of 2 million, but several analysts have raised serious questions about the methodology of the original report and suggest the actual figure could be lower than 1 million.\n\nThus Sebelius is on shaky ground here. The administration originally began citing this figure as way to claim some initial success with the law, but given that there are now millions of people actually enrolled in the exchanges, it\u2019s time to drop this iffy statistic.\n\nThis is the most controversial part of Sebelius\u2019s calculation. Off-market plans are sold directly by insurance brokers or insurance companies, meaning they generally do not qualify for Obamacare subsidies. (An insurance agent could help someone enroll on an exchange if they have proper certification.) But off-market plans do include the protections included in the law, such as guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions and a package of essential benefits.\n\nStill, CBO calculated that the number of off-exchange plans would drop from about 10 million to 5 million as people moved to buying insurance on the exchanges. So why should she tout a figure that was due to go down because of the law, especially because she said she was talking about people with \u201caffordable coverage\u201d?\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that is a valid point. \u201cIt certainly qualifies as more affordable coverage for people with preexisting conditions who were locked out of the market before or faced rate surcharges because of their health status,\u201d he said. \u201cFor others, the coverage likely offers better protection but may not be more affordable. So, it\u2019s a mixed picture for people in ACA-compliant plans off the exchanges.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 3: An article in the New England Journal of Medicine pegged the number at 20 million. The authors credited just one million for young adults, but included the five million for off-exchange plans. However, the authors do not explain why they count this as a gain when the CBO says the ACA will lead to a reduction in off-market plans.\n\nGiven that Sebelius is touting \u201caffordable coverage,\u201d she should stick to citing the figures for the central parts of Obamacare \u2014 insurance bought on the exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. Those are also relatively hard numbers, whereas the figures for the young adults and off-exchange plans are much fuzzier.", "lang": "en"}
