We caught it on tape: https://t.co/KYHrNfz8mC\n\nA white nationalist group called the National Policy Institute (NPI) held a conference in Washington, DC on 19 November 2016 billed as a \u201ccentral gathering point for alt-right writers, activists, and supporters.\u201d\n\nAmong the featured speakers was the president of the organization, Richard Spencer (the man credited with coining the euphemism \u201calt-right\u201c), who railed against what he called the \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse\u201d (German for \u201clying press,\u201d a term the Nazis used to defame critics), called Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election a \u201cvictory of will,\u201d and said the only option for white people is to \u201cconquer or die.\u201d\n\nOn 21 November, The Atlantic posted a three-minute video of excerpts from Spencer\u2019s speech, including a moment when he saluted Donald Trump with the words, \u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,\u201d which were echoed by the attendees, some of whom raised their arms and shouted \u201cHail Trump!\u201d in a Nazi-like fashion:\n\nThe New York Times reported that civil rights groups were quick to condemn the incident and urge President-elect Trump to disavow such groups and their white supremacist message:\n\nCivil rights groups called on President-elect Donald Trump on Monday to publicly condemn extremist movements that are espousing racism in his name after hundreds of white nationalist sympathizers spent the weekend in Washington debating ways to preserve white culture. Trump has been accused of fanning the flames of hate groups with his hard-line positions on immigration, his hesitance to denounce the former Klansman David Duke and his occasional promotion of white nationalist accounts on Twitter. While Trump has called for an end to hate crimes and said he wants to bring the country together, he has not been full throated on expressing disapproval of the alt-right, a rebranded white nationalist movement. \u201cWe would like him to stand up and denounce these folks,\u201d Heidi Beirich, who tracks hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s inexplicable. The longer it goes on, the more you have to wonder if it\u2019s not intentional.\u201d\n\nTo have a group like this convening steps away from the White House proclaiming that what happened two weeks ago was a great victory for them and their ideas, there is value for the president-elect stating clearly that these are not American values, that their ideology is in conflict with American ideals.\n\nEarly on in the 2016 presidential race, Trump pleaded ignorance of the existence of the alt-right movement, saying \u201cnobody even knows what it is.\u201d After the release of the video by The Atlantic, however, a Trump spokesperson issued a statement saying the President-elect unequivocally disavows the group:\n\nDonald Trump himself affirmed that disavowal on 22 November 2016. For Richard Spencer\u2019s part, NBC News reported that the NPI president later claimed his Trump salute was intended as \u201cironic\u201c:\n\nApart from trying to spin the incident as \u201cfun\u201d and \u201ca bit cheeky\u201d, Spencer made no attempt to deny or disavow what was shown in the video.", "lang": "en"}
