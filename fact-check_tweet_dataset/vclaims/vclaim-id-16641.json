Kennedy spoke before the Canadian Parliament, capping off his speech with a popular expression: \u201cAs the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke said, \u2018The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'\u201d\n\nHowever, this saying, which predates Kennedy\u2019s presidency and continues to be shared to this day, cannot be found in any of Burke\u2019s writings.\n\nAccording to the website Quote Investigator, the expression was attributed to Burke in the 14th edition of \u201cBartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations,\u201d erroneously citing a letter from 1795, but the book was later amended.\n\n\u201cEven though it is clear by now that Burke is unlikely to have made this observation, no one has ever been able to determine who did,\u201d Ralph Keyes, author of the book \u201cThe Quote Verifier,\u201d wrote on the subject.\n\nWhat Burke did say was, \u201cWhen bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\u201d Published in 1770, this may be the inspiration for the quotation that appears in the meme.\n\nThe saying bears closer resemblance to the words of English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who in the 1860s wrote, \u201cBad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.\u201d\n\nIsaac Kramnick, a professor emeritus at Cornell University who has studied Burke, told The Daily Caller in an email, \u201cI know the quote. I know it\u2019s attributed to Burke. But I know that I have never seen it in his oeuvre.\u201d\n\nJesse Norman, a member of the British Parliament who authored a book on the philosopher, told the Caller, \u201cAs far as I am aware Burke never said this.\u201d\n\nEtymologist Barry Popik has found attributions to Burke dating back to 1920.", "lang": "en"}
