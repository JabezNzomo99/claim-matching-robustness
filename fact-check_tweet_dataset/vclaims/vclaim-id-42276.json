During the rally, Modi launched an offensive against Kumar and his allies in Bihar, hours after sharing stage with him.\n\nWe found the same image being used in an article by the Indian Express, dating back to July 26, 2015.\n\nAnother article by LiveMint also used a similar photo, attributing it to an event in Bihar in 2015, in the caption.\n\nWe also found a video coverage of the July 2015 event at Bihar, where you can see Modi and Kumar sitting next to each other in the exact same setting as seen in the viral photo.\n\nIt is therefore certain that the photo has not been taken while paying tribute to the martyrs of the Pulwama attack.\n\nCoincidentally, Modi was in Bihar on February 17 and was joined by Kumar while inaugurating development projects at Barauni in Begusarai district. Modi also paid tribute to the two CRPF jawans from Bihar who lost their lives during the Pulwama attack.\n\nActivist Kavita Krishnan, who had previously tweeted the older picture of Modi and Kumar, defended her actions by claiming that a new photo of the duo has emerged from Sunday, where they are seen sharing a laugh, just like our previous photo which has been debunked.\n\nWhile further investigating her tweet, we found that Modi and Kumar did in fact 'exchange inappropriate laughter' on Sunday, according to another PTI photo used by Scroll in an article on Modi's itinerary in Bihar from February 17.\n\nOn February 14, 2019, a car bomber attacked a Central Police Reserve Force (CRPF) convoy near Pulwama, Jammu & Kashmir, claiming the life of 40 jawans.\n\nFollowing this tragic event, social media was filled with fake news claiming to provide information on the attack.\n\nTo check out the other fake news being circulated around the Pulwama attack, click here.", "lang": "en"}
