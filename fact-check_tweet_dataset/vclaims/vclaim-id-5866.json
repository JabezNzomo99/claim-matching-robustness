This typo has been corrected in paragraph 9.\n\nUpdate August 24, 2020: Updating paragraph six to include statement from the National Park Service.\n\nSocial media users have been sharing content claiming that scientists discovered that the Devil\u2019s Tower butte in Wyoming is originally a giant tree after finding \u201can incredibly large petrified root system\u201d underneath it. This claim is false.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cDEVILS TOWER US...ORIGINALLY A GIANT TREE. Scientists from the Wyoming State Parks Department were conducting photographic seismic readings below the tower, when they discovered an incredibly large petrified root system below the tower. The parks department released a statement saying, \"We have discovered, what looks like a giant root system stemming from the base of The Devils Tower. The root system has been measured at 4 miles deep by 7 miles wide.\u201d ( here )\n\nReuters could not find a statement like this from the Wyoming State Parks Department. A Google search of the quote does not reveal anything except for posts by blogs and meme pages.\n\nThe tower is made up of a rare igneous rock called phonolite porphyry. Geologists do not fully know how it formed and there are different theories on details here .\n\nNicholos Myers, Supervisory Park Ranger for the Devils Tower National Monument and part of the National Park Service (NPS) confirmed to Reuters via email that this claim is false. He said, \u201cthere is no evidence to support such a theory as a tree stump or petrified tree roots,\u201d and directed people to an NPS list of formation theories, here .\n\nKGAB AM 650, a local radio station, published an article in August 2017 called \u201cHelp spread Wyoming\u2019s new myth.\u201d ( here ) The article urges locals to spread a myth about Devil\u2019s Tower: \u201cYou've heard of petrified wood, right? Well, that is what you are looking at when you see the mighty Devil's Tower, here in Wyoming. That's right, it was once a giant tree. Look again. Doesn't that look like a huge tree stump to you? Sure it does.\u201d\n\nThe article cites a Facebook post by \u201cCasper Planet\u201d, who originally started the myth in July 2017 ( here ). The \u201cabout\u201d section of the page explains: \u201cDelivering the Snews that doesn\u2019t matter directly to your Snews feed. satire, humor, and opinion, names/locations are made up.\u201d\n\nCasper Planet\u2019s post cites www.infinitysnews.com, which does not exist. The image purportedly showing \u201cthe roots\u201d of the tower actually shows the root system of sweet corn at 8 weeks ( here ).\n\nFalse. Claim about Devil\u2019s Tower being a tree originated from a satire account.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
