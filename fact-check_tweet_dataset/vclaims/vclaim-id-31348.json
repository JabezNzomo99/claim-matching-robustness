(The value of what is currently spent on welfare depends on what you count in that category, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says spending on welfare is currently around \u00a3224 billion a year\u2014\u00a398 billion for non-pensioners and \u00a3126 billion for pensioners).\n\nThe Express\u2019 claim is misleading, because most of the supposed spending is based on the assumption that Labour introduces a basic income at a specific level. Labour have pledged to trial a basic income in certain areas, but not specified the level at which this will be or their intention to roll the scheme out nationally .\n\nEven if we ignore this factor, neither the Express nor the Conservatives have published any further details on this analysis, so we can\u2019t say how accurate their sums are overall. Analysis like this should be published in full so that anyone can check where it\u2019s from and how it\u2019s calculated. We can take a look at some of the elements of spending the report mentions though.\n\nWhere does all this money come from?\n\nMost of the supposed spending (\u00a3504 billion of the total \u00a3520 billion) comes from the cost of delivering a universal basic income. This, as the name suggests, is the idea to give every citizen, regardless of their wealth or income, a regular basic income from the state.\n\nHowever, there is no indication that Labour Party policy is to immediately introduce a basic income for all. Labour suggested it plans to trial basic income if it gets into government. We don\u2019t know how many people would be involved, or the level of basic income they would receive.\n\nIf we look beyond that issue, we can ask how accurate the Express\u2019 claim is that rolling out a universal basic income across the country would cost \u00a3504 billion.\n\nThe problem is that we don\u2019t know at what level a basic income might be set, so it\u2019s impossible to estimate its total cost.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Labour, the Conservatives and the Express for more information about how the figures in the article were calculated.\n\nThe cost of delivering a universal basic income could vary considerably depending on who is eligible and what level it is set at (and linked to this, whether it will constitute a total replacement for other types of benefits or supplement them).\n\nIf you ignore any cost of actually administering the scheme, \u00a3504 billion is the equivalent of providing a universal basic income of around \u00a39,600 a year to each adult aged 18 or over in the UK.\n\nThat\u2019s not an unreasonable estimate of the costs of a basic income. For example, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says a universal basic income should provide a basic standard of living for everyone, and so makes estimates based on the poverty threshold in each country.\n\nIn the UK the ILO says that threshold is \u00a38,800 per year for an adult, so not that far below the \u00a39,600.\n\nBut a universal basic income could also be far less generous and so far less costly.\n\nThere are other issues with the \u00a3520 billion figure\n\nOn top of the \u00a3504 billion the Express adds the cost of various policies proposed by Labour to get to a total of \u00a3520 billion.\n\nFor example, it says the cost of scrapping plans to raise the retirement age to 67 (as pledged in Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto) would cost \u00a39.9 billion according to \u201cfinancial experts\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve not been able to find the figure and the Express haven\u2019t told us their source. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the case that the cost of this would be in addition to any universal basic income that was introduced.\n\nA basic income could possibly remove the need to have the existing benefits system, including state pensions.", "lang": "en"}
