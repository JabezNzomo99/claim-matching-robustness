The tweet garnered more than 300 retweets and over 1000 likes so far. An identical post was also shared by the Facebook page of West Bengal Congress. The archived version of the tweet can be accessed here.\n\nVaidehi Sachin, an individual Twitter user who claims to be the editor-in-chief of a tabloid newspaper Afternoon Voice had earlier posted photographs of the bridge with the identical claim.\n\nAlt News found that a bridge located on the Jamnagar-Junagadh highway near Satudad village of Jam Kandorna tehsil of Rajkot district, Gujarat had collapsed on June 19. One of the images shared on social media was published in Gujarati news article titled, \u201cA bridge on Jamnagar-Junagadh highway collapses, see pics (translated)\u201d.\n\nIn conversation with Alt News, Jitendra Singh Jadeja, the sarpanch of Satudad village, said that the bridge was more than 50 years old and was not inaugurated by PM Modi. Moreover, Digubha Jadeja, a resident of Satudad village and a member of the Jam Kandorna Taluka Panchayat, said, \u201cI am 46-year-old right now. I don\u2019t remember the time when the bridge was built that means it\u2019s older than me.\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted GV Joshi, the executive engineer at Road and Buildings department in Rajkot to confirm the approximate time of construction. He said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not all true. The bridge was built at least 45 years ago. It is also not true that the bridge was inaugurated by PM Modi.\u201d\n\nBy speaking with locals in Satudad village, Alt News was able to trace the location of the bridge on Google Maps. Looking at the historical satellite imagery, we could independently verify that the bridge existed at least since 2009. Thus, the claim that the bridge was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi three months ago is false. In the image below, an intact bridge indicated by the pin can be seen in the 2009 imagery.\n\nWest Bengal Congress tweeted images of a collapsed bridge in Gujarat falsely claiming that it was inaugurated by PM Modi three months ago.", "lang": "en"}
