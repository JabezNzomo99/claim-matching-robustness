By every metric available, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s claim that the Baltics failed is false.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "September 02, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-36085", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-ww2-baltics-democracy/30142634.html", "vclaim": "On the eve of the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War on September 1, 1939, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry tweeted out an extract from a joint report titled \"The Heritage of WWII in the Baltic States\".\n\nThat extract read: \u201cIn the early 90s the Baltic nations gained their national independence. This event raised hopes & aspirations the Baltic Soviet Republics would turn into modern democratic & rule-of-law states, which, unfortunately, never came true.\u201d\n\nExperts, former politicians and diplomats strongly contest the Russian Foreign ministry\u2019s assertion.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s claim that the Baltic nations never turned into modern, democratic and rule-of-law states is patently false. It is ridiculous that anyone in the Russian Foreign Ministry would claim that,\u201d Matthew Bryza, former U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan told Polygraph.info.\n\nBryza, who was previously director of the International Center for Defense and Security, a Tallinn-based think tank, said that Estonia \u201cis one of the most dynamic, modern, rule-of-law countries in all of the European Union.\u201d\n\nFormer Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves mirrored that sentiment, telling Polygraph.info Estonia is \u201cby far the least corrupt post-communist country.\u201d\n\nIlves said the Russian Foreign Ministry was merely \u201crehashing\u201d the same baseless arguments Russia has been making for 28 years, adding the Baltic states \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u2019 have been admitted to NATO or the EU if [Russia\u2019s claims] had any merit.\u201d\n\nIlves was referring to the so-called Copenhagen criteria, which determine who is eligible to join the European Union, and criteria for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization Membership Action Plan.\n\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined the EU and NATO in 2004.\n\nThe EU requires that any potential member have \u201cstable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.\u201d\n\nNATO only invites aspiring members that have, among other things, \u201cbuilt a democratic system of governance and a market economy.\u201d\n\nAliide Naylor, a writer-in-residence at the Latvia-based International Writers' and Translators' House and the author of the book \u201cThe Shadow in the East: Vladimir Putin and the New Baltic Front,\u201d likewise called the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s claim \u201cuntrue and wildly hypocritical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe three Baltic nations have varying degrees of democracy, \u2018modernity\u2019, freedom, and corruption,\u201d Naylor told Polygraph.info. \u201cBut according to the 2019 [Freedom House] Freedom in the World report, Estonia ranks at 94/100 \u2013 a better score than both the U.S. and the U.K. [Latvia was ranked 87 out of 100 and Lithuania 91 out of 100, with 100 meaning most free]. Like any other nation, they still struggle with imperfect political processes, but to say they never turned into modern and democratic states is silly.\u201d\n\nMany international organizations have made similar assessment of the Baltic nations\u2019 democratic bona fides.\n\nFreedom House, a U.S. government-funded think tank that conducts research and advocacy on democracy and related issues, counted Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia among \u201cconsolidated democracies\u201d in its 2018 Nations in Transit 2018 report.\n\nThat report, which tracked the progress of the former Soviet states, found that 19 of the 29 countries had declines in their overall democracy scores.\n\nFreedom House called Estonia one of \u201cthree bright spots,\u201d and raised Estonia\u2019s National Democratic Governance rating from 2.25 to 2.00 (1 \u2013 most democratic, 7 \u2013 least democratic), citing its \u201cdemonstrated resilience and impartiality of national institutions, as well as respect for institutions by all major stakeholders, after the change of government in November 2016.\u201d\n\nLatvia, which Freedom House found to have \u201ccontinued on its path to becoming a stable north European democracy,\u201d did see its Civil Society score drop, in part because of the rise of illiberal groups. Freedom House also lowered Lithuania\u2019s Civil Society rating, calling corruption the biggest threat to democracy there.\n\nThe German-based Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation\u2019s Transformation Index (BTI), which analyzes and evaluates successes and setbacks on the path toward a democracy based on the rule of law and a socially responsible market economy, found all three Baltic states to be democracies in consolidation.\n\nThe BTI ranked Latvia eighth out of 129 countries analyzed for its quality of democracy, market economy and political management, noting that the Baltic country has \u201cfree and fair parliamentary and local elections.\u201d\n\nThe BTI ranked Lithuania in fourth place, saying it has \u201cno constraints on free and fair elections,\u201d while Estonia took the top spot.\n\n\u201cElections in Estonia are free, fair and meaningful in the sense of determining public policies and filling political positions,\u201d the BTI found.\n\nIn terms of the media environment, the press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Estonia 11th its 2019 World Press Freedom Index, while Latvia came in 24th and Lithuania placed 30th. RSF\u2019s annual reports cover 180 countries.\n\n\u201cEstonia has a freer press than the U.K. and Germany, according to RSF (although in the present more \u2018far-right\u2019 climate with [the Conservative People's Party of Estonia] in government, some outspoken liberal journalists may challenge this perceived notion of free press), Naylor said. \u201cLatvia and Lithuania are also doing better than the U.S. and U.K. in terms of press freedom, by these measures.\u201d\n\nRSF ranked Germany 13th in terms of press freedom, France 32nd, the U.K. 33rd and the U.S. 48th. It ranked Russia 149th.\n\nThe Berlin-based anti-corruption NGO Transparency International (TI) compiles a Corruption Perception Index that ranks countries on a scale of 0-100 (0 being maximally corrupt and 100 being maximally clean). On its 2018 Corruption Perception Index, Latvia scored 58, Lithuania 59 and Estonia 73 \u2013 respectively, 41st, 38th and 18th out of 180 countries.\n\nTI gave Russia a score of 28, putting it in 138th place globally.\n\nVaidas Sald\u017ei\u016bnas, a Lithuanian journalist who writes extensively on defense and security-related issues, told Polygraph.info that even less positive assessments still painted the Baltic states in a mostly positive light.\n\n\u201cWhat comes to my mind first, based on such criteria, is the (Economist Intelligence Unit) Democracy Index 2018. There Estonia is 23rd, Lithuania 36th, Latvia \u2013 38,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit describes the Baltic states as \u201cflawed democracies.\u201d\n\nSald\u017ei\u016bnas said that while those less-than-perfect scores are \u201cprobably not enough\u201d for critics, they aren\u2019t really \u201cnews\u201d given that all states have flaws: \u201cGreece, the birthplace of democracy is behind, the Unites States isn't on the top, yet we are still ahead of 130-plus countries. But when the critique comes from Russia, which is not a beacon of democracy and rule of law (144, behind Kazakhstan and Afghanistan), that says a lot. The international community in various statements recognize [the] Baltic nations as modern, democratic, rule-of-law-based states, which allows for membership in various international organizations.\u201d\n\nDalia Bankauskait\u0117, a lecturer with Vilnius University\u2019s Faculty of Communication, told Polygraph.info that it is widely believed Russia resents having lost control of its neighbors. This, she said, best explains Moscow\u2019s attitude towards the Baltics.\n\n\u201cI would like to quote what a young Lithuanian said during one of our discussions,\u201d Bankauskait\u0117 said. \u201c\u2018Why can\u2019t the Kremlin leave us alone? The divorce happened long, long ago. We live our life \u2026 Mind your own country\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnalysts argue the answer to that question is connected to the current Russian regime\u2019s survival strategy.\n\nBryza said President Vladimir Putin is \u201cobsessed with extinguishing any movement towards democracy and rule-based politics in Russia that could threaten his own rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny Russian who has visited the Baltics knows how much more advanced those Baltic countries are compared with Russia on developing democracy and the rule of law,\u201d Bryza said. \u201cSo I think President Putin is trying to discredit the historical record of success of the Baltic countries to protect himself.\u201d\n\nIlves said that the Kremlin, which has no ideology apart from the \u201cideology of expediency,\u201d is simply trying to amplify the message that it does not want to follow the \u201cfake rules of Western liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nIlves argues the Baltic states\u2019 post-Soviet transformation \u201cundermines the fundamental lie of the Kremlin\u201d that countries can become liberal, democratic and rule-of-law based nations after exiting Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nSald\u017ei\u016bnas believes the Baltic states\u2019 success undermines \u201cthe core of the Kremlin lie\u201d that they cannot survive without Russia.\n\n\u201cWhen you say that the Baltic states will fail without Russia (those were actual slogans in late Eighties and early Nineties) and now the facts are proving you wrong (GDP, income, democracy, freedom indexes, etc.), it's bad for your own image. So what do you do? You don't let the facts spoil a good propaganda piece,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Sald\u017ei\u016bnas, this leaves Russia in the position of having to soothe its domestic audience with these falsehoods, given that Russia itself \u201chas failed in democracy and has but a fa\u00e7ade of it, just like [it has a fa\u00e7ade of] the rule of law.\u201d\n\nNaylor said she thinks many Russians assume that every country functions like their own, adding that Moscow\u2019s claim that it is the Baltic states, and not Russia, which have failed to turn into modern, democratic, and rule-of-law states, \u201ccould be a form of projection at play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere could also be envy at the comparative progress, or resentment about the role they [the Baltic states] played in the Soviet collapse,\u201d she said.\n\nBankauskait\u0117 likewise says that by portraying the Baltic states as \u201cfailing states,\u201d the Russian government seeks to make Russians believe that it\u2019s not worth emulating their example and nothing good came from the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s disinformation never speaks about Russia, it always talks about others in a negative way \u2026 I have never seen/read/heard pro-Kremlin media or Kremlin institutions talk positively about Russian civic initiatives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRussia and the Kremlin should never be confused,\u201d Bankauskait\u0117 added. \u201cRussian society itself is a victim of Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
