We should not be restless and go out unnecessarily,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, 1402 new cases and 41 deaths were reported in the city, bringing the overall number of cases and the death toll to 74252 and 4284, respectively. The city continues to be the biggest contributor to rising cases in Maharashtra - the worst affected state with over 1.5 lakh confirmed cases.\n\nOn May 31, the Maharashtra government announced \"Mission Begin Again\", to slowly lift restrictions on movement in a phased manner throughout the month of June. The first two weeks of June saw the reopening of public spaces for outdoor physical activities, opening of shops and market places with social distancing norms and also that of private offices with limited employee attendance.\n\nAlso Read: Photo Of Large Crowd At Marine Drive After Unlock 1.0 Is Not Morphed\n\nParlours and salons falling outside of containment zones opened up with increased safety guidelines on Sunday, after more than three months of closure.
