The PM tweeted, \u201cIndian police\u2019s pogrom against Muslims in UP.\u201d But later took down the clip.\n\nThe same video was shared by several other users as people being dragged out of their homes after NRC was implemented in Assam.\n\nImran Khan shared another video while raising similar allegation and later took it down. He wrote, \u201cIndian police attacking Muslims as part of Modi\u2019s ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThe same clip has been linked with the incident in Muzaffarnagar where a Muslim cleric Maulana Syed Raza Hussaini and several students were allegedly dragged out of Sadaat hostel and brutally thrashed by UP police. The claim reads, \u201cMaulana Syed Raza Hussaini ..Age 82 years ..Muzaffarnagar Resident .. (UP) UPDATE: The police dragged the children into a madrassa and brutally assaulted them, shouting, \u201cYou don\u2019t need citizenship!\u201d#IndiaAgainstCAA_NRC\u201c\n\nA close look at the video reveals that the cops have \u2018RAB\u2019 (Rapid Action Battalion) imprinted on their uniforms. RAB is the anti-crime and anti-terrorism unit of the Bangladesh police.\n\nA keyword search on YouTube led us to the same video uploaded on June 2014 described as, \u201c5 May 2013 RAB & Police killing metion in Bangladesh.\u201d\n\nAccording to a May 6, 2013 report in BBC, \u201cAt least 27 people have been killed and dozens hurt after police and Islamist protesters clashed in Bangladesh. Police used stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse a Sunday protest organised by the group Hefazat-e Islam in the capital Dhaka.\u201d The protest was to call for stronger Islamic policies.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Channel 4 News.\n\nOne of the frames from the Al Jazeera video matches with a frame in the viral video.\n\nVIDEO 2: OLD VIDEO OF FARMERS PROTEST IN UNNAO, UP\n\nThe same video was tweeted by UP State Convenor, IT Cell, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Aeshwarya rah Singh on November 17, 2019.\n\nHe claimed that the video shows farmers protest in Unnao. Based on this, a YouTube search led us to a broadcast by Nyoooz UP. The same visuals can be spotted 1:30 minutes onward.\n\nAccording to a November 17 report in India Today, the farmers were protesting \u201cfor higher compensation for the land acquired for a proposed township set ablaze a crusher plant and some plastic pipes in the open field near a power sub-station.\u201d It further added, \u201cAccording to reports, the land in question had been acquired in 2012 but protests by farmers stalled the projects for the following years. A team of UPSIDC employees tried to start work on the project on Saturday and the farmers turned violent. The farmers pelted stones at the JCB machines and UPSIDC chief engineer Sandeep Chauhan was targeted.\u201d\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan therefore shared a video from Bangladesh and a clip depicting clashes between farmers and police in Unnao as \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 of Muslims in India.", "lang": "en"}
