We found an article from August 2010 about the temple on a website called ISKCONNews which carried this photo.\n\nWe also found the same photo in another article about the temple as well as on Pinterest. Further, we checked photos of the Mayapur ISKCON temple, known as the \u2018Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir - Temple of the Vedic Planetarium\u2019 and found that the recent photos of the structure and other recent renditions bear striking resemblance to the viral photo, with only a difference in the colour of the domes.\n\nThe Quint got in touch with a source at ISKCON who confirmed that the viral photo was indeed a photo of the proposed Mayapur temple. With regard to the difference in appearance of the domes, we were told that ISKCON had first thought of yellow but finding those stones in such quantity was a huge challenge and had therefore, chosen to change to blue marble, but everything else was the same. We found news reports which said that the Mayapur temple is being hailed as the largest temple in the world and while it has opened its doors to the public in February 2020, the final construction will only be completed by 2022.", "lang": "en"}
