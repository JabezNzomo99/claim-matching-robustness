No, that's not true: The headline is misleading. As the video of the former vice president shows, Biden said, \"Super Thur---\" but stopped and corrected himself to say, \"Super Tuesday.\" The article noted that Biden did not say the full word, but the headline did not correctly reflect the accurate quote.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Real Clear Politics on March 2, 2020, titled 'Biden In Texas Ahead Of Super Tuesday: \"Tomorrow Is Super Thursday'\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nFormer VP Joe Biden made an amusing slip of the tongue during a campaign rally on the Monday before Super Tuesday in Houston Texas. \"Look, tomorrow is Super Thursd-- Tuesday,\" Biden said, noticing his mistake before he fully made it. \"I tell you, I'm rushing to head on.\" At the same rally, Biden also referred to the opening line of the Declaration of Independence as \"the thing\" after failing to articulate the entire quote.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe article linked to a tweet that showed Biden at a campaign rally in Houston, Texas, on March 2, 2020. A video clip embedded in the tweet showed Biden saying, \"Look, tomorrow is Super Thur--\" before he corrected the mistake and said, \"Tuesday.\"\n\nEven so, the headline for the article is misleading because it claimed Biden said, \"Super Thursday,\" which he did not.\n\nAt his own campaign rally in North Carolina on Monday, President Trump chastised Biden for his gaffes. Trump said:\n\nTomorrow, voters in states across the nation for Super Tuesday -- not Super Thursday. Oh, he said Super Thursday! You can't do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? I would be over, right? I would be over.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes realclearpolitics.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site can generally be trusted to maintain journalistic standards.
