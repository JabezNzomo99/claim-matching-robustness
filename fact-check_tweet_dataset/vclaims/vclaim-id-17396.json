He didn\u2019t. The citizenship question in 2010 was handled the same way it had been since 1970. \n\n\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s fight to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census was lost in June when the Supreme Court ruled that the administration had concealed the reason it sought to add the question. The majority ruled that the administration gave a \u201ccontrived,\u201d rather than \u201cgenuine,\u201d justification for the question, and thus barred it from being included in the decennial census.\n\nThe issue, though, is still being debated and an error has been widely introduced into that debate on social media. Several different memes are circulating online based on the false claim that former President Barack Obama removed the citizenship question from the 2010 census.\n\nOne popular version of the claim is from Charlie Kirk, founder of the young conservative group Turning Point USA. His tweet has been liked more than 75,000 times and turned into a meme on Facebook. Kirk wrote: \u201cIf Barack Obama was able to remove the Citizenship Question from the census in 2010 without Supreme Court approval Why does President Trump need their approval to put it back on?\u201d\n\nBut Obama didn\u2019t remove the citizenship question from the census.\n\nExplaining how the misconception developed requires some background.\n\nStarting at the beginning, the Constitution mandates that the U.S. population be counted every 10 years in order to determine the number of representatives each state should have and to distribute federal funds. The next decennial census is in 2020.\n\nAs the country\u2019s population grew, the complexity of the census also grew. In 1940, the Census Bureau, for the first time, used sampling as a way to get more detailed information about the population without overburdening all residents with too many questions. That year it sent additional questions to just 5 percent of the population and used statistical techniques to broaden the results. By 1970, the bureau was sending out a short-form questionnaire to every U.S. household and a long-form supplement with more detailed questions to a fraction of U.S. households.\n\nIn 1997, the bureau outlined a plan to eliminate the long-form questionnaire after 2000 and replace it with the American Community Survey, which would be sent out to a small sample of households every year instead of once every 10 years. In 2005, the bureau started using that survey \u2014 which U.S. residents are required by law to answer, just as they are required to answer the census.\n\nThat background is important for understanding where the citizenship questions have been asked.\n\nHere\u2019s how it has been handled since 1820, the first year that a citizenship question was included:\n\u2022 1820 \u2014 The country\u2019s fourth census asked this question of each household in the U.S.: \u201cNumber of foreigners not naturalized.\u201d The following census in 1830 included a variation on that question.\n\u2022 1840 \u2014 The citizenship question wasn\u2019t asked this year. It wasn\u2019t included in 1850 or 1860, either, although those questionnaires did ask about a person\u2019s \u201cplace of birth,\u201d a question that the government would continue to ask, in some form, through today.\n\u2022 1870 \u2014 The first census following the Civil War asked two specific citizenship questions: \u201cIs the person a male citizen of the United States of 21 years or upwards?\u201d and \u201cIs the person a male citizen of the United States of 21 years or upwards whose right to vote is denied or abridged on grounds other than \u2018rebellion or other crime?'\u201d\n\u2022 1880 \u2014 The census did not include any citizenship questions.\n\u2022 1890 \u2014 The citizenship question returned this year, asking: \u201cIs the person naturalized?\u201d That question remained in the next four questionnaires, adding the phrase in 1910, 1920 1930.\n\u2022 1940 \u2014 The census included this question: \u201cIf foreign born, is the person a citizen?\u201d The 1950 census included the same question.\n\u2022 1960 \u2014 This census did not include a citizenship question.\n\u2022 1970 \u2014 The short-form questionnaire sent to every household did not include a citizenship question, but the supplemental long-form questionnaire sent to some households asked: \u201cFor persons born in a foreign country- Is the person naturalized?\u201d The 1980 census handled the question in a similar manner.\n\u2022 1990 \u2014 The short-form questionnaire sent to every household again did not ask about citizenship, but the long form sent to some households asked: \u201cIs this person a citizen of the United States?\u201d The same was true for the 2000 census.\n\u2022 2005 \u2014 The first American Community Survey was sent out with this question: \u201cIs this person a citizen of the United States?\u201d\n\u2022 2010 \u2014 The decennial census sent to every U.S. household did not include a citizenship question, like all of the short-form questionnaires since 1960. The American Community Survey, which had replaced the long-form census, included the same citizenship question as it did in 2005 and continues to today.\n\nAs the timeline shows, Obama did not remove the citizenship question from the census.\n\nPlans to replace the long-form questionnaire with the American Community Survey were underway during the Clinton administration and the shift happened during the Bush administration. The 2010 census that occurred during the Obama administration handled the citizenship question the same way it had been since 1970; there was no citizenship question on the short-form questionnaire sent to every U.S. household, but a citizenship question was asked on the supplemental form sent out to a smaller sample of households.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
