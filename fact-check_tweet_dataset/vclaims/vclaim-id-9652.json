While it is true that Sarkozy was recently interrogated by anti-corruption investigators about illegal campaign contributions coming from the Libyan leader the part about claiming ignorance and only wanting to help is totally made up and not true.\n\nThat story originated on satirical website Le Journal Du Nord (aka nordpresse.be) in an article published on March 21, 2018 titled \"Sarkozy: \"Je ne savais pas que c'\u00e9tait un dictateur, j'ai pris les 50 millions pour rendre service\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe former president and best bullet-dodger since Neo in the Matrix, said today to investigators of the anti-corruption prosecutor's office that he did not know that Muammar Gaddafi was a dictator and that he had \"taken the 50 million to be of service \". Persuaded that the money was clean and sourced from his supporters, Nicolas Sarkozy explained all morning that he had not seen anything coming and that he had learned with dread in 2011 that Gaddafi was a bad thing when he was enjoying a schnitzel sandwich in front of the television.\n\nAs the Washington Post indeed reported:\n\nPARIS-- A panel of French judges placed former President Nicolas Sarkozy under formal investigation late Wednesday for allegedly accepting bribes and illegal campaign financing, and misappropriating Libyan public funds. The decision came after years of allegations that Sarkozy relied on a multimillion euro donation from the government of Moammar Gaddafi to finance his successful 2007 presidential run.\n\nBut the satirical article was probably meant to echo a different case stirring public opinion in France. The phrase \"pour rendre service\" (\"to help out\") was also used by the grandmother of Laeticia Halliday, widow of the deceased French pop-star Johnny Halliday, when she had to explain why she was the owner (on paper) of several companies that managed the rights to the singer's music and images.\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".", "lang": "en"}
