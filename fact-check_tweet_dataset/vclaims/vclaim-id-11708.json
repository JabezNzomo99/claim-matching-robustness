People taking the recourse of untruth speak different things at different places.-translated)\u201d tweeted former Union Minster Pawan Kumar Bansal on Tuesday. Along with this tweet an image of a purported newspaper cutting was also attached. The newspaper has ascribed a statement to BJP chief Amit Shah which calls the Baniya community \u2018thieves\u2019 and accuses them of profiteering.\n\nOn December 10, Alt News had debunked the viral fake newspaper clip. It was found that no mainstream media outlet had reported the statement. Hence, it is unlikely that such a statement coming from the BJP chief calling members of the Baniya community \u2018cheaters\u2019 and \u2018thieves\u2019 would have gone unreported.\n\nTo corroborate, we looked at the news reports and the video of Amit Shah\u2019s rally in Bundi, Rajasthan on December 3. Alt News found that Shah had not uttered the statements attributed to him in the fake newspaper clip.\n\nIn a sub-section of the same article, it was falsely claimed that Amit Shah said that \u201cthese businessmen\u201d will be replaced in retail and wholesale markets with big investment. The concluding paragraph also fabricated a lie that Prime Minister Modi had compared businessmen and the Baniya community with \u201cthieves\u201d.\n\nIn the past as well, Alt News has debunked several instances where misinformation is circulated on social media in the form of fake newspaper clips to provide credibility.", "lang": "en"}
