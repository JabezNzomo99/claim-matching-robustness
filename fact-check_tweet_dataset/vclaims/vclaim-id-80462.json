The PMO further said issues to do with fake news should only be addressed by the Press Council of India (PCI).\n\nOn Monday evening, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting headed by Smriti Irani had issued a circular calling for suspension of any PIB accredited journalist or news agency upon receiving any complaints for disseminating fake news. For determining if the news is fake or not, the case will be referred to the Press Council of India (PCI) in case of print media and to News Broadcasters Association (NBA) in case of electronic media.\n\nThe circular came as a shock to journalists with several senior journalists, editors and owners tweeting against the necessity of it with many expressing fear that this could amount to harassment.\n\nAfter the release of the circular and strong reactions from journalists, MIB minister Smriti Irani tweeted that it was open to suggestions.\n\nWhile the circular now stands withdrawn, there is no clarity yet if Irani acted on her own without consulting the PM Narendra Modi. Any move to regulate the media is always looked with suspicion and hence surprising that the I&B Minister did not anticipate a backlash from the industry.\n\nBut there are others who now hope that the botched plan by the government would at least help the media to introspect on their own approach to the issue.", "lang": "en"}
