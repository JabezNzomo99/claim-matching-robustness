One of these accounts is an unverified and unofficial page of a branch of the Youth Congress in Karnataka.\n\nAn archived version of this tweet can be found here. Two other accounts posted these too.\n\nOn further checking, these numbers resembled a graphic posted on the Facebook page, 'Final War Against Corruption' on February 18, 2019 and carries its watermark (FWAC).\n\nThe picture in the post was then picked up by a Facebook fan page of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\n\nAn archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nThe posts claim that in the period between 2009-2014 under the UPA-II regime, fewer number of ceasefire violations by Pakistan have taken place. There were fewer terror attacks, lesser casualties of security forces and civilians when compared to the 2014 - 2019, the period under the Modi-led NDA government. The post further cites the South Asian Terrorism Portal (the Facebook posts) and Central Information Commission (tweets) as its respective data sources.\n\nBoth of these Facebook pages have followings of more than five lakh users each.\n\nFact Check: 3 Reasons Why These Posts Are Peddling Fake Figures\n\nReason 1: These Numbers Have Been Picked Up From Unrelated Sources\n\nThe ceasefire agreement (CFA) violation numbers from the post are incorrect and have actually been reported in the context of a traffic police drive in the town of Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nOn the February 7, 2019, Jammu & Kashmir Police conducted a traffic drive in Kishtwar, resulting in:\n\nAs reported in the Daily Excelsior:\n\nThis has also been reported in a daily called Greater Jammu\n\nBOOM has reached out to the Jammu and Kashmir Police on the drive and are still to hear from them.\n\nReason 2: The Central Information Commission Does Not Maintain Terrorism Data\n\nThe posts cite the Central Information Commission (CIC) as the public authority from where these numbers have been sourced.\n\nHowever, the CIC (or any of the State Information Commissions) are not tasked with maintaining these records. Data on terrorism and ceasefire agreement violations is officially available with the Ministry of Home Affairs, and is also independently recorded by the SATP.\n\nThe Information Commissions are bodies established by the Right To Information (RTI) Act, 2015. Chapter 5 of the RTI Act lays out the powers and functions of the information commissions at the Union and State level.\n\nTo redress such grievances the information commissions has the mandate to summon required persons, receive testimonies and access documents from any court or office.\n\nThe RTI Act, 2005 can be found here on the official website of the Right to Information (rti.gov.in).\n\nWe are providing data from two sources to show that the numbers in these this post is incorrect:\n\u2022 The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India\n\nOfficial data does not in any way concur with the statistics provided in the post.\n\nIncidents of violence are reported only after 2014, and is not included in the historical time series dataset that the SATP maintains since 1994. We have provided data of incidents of violence as provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs after this section.\n\u2022 From 2009 - 2013, 2,463 civilians and 1,328 security forces were killed - a far cry from the figures of 12 civilians and 139 security forces killed during the UPA-II as claimed by the social media posts.\n\u2022 From 2014 - 2019, 1,227 civilians and 851 security forces were killed - again disproving the post stating 210 civilians and the 483 security forces were killed during the NDA.\n\nThe SATP also shares data on the ceasefire violation - implying cross border firing - across the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB).\n\nThe SATP has sourced these figures from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha answers and a statement given to the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly.\n\nWhile the numbers in the posts shared above are not correct, the data does show that there have been more CFA violations under the NDA than under the UPA.\n\nA weekly volume of the SATP's South Asian Intelligence Review (Volume 17, No. 34) as on February 18, 2019, states that recent CFA violations have been amongst the highest in 15 years.\n\nFrom the data, we can conclude:\n\u2022 During 2009 - 2013, 628 CFA violations have taken place during the UPA-II.\n\u2022 From 2014 - 2019, 3041 CFA violations have taken place during the NDA.\n\nNone of the numbers as stated in the viral social media posts are from the SATP.\n\nThe MHA releases numbers relating to security forces' engagements with terrorists and extremists on three fronts; the reports of which can be read here:\n\u2022 During the UPA II (2009 - 2013), 14,953 incidents of violence were recorded.\n\u2022 During the NDA (2014 - 2018), 7,979 incidents of violence were recorded.\n\nSATP toes MHA data since their data collection methods differ slightly - SATP relying on media and secondary sources whereas the MHA operates various official machinery (governmental wings, police forces etc.)\n\nEarlier, BOOM factchecked Defence Minister Niramla Sitharaman's claim when she said that no major terrorist incidents had happened in India after 2014.\n\nThat article can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
