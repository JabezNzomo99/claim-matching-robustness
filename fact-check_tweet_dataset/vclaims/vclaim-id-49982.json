However, it comes from a fake account purporting to be Zambia\u2019s ministry of commerce, which denied the claim and cautioned people to verify such offers. The same tactic appears to have been used in Botswana as well.\n\nThe non-existent grant featured in this Facebook post on July 4, 2020, with a picture of Zambia\u2019s trade minister, Christopher Yaluma.\n\n\u201cANNOUNCEMENT!!! ANNOUNCEMENT!! GOOD NEWS TO ALL ENTREPRENEURS; The Ministry has partnered with USAID, BACC and other International bodies in giving out GRANTS to all deserving citizens to boost your business during this time. I urge all to grab this chance,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nIncluded is a link to a Google form designed to look like an online application for the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA). It asks applicants for personal details such as their physical location, occupation, and marital status.\n\nHowever, Zambia\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry (MCTIZ) published a press release on May 7, 2020 on their official Facebook account informing the public of a fraudulent Facebook page claiming to advertise grants.\n\n\u201cThere are fraudsters who have created a fake Facebook page named as MINISTRY OF COMMERCE, TRADE AND INDUSTRY-ZAMBIA advertising and claiming that the Ministry has partnered with USAID, BACC and other International bodies in giving out grants to deserving citizens to boost their business during this time,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cKindly note that the Ministry is not disbursing any grants and is not running any empowerment programme on behalf of and in partner[ship] with the United States of American Agencies.\u201d\n\nThe fake page, with very few posts, was created in September 2019 and is managed out of Kenya, according to the Facebook page transparency details. The ministry\u2019s official page, with more regular posts, was created on January 14, 2014, and is administered in Zambia.\n\nThe ZDA echoed the ministry\u2019s position in a post on May 26, 2020, warning people to \u201cbe wary of such offers from unscrupulous people by seeking confirmation with the Zambia Development Agency or other legitimate Government institutions before they can apply or make any payments\u201d.\n\nPeople who had submitted applications through the bogus page subsequently shared screenshots of the emailed responses in the comments section beneath the ministry\u2019s statement of denial. These comments show a further request by the scammers for a more thorough application to be filled in and returned, which some users claimed to have done.\n\nIn response, officials commented on Facebook that they were looking to take further action.\n\n\u201cBe assured that the Ministry is working with the fraud department and other authorities,\u201d said a reply from the MCTIZ.\n\nAn older post by the ZDA from November 19, 2019, shows that the grant scam posts are a recurring theme for the agency -- the warning then addressed a scam targeted at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nNon-existent partnerships were also used as a ploy in a more recent Facebook post on July 16, 2020, claiming to be an initiative by Zambia\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry has partnered with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to roll out an economic development program in the country by issuing Financial Grants worth US$ 93.6 Million to all deserving entrepreneurs and farmers in the country with an aim of promoting local investment and entrepreneurship amid COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d reads the purported offer, on a page created less than a month ago.\n\n\n\n However, a response to AFP Fact Check sent from the ministry\u2019s real Facebook page by spokesman Chileshe Kandeta, confirmed, with thanks, that the post is \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, Zambia\u2019s President Edgar Chagwa Lungu said his government had put in place a 10-billion kwacha ($558 million) medium-term refinancing facility for businesses and households impacted by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI am happy that commercial banks are now accessing part of the 10-billion kwacha to be loaned to our entrepreneurs, especially, small and medium enterprises,\u201d Lungu said.\n\nAt the time he said 533 million kwacha of 1.8 billion kwacha worth of applications from the banking sector had been approved by the Bank of Zambia, with applications worth 753 million kwacha from the non-banking financial sector under consideration.\n\nHe added that the Zambian government had decided \u201cto issue the COVID-19 bond amounting to 8 billion kwacha as a stimulus package to enhance economic activity\u201d.\n\n\n\n Part of the money raised from the bond would include the payment of retirees, suppliers of goods and services, and local contractors.\n\n\u201cFurther, the money realised from the bond will be utilised to support the small and medium enterprises that will not be able to access the 10-billion kwacha medium-term refinancing facility through commercial banks which is managed by the Bank of Zambia,\u201d Lungu said.\n\nBotswana victim of the same scam\n\nA Facebook search of keywords in the fake Zambia post led to a similarly-worded version of the false offer for grants relief on a page purporting to be run by Botswana\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.\n\nPage transparency information on Facebook also indicates the page is managed in Kenya. In this case, the post has been shared more than 640 times since May 4, 2020.\n\nThe Botswana government warned against the scam on official social media platforms here, here and here.\n\n\u201cWe would like to advise that the said post is a scam and further caution members of the public not to follow the link provided as this might be the scammers\u2019 way of swindling the public of their hard earned money,\u201d reads the statement.\n\nWhile the Botswana government is giving businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic some assistance, it does not list the grant opportunities mentioned in the fake post. Some of the assistance includes loans, credit, and tax concessions.\n\nAFP Fact Check recently debunked a claim with the exact same wording aimed at Uganda\u2019s entrepreneurs.\n\u2022 This blog report was updated to include another falsely-rated post.", "lang": "en"}
