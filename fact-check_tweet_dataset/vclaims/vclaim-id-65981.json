But Missouri Senate Bill 5, or SB 5, which was signed by the governor in July, will overturn that local ordinance when it takes effect in October.\n\nSince SB 5 was signed, we\u2019ve seen claims that the bill would allow for employers to fire workers for using birth control. But we found no evidence that that\u2019s true.\n\nAllure, Refinery29, and Newsweek were just a few among media sources that reported the bill would allow for employees to fire people for using birth control. Newsweek came out with an updated article stating that it, among other publications, had erroneously reported on the bill.\n\nMany of these news organizations referenced NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, which ran an ad online and on the radio that read, \"Do you think your boss should be able to fire you for using birth control?\"\n\nThis ad only ran for one week, but its interpretation of the bill was influential to many of those articles.\n\nAccording to Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, it was the rhetoric of Republicans and not the actual language that led to this interpretation. Says 5-year-olds can \u201ctake hormones and change my sex.\u201d\n\nUnder the political subdivision authority part of the bill, it allows property owners to refuse to rent or sell to a person who plans to use the facility as an abortion clinic that isn\u2019t for the sole purpose of saving the mother\u2019s life.\n\nWithin the same guidelines, it also doesn\u2019t require healthcare providers or employers to provide coverage \"that includes benefits that are not otherwise required by state law.\"\n\nDaniel Wilhelm, with Republican Rep. Andrew Koenig\u2019s office, said the bill does not reference birth control or contraceptives, except under circumstances where employers can refuse health care if they don\u2019t want to pay for birth control.\n\nElizabeth Sepper, a professor of law at Washington University, said in an email that no matter what Missouri does, federal law bars an employer with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees based on their reproductive choices, such as taking contraception.\n\nWhile the bill will impose higher level of restrictions on abortion providers and allow real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, the bill does not say employers can fire workers for using contraceptives.", "lang": "en"}
