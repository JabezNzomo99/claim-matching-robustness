The communal rabble-rousing page put out this quote attributing it to the actor. The quote was circulated widely among right-wing Twitter handles and Facebook pages. Bhasker had written an open letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, director of the movie Padmaavat, and expressed her disagreement and disapproval of the portrayal of the queen and her decision to commit \u2018jauhar\u2019 after Chittor had been besieged by Alauddin Khilji. Bhasker\u2019s view gained much traction on social media. She was attacked for her view by certain sections, some of whom stooped rather low.\n\nWe have interviewed many \u00e2\u0080\u0098ex-naxal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 women in Bastar. Each has gut-wrenching stories to tell, full of abuse, rape and misogyny If they marry, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed to have children. I think fake feminist @ReallySwara must make a trip to understand how the Real Vagina feels like. \u2014 Vivek Agnihotri (@vivekagnihotri) January 30, 2018 Now @ReallySwara will tell the girl she had the right to be raped 100 times during 10 months, and will blame her for succumbing to 'patriarchy' by burning her face! #sickening. https://t.co/tmGXpWf50M \u2014 Shefali Vaidya (@ShefVaidya) January 30, 2018 Bhasker spoke to Alt News, \u201cThis meme by Shankh Naad is an utter and blatant lie. I have literally not used these words strung next to each other in any utterance nor anything I\u2019ve ever said or written in public or in private. I think this perverse, wilful twisting of my article and the argument to serve the hateful and poisonous motives of Shankh Naad and it reeks of vicious intent. It\u2019s scary and shameful that a politely worded review of a film should be twisted for such sinister purposes. I think this amounts to criminal defamation.\u201d This is a BLATANT LIE. @ShankhNaad pls publish an official apology or we can take this to court.. https://t.co/yJQe6UpX7l \u2014 Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) January 30, 2018\n\nForced on the backfoot and threatened with lawsuit, Shankh Naad deleted the tweet and issued a \u2018clarification\u2019 and an \u2018apology\u2019, hiding behind \u2018technicalities\u2019. If I say \"I want to consume KCN\" doesn't mean someone can quote me saying \"I want to die\". Apologies for technicalities,\u00c2 here @ReallySwara , corrected it.. pic.twitter.com/IxI8Y4UPO7 \u2014 ShankhNaad (@ShankhNaad) January 31, 2018 For those who are aware of the kind of inflammatory content that Shankh Naad shares, such mischief is not surprising and, sadly, not unexpected. This is because no action has been taken against the page and its owner despite being repeatedly exposed over its blatantly communal agenda, posting malicious content with regularity and impunity. Recently, Mahesh Vikram Hegde, who is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter and is the founder and admin of the fake news website Postcard.news, shared a fake quote attributed to actor Farhan Akhtar over the communal violence in Kasganj, Uttar Pradesh.", "lang": "en"}
