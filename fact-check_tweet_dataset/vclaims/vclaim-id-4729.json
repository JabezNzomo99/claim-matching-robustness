The longest, spanning 1 hour 42 minutes and 57 seconds, is slated to occur on 27 July 2018.\n\nThe length of a total lunar eclipse varies based how far the moon is from the Earth at the time of the eclipse. As described by EarthSky, the 27 July eclipse will occur when the moon is coincidentally at its farthest point from Earth:\n\nIn 2018, the July full moon and July lunar apogee \u2014 the moon\u2019s most distant point from Earth in its monthly orbit \u2013 both fall on the same date: July 27, 2018. Therefore, the July 2018 full moon showcases the most distant and smallest full moon of the year. Sometimes called an apogean full moon (or micro-moon or mini-moon), this smaller and slower-moving full moon takes more time to cross the Earth\u2019s shadow than does a full moon that\u2019s closer to Earth and moving faster in orbit. That\u2019s why a full moon at or near lunar apogee adds to the duration of a total lunar eclipse.\n\nUnfortunately for readers residing in portions of North America that are not on the most eastern side of Newfoundland, they will effectively miss out on the action. However, the eclipse will be visible, to some degree, from every other continent on the planet.\n\nHow does this century\u2019s longest duration total lunar eclipse compare to other centuries\u2019 record holders? Though the Gregorian calendar was not a thing at the time, the longest total lunar eclipse occurring in the five millennia (or 50 centuries) between 2000 BCE and projected into 3000 CE occurred on 31 May 318 CE and lasted 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 36 seconds \u2014 a full three minutes and 39 seconds longer than this July\u2019s eclipse will be.", "lang": "en"}
