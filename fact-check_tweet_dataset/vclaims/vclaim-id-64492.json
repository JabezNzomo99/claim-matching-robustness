Also contrary to the posts, cloth and surgical masks are not entirely ineffective because they prevent the wearer from transmitting infection to others through droplets. Surgical masks also protect wearers from getting potential infections via droplets. In addition, people who wear these masks are in little to no danger of breathing in too much carbon dioxide.\n\nN95 respirators with valves do allow unfiltered exhaled air to reach others, increasing the risk of spreading infection. Cloth and surgical masks do not protect the wearer from airborne infection. Cloth masks also get dirty easily, which is why OSHA and CDC recommend regular washing.\n\nAnother day, another viral claim about the effectiveness (or not) of face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.\n\nA popular Facebook post that had been copied and pasted numerous times in June repeated spurious but familiar claims about masks, this time selectively citing U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) recommendations:\n\nIn July 2020, a similar post \u2014 this time attributed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 made almost identical claims about N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. This photo circulated online:\n\nThe lengthy posts focused on three different types of protective masks: N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. We tackle assertions about each one below.\n\nAccording to the posts your unfiltered, potentially infectious breath could harm others if you are breathing through an N95 respirator.\n\nN95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don\u2019t filter the air on the way out. They don\u2019t need to. Conclusion: if you\u2019re in Stewart\u2019s and the guy with Covid has N95 mask his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Stewart\u2019s (because it was designed for already contaminated environments, it\u2019s not filtering your air on the way out)\n\nThis is mostly true, except it only applies to N95 respirators with valves. Such masks were designed for construction/factory workers or miners, to keep out dust and other particles, but not to prevent infectious particles from leaving the mask. When the wearer inhales, the one-way valve closes so pathogens can\u2019t get through, but when the user exhales, the valve opens. In May, the San Francisco Department of Public Health tweeted that N95 masks with valves in the front weren\u2019t safe and \u201cmay actually propel your germs further.\u201d\n\nHospitals largely use N95 masks without valves for this reason, and in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. OSHA\u2019s guidelines on N95s primarily focus on how they are meant \u201cto prevent workers from inhaling small particles, including airborne transmissible or aerosolized infectious agents,\u201d and should be required in workplaces where respirators are needed.\n\nThe Facebook post argues that wearing a surgical mask makes you a \u201cwalking virus dispenser,\u201d as follows:\n\nSurgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside and indoor environments where people are CLOGG these masks very Very quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged mask will render it \u201cuseless\u201d IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it You become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every \u201c20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment\u201d\n\nOSHA guidelines seem to contradict some of these claims, arguing that surgical masks protect workers \u201cagainst [potentially infectious] splashes and sprays,\u201d and also \u201ccontain\u201d the wearer\u2019s respiratory droplets to protect others. OSHA says these masks should be placed on sick individuals to prevent transmission via droplets. Surgical masks do, however, offer ineffective protection from transmission via airborne particles due to their loose fit. While the post argues that such masks should be thrown out every 20-30 minutes, OSHA simply recommends that they \u201cshould be properly disposed of after use.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s and letter\u2019s claims about cloth masks are mostly false and have been debunked by Snopes before. The author claims:\n\nCloth masks: today three people pointed to their masks as the walked by me entering Lowe\u2019s. They said \u201cya gotta wear your mask BRO\u201d I said very clearly \u201cthose masks don\u2019t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker\u201d the \u201cpshh\u2019d\u201d me. By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything \u2026 ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks health. The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask.\n\nOSHA guidelines already state that cloth masks are ineffective filters against airborne particles. They are worn to protect other people from risk of infection via respiratory droplets. People wearing them are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide. The posts point out the danger of dirty masks, which is why both OSHA and CDC recommend washing cloth masks after use.\n\nOSHA also \u201cgenerally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work,\u201d contradicting the argument of this entire post.\n\nFinally, the author of the Facebook post claimed to be \u201cOSHA 10&30 certified,\u201d which refers to OSHA\u2019s 10-hour and 30-hour training modules about common health and safety hazards in the workplace. We reached out to OSHA, and a representative told us that these courses \u201cdo not include COVID-19 topics,\u201d nor does OSHA \u201ccertify\u201d trainers.\n\nSnopes also reached out to the CDC about the photograph of the notice. They directed us to their guidance on cloth masks, and issued the following statement:\n\nIn sum, the varied claims in these viral posts (with their dubious origins) for the most part misrepresented information provided by OSHA and the CDC. Scientific wisdom argues that wearing a mask is more effective than doing nothing, and, combined with social distancing and other safety measures, offers protection not only to the wearer but to others. Given these posts\u2019 combination of only a few correct facts and largely incorrect conclusions, we rate their various claims as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
