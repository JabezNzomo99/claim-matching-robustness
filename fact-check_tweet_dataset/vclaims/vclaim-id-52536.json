That is not the part that has become disputed in a highly charged political climate recently, as disinformation about the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become central to a geo-political blame-game.\n\nGiven the available facts and evidence, Namibia Fact Check has concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was neither man-made nor escaped from a lab, even as some areas of this narrative remain unresolved. Thus, based on the balance of evidence, we rate claims of SARS-CoV-2 virus being bio-engineered or that it escaped from a lab as mostly false.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\nWhile spurious claims and conspiracy theories about the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been around since at least January 2020, of late such claims and theories have been amplified after US president Donald Trump reiterated a claim during a media briefing on 30 April 2020 that the virus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory called the Wuhan Institute of Virology, in the city that was the initial global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wuhan Institute of Virology hit global prominence at another White House media briefing on 15 April 2020, when president Trump first acknowledged that US officials were investigating claims that the virus might have escaped from a Wuhan lab.\n\nSince then the US president\u2019s claims about the Wuhan lab origins of the COVID-19 pandemic have been repeated by the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, on 3 May 2020, as the following The Guardian video shows:\n\nThe latest Trump administration claims aside for a moment, the claims and conspiracies about the man-made or lab accident origins of the Covid-19 pandemic have come in three main types over recent months, namely:\n\u2022 SARS-CoV-2 was not bio-engineered but escaped from a Wuhan / Chinese lab;\n\u2022 SARS-CoV-2 was bio-engineered and escaped from a Wuhan / Chinese lab.\n\nAs for the first claim \u2013 SARS-CoV-2 was bio-engineered in a lab \u2013 while mostly American conspiracy theorists have been pushing the claim since the beginning of the year that the virus was made in a Chinese lab, in March 2020 Chinese officials have pushed back with the claim that the virus was possibly made and spread by the US government.\n\nFor their part, US officials have been pushing the second claim \u2013 SARS-CoV-2 was not bio-engineered but escaped from a Wuhan / Chinese lab \u2013 as is clear form the statements of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. However, as the New York Times reported on 3 May 2020:\n\nWhat is fueling the controversy around the virus origins is the fact that the Chinese government is not transparent and open with information surrounding the circumstances of the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 and has not allowed investigators from outside China to assist in establishing the facts of the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in China, Dr Gauden Galea, admitted that the global body did not have access to SARS-CoV-2 origin investigations in an interview with Sky News on 30 April 2020. You can watch the interview clip below:\n\nWhat medical experts and scientists say\n\nDespite the political claims and controversies, as the quote from the New York Times indicates, medical experts and scientists do not support any one of the three main origin (conspiracy) theories being peddled by conspiracy theorists and governments alike.\n\nAs of 17 April 2020, the position of the World Health Organisation (WHO) regarding the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the following (look under What is the connection between COVID-19 and animals?):\n\nThis statement needs slight clarification, for while it indicates that the WHO is waiting for confirmation of the \u201cpossible animal source\u201d of SARS-CoV-2, it should be clear that the WHO accepts that the source was an animal. Thus the virus, according to the WHO, is a natural organism.\n\nAnd as of 19 April 2020, the US\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states of the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus:\n\nIn January 2020, the findings of a study, published by Nature.com, into the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concluded that:\n\nThe authors of the study explained that:\n\n\u201cRecombination events\u201d is a reference to bio- or genetic engineering or modification. Thus, the study authors state, there was no evidence of bio-engineering in the make-up of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And, in fact, they point to the Intermediate Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus affinis) \u2013 which is endemic to large parts of south and southeast Asia \u2013 as the most likely source of the virus.\n\nAs should be clear by now, despite the claims of some politicians and governments, as of 4 May 2020, the expert and scientific consensus is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not man-made and that it is unlikely that the virus escaped from a lab.", "lang": "en"}
