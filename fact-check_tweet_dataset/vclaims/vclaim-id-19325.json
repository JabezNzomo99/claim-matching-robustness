Separately, in a series of tweets, Trump quoted a radio host who claimed Jewish people in Israel admired the U.S. president so greatly that it was as though Trump were the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ. Trump never himself articulated any such belief.\n\nIn a brief aside during remarks about the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, Trump said \"I am the chosen one.\"\n\nIn August 2019, we received inquiries from readers about multiple claims that U.S. President Donald Trump had, in one day, called himself the \u201csecond coming of God,\u201d the \u201cKing of Israel,\u201d or \u201cthe chosen one.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 21, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that featured a quotation attributed to Trump: \u201cI\u2019m the King of Israel. I\u2019m the chosen one\u201d along with an unattributed quotation that read: \u201cThe Anti-christ will pretend that he is the son of God.\u201d (That quotation is not Biblical in origin, and appears to have originated in a famous medieval text about the antichrist, written by the French Benedictine monk Adso of Montier-en-der.)\n\nThe same Facebook page posted a second meme on similar themes, writing:\n\nAnd in a third post on the same subject, Occupy Democrats published a meme that read: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s \u2018the second coming\u2019 and \u2018the chosen one.\u2019 I say we throw him in the sea to see if he can walk on it.\u201d\n\nOther mostly left-leaning sources posted similar claims on Twitter, garnering a high volume of retweets. One of them wrote:\n\n\u201cWhen the president of the United States starts declaring that he is:\n\n \u2013 \u2018The King of Israel\u2019\n\n \u2013 \u2018The Chosen One\u2019\n\n \u2013 \u2018The Second coming of God\u2019\n\nIt means he is out of his goddamn mind & it\u2019s time for the 25th amendment now.\u201d\n\nThe @BarristerSecret account tweeted that Trump had \u201cunironically [declared] himself \u2018the second coming of God,'\u201d and the controversial surgeon and left-leaning activist Dr. Eugene Gu claimed the president had \u201c[praised] himself as \u2018the King of Israel\u2019 and \u2018the second coming of God.'\u201d\n\nVanity Fair also published an article with the headline \u201cTrump Declares Himself \u2018King of Israel,\u2019 \u2018the Second Coming of God.'\u201d\n\nThe reality was much more complicated, and the claims and reports mentioned above largely misrepresented what Trump actually said or wrote by removing them from their proper context or issuing inaccurate descriptions of them.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters about the ongoing U.S. trade war with China, Trump did briefly say \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d but it\u2019s quite possible, even likely, that he was merely speaking tongue-in-cheek or for rhetorical effect.\n\nHis remarks came on Aug. 21, while he was speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. In response to a question about recent talk of an impending economic recession, linked to the U.S.-China trade war, Trump held forth on what he presented as sharp economic practices by China, a common topic of discussion for the president. He said:\n\n\u201cOne thing I have to do is economically take on China because China has been ripping us off for many years. President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama and others should have done this long before me. My life would be much easier \u2014 although I enjoy doing it \u2014 but my life would be much easier if I just said \u2018let China continue to rip off the United States.\u2019 It would be much easier, but I can\u2019t do that \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026 Somebody said \u2018It\u2019s Trump\u2019s trade war\u2019 \u2014 this isn\u2019t my trade war, this is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago, by a lot of other presidents \u2026 Somebody had to do it. [Turning to the sky] I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it, so I\u2019m taking on China. I\u2019m taking on China on trade, and you know what? We\u2019re winning \u2026\u201d\n\nThe concept of a \u201cchosen one\u201d \u2014 an individual predestined by prophecy to perform the role of a savior or messiah for a particular people \u2014 has roots in various cultures and religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. However, it has evolved beyond those parameters to gain much looser and more secular connotations.\n\nIt is a common trope in fiction and literature, especially science fiction and fantasy (think of Harry Potter), and is also frequently invoked, sometimes with tongue in cheek, in the context of sports. For example, the basketball player LeBron James famously had \u201cChosen 1\u201d tattooed on his back, after Sports Illustrated published a cover story about him, describing the then-phenomenally promising high school junior as \u201cthe chosen one.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Trump could have been seriously declaring a sincere belief that he is destined by prophecy to be the savior of the American people, or indeed the world, when he said as an aside \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d during a discussion with reporters about U.S.-China economic relations. However, it seems much more likely to us, especially in light of his somewhat theatrical glance to the skies, that he was either using the phrase as a figure of speech born out of his apparently rather certain belief in his own talents, or that he was simply speaking with tongue firmly in cheek, or a little bit of both.\n\nIf the U.S. president refers to himself as \u201cthe chosen one\u201d again, and with less ambiguous, more clearly messianic connotations, we will update this article accordingly.\n\n\u2018The King of Israel\u2019 and \u2018the second coming of God\u2019\n\nTrump never declared or called or described himself as \u201cthe King of Israel\u201d or \u201cthe second coming of God.\u201d Further, he did not even quote someone who personally professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief. As such, many sources, including those mentioned above, grossly misrepresented the pronouncements made in this episode.\n\nHowever, in a decision that concerned many observers, the president did directly quote the conspiracy theorist and radio host Wayne Allyn Root as saying that \u201cThe Jewish people in Israel love [Trump] like he\u2019s the King of Israel\u201d and \u201clike he is the second coming of God.\u201d Trump did this in a series of tweets, also on Aug. 21, which he prefaced by writing \u201cThank you Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words\u201d:\n\nTrump almost entirely accurately quoted remarks Root made on his \u201cNewsmax\u201d TV show on Aug. 20. In response to a caller who lamented the purported irrationality and blind loyalty of Democrat voters, Root held forth on the traditional support for the Democrat party among Jewish voters in the U.S., in contrast with what he presented as widespread support for Trump among Jews in Israel. He said:\n\n\u201c\u2026 75 percent of all Jews vote Democrat and they don\u2019t like Trump. And this is the greatest president for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America. Trump\u2019s the best president for Israel in the history of the world. And the Jewish people love him like he is the king of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God. And in America, American Jews don\u2019t like him. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing or saying any more, it makes no sense.\u201d\n\nThe remarks in question can be watched here (beginning at 36:45). Root was echoing similar statements Trump himself made earlier that day. Speaking to reporters at the White House, the president addressed the controversy over Israel\u2019s reversed decision to bar U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from entering the country.\n\nTrump proclaimed: \u201cWhere has the Democratic party gone? Where have they gone where they\u2019re defending these two people [Tlaib and Omar] over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d\n\nRoot\u2019s original remarks came in the form of a simile, meaning it should have been clear by definition that he was not claiming that Trump actually is the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, nor even that Jewish people in Israel believe he is those things. Rather, in order to emphasize what he perceives as the U.S. president\u2019s popularity among Israeli Jews, Root was indulging in rhetorical license, using the device of a simile, by saying Israeli Jews loved Trump as if he were the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ.\n\nRoot later emphasized the fact that he was engaging in simile, rather than claiming Trump was, in fact, the king of Israel or the second coming of Christ, or even that Israeli Jews regard him as such. During a discussion with former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on Root\u2019s \u201cNewsmax\u201d TV show, Root said:\n\n\u201c\u2026 They [liberal opponents] took everything I said out of context \u2026 Did I really say, on national TV, on my \u2018Newsmax\u2019 show last night, that Donald Trump is the second coming of Christ, and he\u2019s the king of the Jews? No. I said in Israel they treat him like he\u2019s the second coming of Christ and the King of the Jews. And it\u2019s a New York expression, you know, it\u2019s like you and I could have been having an expression [sic] and I\u2019d say, \u2018Are you kidding me? In Israel they treat him like he\u2019s the King of the Jews.\u2019 Does that really mean that I believe he\u2019s the King of the Jews? \u2026 Obviously, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nWe know that certain Christians in the United States and beyond have professed a fringe belief in Trump as a Christ-like or messianic figure. It\u2019s even possible, theoretically, that Trump himself might harbor similar suspicions of his own destiny. But the series of statements he made on Aug. 21, 2019, did not constitute evidence of any such belief on his part.\n\nThe president did say \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d but he made the remark as an aside, combining it with a theatrical glance towards the heavens, while making a broader point about his engaging in a supposedly overdue trade war with China. The context, along with Trump\u2019s penchant for flippant and tongue-in-cheek asides, makes it highly unlikely he was choosing that moment to earnestly articulate some sincere belief in his own messianic destiny.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump quoted a controversial conspiracy theorist, Root, who had lavished praise upon the president, professing that Jewish people in Israel so admired Trump that it was as though he was the \u201cKing of Israel\u201d or \u201cthe second coming of God.\u201d But Root (as he later confirmed) was using exaggerated language as part of a simile. He was not making the factual claim that Israeli Jews literally believe that Trump is the King of Israel, or the second coming of Christ (the latter of which claims would make no sense for theological reasons, anyway.)\n\nSo the widely promulgated claim that Trump, simply by quoting Root\u2019s remarks, was in effect declaring himself to be the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, was inaccurate by a considerable distance. Trump did not even quote someone who professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief.", "lang": "en"}
