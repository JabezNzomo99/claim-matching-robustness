But the Central Bank of Kenya told AFP that only coins were unveiled to the public last week. The pictures of the banknotes already circulated on social media two years ago.\n\nOne Facebook post, shared in this group supporting President Kenyatta with more than 300,000 followers, has since attracted more than 700 reactions and 47 shares.\n\nA caption accompanying the misleading post read: \"PRESIDENT KENYATTA launches new generation Kenyan currency in accordance with Constitution; currency to have symbols not portraits of persons. Hongera! [Congratulations!] Kenya.\"\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) told AFP that only new coins, and no new notes, have so far been released.\n\nThe coins were launched by Kenyatta in line with the 2010 constitution which outlawed portraits and images of individuals on currency. The current banknotes bear portraits of Kenyatta\u2019s father, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya\u2019s first president, and the second president Daniel Moi.\n\nThe new coins replace images of ex-presidents with depictions of wildlife.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and Yandex shows that the photos of mocked-up Kenyan bank notes have circulated on social media before, first appearing in September 2017 when activist Okiya Omtatah sought a court order compelling the CBK to issue new notes and coins after the bank missed the constitutional deadline of August 2015 for issuing new currency.\n\nThe images were then shared in this Facebook group with more than 1.2 million followers while this website published an article claiming that the images of the new currency notes had been leaked.\n\nIt is unclear whether the images do in fact represent what the new notes will look like when they are issued. However, they appear not to meet a key requirement to prevent counterfeits in the form of a distinct interwoven security thread running vertically down the right-hand side of the notes.\n\nThe notes also bear dates of January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2003, years prior to the passing of the new constitution.\n\nCBK is expected to at some point launch new banknotes.", "lang": "en"}
