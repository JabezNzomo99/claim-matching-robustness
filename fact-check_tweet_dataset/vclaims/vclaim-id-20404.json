The key aim, when it was introduced, was to consolidate the existing legislation on fire safety into one place.\n\nOne of the provisions of the new legislation changed the rules on how buildings are assessed for fire risk and this is what the Prime Minister is talking about.\n\nBefore 2006, the rules were more complicated. In some cases, local fire brigades issued fire certificates to businesses when they were satisfied the premises met the required standards (and issued notices requiring changes where they weren\u2019t).\n\nThe 2005 Order replaced the need for fire certificates with a risk-assessment approach, where a \u2018responsible person\u2019 (usually whoever is in control of the premises) has to ensure that a fire safety risk assessment of the building is carried out. If they\u2019re not able to carry one out, this is done by a \u2018competent person\u2019 who needs to have \u201csufficient training and experience or knowledge and other qualities\u201d to carry it out properly.\n\nThe inquest into the Lakanal House fire in 2009 unearthed concerns that there weren\u2019t strict enough requirements for people conducting risk assessments to be qualified to do so, and for buildings to undergo the checks. The Coroner also told the government in 2013 that \u201cthere remains uncertainty about the scope of inspection for fire risk assessment purposes which should be undertaken in high rise residential buildings\u201d.\n\nConcerns about the 2005 Order were also raised by a Lords Committee which remarked ahead of its publication: \u201cThe Committee is concerned that there is a risk that the proposed fire safety regime (based on self-assessment) would not maintain the necessary protection provided by the current fire safety regime (based on fire safety certification).\u201d\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean the Order was responsible for this fire or the more recent one at Grenfell tower. The public inquiry that\u2019s been announced into the recent tragedy will cover the reasons in depth.", "lang": "en"}
