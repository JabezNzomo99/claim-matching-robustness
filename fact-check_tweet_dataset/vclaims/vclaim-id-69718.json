Each were by the state Republican Party, with one dating back more than a year.\n\nThere also have been two TV ads on the case that we\u2019ve checked from two groups defending Evers, who will face Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018, election.\n\nNow comes another attack ad, this one from Walker, released Sept. 5, 2018. The narrator goes into lengthy detail, saying:\n\nA teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom, showed obscene images to female coworkers, commented about the chest sizes of middle-school girls, suggested one struggling student should brush up on her sex skills because it's the only thing she'd ever be good at -- then intimidated the female teacher who complained. Tony Evers should have revoked the teacher's license, but he didn't, and the teacher is still in the classroom with young girls.\n\nWe\u2019ll break down the statement into two parts:\n\n\"A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom,\" along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and \"the teacher is still in the classroom.\"\n\nLike the other ads, this one focuses on Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images and videos of nudity on his school computer and showing them to co-workers.\n\n \n\n Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired. Two courts, without ruling on whether the firing was illegal, concluded that the arbitrator was within her authority in making her decision.\n\nThe arbitrator based her decision in part on her determination that Harris\u2019 behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students, as defined by state law.\n\nNow to what Walker\u2019s ad claims about the teacher\u2019s behavior.\n\nWhat the teacher did\n\nWe\u2019re relying on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports on the case, the arbitrator\u2019s report and the school district\u2019s investigation of the case.\n\n\u2018Watched hard-core pornography in classroom\u2019: Correct, though \"hard-core\" might be debatable. Harris looked at pornographic material at school during the workday, via 23 emails sent by Harris' sister, that included pornographic photos, jokes and movies.\n\nCommented about chest sizes, sex skills: Undetermined. In the school district\u2019s investigation, an unidentified employee said Harris made the remarks. But the Department of Public Instruction, which Evers heads, said neither the arbitrator nor the department could determine whether Harris made the remarks.\n\n\u2018Intimidated the female teacher who complained\u2019: Correct. The teacher who complained said Harris could sometimes be intimidating. The district\u2019s investigation found that emails Harris sent to the teacher \"suggests retaliation,\" but Harris denied they were retaliatory.\n\nSo, the first part of Walker\u2019s claim is partially accurate.\n\nBut the second part is more important, given that it contains the attack on Evers.\n\nThis part of the ad states \u2014 particularly in saying Evers should have revoked Harris\u2019 license \u2014 that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching.\n\nBut when Harris was fired, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan legal advisers, \"as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.\"\n\nAnd is the pivotal word.\n\nEvers\u2019 department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. The department has said it decided against that course after concluding Harris\u2019 behavior didn\u2019t endanger kids, as defined by the law.\n\nWalker, in effect, argues that Evers nevertheless should have tried revocation. But the lack of a legal basis to take away Harris\u2019 license appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris\u2019 firing, Walker signed a bill, supported by Evers, that redefined immoral conduct to specify that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation.\n\nSo, the second part of Walker\u2019s statement is misleading in claiming that Evers could have revoked Harris\u2019 license and simply didn\u2019t.\n\nWalker says: \"A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom,\" along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and \"the teacher is still in the classroom.\"\n\nThe first part of Walker\u2019s statement, about the teacher\u2019s behavior, is correct on two points; but on two other points, the validity of the allegations is unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, the more important part of Walker\u2019s statement is misleading in saying Evers could have and didn\u2019t revoke the teacher\u2019s license. There was a lack of legal basis for revocation at the time \u2014 made clear by the fact that Walkers and Evers backed a change in state law so that teachers can be fired for viewing pornography at school.\n\nFor a statement that contains only elements of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
