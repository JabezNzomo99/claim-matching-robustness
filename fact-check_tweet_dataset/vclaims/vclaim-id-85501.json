Is This Sophie Trudeau Talking About Coronavirus?\n\nA video clip of a woman who contracted COVID-19 speaking from a hospital bed about 'not taking chances' is being shared with a false claim that identifies her as Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. The clip is being shared with the following misleading caption: \"The Canadian PM's wife.

BOOM found that there is some existing literature on certain remedial properties of cow urine, and the United States have granted patents for the medical use of cow urine distillate. However, none of these studies have investigated the effectiveness of cow urine on SARS-CoV-2, which is a novel virus, and all of them predate the outbreak of the disease by years. But, the WHO still states that there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.\n\nRead the facts around this claim in detail here.\n\n4.

The message has been doing the rounds in Mumbai and Bangalore and asks residents to stay indoors between 10pm to 5am. BOOM got in touch with a senior officer at Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). He said, \"This is a fake message. Nobody is spraying anything in the air or anywhere. This is someone's attempt to create panic.\" He added, \"While it is good if people stay indoors unless absolutely necessary, such a message is false and fake.\"\n\nRead the facts around this claim in detail here.\n\nA quote calling for closure of meat shops in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak has gone viral in the name of cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. The viral post, accompanied with a photo of the master blaster, reads 'Coronavirus is an epidemic that has spread because of consumption of non-vegetarian food. Why then only school, colleges and malls are shut? All shops selling meat should be closed'. The same claim is also viral without Tendulkar's name.
