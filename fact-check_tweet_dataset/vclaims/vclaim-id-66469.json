Four seem relevant to this fact check. (The fifth deals with requiring approval of voters before a gambling establishment can be relocated .)\n\nIn 2006, Question 1 asked voters to . That proposal was defeated. In 2012, two questions -- one , the other -- were approved, although Newport voters rejected the Newport Grand proposal. In 2014, a new proposal to authorize casino gambling at Newport Grand was approved in a statewide vote, but lost again in Newport, where approval was also required for passage.\n\nWhen we checked the votes with the , we confirmed the tallies Doyle sent us and found a clear pattern. Here are the various approval rates:\n\nIn every case, Tiverton voters approved gambling provisions by a wider margin than voters statewide. Last year, the number of Tiverton voters approving table games at Newport was nearly 17 percent higher than the state as a whole.\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether Tiverton voters' degree of support will be as high if the gambling facility is going to be located in their town. Taylor's meeting Monday night with the Town Council didn't offer many clues, but the casino plans aren't going to be firmed up until November.\n\nBut if Twin River is looking to set up a facility in a community that is receptive to a casino, it looks like Tiverton is a good bet.", "lang": "en"}
