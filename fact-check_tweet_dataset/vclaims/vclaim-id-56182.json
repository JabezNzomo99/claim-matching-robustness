Rainfall after a weeks-long dry period helped, the agency said.\n\nThe fire in Chernobyl came amid the panic over the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a surge of apocalyptic memes on social media but also raising concerns that smoke and wind could potentially spread radioactive contamination.\n\nInternational media reported elevated radiation levels in the area of the fire.\n\nThe Associated Press cited a member of Ukraine\u2019s public council in charge of Chernobyl exclusion zone, Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, as saying on Facebook that the situation was \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian cited a Facebook post by the head of Ukraine\u2019s state ecological inspection service that included a video of a Geiger counter showing a radiation level 16 times above normal.\n\nReuters reported that aerial images of the exclusion zone around the destroyed nuclear plant \u201cshowed scorched, blackened earth and the charred stumps of still smoldering trees.\u201d\n\nLater on Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s deputy interior minister, Anton Herashchenko, visited Chernobyl and gave assurances that all the fires would be extinguished. He also claimed the radiation level in the area was normal.\n\n\u201cThe firefighters did not allow the fire to move towards the town of Pripyat, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and nuclear waste storage facilities. There was no danger to the nuclear facilities of the Exclusion Zone at this fire. There is no increase in radiation background,\u201d Herashchenko said.\n\nTo confirm Herashchenko\u2019s claim, Ukraine\u2019s Emergency Situations Service published a photo showing a firefighter holding a Geiger counter showing a reading of 0.14 microSieverts per hour (mSv/h) \u2013 indicating a radiation level considered safe or normal.\n\nUkraine uses the same system of measuring radiation levels as Russia and Europe. A background radiation level of 0.12 to 0.24 mSv per hour is considered normal.\n\nA chest X-ray delivers 0.1 mSv of radiation and a full-body CT scan 10 mSv. The maximum levels recorded at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan on March 14, 2011, after it melted down as a result of being struck by tsunami, was 400 mSv. Many of the workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant when it melted down in April 1986 received doses measuring 6,000 mSv and died within a month.\n\nDespite Herashchenko\u2019s claim of \u201cno increase,\u201d several sources reported what they characterized as elevated levels.\n\nOn Monday, Dmitry Shibalov, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Chernobyl council, which oversees the exclusion zone, posted a video on Facebook from the abandoned village of Poliske, located inside the zone, some 36 miles from the defunct power plant. The video shows blackened trees still smoldering, with a Geiger counter in the foreground beeping and showing a reading of 0.42 mSv.\n\n\u201cThe level is a little above normal, but not significantly, and it\u2019s very localized,\u201d Shibalov wrote in a caption to the video.\n\nUkrainian activists posted videos on Facebook taken near the fire in Chernobyl and showing readings as high as 2.3 mSv \u201cat the center of the fire.\u201d\n\nThe latest wildfires are the largest in the exclusion zone since the nuclear accident, the head of the Eastern European Fire Monitoring Center, Sergiy Zibtsev, told Agence-France Presse. He estimated that the fires covered more than 50,000 acres in the western part of the zone.\n\nAccording to several studies and data, previous wildfires in Chernobyl were much smaller (the largest, in 2015, covered 3,700 acres). One study compared the 2015 fires as equivalent to a Level 3 nuclear event, \u201cwhich corresponds to a serious incident, in which non-lethal deterministic effects are expected from radiation.\u201d\n\nOn April 15, Ukraine\u2019s state Scientific Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety published data of the movement of \u201cpotentially contaminated air masses\u201d toward Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, but said they were not hazardous.\n\n\u201cThe forecasted concentrations are not higher than those observed previously and do not pose a threat to the health of the population,\u201d the Center said.\n\n\u201cWildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant burning since April 3 have already become the largest for the entire existence of this exclusion zone. These fires are extremely dangerous because radionuclides located in the upper soil layers might be released into the air,\u201d Greenpeace said in a statement.\n\nThe online investigative site Bellingcat reviewed satellite photos and other evidence about the fires, concluding that while there was cause for concern, \u201csome international media outlets have made misleading claims about \u201cspiking radiation levels.\u201d\n\nCiting experts and government sources, the site said that \u201cLocal radiation levels seem to have increased, but there has been no immediate risk for citizens being exposed to dangerous levels of radiation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
