The Reverend Franklin Graham (son of the late Reverend Billy Graham) described New Orleans as \u201cone wicked city\u201d with a \u201cblack spiritual cloud\u201d hanging over it. \u201cThey believe God is going to use that storm to bring revival,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nSimilar sentiments have been attributed to Billy Graham\u2019s daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, with regard to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that killed nearly 3,000 people. During a 2016 radio interview, Lotz said God allows \u201cbad things\u201d like 9/11 to happen because the United States is \u201cbasically abandoning God as a culture and as a nation.\u201d\n\nSome of the contemporaneous press coverage of Lotz\u2019s remarks employed headlines that misrepresented the tone and tenor of what she actually said, however. For example, an article on the website DeadState was headlined \u201cBilly Graham\u2019s Daughter: \u20189/11 Was God\u2019s Punishment for Trans People, Evolution, and Secularism,'\u201d while the article itself reported that:\n\nAnne Graham Lotz, the daughter of famed evangelist Billy Graham, appeared on right wing pundit Steve Deace\u2019s radio show to remind listeners that God has forsaken the U.S. because of transgenders, the teaching of evolution, the gays, etc. Lotz said she hopes that \u201csome of this craziness would settle down\u201d in the U.S., which, according to her, \u201cseems to be shaking its fist in God\u2019s face and telling him to get out of our politics, get out of our schools, get out of our businesses, get out of our marketplace, get off the streets\u2026\u201d She warned that when people abandon God, \u201cGod abandons us and he backs away and takes his hand of favor, blessing, his hand of protection away from us and he abandons us.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Huffington Post ran a story with a headline declaring that (according to Lotz) \u201cGod Sends Terror Attacks Because of Bathroom Rights and Evolution,\u201d but the body of the article couched her comments in somewhat different terms:\n\nTerror attacks such as 9/11 and the mass shooting in San Bernardino were allowed by God because of the gay rights movement and the acceptance of evolution, evangelist Anne Graham Lotz said. \u201cOur nation seems to be shaking its fist in God\u2019s face and telling him to get out of our politics, get out of our schools, get out of our businesses, get out of our marketplace, get off the streets,\u201d Lotz told conservative radio host Steve Deace, according to audio posted online by Right Wing Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s just stunning to me the way we are basically abandoning God as a culture and as a nation.\u201d When that happens, \u201cGod abandons us and he backs away and takes his hand of favor, blessings, His hand of protection away from us and he abandons us,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough both articles accurately quoted Lotz\u2019s statements, their headlines were misleading. At no point did Lotz claim that God \u201csends\u201d terror attacks, nor did she claim that 9/11 was \u201cGod\u2019s punishment\u201d for America\u2019s acceptance of transgender people, evolution, or secularism.\n\nShe did, on the other hand, assert a direct connection between those social phenomena (which she characterized as proof of America \u201cabandoning God\u201d) and God withdrawing his \u201cprotection\u201d from America, hence allowing catastrophic events to happen.\n\nHere are transcripts of the relevant portions of the interview (based on audio files hosted by the website Right Wing Watch):\n\nOn 9/11: \u201cWe\u2019re struggling with our own pride or self-sufficiency. I think that\u2019s why God allows bad things to happen. I think that\u2019s why He would allow 9/11 to happen, or the dreadful attack in San Bernardino, or some of these other places, to show us that we need Him. We\u2019re desperate without Him.\u201d\n\nOn Transgender People:: \u201cThere is silliness, there is craziness, there\u2019s the most illogical rulings. The one in North Carolina on HB2, which is to protect our children in bathrooms and locker rooms, has become something where the Justice Department is suing us for something that\u2019s just common sense.\u201d\n\nOn Evolution: \u201cRomans I describes a person or a nation that refuses to acknowledge God as God, refuses to thank God, exchanges Him, or worship of Him, for four-footed creatures or animals, which is basically evolution, so that we\u2019re saying there is no God, we\u2019re not accountable to God, we\u2019re not going anywhere, we came from nothing. And then you begin this downward spiral away from God.\u201d\n\nOn Secularism and America\u2019s \u201cAbandonment\u201d of God:\n\nOur nation seems to be shaking its fist in God\u2019s face and telling Him to get out of our politics, get out of our schools, get out of our businesses, get out of our marketplace, get out of our streets. It\u2019s just stunning to me, the way we are just abandoning God as a culture and as a nation, because when we do that, the Bible says God abandons us, and He backs away and takes His hand of favor, blessing, His hand of protection away from us, and He abandons us. So that the hope is that when we cry out to Him in deep repentance and humility and say, \u201cGod, we\u2019re sorry, and we\u2019re asking you to come back, and would you return to us, would you once again bless us,\u201d then I think there would be peace on our streets, and there would be, in our leadership, a caring about what\u2019s best for the nation instead of their own agendas. I think He would begin to reveal the plots of our enemies and terrorists before they\u2019re carried out. He can even control the weather patterns and protect us from these violent storms that are taking human life.\n\nSome critics will still object to Lotz\u2019s theological interpretation of these events, but such disputes are more legitimately founded on what was actually said than on contentious misrepresentations of what was said.\n\nFull Disclosure: The author of the DeadState article referenced above is the brother of a Snopes staff member.", "lang": "en"}
