However, few have dismissed the threat more resolutely than Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenka, who referred to alarm about to the pandemic as a \u201cpsychosis.\u201d\n\nOn March 16, Lukashenka offered a group of government officials advice for dealing with the coronavirus. While his first recommendation \u2013 \u201cWash your hands more often\u201d \u2013 is solid and widely accepted, others were less conventional.\n\nFor example, he advised:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a drinker, but I\u2019ve jokingly been saying lately that vodka should be used not only for washing your hands, but [drinking]. 40-50 grams a day of pure alcohol will poison the virus. But [don\u2019t drink] at work.\u201d\n\nThe president recommended visiting dry saunas, and doing farm work.\n\n\u201cPeople on tractors are working, nobody is talking about the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cThere the tractors will cure everybody. The field cures everyone!\u201d\n\nLukashenka made his comments in response to the news that Russia had closed its border with Belarus. He appeared unmoved as Russia began to close universities and initiate lockdowns.\n\nOn March 28, he was playing hockey and gave a short rink-side interview to a reporter who asked him if coronavirus could keep him off the ice.\n\n\u201cMe? Why? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cHere there aren\u2019t any viruses!\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that sports, especially on the ice, were the \u201cbest real anti-viral medicine.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, Lukashenka said he wanted to keep businesses working so people would get paid, invoking what he called the \u201cTrump formula.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really liked how he (Trump) openly said if we don\u2019t immediately begin to work, then more people will die of hunger and unemployment than from coronavirus,\u201d he said.\n\nLukashenka may have been inspired by comments Trump made earlier, when he said he wanted an Easter Sunday deadline to reopen the U.S.\n\nAs of April 2, Belarus reportedly had 254 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and four deaths, with over 30,000 people tested since the end of January. The four patients who died were described as elderly and with multiple chronic health conditions.\n\nLukashenka is not the only leader to depart from convention on COVID-19.\n\nTurkmenistan has declared it has no infections from the virus. To drive the point home, its government has reportedly banned the public use of the word \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d as well as behavior like wearing protective masks.\n\nThe country is ruled by strongman Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and has one of the worst environments for press freedom. According to the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, \u201cIt's as if (coronavirus) had never existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state media are saying nothing about the effects of coronavirus in Turkmenistan and the word has even been removed from health information brochures distributed in schools, hospitals and workplaces, according to Turkmenistan Chronicles, one of the few sources of independent news, whose site is blocked within the country.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
