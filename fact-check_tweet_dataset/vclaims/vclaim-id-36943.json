It has been shared almost 2,000 times.\n\nBut the EU election results are a far from perfect measure for whether people would vote to leave or remain, and some of the method behind this post\u2019s calculations are suspect.\n\nThe claim is based on working out the Brexit position of each party that stood in the elections, and then establishing the collective number of votes cast for parties that support leave and remain respectively.\n\nThe post counts Labour votes\u201414% of the total\u2014as \u201cleave votes\u201d, whatever that means, but this may not be fair given that Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit is widely considered to be unclear.\n\nYou could argue that it stood on a pro-Brexit platform because it supported an \u201calternative plan\u201d for Brexit (\u201ca new comprehensive customs union with a UK say\u201d). But, at the same time, the Labour manifesto said it \u201cbacks the option of a public vote\u201d if it failed to get an \u201cagreement along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election\u201d. Labour has also said it would \u201ccontinue to oppose\u201d no deal Brexit and Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement.\n\nOnly 13% of respondents told a YouGov survey that Labour\u2019s Brexit position was \u201cvery clear\u201d or \u201cfairly clear\u201d. 17% said the same for the Conservatives, and 59% said the same for the Brexit Party. We can\u2019t say with confidence what Labour party voters might have thought they were voting for in terms of Brexit.\n\nPeople might vote for a party for reasons other than Brexit\n\nThe post also assumes that every vote cast in the EU parliamentary elections in the UK was cast on the basis of a party\u2019s Brexit position, which isn\u2019t a certainty.\n\nSome of the parties\u2019 manifestos, for example, covered wider domestic and European issues, beyond Brexit.\n\nPolling from Lord Ashcroft shows that Brexit wasn\u2019t the main reason why people voted for many of the major parties.\n\nOf the six best-supported parties, only among Liberal Democrat voters was the number one reason for voting for them because \u201cthey had the best policy on Brexit\u201d. For Labour and the Conservatives, the number one reason was \u201cI always vote for that party\u201d, and for the Greens it was \u201cthey had the best policies on issues other than Brexit\u201d. For the Brexit Party, the top reason was \u201cI wanted to show my dissatisfaction with the UK government\u2019s current negotiating position on Brexit\u201d.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might want to be cautious about reading too much into the results as well.\n\nFor example, turnout was relatively low compared to other types of public vote\u2014so the results don\u2019t necessarily reflect attitudes of the electorate as a whole\u2014and people don\u2019t necessarily vote in the same way in an EU parliamentary election as they would in a referendum or general election.
