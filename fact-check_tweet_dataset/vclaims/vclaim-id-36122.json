The government\u2019s announcement set out that, compared to this year, spending would be \u00a32.6 billion higher in 2020/21, \u00a34.8 billion higher the year after, and \u00a37.1 billion higher in 2022/23.\n\nThat all adds up to \u00a314.5 billion, but, as we\u2019ve said before when the government made similar claims about the NHS, adding up multiple years funding is an unhelpful way to look at the spending increase. A number of news outlets chose not to report the \u00a314 billion figure for that reason.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, adding several years of spending together is simply not the normal way politicians talk about spending increases. They most commonly refer to spending on a per-year basis, or talking about the difference between the first and final year of spending. It\u2019s not factually wrong\u2014but it could be misleading.\n\nSpending is planned to increase by \u00a37.1 billion between now and 2022/23, but that also doesn\u2019t account for inflation (the change in how much things cost over time).\n\nThe \u00a37 billion increase in spending by 2022/23 is actually \u00a34.3 billion once inflation is accounted for, according to the IFS.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said: \u201cSince 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England.\n\n\u201cThe new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
