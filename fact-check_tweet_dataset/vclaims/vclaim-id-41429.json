The claim circulated from June 30 to July 1, 2019, and it had been shared on Facebook 12 times by the following groups and pages:\n\nThe article, however, is rehashed content from 2016. Rappler found an earlier version on the website Favradio Global (one.favradiofm.com) dated June 26, 2016. It cited two other websites as its sources: TRENDINGNEWSPHFILE (philippinesnewsportal2016.blogspot.com) and Worldinfographix (worldinfograpix.blogspot.com). The latter is not accessible anymore.\n\nThe facts: The Aquino administration obtained a $500-million loan from World Bank in 2013, but this information was not hidden from the public. The debt figures cited by the blog were also inaccurate.\n\nIn November 2013, the World Bank approved a $500-million budget support loan to the Philippines for reconstruction and overall recovery from the onslaught of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). It was not a \u201csecret\u201d since the World Bank released a brief about it, and it was announced on local news reports.\n\nMoreover, the blog was wrong to say that billions of dollars worth of debt was incurred \u201cunder the Aquino administration.\u201d Economist JC Punongbayan explained it is wrong to attribute the entire country's debt to one administration as it is a \"running total\" of how much it still owes. (READ: FALSE: Pie chart of Philippines' national debt under 3 presidents)\n\nAs such, only the \"net addition\" or \"net increase\" to the debt should be considered since new debt is incurred at any point of time as old debt gets paid, according to Punongbayan.\n\nThe public debt figure cited in the blog was also lot higher than the official data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The blog said that public or national debt stood at $163 billion in early 2016. BSP data, however, shows that the total debt of the country only ranged from $123 to $126 billion in the first 6 months of 2016.\n\nUsing these figures, however, the net increase in the country\u2019s total debt under the Aquino administration from July 2010 to June 2016 was only P1.3 trillion, or $28.6 billion if converted using end-of-month foreign exchange rates in June 2016. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
