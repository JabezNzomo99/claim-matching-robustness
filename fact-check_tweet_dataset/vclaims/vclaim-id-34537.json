Don\u2019t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump also tweeted the quote in 2013.\n\nJefferson\u2019s estate at Monticello considers it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d It actually comes from Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz.\n\nThe internet is replete with both genuine and apocryphal quotes attributed to the founding fathers. The quote attributed to Jefferson in the Facebook post appears to fall into the latter group.\n\nYet, while Jefferson coined many oft-quoted sayings, there\u2019s no evidence he ever said or wrote this particular statement. The Daily Caller found no matching or similar phrases in the Papers of Thomas Jefferson. It doesn\u2019t appear in his collected letters or quotes either.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, includes the statement on its \u201cspurious quotations\u201d list. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018Nothing Can Stop The Man With The Right Mental Attitude From Achieving His Goal\u2019?)\n\n\u201cThis statement can be unequivocally attributed to Witold Gombrowicz,\u201d reads the Monticello website. \u201cHow it came to be attributed to Thomas Jefferson is unclear.\u201d\n\nThe statement does, in fact, appear in a 1959 entry of Gombrowicz\u2019s published diaries, in which he wrote, \u201cDo you want to know who you are? Don\u2019t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you. You will find out from your actions. But you must act as an \u2018I,\u2019 as an individual, because you can be certain only of your own needs, inclinations, passions, necessities.\u201d\n\nThe quote has been misattributed to Jefferson since at least 2003, according to Monticello.", "lang": "en"}
