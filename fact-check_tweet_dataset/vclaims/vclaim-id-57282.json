Netizens are criticising the viral photograph along with the government for its lack of focus on homeless children.\n\nThe caption in the Malayalam language to one such image uploaded on Facebook translates to English as, \u201cImage shows the condition of children in Indian slums.

A vagabond appears to contradict the right to life and freedom of movement, which are guaranteed as fundamental rights by the Bangladeshi constitution. There are allegations of physical, mental, and even sexual torture against people in shelter centers.\"\n\nWe also found the image featured in the Daily Mail on July 10, 2014.\n\nBesides, several other websites publishing award-winning environment photographs have also featured the viral picture with the claim that it is from Bangladesh.\n\nHence, the photograph showing the miserable condition of children inside cement pipes is a seven-year-old picture, taken in 2014 in Bangladesh and is not related to India.\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: Did Kashmir witness stone-pelting like this viral post claims?\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: Has Russia gifted 1 million doses of Covid vaccine to Pakistan?", "lang": "en"}
