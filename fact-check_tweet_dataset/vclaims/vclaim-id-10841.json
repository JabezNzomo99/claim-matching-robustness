And I think they were going a different route. But now they\u2019re going the route of ordering from us,\u201d Trump said, while summing up some of the accomplishments of his Asian tour before leaving the Philippines.\n\nCuriously, though, no such deal can be found on the Boeing website, where such major deals are usually announced.\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office for clarification, but did not hear back.\n\nA Boeing spokesman told us it\u2019s possible the president may have been referring to future sales. However, he declined to comment on what future orders might look like, saying Boeing never comments on discussions it is having with its customers.\n\nEven if there are discussions underway for future deals, nothing has been finalized to the point where the president could claim \u201cVietnam is ordering at least $12 billion worth of Boeings.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what we can say.\n\u2022 In 2016, Boeing announced a deal to sell $11.3 billion worth of planes to VietJet. That deal was formally finalized during a visit to Vietnam by Obama. If that\u2019s what Trump was referring to, it was misleading for him cite it among the accomplishments of his trip to Vietnam.\n\u2022 Among the deals formally announced in Vietnam, VietJet and Vietnam Airlines both announced contracts to buy airplane engines from Pratt & Whitney, a company based in Hartford, Connecticut. The deals total $2.1 billion. But no deals between Vietnam and Boeing were publicly announced during Trump\u2019s trip to the country.\n\u2022 During Trump\u2019s stop in China, Boeing and China announced an agreement for that country to purchase 300 Boeing airplanes valued at $37 billion. But that\u2019s China, not Vietnam, and it is in keeping with a 20-year projection formulated prior to Trump taking office.\n\nThe president has repeatedly boasted that his 12-day trip to Asia resulted in $300 billion worth of trade deals. Although the figure is unconfirmed, Trump later claimed the deals would end up being much more than that.\n\nDuring the press gaggle in the Philippines on Nov. 14, Trump said: \u201c[A]nd we have at least $300 billion worth of deals, but that will be, I think, way [sic] triple that number in a fairly short period of time.\u201d Less than an hour later, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \u201cWe actually sold $300 billion worth of equipment and other things. And I think that number is going to be quadrupled very quickly. So that\u2019s over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of stuff.\u201d\n\nBut experts warn not to put too much stock in the announcement. As Bloomberg News put it, \u201cThe reality, however, is that the roughly 15 agreements unveiled on Thursday [in China] are mostly non-binding memorandums of understanding and could take years to materialize \u2014 if they do at all.\u201d\n\nWe asked the White House for a breakdown of those deals, but we did not hear back.\n\nScott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, told us via email that while the $250 billion in memorandums of understanding signed in China, for example, is a lot of money, \u201cnone of these reflect new market openings or should be seen as solidifying the U.S.-China economic relationship.\u201d\n\nAs for Vietnam, a White House press release said the United States and Vietnam concluded \u201c$12 billion in commercial agreements, which when implemented will include $10 billion in United States content.\u201d\n\nA press pool report from Vietnam included this list of agreements provided by the Vietnamese government:\n\nNone of those include Boeing. The list does include two deals with the aerospace company Pratt & Whitney to purchase aircraft engines and support services.\n\nOne contract was with Vietnam Airlines for engines for 20 planes, a deal worth $1.5 billion. Here are the press releases from Vietnam Airlines and Pratt & Whitney.\n\nThe second deal was with VietJet for the purchase of engines to power 10 new aircraft, a deal valued at $600 million. Here are the press releases from VietJet and Pratt & Whitney.\n\nThose deals come to $2.1 billion, but they are not with Boeing \u2014 which makes Trump\u2019s comment about a $12 billion deal between Vietnam and Boeing all the more puzzling.\n\nHere\u2019s the context of Trump\u2019s claim about the deal during a press gaggle in Manila, Philippines.\n\nBut again, we could find no evidence that such a deal exists \u2014 at least not one that Trump could list among accomplishments of his Asian trip, or that happened recently under Trump\u2019s leadership, as the comment \u201cnow they\u2019re going the route of ordering from us\u201d would suggest.\n\nAs we said, there was a similar-sounding deal announced on May 23, 2016, during then-President Obama\u2019s trip to Vietnam. On that day, Obama and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, witnessed the deal, and Boeing put out a press release about it.\n\nIf that\u2019s the deal Trump was referring to, he\u2019s double-dipping.\n\nBoeing officials did make the trek to Asia for Trump\u2019s visit. During remarks in Tokyo, Japan, on Nov. 6, Trump noted that Japan was the second largest owner of Boeing aircraft behind the U.S., and he singled out a Boeing executive for applause.\n\nWhile Trump was in Beijing, China signed an agreement for the purchase of 300 airplanes from Boeing valued at $37 billion. The signing took place at a ceremony in Beijing attended by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to a press release from Boeing. In September 2016, Boeing projected China would have demand over the next 20 years for 6,810 planes valued at over $1 trillion, so the announcement is consistent with previously announced plans.\n\nPrior to his Asian trip, Trump and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met on Oct. 23 at the White House, where Singapore Airlines was named as the previously \u201cunidentified customer\u201d of 39 new Boeing planes \u2014 a deal worth $13.8 billion at current list prices. The deal was formally announced at a White House ceremony, and Boeing put out a press release the same day.\n\nNone of this, however, accounts for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cVietnam is ordering at least $12 billion worth of Boeings.\u201d Unless he was talking about the deal in 2016 that was formally agreed to during Obama\u2019s visit to the Southeast Asian country. That, or he was talking prematurely about future sales.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this post if the White House provides more information.", "lang": "en"}
