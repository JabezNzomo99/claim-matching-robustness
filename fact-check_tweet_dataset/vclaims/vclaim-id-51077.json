They have begun evicting people from their homes. The media doesn't show it, they are being sold so it is our responsibility now to share this video.\" The video is viral on Facebook with the NRC narrative.\n\nAccording to a report in the Hindu, the NRC for Assam was published on August 31 last year and excluded 19,06,657 people. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.\n\nThe same footage is doing the rounds on Instagram as well.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video is not from Assam, as the insignia seen on the police uniform did not match that of Assam Police's.\n\nWe then broke the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search on Yandex, a Russian search engine. We were directed to the same video that was uploaded to Twitter on August 2 last year. The user identified that the incident happened in Jaipur, Rajasthan.\n\nUpon a custom ranged time filter and a relevant keyword search, we were then led to another tweet featuring the same video. According to the description of the tweet, the incident occurred in Samriya Road, Kanota (Jaipur), where police demolished illegal constructions.\n\nIn fact, Jaipur Police replied to the same tweet, with a news report from Hindi daily Patrika. According to the article, the video is part of an anti-encroachment drive that was initiated by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) in August last year. Cops demolished walls which were illegally built beyond the permissible limit, under the drive. The article also stated that people tried to disrupt the drive by bringing women to the forefront.", "lang": "en"}
