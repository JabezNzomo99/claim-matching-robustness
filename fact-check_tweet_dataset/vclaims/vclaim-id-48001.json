There is no mention of the three U.S. politicians in testimony from his sentencing trial either.\n\nKnown by the nickname \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is the former head of the Sinaloa cartel, widely considered one of the world\u2019s most powerful drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nHe was convicted on 10 counts related to federal drug offenses in February, following extradition to the U.S. and a lengthy trial, reports The Associated Press. The Facebook post, which likely stems from another post that garnered more than 30,000 shares, claims that Guzm\u00e1n testified in court that he gave millions of dollars to Clinton, Pelosi and Schiff.\n\nThe drug kingpin, however, never testified that he made payments to U.S. politicians.\n\nIn fact, Guzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t take the stand at any point in his three-month trial. He was listed as a potential witness for the defense but never actually testified, according to reports from numerous media outlets. His defense team only called one witness, and it was an FBI agent, not Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nColombian drug lord Alex Cifuentes Villa testified that Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cartel bribed numerous Mexican officials, including former Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, but there is no mention of the three U.S. politicians\u2019 names at any point.\n\nA search for Pelosi, Schiff and Clinton\u2019s names in the transcript of his July sentencing hearing also yielded no instances.", "lang": "en"}
