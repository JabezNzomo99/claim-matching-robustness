It shows a man tripping and then landing clumsily on his head while he tries to hop on a camel.\n\nThe video is being shared far and wide with different claims -- most of them associating it with the election campaign and candidates in the fray. Some netizens have claimed that the man who fell from the camel's back is Rajasthan BJP leader Harish Singh.\n\nSome others also claimed that the man is Rajasthan Congress leader Hari Singh.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AWFA) has found this claim to be totally false. The video has nothing to do with any election campaigning. The incident actually happened during a wedding in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAmong many others, the video was posted by a Facebook page 'Courageous Indian'. The video has already been shared in thousands from different Facebook profiles.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the same video was also used with misleading claims during the Rajasthan Assembly elections. However, the details about the video could not be ascertained then. This time around, AFWA managed to track down the exact details about the video and identified the person in the video.\n\nLooking closely at the video on which the soundtrack of a Hindi film song has been overlaid for the pun, we can see a TikTok ID nadeemmg07\u2019. We found that the TikTok ID has a link to an Instagram profile nadeem_mg04\u2019.\n\nWe reached out to Nadeem over Instagram chat and asked for details of the video that he posted. For reasons not known to us, Nadeem refused to reveal much about the video -- except a vital clue. He claimed that the video is from his village Sawayaya Hasan near Unchahar in Raebareli district of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nWorking on this clue, we scanned Google Maps for any information regarding Sawayaya Hasan. The village is 38 kilometre from Raebareli on NH-30.\n\nWe did find some pictures of a school and a mosque along with contact details about this village posted on public platforms. Among them were a few pictures of Mecca Masjid with a mobile number of the person who posted it.\n\nWhen we called on this number, one Altaf from Mumbai answered the phone. Altaf confirmed that he belongs to Sawayaya Hasan and works in Mumbai.\n\nAsked about the video of the man falling off the camel's back, he confirmed that the man is indeed from his village. To know further details about the video, Altaf shared the mobile number of his friend, Azmain Khan, who lives in the village.\n\nWhen we spoke to Azmain, who runs a chicken shop in the village, he immediately confirmed to us that the man being claimed a party candidate in the viral video is one Vakil Ahmed Khan from the same village.\n\nAzmain said he was also present at the time of the incident. He confirmed to India Today that the incident happened around Diwali last year during a wedding function in which he was also invited.\n\nAccording to Azmain, they had gone to Shahjadpur village in Kaushambi district for the wedding as 'barati' (groom's family and friends). The bride's family had arranged for camels and horses for them. A few people took the camel ride but the moment Vakil Khan tried to hop on the camel's back, he could not maintain his balance and fell upside down.\n\nThe hilarious moment was captured by someone on mobile.\n\nWith the help of Azmain, we reached out to Vakil Khan. He confirmed the incident.\n\nVakil Ahmed Khan, a businessman, lives in Mumbai and is associated with a political party. However, relating this video to an election campaign is just a figment of the imagination.\n\nREAD | China never shot down an Indian satellite as being claimed", "lang": "en"}
