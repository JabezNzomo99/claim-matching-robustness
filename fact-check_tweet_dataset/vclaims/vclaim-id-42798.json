In the 1990s, the Air Force released reports that concluded the likely source of the wreckage was a \u201cballoon-launched classified government project designed to determine the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research,\u201d per a Government Accountability Office report.\n\nConspiracy theories about extraterrestrials, the government and the Roswell incident have circulated ever since. The Facebook post alleges that nine Democratic politicians were born nine months after the incident, in April 1948: former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, former President Bill Clinton, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Sen. Diane Feinstein, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former California Sen. Barbara Boxer.\n\n\u201cSee what happens when aliens breed with sheep and jackasses,\u201d the image then remarks. \u201cNo wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, none of the politicians listed were born in April 1948. Only two \u2013 Gore and Dean \u2013 were actually born in 1948, though not in that month.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Britannica, here are the the accurate birth dates for each politician:\n\nOther credible sources confirm the Encyclopedia Britannica\u2019s birth dates for the nine politicians.
