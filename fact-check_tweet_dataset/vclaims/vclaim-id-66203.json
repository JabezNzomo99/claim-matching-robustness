Eric Greitens recently announced the launch of a new website aimed at cutting the red tape that he believes is negatively impacting Missouri businesses. This is but one of the initiatives Greitens has taken to grow business in Missouri.\n\n\"Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places \u2026 in the rankings of the best states to do business,\" Greitens said in the Facebook Live video.\n\nAmong other lists regarding the best states to do business is Forbes and Chief Executive, both placing Missouri at 25, falling within the range calculated by CNBC for its 2016 and 2017 lists. Five other lists also saw an increase in ranking for Missouri.\n\nAnother site worth noting is Site Selection, which does not update its ranking until later this year. This could impact how progress is ultimately seen for states like Missouri.\n\nWhile consistent in nature, experts point out that compiling these rankings takes time, indicating that Greitens\u2018 \"mission to turn Missouri around,\" as his campaign website states, might not truly be all his doing.\n\n\"Much, if not most, of the data that goes into this ranking was collected more than six months ago. Thus, it may be a little premature to take credit for these changes,\" said Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.\n\n\"The issue of ranking states as \u2018best for business\u2019 makes for interesting reading, but I expect most serious economists would be skeptical of any one approach,\" said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.\n\nThe 10 categories are workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy, quality of life, technology and innovation, education, business friendliness, access to capital and cost of living. Each category comes with individual point weights. The rankings are based mainly on publicly available sources from federal databases.\n\n\"There are many of these studies with varying methodology and there is not usually a lot of solid economic research to back up most of them,\" McPheters said.\n\nMcPheters points out that, in order to see progress for a state, the numbers do not necessarily need to match up, but there must be a consistent improvement among the differing lists.\n\nGreitens, talking on Facebook Live about his first six months as Missouri governor, said, \"Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places \u2026 in the rankings of the best states to do business.\"\n\nCNBC moved Missouri up nine spots on its annual America\u2019s Top States for Business list. That\u2019s only one ranking, among many, that can be considered, and it\u2019s impossible to say that its methodology is perfect.\n\nExperts suggest that, while the methodologies of these lists vary significantly, it might be better to derive a decision if Missouri\u2019s ranking has increased on all of them, which is true among five other lists.", "lang": "en"}
