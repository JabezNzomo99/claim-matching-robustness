Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A toddler (Alan Kurdi) was murdered to start a fake propaganda in order to push refugees into European countries. Fact: According to news articles, the men involved in the human trafficking incident which eventually resulted in the sinking of the boat in which Alan Kurdi was present, were sentenced for the crime of \u201ckilling with eventual intent\u201d and nowhere in the article it is mentioned that the toddler was murdered. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nAccording to the news article which is shared in the post in support of the claim, three men who were involved in human trafficking incident back in 2015 which eventually resulted in the sinking of the boat in which Alan Kurdi was present are sentenced to 125 years each in prison. These men are sentenced for the crime of \u201ckilling with eventual intent\u201d. However, in the news article, it is nowhere mentioned that the toddler (Alan Kurdi) was murdered. With this, we can certainly say that the toddler was not murdered.\n\nIn the light of the latest riots which broke out in the Swedish city of Malmo on 29 August 2020, news related to refugees is being circulated across social media platforms with misleading claims.\n\nTo sum it up, the toddler (Alan Kurdi) a Syrian refugee kid was not murdered.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
