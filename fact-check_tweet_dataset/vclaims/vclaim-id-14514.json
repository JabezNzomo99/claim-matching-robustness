He claimed that the crowd surge at PM Modi\u2019s election rally in Jodhpur is illustrative of the neck and neck contest between the Congress party and BJP in the state. The tweet has now been deleted.\n\nIn response to Bagree\u2019s tweet, several individuals have claimed that the images are not representative of the recent PM Modi rally in Jodhpur on December 3, 2018 and that they date back to 2013.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News did a Twitter search for finding the images tweeted since November 28, 2013 with keywords, \u201cNarendra Modi and Jodhpur\u201d.\n\nAmit Malviya, BJP IT head and MLA Piyush Desai had tweeted one of the images on November 29, 2013 with the identical narrative.\n\nOne more image from a different angle was also tweeted by several individual users (1, 2) claiming it to be of PM Modi\u2019s rally in Jodhpur on November 29 & 30, 2013.\n\nOne Twitter handle, @Lala_The_Don had also tweeted the same image on December 3, 2018 with the same narrative as suggested by Bagree.\n\nWe found that the first two images posted by Rishi Bagree are from PM Modi\u2019s rally of year 2013 and not 2018.\n\nAccording to an individual user, this is a featured image of the video of the Kisan Hunkar Rally organized by Rashtriya Loktantrik Party founder Hanuman Beniwal, was posted on YouTube on Jan 29, 2018. Look at the image comparison posted below.\n\nUsing the Google reverse image tool, Alt News found that several video of the Kisan Hunkar rally in Barmer uploaded on various platforms have the identical featured image.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t independently verify this image, although it is certain that the image existed way back in January 2018 as the thumbnail of the video was posted at the same time.\n\nRishi Bagree has been repeatedly caught spreading misinformation on social media. A compilation of such instances can be read here. This time around he has not only shared pictures from PM Modi\u2019s 2013 rally but also tried to pass off a picture of Kisan Hunar rally by Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal as that of Modi\u2019s rally.", "lang": "en"}
