Some iterations of the claim read: \u201cBeware, Trump is really trying to use Covid-19 to suspend the elections and remain President for the next 4 years. BEWARE.\u201d\n\nLegally, it is Congress (not the President) that holds the power to determine the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner of holding Elections\u201d, according to the Constitution. Congress could delegate this authority to the President but only by changing the law. This fact-check will focus on the legality of postponement, as claims around Trump cancelling the election usually imply his rescheduling it for a later date or staying in power for up to another four years.\n\nAccording to Article II, \u00a71, cl. 4 of the Constitution of the United States: \u201cThe Congress may determine the Time of chusing the [Presidential] Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States\u201d. ( here) . Election Day 2020 is scheduled for November 3. As 3 U.S. Code \u00a7 1 establishes: \u201cThe electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President\u201d. ( here ).\n\nDouglas Spencer, a Professor of Law at Yale Law School, told Reuters it would be up to Congress to amend this law (3 U.S. Code \u00a7 1 ) in order to change the date of the Presidential election this year. \u201cPresident Trump can put political pressure on Congress to change the date but he can\u2019t do it himself unilaterally,\u201d he said.\n\nCongress could technically extend the ability to postpone an election to the Executive, as mentioned in this 2004 Congressional Research Service report ( fas.org/sgp/crs/RL32471.pdf ). However, given the Democrats\u2019 current control of the House, as well as the possibility of legal challenges, this is extremely unlikely.\n\n\u201cIn theory, there\u2019s nothing stopping Congress changing its law about the timing of the election, either to postpone it or to delegate to the President the decision to postpone it,\u201d Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard Law Professor, told Reuters. \u201cBut in practice this would take the enactment of a new statute, which is extremely unlikely to happen in this time of extreme polarization and suspicion of the President.\u201d\n\nWhile Congress does hold the power to change the election date, it could not postpone it indefinitely. (See footnote 6. fas.org/sgp/crs/RL32471.pdf) The Constitution\u2019s 20th Amendment establishes an end date for the presidential term: \u201cThe terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January\u201d ( here ).\n\n\u201cIf Congress delayed the election until May 2021, President Trump wouldn\u2019t stay in office until a successor was named in May,\u201d Yale Law School\u2019s Douglas Spencer said. \u201cHis term ends on Jan. 20 no matter what (unless we amend the Constitution).\u201d\n\nSome iterations of the claim also mention Trump declaring a state of emergency for this purpose ( here ). This is also untrue. \u201cIf the President declares a state of emergency, he still wouldn\u2019t have the authority to change the date of elections. Congress has delegated a lot of authority to the President during emergencies, but not the authority to move elections,\u201d Spencer told Reuters.\n\nIt is true that states are able to determine the timing for primary elections, but federal law requires them to choose their presidential electors and give their votes \u201con the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December\u201d ( here ).\n\nMore than a dozen states in the U.S., including New York ( here ), Louisiana and Kentucky, have already rescheduled their primary elections amidst the coronavirus outbreak ( here ). A list of states postponing primaries can be seen here .\n\nIn the past, local elections have been postponed due to emergencies. In 2001, New York City postponed its mayoral primary election by two weeks following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center ( here ). Elections have been held under unique circumstances, like the 1918 midterms during the Spanish influenza outbreak (here) and the presidential elections after Superstorm Sandy in 2012 ( here ).\n\nThe U.S. government recently devoted $400 million to bolster mail-in and early voting, expand facilities and hire more poll workers, as part of a $2.2-trillion coronavirus stimulus bill. ( here )\n\nFalse: US President Donald Trump can\u2019t suspend or cancel the November election. The power to postpone an election is held by Congress and any changes past January would require changing the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
