That\u2019s according to both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Audit Office.\n\nYou can look at the budget in a number of ways. As we\u2019ve discussed before, you can look at the actual cash that\u2019s being spent on schools, the value of that cash after taking inflation into account, and how it divides down per pupil. Prices and pupil numbers are both rising, so these both create pressures on the funding that\u2019s needed.\n\nThe schools budget is set to rise in cash terms from about \u00a340 billion in 2015/16 to nearly \u00a343 billion in 2019/20, a record level. That\u2019s also a rise when you take expected inflation into account.\n\nBut once you factor in rising pupil numbers as well, the budget per pupil is set to fall.\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, \u201cthis will be the first time since the mid-1990s that school spending has fallen in real terms\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
