However, the British leader actually uttered the words \u201cpeople of talent\u201d.\n\nMultiple tweets, including some we\u2019ve archived here, here and here, were shared hundreds of times in the United Kingdom on December 6, 2019.\n\n\u201cVile,\u201d says one tweet, which has since been deleted. \u201cMake no mistake, this man is a racist\u201d.\n\nMany of the tweets link to a video published by British broadcaster Channel 4 on December 6, 2019. The footage shows Boris Johnson -- who is fighting for re-election in the UK\u2019s upcoming vote on December 12, 2019 -- talking to a crowd in Derbyshire, England.\n\nAccording to Channel 4\u2019s subtitles, Johnson says, \u201cI\u2019m in favour of having people of colour come to this country, but I think we should have it democratically controlled\u201d.\n\nThe apparent remarks caused outrage on Twitter, with the terms \u201cpeople of colour\u201d and \u201ctalent\u201d trending in the UK on December 6, 2019.\n\nHowever, the broadcaster later removed the video and admitted making a \u201cmistake\u201d in this tweet.\n\nInternational fact-checking project CrossCheckUK spotted a better quality version of the video which makes it easier to hear what the prime minister is saying.\n\nIn the footage, Johnson clearly says \u201cpeople of talent\u201d and not \u201cpeople of colour\u201d.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative party has been hit by allegations of racism and Islamophobia in recent weeks.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, The Guardian published details of \u201cinflammatory\u201d social media posts from current and former Conservative councillors.\n\nAccording to the British newspaper, comments included calling for mosques to be banned and referring to famine in Africa as \u201cnature\u2019s way of depopulation\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
