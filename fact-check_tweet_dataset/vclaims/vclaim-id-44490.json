You know it turns out the flu vaccine isn\u2019t that effective in elderly people; we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they\u2019re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don\u2019t have side effects, you know, if we have one in 10,000 side effects, that\u2019s\u2026 way more, 700,000, ah\u2026 people who will suffer from that. And that actual decision of, OK, let\u2019s go and give this vaccine to the entire world \u2013 governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed \u201d\n\nThe video has been edited to cut out parts of Mr Gates\u2019s answer. Below is the full transcript from the relevant section of the interview. The full interview is on the CNBC website.\n\nThe relevant starts at the 11 minute, 36 second mark. The parts of Mr Gates\u2019s response left out in the Instagram video are shown in bold. Mr Gates says:\n\n\u201cThe efficacy in vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. You know it turns out the flu vaccine isn\u2019t that effective in elderly people; most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they\u2019re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.\n\n\u201cHere, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they\u2019re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don\u2019t have side effects. You know if we have one in 10,000 side effects, that\u2019s\u2026 way more \u2013 700,000\u2026 people who will suffer from that.\n\n\u201cSo, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges\u2026 \u2013 pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities \u2013 it\u2019s very, very hard. And that actual decision of, OK, let\u2019s go and give this vaccine to the entire world \u2013 governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.\u201d\n\nThe text in the Instagram post claims Mr Gates \u201cfreely admits\u201d a vaccine \u201cwill seriously injure or even kill upwards of 700,000 people\u201d. This is false. What Mr Gates says \u2013 evident even in the edited video \u2013 is that a vaccine is needed that works in older people \u201cand yet you don\u2019t have side effects\u201d. At no point does he say a vaccine will injure or kill upwards of 700,000 people.\n\nAlso edited out are the parts of Mr Gates\u2019s response that say \u201cunderstanding the safety at gigantic scale \u2026 it\u2019s very, very hard\u201d and governments will need to be involved because of the risk and indemnification needed \u201cbefore that (administering a vaccine) can be decided on\u201d.\n\nThe figure of 700,000 relates to a statement Mr Gates makes earlier in the interview, at the 9 minutes, 30 seconds mark. He says making seven billion doses of a vaccine (seven billion being close to the current global population of 7.7 billion) \u201cis going to be an incredible challenge\u201d.\n\nOne in every 10,000 people out of a population of seven billion people, equals 700,000 people.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Instagram post to be false. The post falsely claims Mr Gates said as many as 700,000 could die or be injured by a COVID-19 vaccine. Mr Gates makes no such statement. The video interview included in the post has been edited to remove his reference to the need to understand safety. The post also ignores the fact that Mr Gates says in the interview \u2013 even in the edited video \u2013 that a vaccine has to be developed in order that \u201cyou don\u2019t have side effects. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
