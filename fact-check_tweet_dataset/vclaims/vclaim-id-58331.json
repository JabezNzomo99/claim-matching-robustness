Dapat ang virus ang pigilan natin.\" (We should not restrain people from spreading out. We should restrain the virus.)\n\nThis quote was taken from her statement on March 12. In this speech, she did not say people should not be restrained. She called for work-from-home arrangements in favor of physical distancing.

The post became unavailable after Rappler sent them a message.\n\nThis is not the first time that this News5 graphic was altered to perpetuate a false quote attributed to Robredo. Rappler also debunked another false quote that claimed Robredo suggested \"inhaling back\" one's cough to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
