Investigations by international media outlets and volunteer organizations have found evidence of Russian involvement in Donbas.\n\nThe evidence includes social media posts by Russian soldiers and mercenaries or their families, as well as weapons, either photographed or captured, including types that were designed in Russia and never exported to Ukraine.\n\nRussia has not adequately explained how the rebels in Donbas acquired so many sophisticated weapons systems, including tanks and heavy artillery. Russian officials have said the weapons were captured from Ukrainian army stockpiles, or, as Russia bizarrely argued at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, found in abandoned mines.\n\nAt his annual news conference in December 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the weapons, including tanks and artillery, came from countries that \u201csympathize\u201d with the self-proclaimed republics.\n\nHe did not identify those donor governments. In any case, the DNR and LNR have no functional airfields or seaports and share a land border with only one foreign country \u2013 Russia.\n\nUkraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Volodymyr Yelchenko, commented on the flow of Russian weapons to the Donbas in an Aug. 3 tweet.\n\n\u201cAnd given that, (Russia) is so concerned with US military supplies to Ukraine that it threatens to do the same to the militants, as if they don't have enough of (Russia\u2019s) weapons already,\u201d Yelchenko tweeted.\n\nRussia\u2019s insistence that the conflict in Donbas is a \u201ccivil war,\u201d and its repeated denials about sending military supplies and manpower to sustain the now six-year-long conflict, have become an object of ridicule by Russia and Ukraine watchers.\n\n\u201cDarth Putin\u201d (@DarthPutinKGB), a parody Twitter account with more than 120,000 followers, has long made the seemingly endless supply of ammunition, fuel, and other crucial war materials to the \u201crebels\u201d a running gag.\n\nWar broke out in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region months after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in March 2014. So-called \u201cpro-Russian\u201d forces in Donbas were initially commanded by Igor Girkin, a former colonel in the Russian intelligence service who then went by the alias \u201cStrelkov.\u201d In November 2014, Girkin told the Russian newspaper Zavtra that there would not have been a war in the Donbas without his intervention.\n\nRussia intervened directly in the conflict in August 2014, both with regular troops and artillery fire from across the border, after Russian proxy forces lost much of the territory they\u2019d captured that spring. The intervention would lead to a Ukrainian military defeat that came to be known as the battle of Ilovaisk. The last major intervention of regular Russian forces came in early 2015, during the battle of Debaltseve.\n\nOne of the clearest instances of Russian weapons being used in the Donbas happened on July 17, 2014, when a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) over eastern Ukraine while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 aboard. The international Joint Investigative Team charged with investigating the incident determined that the airliner was shot down by a Russian-made Buk M1 SAM system provided by Russia\u2019s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade.\n\nIn March 2020, a Dutch court charged three Russian nationals (including Igor Girkin) and a Ukrainian national in absentia with causing the deaths of MH17\u2019s 298 passengers and crew. The trial is ongoing.\n\nIn July 2015, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly voted to condemn what it called Russia\u2019s \u201cunilateral and unjustified assault on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations estimates that more than 13,000 people have been killed in the Donbas conflict.", "lang": "en"}
