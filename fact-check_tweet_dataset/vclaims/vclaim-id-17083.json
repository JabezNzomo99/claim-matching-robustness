Amitabh lent his shoulder to the body. Great man. Everyone has money but few people have humanity. Hats off to Amitabh.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral image is true, but Bachchan did not lose his domestic help. It was his secretary and manager Sheetal Jain who passed away earlier this month.\n\nFacebook user Ashutosh Mehta uploaded the post on June 22, claiming that Bachchan lost his servant\u2019 the day before. A photo of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan holding a stretcher carrying a body was also posted along with the claim.\n\nSome Facebook users have shared the post. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nAnother Facebook user, Kalale Purushotham shared the same photo with the same claim on June 23. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nAFWA found that Big B had himself written a blog about his associate of 40 years passing away on June 8. Bachchan had uploaded the picture that has been going viral and eulogised his secretary and manager Sheetal Jain in the blog.\n\nIn the blog Bachchan has written that Jain planned and sorted my schedules, films and important meetings with producers. It was him that we asked to represent us when it was not possible for the family to attend an occasion.\n\nSo it is clear that it was not a domestic help, but Bachchan\u2019s secretary and manager Sheetal Jain whose funeral the megastar attended.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Viral post warning Mumbai residents of robbers is a hoax\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Truth behind the viral video of Hindu girl set ablaze in Madhya Pradesh", "lang": "en"}
