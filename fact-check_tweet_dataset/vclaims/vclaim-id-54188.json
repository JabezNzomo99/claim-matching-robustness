That reference number will be used in the cash out process, which may be availed in Puregold, Tambunting, Palawan, or \u201ceven in a shop\u201d that has GCash cash out as an option.\n\nGCash is only one of the payout methods through which ESP beneficiaries can avail of their subsidies.\n\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the ESP\u2019s lead implementing agency, named the following partner financial service providers (FSPs) for the program: GCash, PayMaya, RCBC, Robinsons Bank, Starpay, and UnionBank.\n\nMaricel Deloria, assistant director of the DSWD\u2019s program management bureau, said in a July 21 press briefing that beneficiaries will be informed by the FSPs via text message if their subsidies are ready to be claimed. Different localities have different FSPs assigned to them.\n\nDSWD Spokesperson Irene Dumlao, who appears in the photo of the post, confirmed to Rappler that \u201cDswd Sap 2nd Tranche Update\u201d is not an official page of the agency.\n\nGCash issued an advisory on July 19 warning the public of a scam that involves people pretending to assist in distributing subsidies but will ask for account details and mobile personal identification number (MPIN).", "lang": "en"}
