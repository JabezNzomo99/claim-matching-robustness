Susan Collins (R-Maine), who faces a tough reelection race, has come under attack from a dark money group that does not need to disclose its donors. This ad follows a standard Democratic playbook of accusing the moderate Republican of jeopardizing programs for retirees in exchange for supporting a tax cut for big corporations. It ends with \u201cDavid,\u201d who says he\u2019s a cancer survivor, urging viewers to tell Collins to \u201cstop risking\u201d Social Security and Medicare.\n\nFirst, there is no dispute that the 2017 tax bill signed into law by President Trump, officially known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), included a big corporate tax cut. More than one-third of the $1.5 trillion cut reduced taxes for business interests. There had been bipartisan support for reducing corporate tax rates, although not to the extent that the GOP-crafted bill did.\n\nWhen David says Collins voted for a tax bill that puts Social Security and Medicare in jeopardy, the citation is the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC), with a date of Nov. 21, 2017. The center is widely respected for its analysis of how Americans of various income levels benefit from tax bills. But this citation does not appear to refer to one of those reports.\n\nFavreault faulted the tax bill for not being revenue-neutral, noting that \u201cSocial Security and Medicare already face funding challenges\u201d and so benefits could be cut in the future, especially if the government runs short of revenue. \u201cAdding to the nation\u2019s debt while our population is aging rapidly is ill-advised and maybe dangerous,\u201d she warned.\n\nShe said she was making the case that a deficit-financed tax cut was shortsighted. \u201cWe need to think about future needs and keep our promises to workers who contributed to these programs,\u201d she told The Fact Checker. \u201cIn my view, engaging in deficit spending to prioritize (to a very large extent) the short-run needs of some of the most well-off members of society at a time when the economy was not in recession was a missed opportunity. The tax cuts did not pay for themselves, so implicitly we left ourselves with less fiscal space for Social Security and Medicare.\u201d\n\nBut that vote did not deal with the issue raised by Favreault. \u201cWhile the point that Senator Collins sponsored the amendment is related, I do not think it affects my larger point,\u201d she said. \u201cThat amendment addressed a short-run Medicare issue. My focus was on the long run for these two programs.\u201d\n\nAs for the donations from corporations, the ad cites the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Corporations cannot contribute directly to candidates, but do so via political action committees. Indeed, the CRP shows that Collins has received nearly $7.3 million over the course of her career from business-associated PACs. But the contributions from individual company PACs are not that large. Blue Cross/Blue Shield tops the list with $76,000, followed by General Dynamics ($45,000), Ernst & Young (almost $42,000), Deloitte ($40,000) and FedEx ($47,500).\n\nUpdate: In an opinion article that was published in a Maine newspaper on Aug. 18, David Tuemmler responded to criticism by Collins of the ad. \u201cI was diagnosed with cancer more than three years ago. I have had nine surgeries and 55 radiation treatments. My medical care has cost more than $1 million,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t like folks pointing out that her vote for the tax law jeopardizes Medicare and Social Security, she should take that up with her boss, Sen. Mitch McConnell,\u201d he added, citing comments by McConnell that big entitlement programs were largely responsible for the growing deficit.\n\nThis is a cleverly crafted ad. It implies, but does not say directly, that corporate PAC campaign contributions swayed her vote. (There\u2019s no evidence to support that claim.) It also cites an opinion article that makes the valid case that a deficit-financed tax cut could put pressure on programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Just because the TCJA is deficit-financed does not mean benefits in the specific safety-net programs mentioned in the ad would be cut to achieve balance. All things being equal, Congress just as easily could reduce spending on any other program. In fact, given the politics involved, Social Security and Medicare might be the last programs to be cut. Moreover, Collins affirmatively took a step to protect Medicare from budget cuts \u2014 a fact unacknowledged by the ad.", "lang": "en"}
