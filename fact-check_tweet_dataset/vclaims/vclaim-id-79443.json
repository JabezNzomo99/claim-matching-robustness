Several Facebook users were sharing the video again in August on various Facebook groups.\n\nFacebook\u2019s monitoring tool, Claim Check, flagged Metro Showbiz\u2019s video on August 28 for fact checkers to verify. Claim Check data showed that the video had been shared on Facebook over 131,000 times over the last 4 months. The YouTube video also had 246,397 views as of writing.\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 2, Congress has not approved any measure that would allow ABS-CBN to broadcast on television again. Metro Showbiz\u2019s video wrongly claimed that a provisional franchise was granted to ABS-CBN in May.\n\nOn May 13, when Metro Showbiz\u2019s video was posted, lawmakers filed House Bill (HB) No. 6732 that sought to grant ABS-CBN a provisional franchise that would be valid until October 31, 2020. But even then there was no confirmation that the network would be able to go back on air since the bill was approved only on 2nd reading.\n\nCongress eventually dropped the bill on May 19, as lawmakers argued that hearings on ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise application would resume soon. The House committee on legislative franchises then rejected ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal application on July 10.\n\nABS-CBN has been off air since May 5, after the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order. The Supreme Court also recently junked the network\u2019s petition to void the NTC's shutdown order on August 25.\n\nThousands of employees have been laid off since May. On August 28, ABS-CBN stopped all its regional newscasts of TV Patrol programs, which had been airing via Facebook and YouTube after the shutdown order.\n\nA people's initiative was also launched to bring ABS-CBN back on air, but it is still in the process of gathering the needed 7 million signatures.
