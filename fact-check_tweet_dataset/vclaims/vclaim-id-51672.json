As of this writing, his tweet drew over 9,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets.\n\nThe painting has been shared in the aftermath of the Bengaluru riots triggered by an inflammatory post against Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, allegedly made by Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy\u2019s nephew Naveen. Three people were killed in police firing and over 300 have been arrested for the violence.\n\nPrior to Chaurasia\u2019s tweet, Krishna\u2019s derogatory painting was tweeted by NewsX anchor Shehzad Poonawallah who tagged the DGP of Assam and the Chief Minister\u2019s Office to take action against Hussain. The same was tweeted by ISKCON Long Island, New York. ISKCON Kolkata vice-president and spokesperson Radharamn Das requested BJP MLA Himanta Biswa to arrest Hussain.\n\nMadhu Kishwar, who has often been found sharing misinformation via her Twitter account, retweeted Arun Pudur\u2019s tweet alleging the same. \u201cThey are free to depict their Prophet with 72 hoors but keep their dirty hands and minds off our sacred symbols and deities,\u201d wrote Kishwar, enraged. Several other individuals who amplified the claim include BJP OBC Morcha Haryana vice-president Maya Yadav and Twitter users Karunesh Shukla, Manisha Mishra and Roop Darak.\n\nThe incident dates back to April 2015 when the Guwahati police had registered an FIR against painter Hussain Akram on the basis of a complaint filed by the Hindu Jagran Manch. \u201cThe artist has, however, immediately removed the painting and has apologised,\u201d said Guwahati DCP Amitabh Sinha as quoted by The Indian Express. \u201cThe police were now looking for Hussain, who reportedly hails from Goalpara. The state cultural directorate has instituted an inquiry to find out how such a painting was permitted in the State Art Gallery,\u201d the report adds.\n\nTaking cognisance of viral claims, Guwahati police tweeted that Hussain was arrested on May 30, 2015.\n\nFollowing the police\u2019s tweet, Deepak Chaurasia and ISKCON Long Island tweeted updates however their misleading tweets remain.\n\nHindi news organisations Amar Ujala and Punjab Kesari published the same report which said that ISKCON has demanded the arrest of Hussain Akram. The articles cite social media posts and neither clarify that the case is five years old nor that the accused was taken in custody.\n\nA few other websites like News Track and OpIndia also revived the case however they mentioned that the incident is from 2015.\n\nAn old inflammatory painting made by Assam-based Akram Hussain was widely shared by journalists, media outlets and BJP members and supporters. Hussain was arrested in 2015 but agitated individuals on Twitter tagged the police and CMO to take action against him. It\u2019s been less than a week since a mere Facebook post sparked violence in Bengaluru yet certain people thought it wise to revive an offensive painting from five years ago.", "lang": "en"}
