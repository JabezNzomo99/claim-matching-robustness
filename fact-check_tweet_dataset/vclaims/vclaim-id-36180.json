This is compared to 4% of participants who did not take any statins or blood pressure drugs during the study.\n\nAfter adjusting for risk factors, the researchers found that the odds of becoming obese was 82% (or 1.82 times) greater in people who began taking statins or blood pressure drugs compared to those who didn\u2019t take these drugs.\n\nBut finding that statins increase the risk of obesity by 82% is not the same as saying that 82% of people were more likely to become obese, as the Mirror reported. As we\u2019ve already noted, that number of participants who became obese over the course of the study was only 7% of the total.\n\nObesity is a measure of extreme weight, where a person\u2019s body mass index (weight in kilograms/height in metres squared) is more than 30. The researchers also looked at any weight gain and concluded that taking medication during the study was associated with an average increase of half an extra unit of body mass index.\n\nAs highlighted by some experts in this field of research, this study cannot be used to prove that statins or blood pressure drugs cause weight gain. The reasons why patients were prescribed the preventative medication was not accounted for in the study. These, and other unmeasured factors, may explain why participants who were prescribed drugs were more likely to gain weight.\n\nIn addition, as acknowledged in the paper, the findings cannot be applied to the wider population in Finland where the study was conducted (or the UK). This study recruited people who worked in the public sector and participants were mostly white, female and over 50 years old.", "lang": "en"}
