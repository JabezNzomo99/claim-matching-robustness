The first ad claimed the out-of-pocket costs were so high that \u201cit\u2019s unaffordable.\u201d When that line was questioned\u2014and Democrats demanded proof be given to television stations running the ad\u2014the issue became much fuzzier. Suddenly, it became \u201ca plan that doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d That is much more subjective and harder to fact check.\n\nThe problem with the original ad was two-fold. First, Boonstra, a cancer patient, suggested she had lost her \u201cwonderful doctor\u201d when in fact she could keep that doctor in the new plan. Second, her premiums were cut in half, from $1,100 a month to $571, and the savings were slightly more than the out-of-pocket costs permitted under the health care law. So it seemed highly suspicious that the costs were \u201cunaffordable.\u201d\n\nWe were led to believe that she had a Silver individual plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield but were not able to determine her actual plan, as AFP declined to document her claim. Instead, it merely asserted that her costs may be unpredictable in the future.\n\nIn an interview with the Dexter Leader responding to our column, Boonstra said: \u201cPeople are asking me for the numbers and I don\u2019t know those answers \u2014 that\u2019s the heartbreak of all of this. It\u2019s the uncertainty of not having those numbers that I have an issue with.\u201d\n\nBoonstra\u2019s response to this report was that it \u201ccan\u2019t be true\u201d because she was worried about high expenses early in the year and because she thought one of her prescription drugs was not covered. A spokesman for Blue Cross told the News that all of her prescriptions are covered and her co-pays on the drugs would help with meeting her out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nIn the meantime, her premium savings are building up every month. If the initial out-of-pocket costs were too high, she likely could have worked out a payment plan. But it is puzzling this still would be a mystery to her more than two months into the new plan.\n\nThe president\u2019s false Four-Pinocchio claim that people could keep their plans if they liked them has formed the core of many of AFP\u2019s claims. We understand that change can be confusing and that Boonstra was annoyed at having to sign up for a new plan. But it appears she jumped on television without trying to understand the basics about her new coverage. (Initially, she even seemed to believe she would have to pay 20 percent of the cost of a $350,000 bone marrow transplant, when in fact everything above the out-of-pocket maximum would be covered.)\n\nIn any case, one cannot claim that a plan is \u201cunaffordable\u201d when over the course of the year it will provide you with substantial savings. Thus we are changing the rating on this ad from Two Pinocchios to Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
