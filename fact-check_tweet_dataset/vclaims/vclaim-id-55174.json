It is being said that she is the daughter of singer Amit Kumar and the granddaughter of legendary singer Kishore Kumar.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The girl in the video is Ananya Sabnis, a singer from Mumbai.\n\nThe archived version of the Facebook post can be seen here.\n\nMany users in the comment section have said she is not Kishore Kumar's granddaughter but a singer from Mumbai called Ananya. Taking a clue from this, we searched for the Facebook page of Ananya Sabnis, and were able to connect with her mother Manisha Sabnis.\n\nWe sent her the viral video and she confirmed that the girl in it is her 14-year-old daughter Ananya. She said, \"My daughter Ananya has been training in music for the last seven years. She's a student of Bollywood singer Usha Timothy. She's a student of Class 9 and often performs in events.\"\n\nWe found the same video on the Facebook Page of Manisha Sabnis.\n\nSinger Amit Kumar's daughter is Muktika Ganguli who had made her singing debut in August 2015. Her album \"Baba Mere\" was dedicated to her grandfather Kishore Kumar. A song from the album that she had sung along with her father can be seen below.\n\nAmit Kumar had earlier shared a picture with his daughter Muktika on Twitter, which can be seen below. Looking at the picture, one can easily make out that Muktika looks entirely different from the girl in the viral video.\n\nLast year, singer Pickosa Moharkar was also falsely claimed to be the granddaughter of Kishore Kumar. That time too, several websites had debunked the claim.\n\nHence, it is clear that the girl in the viral video is not Kishore Kumar's granddaughter Muktika Ganguli but Mumbai singer Ananya Sabnis.", "lang": "en"}
