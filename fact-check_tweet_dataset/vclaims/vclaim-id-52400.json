In this case, a Facebook post makes a dubious claim about the nomenclature for the disease caused by the new coronavirus: that the acronym \u201cCOVID\u201d in COVID-19 stands for \u201cCertificate Of Vaccination Identification.\u201d\n\nThat is incorrect. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Feb. 11 that COVID-19 stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019,\u201d with the number \u201c19\u201d referring to the year the virus was first detected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website also states that COVID-19 stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now have a name for the disease and it is COVID-19. And I will spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a Feb. 11 press conference. \u201c\u2018CO,\u2019 C-O, stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 V-I stands for \u2018virus,\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018disease,\u2019 so \u2018COVID.'\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims COVID-19 Stands For \u2018Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease\u2019)\n\nThe post appears to reference a comment Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), made during an interview with CNN in April. At the time, Fauci discussed the possibility of Americans carrying digital certificates of COVID-19 immunity.\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s possible. It\u2019s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not,\u201d Fauci said in the interview. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates has also speculated that \u201ceventually we will have some digital certificates\u201d to track who has been tested or vaccinated for the new coronavirus, according to The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
