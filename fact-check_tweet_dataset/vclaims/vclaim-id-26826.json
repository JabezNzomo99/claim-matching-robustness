In the visit, Modi stressed on energy ties and balanced approach to resolve West Asia\u2019s conflicts.\n\nThe morphed image is viral on Facebook with a similar narrative.\n\nThe post can be seen here and its archive here.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the image has been edited as Modi looks blurred than the rest of the elements in the photograph.\n\nWe then ran a reverse image search and found that the original image was tweeted by Raveesh Kumar, the official spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs. The photograph was first tweeted by Kumar after Modi reached Riyadh as part of his one-day Saudi Arab trip. The prime minister can be seen being welcomed by Governor of Riyadh Prince Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud. In the photographs, Modi is not seen wearing the traditional headgear.\n\nThe same set of images were also tweeted by PMO's official Twitter handle on October 29.\n\nA similar morphed image of PM Modi arriving in Abu Dhabi wearing the keffiyeh was viral with false claims earlier.\n\nALSO READ: Morphed Image Of PM Modi\u2019s Arrival In Abu Dhabi Viral", "lang": "en"}
