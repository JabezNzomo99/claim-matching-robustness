There is little precedent for someone convicted of the specific crime of lying to Congress to again appear before Congress shortly afterward. But people who were found to have lied to Congress have returned before the body to testify, and lawmakers occasionally hear from convicted criminals.\n\nVery few people \u2014 six from the 1940s to the 2000s, according to one estimate \u2014 have been convicted of lying to Congress. Others were indicted but acquitted (for example, Roger Clemens, the baseball pitcher) or received presidential pardons (like officials in the Reagan administration involved in the Iran-contra affair).\n\nAmong this small group, at least two have testified to Congress after being charged. Elliott Abrams, the former assistant secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan and current envoy to Venezuela under President Trump, pleaded guilty in 1991 to withholding information from Congress, but testified to Congress this month. Robert McFarlane, Mr. Reagan\u2019s national security adviser, also pleaded guilty in 1988 to withholding information from Congress but testified before the Senate in 2002. Both men were pardoned by President George Bush.\n\nOther people who committed crimes other than lying to Congress and have testified before the body include Frank Costello, the mafia boss, in 1951; Joseph Michael Valachi, a mobster, in 1963; and Frank Abagnale, the former con artist and subject of Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cCatch Me If You Can,\u201d in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
