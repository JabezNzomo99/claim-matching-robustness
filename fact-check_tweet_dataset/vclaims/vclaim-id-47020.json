The claim is false; the video actually shows an incident in Italy in August 2018.\n\nThe 23-second video was published here on Twitter on June 13. It has been viewed more than 20,000 times.\n\nThe post's traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBreaking: Tanker truck explosion on highway in Daxi, Wenling, Zhejiang!\u201d\n\nThe video was shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here and here; on Twitter here and here; and on YouTube here and here.\n\nA tanker truck did explode on a highway in Wenling on June 13, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 170, as AFP reported here.\n\nHowever, the claim about the footage is false.\n\nReverse image and keyword searches found that the video in fact shows an accident that occured in Italy in 2018.\n\nSimilar footage was published on Twitter here on August 7, 2018, by Polizia di Stato, one of the national police forces of Italy. In the tweet, the police reported that the accident involved a vehicle that was \"transporting flammable substances.\"\n\nThe footage in the misleading post corresponds to the Twitter video between the 11- and 34-second marks.\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading post (L) and the footage from Polizia di Stato (R):\n\nThe accident was widely reported on by international and Italian media; for example here and here by Italian newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Provincia di Lecco.\n\nAFP also published the police video along with other footage from the blast here.\n\nThe stretch of highway where the accident occured, which is just outside the northern Italian city of Bologna, can be seen here on Google Street View.", "lang": "en"}
