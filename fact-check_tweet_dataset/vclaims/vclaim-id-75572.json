The tweet was accompanied with a picture that looked suspect.\n\nWhile several Twitter users claimed the image to be from Russia, a simple Google search shows that this image has been used by several websites including from Pakistan, claiming installation of LED lights.\n\nSM Hoax Slayer, a Twitter handle that calls out fake images on social media pointed it out to the minister, following which another user pointed out how the BJP has used a wrong image in the past as well\n\nWhile in the past, BJP members have either quietly deleted their tweets or refused to apologise, this time Piyush Goyal acknowledged his mistake and deleted his tweet.\n\nIt cannot be denied that BJP ministers and spokespersons are very social media savvy but have also faced flak for wrong images and posts on social media.\n\nDoes Rajkot Bus Stand Look Like A Swanky Airport?: A FactCheck\n\nHow BJP And Congress Used A Picture Of A Potholed Road To Target Each Other", "lang": "en"}
