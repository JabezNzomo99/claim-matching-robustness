Dennis Kucinich took to the floor of the House last month to warn against proposed austerity measures. The Cleveland Democrat said such spending cuts would repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression.\n\n \n\n \"Poor and middle-class Americans know all about the fiscal cliff,\" he said, because \"they've been getting pushed off it for years.\"\n\n \n\n Among examples he cited: \"Fourteen million Americans' mortgages are greater than the value of their homes.\"\n\n \n\n The recession officially ended more than three years ago.
