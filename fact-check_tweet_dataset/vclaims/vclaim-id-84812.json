My wife does our tax returns. We\u2019ve been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain\u2019t going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there\u2019s not going to be anything new in it that people haven\u2019t seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nSanders: \u201cNo, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, for example, has consistently refused to release his tax returns, saying it would be unwise to do so while his tax filings are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Trump released a letter from his tax attorneys saying the IRS is examining his tax filings since 2009, while filings between 2002 through 2008 \u201chave been closed administratively by agreement without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency.\u201d There is no prohibition against making public tax returns under IRS review and the letter did not explain why at least Trump\u2019s 2002-2008 filings have not been released.\n\nThat\u2019s about all the details available of Sanders\u2019s federal income tax records. A 1996 article in the Vermont publication \u201cSeven Days\u201d detailed Sanders\u2019s 1995 tax return, when he was a member of Congress. Sanders reported $125,843 in total income, according to the article, but it\u2019s unclear how the outlet obtained this information. (It may have been released by Sanders\u2019s previous campaign, but the current presidential campaign did not clarify when we asked.) [Note: We misidentified the office Sanders held at the time in an earlier version.]\n\nDuring the 2006 Senate race, Sanders said he would release his tax returns if his opponent did so, and his campaign had said it was a \u201cgood idea\u201d for political candidates to release their federal and state returns. But there is no indication that Sanders ever released his federal returns during that campaign.\n\nThe Form 1040 is a partial record and a summary, and devoid of details that tell the public more about how he manages his money. In particular, it doesn\u2019t tell the public about his charitable giving or any other itemized deductions. Given that Sanders\u2019 1995 return indicated he was parsimonious about giving to charities, voters might want to know if his attitude has changed in the last two decades. A spokesman told The Washington Post in 2015 that Sanders had donated $8,350 to charity in 2014, and another $1,867 that he had received from a book event and television appearance. But we can\u2019t confirm that without seeing the full tax return and itemized donations.\n\nPlainly put, Sanders has not released his full federal tax return. The little he has released was the Form 1040 in 2014, which is a summary of his tax filing that gives a snapshot of his finances \u2014 not what is considered a full tax return. The Sanders campaign confirmed to The Washington Post that it has not released other tax returns prior to 2014, which is a sharp contrast to Clinton\u2019s voluminous release of her complete tax returns.\n\nSanders says there is nothing in his 2015 tax return that is different from what the public has \u201cseen for the last many years.\u201d This indicates he may have been referring to the information filed in his financial disclosures. But that\u2019s not the same as a full federal tax return \u2014 and as a longtime member of Congress, Sanders should know that.", "lang": "en"}
