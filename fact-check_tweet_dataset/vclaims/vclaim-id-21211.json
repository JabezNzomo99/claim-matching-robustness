Although she was not an official member of the Nazi Party, Braun was loyal to Hitler. Heike G. G\u00f6rtemaker, a German historian and author of the biography Eva Braun: Life with Hitler, said that Braun was an enthusiastic accessory to Hitler\u2019s philosophy:\n\nBraun became part of the Nazi propaganda machinery. She served not just as decoration; she took pictures and films portraying Hitler at his Berghof retreat as a likeable caring person and family man, fond of children. But he wasn\u2019t a family man. And she sold these so-called private pictures to Heinrich Hoffmann, and in doing so earned a lot of money \u2014 she got 20,000 marks for one of her [home] movies. She was very rich \u2026 Yes. It is true that Braun did not belong to the [Nazi Party]. But that fact does not mean that she rejected the Nazi state or was opposed to it in any way. On the contrary, her life, like that of everyone else around Hitler, was shaped by his worldview \u2014 by his charisma and his power \u2026 It cannot be verified that she knew about the Holocaust, but she certainly was informed about the persecution of Jews and the deprivation of their rights. It is also clear that she supported this policy. Despite the fact that she did not appear in public, she was not a passive bystander.\n\nG\u00f6rtemaker also told the Observer that Braun was far more than a bit player or a victim:\n\n\u201cEva Braun features in films, plays, novels and historical memoirs,\u201d G\u00f6rtemaker told the Observer, \u201cbut is always portrayed as the dumb blonde who had the misfortune to fall in love with a devil, and this is an image that needs to be \u00adcorrected. She was capricious, an uncompromising advocate of unconditional loyalty towards the dictator who went so far as to die with him, and he adored her.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
