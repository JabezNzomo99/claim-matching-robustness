Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map \u2014 with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\n\nCruz\u2019s added commentary in his tweet, which began with \u201cThis is Bernie\u2019s base,\u201d implied \u2014 if not directly asserted \u2014 that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\n\nThis is Bernie\u2019s base \u2014 the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\n\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz\u2019s tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment \u2014 no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\n\nKimmel\u2019s crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:", "lang": "en"}
