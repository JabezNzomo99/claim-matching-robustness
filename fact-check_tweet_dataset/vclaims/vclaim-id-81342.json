The debate over whether Congress should kill the agency is now heating up, and we are looking into claims made on both sides. We dug into a claim made by supporters of the bank, and are now examining a claim from opponents. We will be following this debate, and we welcome reader suggestions.\n\nThere are 178 countries where the Export-Import Bank authorized a transaction in fiscal 2014. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, indeed, received billions of dollars in authorizations (loans, guarantees and insurance) to buy American goods. Russia received nearly $1.5 billion, China received $4.5 billion and Saudi Arabia received nearly $6.9 billion. But many other countries that are democracies, or that do not have notable records of violating human rights, also have received billions. This includes Australia, the Netherlands, India and South Korea.\n\nFreedom Partners pointed us to concerns raised by the airline industry, which has some of the most outspoken critics. Boeing is the biggest beneficiary of the bank, and some U.S. airlines and the Air Line Pilots Association International have said foreign customers of Boeing aircraft are gaining an unfair advantage. The bank\u2019s financing support for Boeing jet exports has increased since 2004, and Boeing represented about 28 percent of the agency\u2019s total financial exposure as of March 31, 2014, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nFreedom Partners also pointed to a news release by Minnesota and Michigan lawmakers over a $694 million loan to an Australian iron ore mine. It would threaten U.S. iron ore production, they said. But it\u2019s important to note that one of the two American companies that profited from the deal was Caterpillar, one of the major beneficiaries of the Export-Import Bank.\n\nThey also provided research by the libertarian Cato Institute, which found that for nearly every financial authorization that helps a single U.S. company, there is at least one U.S. industry that is harmed from diverted supplies, shifting market power and decreased cost of capital for their foreign competitors. The report did not specify countries that received specific loans, but did note the adverse impact on the United States due to export restrictions in China. But this is not a direct result of Export-Import Bank loans.\n\nOn March 30, 2015, a federal judge in Washington dismissed the lawsuit. The details are very technical, but the main takeaway is this: The judge rejected the airlines\u2019 arguments. He concluded that a single loan or minimal savings would not create such disadvantage, especially regarding the specific loan guarantee to Air India for the purchase of Boeing aircraft (the deal over which Delta filed suit). The judge found the bank did not violate its charter, and that it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cDuring this period, [since 1979] the Bank accumulated decades of expertise regarding the airline sector and other industries, and critically, the Bank has long used that expertise to develop various procedural filters, including the exportable goods screen, that block from further in-depth analysis categories of transactions that the Bank, in its considered judgment, deems to be unlikely to produce a substantial adverse impact on domestic industry and employment.\u201d\n\nIf one were to listen to this radio ad, it would be jaw-dropping that the United States is giving billions of dollars to countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia at the expense of American workers. But once you dig into the facts, this claim is questionable. First, the examples that Freedom Partners sent us to show unfair advantage were not all in those countries. The Delta suit was over loan guarantees to Air India, and the mining equipment loan went to an Australian company. But we found insufficient evidence that Russia, China and Saudi Arabia are gaining any more advantage than other, democratic countries.\n\nThere are inherent risks with providing a loan to a foreign company \u2014 but the point is to weigh those risks with the long-term gain. The federal judge\u2019s dismissal of the long-standing lawsuit by Delta and other parties is quite telling. It makes us question how much of the impact reported by airlines, and other industries, carry weight, especially given that the airlines have been the most outspoken critics of the disadvantage.\n\nThere are systems in place for the bank to try to minimize economic harm. In the specific \u2013 and only case \u2013 that a federal judge weighed in on, the systems were working. They\u2019re not perfect, as the judge noted, and Congress must bear the blame for any ambiguities or any conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the laws that lawmakers wrote.", "lang": "en"}
