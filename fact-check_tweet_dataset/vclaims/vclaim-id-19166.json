This ad appeared in, for example, the January 1919 issue of Little Folks, a children\u2019s magazine (as well as Boys\u2019 Life magazine), at a time when the recently concluded Great War in Europe (later to be known as World War I) had unfortunately lent that weapon a good deal of public prominence:\n\nDespite the wording of the ad, the \u201cBig Dick\u201d was not a \u201creal\u201d machine gun in anything but a superficial sense. It used neither gunpowder nor real metal cartridges; rather, it was a spring-action toy that fired \u201cbullet-shaped wooden slugs\u201d:\n\nHere\u2019s a video of the toy in question, showing its (less than impressive) firing rate and mechanism:\n\nAlthough lines of ad copy such as \u201cGet Big Dick and be envied by every boy in town,\u201d \u201cBecome a member of the \u2018Big Dick Brigade,'\u201d and \u201cHow to get BIG DICK free\u201d might seem like obvious double entendres to modern audiences, they were not read as such by customers of the time.\n\nCharting the course of spoken (rather than written) language across the years is somewhat difficult. But it appears that although the modern meaning of \u201cdick\u201d as a slang reference to male genitalia had entered the English language at least a few decades prior to World War I, it didn\u2019t become common parlance in America until well after the era of the \u201cBig Dick\u201d machine gun toy.", "lang": "en"}
