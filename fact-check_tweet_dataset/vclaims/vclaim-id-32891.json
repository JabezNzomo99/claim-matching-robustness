And while deputy minister Nawatiseb\u2019s words can be brushed off as frivolous and clearly erroneous or misleading, and probably could have been ignored, an accusation of treason is a serious one and his words carried an implied threat made in his official capacity on an official government platform.", "lang": "en"}
