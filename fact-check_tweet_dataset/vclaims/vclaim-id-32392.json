But sometimes undercover cops can inadvertently put themselves in harm\u2019s way by playing their roles too well, as suggested in the following meme:\n\nThis farce played out on Detroit\u2019s east side in November 2017, although it wasn\u2019t quite as simple as the above meme, and several news accounts, made it sound.\n\nSpecial-operations officers from Detroit\u2019s 11th Precinct were preparing to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house, but unbeknownst to them, cops from the department\u2019s 12th Precinct were operating within the 11th Precinct\u2019s territory. This intersection of two different groups of police who had not coordinated with or made their presence known to each other set the stage for chaos.\n\nFirst, two special-ops officials from the 11th Precinct encountered two undercover cops from the 12th Precinct who were posing as drug dealers, and the former attempted to detain the latter. Then, while 11th Precinct officers were executing their search warrant on the suspected drug house, a separate team of cops from the 12th Precinct stormed into the house before it could be secured, triggering a confused brawl between the two groups:\n\nThe incident occurred on Nov. 9 when two officers from Detroit\u2019s 12th Precinct were posing as drug dealers in order to arrest buyers. Two buyers did arrive to the drug house, but they were undercover police officers from Detroit\u2019s 11th district. The officers did not know each other. More officers from the 11th district arrived to serve a search warrant and that\u2019s \u201cwhen it started to go terribly wrong,\u201d [Detroit Police Chief James] Craig said. Body camera footage shows the two groups of police officers yelling, shoving and throwing punches at each other. \u201cThey appeared to be like Keystone cops,\u201d Craig said, referring to the fictional police officers depicted in comedic silent films.\n\nFootage from one of the officers\u2019 body cameras captured part of the fracas between the two groups of officers:\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the most embarrassing things I\u2019ve seen in this department since I\u2019ve been appointed police chief,\u201d James Craig told reporters. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d have to tell you it is probably one of the most disappointing things I\u2019ve experienced in my entire 40-year career.\u201d During the botched operation, 12th precinct officers, who were posing as drug dealers, were held at gunpoint by police from the 11th precinct. \u201cI am thankful that no one was more seriously injured,\u201d Craig said. A video of the incident, which took place on 9 November, has been been released as part of the investigation. The bodycam footage shows one officer shouting: \u201cDon\u2019t put your hand on your gun\u201d while another says his team has a search warrant. As the brawl develops, the bodycam is knocked off the officer filming. It is believed a lack of communication over the existence of the warrant led to the problem.\n\nAccording to one report, the incident involved two dozen police officers altogether, one of whom was taken to a hospital:\n\nAfter obtaining a search warrant to raid a home in the 19000 block of Andover Street, the undercover unit from the 11th Precinct entered the home, but then a separate team of cops from the 12th Precinct stormed the location before the home could be secured. One officer was taken to the hospital after the incident, according to [WXYZ], which quoted an unidentified cop who said the crew from the 12th Precinct didn\u2019t follow proper protocol since it didn\u2019t notify the department of the raid, which occurred three blocks inside the 11th Precinct\u2019s territory. Officers from the 12th Precinct also didn\u2019t properly notify the 11th Precinct during a prostitution sting that led to a police chase, according to the police source. In all, about 24 cops were involved, including some in full tactical gear and armed with assault rifles who were pushing and shoving each other in the \u201cheated\u201d and \u201cbruising\u201d incident.\n\nContrary to the wording of the meme presented above, we found nothing documenting that undercover police from the 11th Precinct were \u201cposing as drug buyers.\u201d A couple of 11th Precinct officers unknowingly encountered undercover cops from the 12th Precinct who were posing as drug dealers and attempted to detain them, but the former were on the scene because they were part of a group of officers attempting to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house, not because they were engaged in an undercover operation that had them posing as drug buyers.", "lang": "en"}
