The Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, recently told the Health and Social Care Select Committee that he doubts that a coronavirus vaccine would become a legal requirement, but this would be up to ministers to decide.\n\nPrior to this, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said at daily briefings that he would like and encourage people to get a vaccine when it is available but has not said he would make it mandatory. In early May he said, \u201cOn the question of whether to make it [the Covid-19 vaccine] compulsory, I think the extent of the public\u2019s reaction to following the lockdown shows that we will be able to achieve very, very high levels of vaccination without taking that step...whilst I don't rule anything out, we are proceeding on the basis that just such a huge proportion of the population are going to take this up because of the obvious benefits to individuals and their families and their communities and indeed the whole nation.\u201d\n\nLater that month, when asked again if the vaccine would be mandatory, he said: \u201cThe question of whether it\u2019s mandatory is not one that we\u2019ve addressed yet. We are still some time off a vaccine being available. But I would hope, given the scale of this crisis, and given the overwhelming need for us to get through this and to get the country back on its feet, and the very positive impact that a vaccine would have, that everybody would have the vaccine.\" No other vaccine is mandatory in the UK.\n\nWe could find no evidence that an app involving a QR would be used to monitor whether or not someone has been vaccinated. We have previously written about claims that tracing apps had been downloaded onto people\u2019s phones without their consent. As we said at the time, there aren\u2019t any plans to automatically download an app to phones to trace contacts, and we\u2019ve found no evidence to suggest there is any plan to trace people\u2019s vaccination history this way.\n\nAway from coronavirus, the UK hasn\u2019t previously banned non-vaccinated people from public spaces. Vaccines are not mandatory in the UK, and people who are unvaccinated for other contagious diseases are not banned from public spaces.", "lang": "en"}
