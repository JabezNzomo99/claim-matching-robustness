Chambliss has announced he is not running for a third term. Handel has attempted to separate herself from three House members running for the Senate seat -- Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston -- by linking them to contentious congressional policies.\n\nOn Sept. 9, though, Gingrey introduced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from receiving any money from the federal government to help pay their health care coverage through an exchange plan.\n\nEarlier this month, PolitiFact Georgia researched Handel\u2019s claim that Congress secured special Obamacare rules \"to prevent their health care costs from rising\" and rated it as .\n\nSo did Handel receive a clean bill of health from the Truth-O-Meter for the most recent claim?\n\nObamacare boots members of Congress and their staffs from their generous Federal Employees Health Benefits plans at year's end, meaning they will have to select an insurance plan from exchanges designed for those who lack employer-based health insurance.\n\nWhen Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. There was uncertainty that federal contributions for health care coverage to members of Congress and their staff would continue when the law passed.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the contributions provide up to $5,000 a year for individual coverage and as much as $11,000 for families under some of the most popular health plans, The New York Times reported.\n\nThat is a subsidy of about 75 percent of the health insurance costs for members of Congress and their staffs, according to a Sept. 18 article in The Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nSome lawmakers were not happy with the decision.\n\n\"[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans,\" U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, said after the OPM\u2019s announcement. \"When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats.\"\n\nIn Georgia, census reports show that the median household income from 2007 to 2011 was $49,736. Most households in Georgia would qualify for some kind of subsidy if they bought health insurance through an exchange.\n\nMost members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000. The leaders in both chambers make more, with House Speaker John Boehner at the top of the list at $223,500 a year. Some chiefs of staffs to lawmakers make annual salaries exceeding $135,000, according to a December 2010 Sunlight Foundation report. Assistants and clerks make in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, the report found.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management\u2019s website contains a state-by-state breakdown of the cost for various health care plans for non-U.S. Postal Service workers. The highest monthly subsidy the government would pay for family plans in each state and the District of Columbia was $920.73. Multiplied by 12 months, and that total is $11,048.76.\n\nLoren Adler, research director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said she believed Handel\u2019s claim in the radio ad is accurate.\n\n\"[T]he statement is correct, especially since it\u2019s worded as getting \u2018to keep\u2019 the subsidy,\" said Adler, who has worked with some senators on health care issues.\n\nWe asked Adler how many lawmakers would maximize their coverage. He directed us to an August study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found the average monthly health care premium for family coverage in 2013 will be $1,363. Some single-coverage health care plans in Washington, D.C., that Adler has seen cost $9,700 a year.\n\n\"Since family plans generally cost more than twice a single one, there should be at least some offerings expensive enough for a congressional employee to get the $11,000 subsidy for them and their family,\" Adler said.\n\nAgain, Handel claimed in a radio ad that members of Congress get to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies to offset health care coverage costs after an arrangement made by the Obama administration. Lawmakers can get as much as $11,000 for family coverage. This is a continuation of a prior funding policy for lawmakers and their staffs that seemed to be unclear when the health care law was passed.\n\nMembers of Congress and their staffs, however, aren\u2019t the only ones getting taxpayer-funded subsidies. Millions of Americans could get them, based on their incomes.\n\nMembers of Congress and the high-paid members of their staffs are unique in one important sense. They far exceed the income caps put on the subsidies for average Americans.\n\nHandel\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but it needs a lot of context to be fully understood.\n\nWe rate this statement as Half True.", "lang": "en"}
