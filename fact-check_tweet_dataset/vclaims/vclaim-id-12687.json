No, that's not true: the story was made up by a satirical website but several people were sharing it online without that context. The whole thing is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by The Daily Mash on November 14, 2018 titled \"Northern Ireland re-named 'West Belgium' in Brexit deal\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nTHE finalised Brexit deal imposes full EU rules on Northern Ireland, changes its official language to Flemish, bans religion and renames it West Belgium.

The famous art of the \"Belgian Compromise\" consists of negotiating as long as it takes to reach a deal that makes everybody equally unhappy.\n\nThe Daily Mash is a satirical website from the U.K. which sports following disclaimer on its about page:\n\nThe Daily Mash is a satirical website which publishes spoof articles, i.e. it is all made-up and is not intended, in any way whatsoever, to be taken as factual. Glad we've got that sorted.\n\nTheir articles are generally quite funny but now and then they get mistaken for real news.\n\nWe wrote about thedailymash.co.uk before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: World Cup Opening Ceremony NOT To Centre On 380ft Replica of Putin's Cock\n\u2022 Fake News: Richard Dawkins Did NOT Join Cast of Love Island\n\u2022 Fake News: Scottish Drinkers Can STILL Buy Frosty Jack's Without Bitcoin\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Claim Boosts Are The Best Chocolate Bar\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Post-Brexit Remake of Fawlty Towers, NOT To Star Idiot English Waiter", "lang": "en"}
