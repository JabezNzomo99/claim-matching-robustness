It will be an mRNA vaccine which will literally alter your DNA. It will wrap itself into your system. You will essentially become a genetically modified human being.\u201d\n\nIt is true that mRNA vaccines are being developed to combat Covid-19, along with numerous other types of vaccines. There is not one \u201cCovid-19\u201d vaccine, as suggested by the post, lots of countries and lots of laboratories are attempting to develop a vaccine to combat the virus.\n\nOf the six vaccines the World Health Organisation had identified on 13 August as being furthest along in clinical trials, two were mRNA vaccines.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that mRNA vaccines are very novel, and if one were to be approved for human use for Covid-19, it would be the first of its kind.\n\nHowever, the post incorrectly describes how mRNA vaccines work. mRNA vaccines work by introducing a molecule into the body which instructs cells to build a disease-specific antigen. The antigen is then recognised by the immune system which produces antibodies to fight the real thing.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t change the body\u2019s DNA or \u201cwrap\u201d itself. mRNA vaccines are generally viewed positively as they are cheap, and don\u2019t involve using part of a virus-like some traditional vaccines.\n\nThe picture in the post is just a comparison of DNA and RNA and has nothing to do with vaccines or mRNA vaccines.", "lang": "en"}
