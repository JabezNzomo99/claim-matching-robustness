Some choice headlines:\n\u2022 BREAKING: First Reports Of '11/4\u2032 ANTIFA Violence Roll In From The East Coast\n\u2022 BREAKING: '11/4\u2032 ANTIFA Thugs Burn A National Treasure To The Ground - MSM Still Silent\n\u2022 BREAKING: Group Of Patriots Fights Off '11/4\u2032 ANTIFA Thugs To Save A National Treasure\n\u2022 BREAKING: Three Antifa Terrorists Dead After They Messed With The Wrong Patriot\n\nSo it definitely looks like our story about one of these sites being 'resurrected' yesterday wasn't far off the mark.\n\nRest assured all of the stories are false. Freedum Junkshun, The Last Line Of Defense and Reagan Was Right are all fake sites which carry satire disclaimers at the bottom of each article:\n\nABOUT THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE: In a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\n\nWe believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won't find any of it here.\n\nJoin the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someone's poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away\n\nThe owner and main writer of the sites is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as asamericanasapplepie.org, ourlandofthefree.com and nunadisbereel.com (formerly thelastlineofdefense.org). Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
