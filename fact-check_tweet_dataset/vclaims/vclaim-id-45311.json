The video shows former First Lady Michelle Obama awkwardly accepting a gift from incumbent FLOTUS Melania Trump. Struggling to figure where to place the gift, former President Barack Obama takes it from his wife. The video shows him going back towards the entrance of the White House and tossing the gift to his left.\n\n\u201cTrump took his wife to visit Obama and gave gifts in an attempt to calm the anger of the black people. Unexpectedly, Obama took the gift and dumped it as soon as he turned around,\u201d reads the claim shared with the video.\n\nThe clip, which carries the logo of US-based CNN, is massively viral on Twitter. Alt News has also received fact-check requests on its mobile application.\n\nThe video has been viral since 2017. It was shared by a comic page on Facebook \u2018Blast Avenue\u2019 on January 23, 2017, gathering 22 million views.\n\nThis video was shot in January 2017 when Donald Trump, then President-elect, and his wife Melania Trump visited the White House to meet the Obamas. In the original CNN video, former President Barack Obama does not throw away the gift but hands it over to a White House staffer.\n\nAlt News found the above video with a video search on Google with the time frame selected between January 19, 2017, and January 21, 2017. CNN also uploaded a longer version of the event. The part viral can be seen 25 seconds into the broadcast.\n\nThe same video taken from a wide shot angle clearly shows (7:12 seconds) Barack Obama handing over the gift to a staffer.\n\nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Michelle Obama explained the awkward gift exchange. She said, \u201cI mean, this is like a state visit, so they tell you that you\u2019re going to do this, they\u2019re going to stand here. Never before do you get this gift, so I\u2019m sort of like okay\u2026\u2019What am I supposed to do with this gift?\u2019 No one would come and take the box and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Do we take the picture with [it]?\u2019 See, he [Barack Obama] grabbed the box and took it back inside.\u201d\n\nA 2017 video of a state visit between the Obamas and the Trumps was tampered with to show the ex-President tossing away the gift handed by First Lady Melania Trump.\n\n[Update: The wide shot video which provides clearer frames was added to the report on June 11, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
