Gen. Charles E. McGee, and other White House guests.\n\nIn fact, the House speaker did not tear up a copy of the president\u2019s Feb. 4 address until the speech was over.\n\nIt\u2019s fair game for Trump to claim Pelosi disrespected him by tearing up the speech.\n\nBut, as we show in our video, Pelosi stood and clapped for McGee. She clapped at some point for all the White House guests featured in Trump\u2019s video \u2013 with the exception of conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh.", "lang": "en"}
