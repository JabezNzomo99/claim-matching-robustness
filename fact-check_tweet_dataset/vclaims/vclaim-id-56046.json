It added text to its graphic that read, translated from Filipino: \u201cThe US says it\u2019s their right to be obeyed by the Philippine government to drop Maria Ressa\u2019s case and release her!!???\u201d This is erroneous and misleading.\n\nKim's statement on Twitter echoed U.S. State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus' position a day before, expressing concern over the guilty verdict on Ressa and Santos while calling for a resolution of the case in a way that \"reinforces the U.S. and Philippines\u2019 long shared commitment to freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nThis was in reaction to a Manila court's June 8 decision convicting the Rappler CEO and former staff of cyber libel over a 2012 story involving a local businessman.\n\nIn its caption, Solid Sarah Z Duterte 2022 wrote that Kim \u201cshould not interfere in any judicial process\u201d in the Philippines. \"We are not surrendering an Inch of our sovereign right,\" it added. This sentiment was echoed by many netizens in the post\u2019s comments section.\n\nThe deceptive post was uploaded after the U.S. and the European Union said the Philippine government should have \u201crespect for freedom of expression and speech\u201d as a democratic country.\n\nSolid Sarah Z Duterte 2022\u2019s post could have reached over 474,000 people and has been shared by 13 FB pages and groups, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Among its top traffic generators are the page itself and FB groups Pinoy ako DU30 Online Warrior and Mayor Inday Sara Duterte International Movement.", "lang": "en"}
