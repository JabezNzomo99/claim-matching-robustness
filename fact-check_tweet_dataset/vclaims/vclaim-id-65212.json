The following day, false reports started to circulate on social media that claimed she had died from the vaccination.\n\nOne such article published to a website called News NT claimed:\n\nElisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, has died. She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated.\n\nThis is not a genuine news article. While Granato truly took part in a vaccine trial for COVID-19, she has not died. Her tweets are protected, but she did update her profile to explain that she is \u201c100% alive\u201d:\n\nThe University of Oxford News Office confirmed to Reuters that Granato was \u201calive and well,\u201d while the U.K.\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care called the reports of Granato\u2019s death \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d on Twitter:\n\nBBC News reporter Fergus Walsh also confirmed that Granato was alive, writing on Twitter: \u201cFake news has been circulating on social media that the first volunteer in the Oxford vaccine trial has died. This is not true! I spent several minutes this morning chatting with Elisa Granato via Skype. She is very much alive and told me she is feeling \u2018absolutely fine.'\u201d\n\nFerguson shared a video of his call with Granato on April 26, the day after she supposedly died from the vaccine:\n\nOxford University also posted an update on its page dedicated to the COVID-19 vaccine trial, explaining that \u201cfalse reports about the progress of the trial\u201d had been circulating on social media. The university cautioned readers this likely would not be the last time a false rumor would circulate about the vaccine trial and urged people to get updates about the trial directly from the source:\n\nWe are aware there have been and will be rumours and false reports about the progress of the trial. We urge people not to give these any credibility and not to circulate them. We will not be offering a running commentary about the trial but all official updates will appear on this site.\n\nGranato was one of more than 800 people who volunteered to take part in Europe\u2019s first human trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The BBC reported that half of the volunteers were administered a potential COVID-19 vaccine, while the other half received a control vaccine that protects against meningitis. Granato, as well as the other volunteers, will not know which vaccine they received.\n\nGranato told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
