In this case, a Facebook post claims Starbucks has shown support for the Black Lives Matter movement through a drink promotion.\n\nThe alleged promotion shows the hands of two people, one white and one black, holding up what appear to be Frappuccinos. Above the image, text reads, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together, Black Lives Matter! Come to any of our stores shouting these words for a free Frappuccino of your choice. The louder you shout, the larger the size you\u2019ll get!\u201d\n\nBut the Starbucks promotion is fake. A spokesperson for the company confirmed it was not a valid offer to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Is Starbucks Offering Free Drinks To People Of Color?)\n\n\u201cThis is not a valid Starbucks offer,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cOur customers may confirm any Starbucks promotion, by checking the Starbucks app, reaching out to our customer care line, or asking a Starbucks barista.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Starbucks has been the target of a fake promotion. In February, Twitter users widely shared a digital coupon that falsely claimed Starbucks would give free drink vouchers to people who posted pictures of themselves listening to Lady Gaga\u2019s song \u201cStupid Love.\u201d\n\nStarbucks has made public statements following Floyd\u2019s death. On Twitter, the company tweeted a statement promising to \u201cconfront racism to create a more inclusive and just world.\u201d The company also held a forum \u201cfor any Starbucks partners who felt compelled to join a conversation about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and the many other racial injustices that have shaken the entire country and each one of us,\u201d according to a letter from CEO Kevin Johnson.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
