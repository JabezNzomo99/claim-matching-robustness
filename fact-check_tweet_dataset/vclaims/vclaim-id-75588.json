Large scale livestock sacrifice on Eid al-Adha, coupled with heavy rains and poor drainage networks have left many residents in some parts of Bangladesh to wade through 'rivers of blood.'\n\nImtiaz shared the image on his personal Facebook page along with other images to prove that the photo was not digitally manipulated. The photograph was taken in Bangladesh's Narayanganj area. BOOM reached out to Imtiaz through Facebook but is yet to hear from him.\n\nHis post got over 1300 shares and over 2500 reactions on Facebook.\n\nImtiaz also shared a video and other photos below his post to prove that the picture was not photoshopped.\n\nBOOM has blurred the faces of children appearing in the photograph.\n\nSadly, apocalyptic visuals of blood and accumulated rainwater combining are not new to Dhaka. In September 2016 local and international media presented jarring photos and reported about the civic nightmare the city had turned into during the festival.\n\nAccording to a 2016 story by the Guardian, authorities in Dhaka said they had created hundreds of designated sacrifice spots yet people preferred to sacrifice cows, goats and sheep in their garages or in streets outside their homes.
