Despite several people commenting on the post calling it 'fake' and that Saudi Arabia had denied it, the ministry did not delete it until Wednesday.\n\nIf granted, the lifting of a 70-year old airspace ban, would have been historic for all three countries as it would signify a thaw between Saudi Arabia and Israel and stronger diplomatic ties between India and Israel.\n\nBOOM wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs and the General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, but did not receive a reply from either authority.\n\nThe Facebook post was deleted after BOOM replied to a query saying the news of Air India receiving the approval was source-based and that Saudi's aviation authority had denied it.\n\nEarlier in February, several news reports said Air India had sought permission to fly through Saudi airspace which was so far off-limits to Israel-bound commercial flights. BOOM contacted the national carrier and confirmed the same.\n\n\"We have requested for the route New Delhi-Tel Aviv-New Delhi and are awaiting regulatory approvals,\" Sameek Bhattacharya - Senior AGM, Corporate Communications at Air India, told BOOM. \"We intend to start flying once the DGCA approvals are in place,\" Bhattacharya said.\n\nOn February 7, Israeli daily Haaretz wrote a story that Saudi Arabia had granted Air India approval to operate direct flights from Delhi to Tel Aviv citing \"sources in the Israeli flight industry\".\n\nThe site reported how a route through Saudi airspace would shorten travel time between India to Israel.\n\nThe news was picked up by Indian and international news agencies. However, Saudi\u2019s General Authority of Civil Aviation told Reuters that the agency had not granted any permission to Air India.\n\nHaaretz later updated its story with the denial though the URL shows the previous headline of the story.\n\nHowever, MEA's Facebook page shared a third-party link which still had the original story.", "lang": "en"}
