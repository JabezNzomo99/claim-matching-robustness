No, that's not true: It is a false claim made up by a fake news site that is notorious for attributing non-existent FBI sources in untrue conspiracy stories. The FBI and Arkansas State Police denied to Lead Stories that there was a child sex trafficking probe relating to the murder case. Prosecutors have charged an Arkansas woman, who was a friend and political supporter of the Collins-Smith, with the killing. As Lead Stories has confirmed in a previous story, there is no evidence that she had collected any evidence of a child trafficking ring before her apparent murder.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on July 9, 2019 by TruePundit.com titled \"FBI Reveals Murdered Arkansas Senator Planned to Expose Child Pornography, Child Sex Trafficking Syndicate: FEDS PROBE\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nSoon after we published that story, Arkansas State Police and the Randolph County Sheriff's Department arrested a close friend and political supporter of Collins-Smith, 48-year-old Rebecca Lynn O'Donnell, and charged her with capital murder, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence. While prosecutors are staying tight-lipped about the case, there is no reason to believe that O'Donnell's motives were connected to politics or a chid sex trafficking ring. The suspect's social media postings indicate she is a Republican and a supporter of President Donald Trump. She worked as a volunteer on Collins-Smith's failed re-election campaign and even testified in the former senator's divorce trial. The TruePundit article, however, claimed the federal investigators were on the case because of Collins-Smith's special knowledge of a child porn and trafficking syndicate:\n\nWith a murder suspect already in custody, however, federal law enforcement sources revealed Collins-Smith, at the time of her death, was probing child pornography cases linking to a child trafficking syndicate in Arkansas.\n\n\n\n\"She had developed this information through contacts and people very close to her,\" a law enforcement source said. \"The plan was to go public with all of it or hand it to law enforcement outside of Arkansas.\"\n\n\n\nThe FBI sources would not say whether the former senator was working with the FBI prior to her death. But federal insiders said the FBI began interviewing witnesses in the case in recent weeks. Also the Secret Service has taken an interest in the case as well, though FBI sources would not elaborate on the Secret Service's role.\n\nLead Stories contacted FBI headquaters in Washington and the Arkansas State Police in LIttle Rock about the claim that the FBI was involved in such an investigation connected to Collins-Smith's death. We were assured on the record -- not through an anonymous source -- that the federal agency was not. Arkansas Police spokesman Bill Sadler said this:\n\nSadler make it clear to Lead Stories that there is no investigation of a child pornography or child sex traffic syndicate connected to the Collins-Smith killing.\n\nWe were not surprised, considering the investigation that journalist Craig Silverman with Buzzfeed has done into the founder and writer for TruePundit.com. Michael Moore writes under the pseudonym Thomas Paine, the name of an 18th century political philosopher. He is a ex-con who admits he launched his website as vowed revenge on the FBI after he was successfully investigated and prosecuted on a federal charge. Moore wrote on his website about his anger that agents raided his home while his family was there:\n\nThese were bad guys. But I can think of few, if any, of those cases where federal agents rolled into those people's homes and pointed guns in the faces of their children. That's simply asking for trouble. On many fronts. It baffles me to this day. If the FBI had waited another hour and my kids were off to school, things could have been much different. But the lead agent didn't have the brains or experience to comprehend he had put his crew into a potentially dangerous situation. He did no recon on when my sons went to school. And unwittingly, he ultimately unleashed a clandestine collection of current and former law enforcement officials onto his employer in the form of True Pundit. That was a mistake.\n\nSilverman wrote that Moore's (Paine's) favorite tactic is to fabricate \"anonymous sources\" for his fake conspiracy stories:\n\nLead Stories can confirm that he did it again.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes truepundit.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
