{"title": "FALSE: ABS-CBN violated Constitution for being in airwaves for more than 50 years", "subtitle": "Law experts say Deputy Speaker Rodante Marcoleta misinterpreted the provision in the Constitution regarding the 50-year cap for franchises", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "May 30, 2020 7:43 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-44664", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/abs-cbn-violated-constitution-being-in-airwaves-more-than-50-years", "vclaim": "\"Hindi na po dapat payagan itong pagre-renew ng prangkisa ng ABS-CBN. Dapat na pong isara ang pinto para sa kanila. Bakit po? (We should not allow the renewal of the franchise of ABS-CBN anymore. We should close the door on them. Why?) Because the ABS-CBN has been using the airwaves for more than 50 years. Fifty-three years today, to be exact. Our Constitution says that Congress can grant a franchise of up to 50 years only,\" Marcoleta said.\n\nHe further pointed out that even if the counter began in 1957 when Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) merged with Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) \u2013 thus making it 63 years \u2013 then subtracting the 13 years when ABS-CBN was closed due to Martial Law, the network's franchise would still have run for 50 years already.\n\nMarcoleta's claim was shared by some Facebook users. One example is the post below published on May 27 that was flagged by Facebook's Claim Check dashboard. That post was accompanied by a graphic featuring Marcoleta's exact quote related to the claim and a caption which expressed admiration for Marcoleta's statements.\n\nLyceum of the Philippines dean Soledad Mawis also told ABS-CBN News on May 28 that the 50-year period is the maximum that Congress can set for a franchise at one time, and it can be renewed or extended. It would also be a disincentive for franchise holders, said Mawis, to have their operations shut down after 50 years because it \"could no longer be given a franchise extension,\" if Marcoleta's claim holds.\n\nOutside ABS-CBN's reporting, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd district representative Rufus Rodriguez told the Philippine Daily Inquirer on May 28 that every granted franchise can be renewed for another maximum period of 50 years when it expires, citing the practice in Congress. The 50-year cap, therefore, is not a cumulative one, he said.\n\nABS-CBN's precursor, ABS, had its first broadcast in 1953. Following the merger with CBN in 1957, the network was incorporated as ABS-CBN in 1967, then got a franchise under its new name in 1969. ABS-CBN got a new franchise, lasting for 25 years, in 1995. This last franchise expired on May 4, 2020, after the bill for its renewal languished in the House of Representatives. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
