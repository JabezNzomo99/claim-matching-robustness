That\u2019s important because casting a ballot in the wrong place means your vote doesn\u2019t count.\n\n \n\n \"Voting in the wrong precinct led to over 14,000 registered voters statewide to lose their vote in 2008,\" state Sen Nina Turner, a Cleveland Democrat, said during a floor speech on June 22.\n\n \n\n \"But I guess the loss of votes for some doesn\u2019t matter,\" she sarcastically concluded, suggesting that Republicans were deliberately trying to suppress valid ballots in urban and impoverished areas of the state where mixing up precincts most often occurs.\n\n \n\n It\u2019s a powerful charge. And one can see Turner\u2019s concern for those who are legitimately confused as to where they are suppose to vote. But Politifact Ohio wanted to know if there really were more than 14,000 ballots thrown out during the November 2008 elections \u2014 a presidential election, making it more significant \u2014 as she claimed.\n\n \n\n First, it needs to be noted that bills are ever-changing before they become a finished product, and so, too, was this one. The House added the provision blocking poll workers from helping voters, an idea that was not supported by Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. House Republicans said they were merely trying to protect poll workers and county boards of election from being legally liable for giving voters wrong information that might lead to a ballot not being counted.\n\n \n\n But the time the bill received final passage, that provision was removed. So to, though, was another mandate.\n\n \n\n \"As the bill now stands there is no strict prohibition on them directing voters to their correct precinct and there\u2019s no mandate that they do, either,\" explained Maggie Ostrowski, a spokeswoman for Husted.\n\n \n\n That still concerns Turner and other opponents of the bill \u2014 which will soon become law \u2014 because it removes the mandate for poll workers to help.\n\n \n\n But, what about the figure Turner quoted?\n\n \n\n Turner cited information supplied by the secretary of state\u2019s office. Former Secretary Jennifer Brunner compiled a report for the governor, legislature and state residents compiling statistics and analysis of how well the state\u2019s election process worked. It is a routine report following major elections.\n\n \n\n Provisional ballots are required when a person shows up to vote but does not have the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter. Poll workers then allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until their identity is proven and at that point the ballot will be counted.\n\n \n\n According to the secretary\u2019s report, there were 206,859 provisional ballots cast during the November 2008 election. But 39,989 of those ballots were not counted for a number of reasons, most commonly because the person casting the ballot was not registered to vote in the state of Ohio.\n\n \n\n But the second most common reason the ballot was not counted was because while the person was properly registered to vote in Ohio, they cast the ballot in the wrong county or precinct. In all, 14,335 such ballots were not counted for this reason, according to the Brunner report.\n\n \n\n Of those 14,000-plus ballots, 3,423 were cast in Cuyahoga County, home to Turner\u2019s district and by far the county with the most uncounted provisional ballots during the November 2008 elections due to wrong place filings.\n\n \n\n The irony here, given Turner\u2019s fight to get poll workers to assist voters, is that the casting of provisional ballots in the wrong place is most often the fault of the poll workers themselves \u2014 not voters.\n\n \n\n A voter cannot get a provisional ballot unless given one by a poll worker. Remember, under current law, the law in place in November 2008, poll workers were mandated to get voters to the right location even if they are voting provisionally. Ostrowski noted that it is not always poll workers fault because sometimes voters insist they are in the right location and demand a provisional ballot.\n\n \n\n Regardless, data from the secretary of state\u2019s office supports Turner\u2019s claim. In the November 2008 election ballots from more than 14,000 registered voters weren\u2019t counted because they were cast in the wrong place.\n\n \n\n Her claim is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
