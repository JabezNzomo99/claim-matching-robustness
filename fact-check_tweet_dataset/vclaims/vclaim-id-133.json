Others say it was re-printed \u201cduring 1919 pandemic\u201d, (here) - a reference to the Spanish flu outbreak that began in 1918.\n\nSome posts attribute the poem to Grace Ramsey (here), pen name of Kathleen O\u2019Meara, a 19th century French-Irish biographer and novelist (here).\n\nThe poem has attracted attention for its timely reflections on social distancing during the current coronavirus pandemic. It describes people adapting to isolation through reading, art, exercise, meditation and other activities.\n\nThe claim circulating on social media is false. The poem was not written in 1869 but in March 2020, by Catherine (Kitty) O\u2019Meara, a retired teacher from Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nO\u2019Meara was interviewed about her poem by The Oprah Magazine in March 2020 (here). She commented on the writing process of the now-viral poem, \"I was getting kind of sad. There was nothing I could do. I couldn\u2019t help my friends. I was very worried about them. My husband said: \u2018Write. Just write again.\u2019\"\n\nThe original poem can be found on O\u2019Meara\u2019s blog, \u201cThe Daily Round\u201d, dated March 16, 2020, (here).\n\nFalse: Viral poem on social distancing was written by Kitty O\u2019Meara, a retired teacher in Madison, Wisconsin in March 2020 (not by Kathleen O\u2019Meara or Grace Ramsey in 1869)\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
