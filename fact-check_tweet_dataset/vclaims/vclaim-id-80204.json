However the image was manipulated, with the original showing people rallying against Duterte.\n\nThis online post claims the photo below shows a rally held by Duterte supporters to coincide with his State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 23.\n\nThe post says: \u201cDuterte Supporters During the #SONA2018.\u201d\n\nIn the image, marchers carry a banner that is purportedly adorned with the Duterte campaign symbol of a clenched fist as well as the slogan \u201cDU30\u201d, which is shorthand for the president\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nThe Filipino messages on the alleged banner translate to: \u201cShun the Yellows! Fight Corruption\u201d, referring to a nickname for supporters of one of the key opposition parties.\n\nHowever, the image was manipulated to change the banner\u2019s message.\n\nSeveral news organisations, including AFP, published photos of the same rally and of the same banner. Those images prove the marchers were protesting against Duterte.\n\nThe real banner of the protesters in the original image, when translated to English, says \u201cShun Duterte\u2019s Cha Cha! Fight Dictatorship!\u201d\n\n\u201cCha Cha\u201d is a Philippine shorthand for constitutional change. Duterte is proposing to re-write the constitution to create a new federal system where regions would have more power.\n\nHere is AFP\u2019s photo of the protest:\n\nPhilippine news site Rappler and daily newspaper Manila Times also published their own photos, which showed the march was against Duterte.\n\nIn these pictures, which were taken by three different photographers, there are key details that are the same with the manipulated one.\n\n- A person in tan trousers and a white shirt walks on the far right side of the banner.\n\n- A dark-haired person in yellow stands behind the \u201cD\u201d in Duterte, which is toward the left side of the image.\n\n- The flags behind the banners are the same colours.\n\nThese details prove the scene in all of photos are the same, except the banner on the misleading image has been changed.\n\nThe post referenced at the start of the blog that promoted the misleading image has been shared to Facebook pages with a combined total of more than one million followers, according to Crowdtangle data.", "lang": "en"}
