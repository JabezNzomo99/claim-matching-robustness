According to these tweets, the chairperson of the Reliance Foundation has purportedly spoken out in favour of PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, apart from tweets of communal nature.\n\nThe above post has been shared over 4400 times. As can be seen, the tweets are from an account @NitaAmbaani. Some of these alleged tweets are inflammatory in nature, spewing hatred against the Muslim community. The post contains an audio clip wherein a person calls the Reliance Jio customer care service and asks for portability of the number to another service provide, in light of these alleged tweets by Nita Ambani. The screenshots have been shared with appeals to social media users to boycott Reliance Jio. The same audio clip has been posted on YouTube. It has been viewed over 340,000 times so far.\n\nOne of the tweets by the account reads, \u201c\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0905\u092c \u0935\u0915\u093c\u094d\u0924 \u0906 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u0936\u093e\u0939 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0915\u093f \u0906\u091c \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092f\u0947 \u091f\u0942\u091f \u0917\u090f \u0924\u094b \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0939\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0924 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u093e \u092c\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0923\u092f \u0932\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e (Friends, the time has come to stand with Modi and Shah because if they break today, no one will dare to take a big decision.)\u201d\n\nThe screenshots have also been posted with a message in Bengali- \u201c\u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09aa\u09bf \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u0982\u09ac\u09bf\u09a7\u09be\u09a8 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b0\u09cb\u09a7\u09c0 NRC \u0993 CAB \u0995\u09c7 \u09b8\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09a5\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u09b0 \u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09a3\u09c7 Jio \u0995\u09cb\u09ae\u09cd\u09aa\u09be\u09a8\u09bf\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09af\u09bc\u0995\u099f \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u09b0 \u09b9\u09bf\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf\u0995 \u09aa\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u0997\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u099b\u09c7\u0964 #\u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09bf\u0993 PORT \u0995\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09bf\u09a8 \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 Jio sim \u099f\u09bf\u0964 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09aa\u09bf\u09b0 \u09aa\u09be \u099a\u09be\u0981\u099f\u09be jio \u0995\u09cb\u09ae\u09cd\u09aa\u09be\u09a8\u09bf \u09a4\u09a5\u09be \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09ac\u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09a6\u09c1\u09b6\u09ae\u09a8\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09be\u0981\u09a4\u09ad\u09be\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09be \u099c\u09ac\u09be\u09ac \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8.!!!!\u201d They have also been shared on Twitter.\n\nOn the basis of these tweets, a boycott of Reliance products has been called for by some sections.\n\nAlt News found that the tweets in question are not from the official account of Nita Ambani. In fact, Nita Ambani does not have a Twitter account. These tweets are from an impostor account. A screenshot of this fake account is posted below.\n\nThe account had over 18,000 followers before it was suspended by Twitter after it was reported by several users. It may be noted that had Nita Ambani indeed tweeted to this effect, it would invariably have been reported by the media. However, there are no media reports on this.", "lang": "en"}
