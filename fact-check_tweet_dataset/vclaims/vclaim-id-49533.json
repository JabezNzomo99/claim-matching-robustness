This proved the cricketer had never posted anything like that from his Twitter account.\n\nWhen the Team Vishvas searched the keywords of the viral post on Invid, we found that the content of this post was shared for the first time on May 8, 2018. Later, the post was shared in the name of Sehwag.\n\nWe did Stalkscan search of the Twitter account of Dilip Singh and found that the account had over 10,000 followers, but it doesn\u2019t exis now. According to this account, the user lives in Jogbani area of Araria in Bihar.\n\nConclusion: The message going viral in the name of cricketer Virender Sehwag is fake. Sehwag never posted anything like this. The handle with which the post was tweeted has been deactivated.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
