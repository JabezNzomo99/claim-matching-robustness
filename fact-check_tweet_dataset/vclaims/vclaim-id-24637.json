Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the newspaper clip and also the claims made in it.\n\nClaim:Amit Shah had said that Ram Mandir would never be constructed and Modi had said that to gain the confidence of Hindus, it was necessary for him to kill Muslim farmers. Fact: No such newspaper articles were found with the above-mentioned statements of Amit Shah and Modi. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\nWhen googled for any news regarding such bizarre statements made by Amit Shah about Ram Mandir construction and Modi about the killing of Muslim farmers to gain the confidence of Hindus, no information is found either in the print or on the broadcast media. On looking for any other information, it was found that a similar newspaper clip is also in circulation with the same claims on Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Both the newspaper clips were similar with only a few changes in the placement of words. When tried to ascertain the claims made on Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav, no information pertaining to their statements was also not found.\n\nTo summarize, the newspaper clips carrying the statements of political leaders on \u2018Ram Mandir\u2019 and \u2018killing Muslim farmers\u2019 are digitally created ones and not true.", "lang": "en"}
