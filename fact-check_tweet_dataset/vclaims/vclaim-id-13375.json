No, that's complete nonsense: the story was made up by a Canadian website that invents stories about bizarre crimes, weird sex acts and general oddities for entertainment purposes. The story is not true, although we suspect the name \"James O'Keefe\" for the fictional turkey-man was chosen on purpose so that internet searches for the conservative political activist James O'Keefe III would bring up search results about a trans-species turkey.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on November 21, 2018 titled \"Trans-species man who identifies as a turkey wants to ban Thanksgiving Day\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAn Oklahoma trans-species man who identifies as a turkey is calling for politicians to ban once and for all the American holiday of Thanksgiving Day, which he describes as \"an unjustified genocide\" of his \"fellow birdkin.\" James O'Keefe, 42, who has identified as a turkey since he is 5-years-old, plans to go on a 100-day hunger strike to raise awareness amongst the American population of the murdering of millions of turkeys on the day of Thanksgiving each year. O'Keefe came out publicly about his trans-speciesism when he was 35 after he realized his marriage was not working and that he could no longer lie to himself about his true identity.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, so some people might think it was a real news article:\n\nBut the picture used with the story is actually from an article about a turkey rescued in 2016:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug Dealer NOT Busted After Calling 911 to Report 150-lbs of Cocaine Stolen\n\u2022 Fake News: Hells Angels Did NOT Sue Canadian Government For $2 Billion Revenue Loss Over Legalization of Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Alleged Son of Adolf Hitler NOT Planning to Write Sequel to Mein Kampf\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Sue Ex-roommate For $1.2m For Training Her Parrot to Sexually Harass Her\n\u2022 Fake News: Elderly Man NOT Accused of Bribing Police Officer for Giving a Biscuit to a Police Dog", "lang": "en"}
