Bleja\u2019s farm in Deveselu, southern Romania, is located about 10 meters from the fence of the U.S. military base that is hosting an anti-missile defense system. For more than three years, he has been fighting in court against the Romanian defense ministry, which is demanding that he move his farm away from the U.S. base\u2019s security zone.\n\nThe mystery, however, is why the Romanian sheep were, for a day, elevated to a place next to Vladimir Putin in the headlines of Russia\u2019s mainstream media.\n\nThe answer lies in Russia\u2019s \u201cNational Security Strategy,\u201d signed into law by Putin in 2015, which, among other things, determines information policy and topic priorities for government-owned media.\n\nThus, ironically, thanks to Russia\u2019s furious opposition to the United States and NATO increasing security measures in Europe \u2013 the Romanian sheep became a matter of Russia\u2019s national security interest and thereby earned a top spot in the headlines of the country\u2019s mainstream media.\n\nOn Wednesday, Romania\u2019s highest court ruled against Dumitru Bleja for building a shelter for his sheep without a permit, but has not made a decision on whether the farmer must take it down.", "lang": "en"}
