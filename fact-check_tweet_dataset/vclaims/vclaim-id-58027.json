(Click here for the full text of the e-mail.)\n\nThe allegation began after the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, N.Y. during the end of Bill's presidency. About two weeks before they left office, a short item headlined \"Another freebie for the Clintons\" on the New York Press Web site said the Secret Service was paying rent and that \"by an amazing coincidence . . . matches the monthly mortgage payment for the entire property.\" There were no other details.\n\nThat allegation was then repeated in a chain e-mail, with the additional detail that the Secret Service was paying $10,000 per month.\n\nThe e-mail says \"an extra residency had to be built within the acreage in order to house the Secret Service agents ... The Clinton's now charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of said Secret Service residence and that rent is just about equal to their mortgage payment.\"\n\nWe checked with the Secret Service, which declined to comment and referred us to Clinton's Senate office.\n\nPhilippe Reines, Clinton's press spokesman, said in an e-mail message, \"They have not and do not receive money\" from the Secret Service.\n\nThat matches a statement from White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre, who told the New York Post in January 2001 that \"They are entitled to charge rent, but they have decided not to do it.\"\n\nSo we find the charge to be False.", "lang": "en"}
