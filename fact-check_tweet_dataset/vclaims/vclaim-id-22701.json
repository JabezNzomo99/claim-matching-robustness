Now you can understand many things. You can also connect this to the so called \"Bhagwa Goons\" doing Violence during Amit Shah Road Show in Kolkata, They were all TMC Goons,\u201d Singh tweeted.\n\nThe tweet also sought to bring attention to the accusation by the BJP that goons affiliated to the Trinamool Congress party had indulged in violence and mayhem during the recent rally by Amit Shah.\n\nBoth TMC and BJP have accused each other of starting the violence.\n\nSingh, in a later tweet, defended his original tweet saying he had never said the video was from Kolkata.\n\nHowever, several netizens believed the video to be from the state, accusing West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of indulging in minority appeasement politics.\n\nSeveral Twitter users also stated that the man had a tilak on his forehead, however BOOM was not able to independently verify whether it was a tilak or caused as result of the man bleeding from the head.\n\nBOOM found a comment on the video which mentioned that it is originally from Jamshedpur and documents a clash that broke out between two groups over elections, on May 12.\n\nWe found a news bulletin where the accused can be seen interacting with the cops, while profusely bleeding from the head.\n\nAt 2 minute 19 second mark, the former, in a saffron T-shirt, has been detained by cops.\n\nBOOM also found a tweet with the same video.\n\nJamshedpur's Jugsalai turned into a battleground and the local police had to resort to firing teargas shells and lathicharge, when two groups clashed on account of elections on May 12. Section 144 was imposed in the area after seven were detained during the clashes. For more on the incident, read here.", "lang": "en"}
