Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tweeted, \"#WV has the highest overdose rate per capita of any state in our nation. That\u2019s why I made sure the SUPPORT for Patients & Communities Act included a set aside for states like WV.

The data is from 2016.\n\nManchin\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t specific about whether he was referring to opioid overdoses specifically or overdoses generally.
