President Donald Trump on Aug. 22 issued a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration for the state, providing federal funds to support local and state governments\u2019 efforts to combat the blazes, according to Fox News.\n\nA viral image falsely claims to show an aerial photo of the deadly fires tinging the clouds above red, despite the photo being unrelated to the ongoing blazes. (RELATED: Is This A NASA Satellite Image Of The Australian Wildfires?)\n\nThe photo, which has also been erroneously linked to the 2018 California wildfires, was taken by Nathan Province, who posted the photo on his Instagram roughly two years ago, with the caption clarifying, \u201cThis post is a sunset.\u201d Province told Check Your Fact in an Instagram direct message that it was \u201ctaken from an airplane over Hawaii during sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I did take this photo,\u201d Province said. \u201cIt was mistaken for the wildfires but Snopes and Forbes debunked it when it went viral and was stolen from me in 2018.\u201d\n\nIn response to an August 2018 tweet miscaptioning Province\u2019s photo, Michael Lowry, a strategic planner at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, explained the phenomenon.\n\n\u201cThis was taken from a C-17 ~40 min from Oahu, not CA (and not by Peter Singer),\u201d the tweet reads, in part. \u201cThe glow is from a sun angle below the horizontal plane illuminating shallow altocumulus clouds. Not fires. Not lava.\u201d\n\nSocial media users have previously shared photos that they falsely linked to wildfires. In January, Check Your Fact debunked a viral post claiming a similar image showed the Australian wildfires from above.", "lang": "en"}
