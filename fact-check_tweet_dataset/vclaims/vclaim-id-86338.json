He eliminated a number of deputy national security advisers so there was just one. And he folded the global health directorate into a new one that focused on counterproliferation and biodefense. Ziemer departed for a high-level post in the U.S. Agency for International Development, though a former administration official said he was due to leave the NSC anyway. His staff, whom Ziemer had called \u201cthe dream team,\u201d remained in place.\n\nEach directorate is housed in its own \u201cvault,\u201d so to speak, so classified information can be left on a person\u2019s desk overnight. \u201cHaving those people in the same vault means that they don\u2019t have to walk out of the office, walk down the hall, knock on the door to have someone let them in,\u201d another former administration official said, allowing for easier communication among staff members. A number of major projects that had been stalled in bureaucratic fights, such as a National Biodefense Strategy, finally were completed after the reorganization.\n\nCritics say the changes were shortsighted in the long run. Ron Klain, the Ebola \u201cczar\u201d appointed by Obama and a Biden campaign adviser, said biodefense and pandemic prevention require different skill sets and expertise. He said the move was akin to terminating the fire department chief and putting the firefighters in the police department. \u201cThe next time you have a fire, they will send a police car with a couple of firefighters in the back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe NSC doesn\u2019t make policy but it does (and must) make sure that the Department-level policymakers are focused on the right questions and understanding the landscape beyond just their own agencies\u2019 perspectives,\u201d Konyndyk said. \u201cIn this case the questions were pretty obvious and straightforward to anyone with outbreak experience: could a Wuhan-like outbreak happen here (Yes), are we ready for that (No), what are agencies doing to prepare the country for that contingency while working to avert it (not much, as it has turned out).\u201d\n\nOne can see the dueling narratives here, neither entirely incorrect. The office \u2014 as set up by Obama \u2014 was folded into another office. Thus, one could claim the office was eliminated. But the staff slots did not disappear and at least initially the key mission of team remained a priority. So one can also claim nothing changed and thus Biden\u2019s criticism is overstated.\n\nThe question that cannot be answered \u2014 at least perhaps until a congressionally mandated commission examines the U.S. preparation for this crisis \u2014 is whether a separate directorate would have had more clout to bring the issue immediately to the president\u2019s attention. That might have helped buy time to stem the spread of the disease by focusing the full attention of government on the emerging problem. (One example: China refused to let American experts into Wuhan \u2014 a discussion kept at the agency level. But early presidential pressure might have swayed Beijing to cooperate.)", "lang": "en"}
