Not only was the ceremony planned eight years before the pandemic, but the themes questioned by the post can be logically explained .\n\nThe opening show was designed by Oscar-winning film director Danny Boyle as an ode to British history and culture. In the second of three \u201cacts\u201d, Boyle paid homage to the NHS, a much-loved national institution to many Britons. (here) .\n\nThe sequence, which can be seen in this video of the ceremony at 45 minutes in, features hundreds of nurses dancing and roller-skating around hospital beds (here) .\n\nLater on, representations of famous villains from English literature are seen rising from the beds. The grim reaper-like figure that the post claims symbolises \u201cdeath\u201d is actually Lord Voldemort \u2013 the main antagonist in J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter book series.\n\nAccording to the Olympic media guide, the performance honours \u201ctwo of Britain\u2019s greatest achievements: its amazing body of children\u2019s literature and its National Health Service\u201d.\n\nThe post goes on to claim the \u201ccountryside theme\u201d the ceremony opens with is a reference to the positive impact the coronavirus crisis has had on the environment.\n\n\u201cSince the Covid-19 lockdown we\u2019ve seen greener grass, the sky bluer and the clouds fluffy white(amazing coincidence hey),\u201d the post reads.\n\nWhile it is true that coronavirus lockdowns have caused air pollution levels to improve across the world, this has nothing to do with the performance. (here)\n\nThe Olympic website explains that the sequence actually represents the \u201cgreen and pleasant land\u201d mythologised by romantic poet William Blake in his poem \u201cJerusalem\u201d (here) .\n\nFalse: the Olympic ceremony was a celebration of British history and culture, with no link to the coronavirus pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
