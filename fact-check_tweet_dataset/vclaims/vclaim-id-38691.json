The advertisement had a text in Hindi, which reads, \"\u0926\u0902\u0917\u093e \u092a\u0940\u095c\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0939\u0947\u0924\u0941\" (Translation: For the help of riot victims).\n\nAlso read: Video Of Mosque Vandalised In Delhi's Ashok Nagar Is Not Fake News\n\nRecently, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal had declared monetary compensation for families which were affected in the riots. Delhi, since February 22, 2020, has been gripped with communal tension. The clashes that erupted on February 22 turned into violent riots by February 23. It claimed over 40 lives and left more than 200 injured.\n\nThe screenshot of the now-deleted post can be seen below and the archived version can be accessed here.

Users also shared images of the published newspaper from the same day.\n\nWe then looked for the e-paper on the website of Dainik Jagran and found the published page of the February 29, 2020 edition.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the same. There is no mention of Muslim in the advertisement as well.\n\nYou can download the PDF here.\n\nFurthermore, we also looked for other news reports about the help that is being provided by the AAP government. We were directed to a press conference by the chief minister of Delhi and AAP's chief Arvind Kejriwal on the aftermath of the riots. Kejriwal has nowhere mentioned any specific religion or community who were entitled to the compensation.\n\nThe press conference can be seen below.\n\nTo read more about the reliefs being provided for the victims of the riots, click here.\n\nAlso read: Video Of Mob Pelting Stones At Police In Ahmedabad Peddled As Delhi", "lang": "en"}
