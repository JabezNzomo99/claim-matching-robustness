He also misrepresented facts about the detention of previous presidents on plunder charges to support his claim that the country\u2019s justice system does not need the ICC.\n\nResponding to concerns over the possible consequences of the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC to the country\u2019s maritime disputes with China, Panelo said:\n\nPanelo then argued that the Philippines\u2019 \u201crobust judicial system\u201d has proven its ability to jail erring presidents and the country, therefore, can do without the ICC in prosecuting \u201cbad leaders\u201d:\n\nPanelo\u2019s first claim is false; the second is misleading.\n\nThe Philippine government as a party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC, in an official notification submitted to the United Nations March 17:\n\nTwo days later, the ICC the Philippines\u2019 decision amid an ongoing preliminary examination of crimes allegedly committed in President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.\n\nThe decision was formalized days after Duterte his plan to withdraw \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d citing \u201cbaseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks\u201d from UN officials.\n\nPanelo's second claim is misleading because the ICC's mandate is not to \u201cbad leaders\u201d but those who commit the \u201cmost serious crimes of concern to the international community.\u201d These are:\n\nEstrada and Arroyo were both charged with plunder, a crime the ICC has no jurisdiction over.\n\nEstrada, to life imprisonment in 2007 for receiving hundreds of millions of pesos in protection money from \u201cjueteng\u201d operators and maintaining P3.23 billion in secret bank accounts, was by Arroyo the same year.\n\nArroyo, now House Speaker, has been cleared of her alleged involvement in several corruption scandals.
