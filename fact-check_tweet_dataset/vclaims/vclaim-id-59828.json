O\u2019Brien has said. O\u2019Brien also said the CIA has asked the Justice Department to open a leak investigation into the matter.\n\nAfter the initial reports in early 2019, the White House National Security Council again examined intelligence of Russian bounties in March of this year. White House officials have said it was not sufficiently substantiated to be brought to Trump\u2019s attention. Apparently, Trump\u2019s briefer did not bring the subject up during their meetings. Several people familiar with the matter told The Post that information is sometimes withheld from Trump, who often reacts badly to reports that he thinks might undermine what he considers his good relationship with Putin.\n\nBut the New York Times, and later others, reported that information on the Russian bounties appeared at some point in late February in the presidential daily brief (PDB), a written summary of intelligence that previous presidents are known to have read. The Post has reported that Trump \u201croutinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week.\u201d\n\nThe memo said that the C.I.A. and the National Counterterrorism Center had assessed with medium confidence \u2014 meaning credibly sourced and plausible, but falling short of near certainty \u2014 that a unit of the Russian military intelligence service, known as the G.R.U., offered the bounties, according to two of the officials briefed on its contents. But other parts of the intelligence community \u2014 including the National Security Agency, which favors electronic surveillance intelligence \u2014 said they did not have information to support that conclusion at the same level, therefore expressing lower confidence in the conclusion, according to the two officials. A third official familiar with the memo did not describe the precise confidence levels, but also said the C.I.A.\u2019s was higher than other agencies.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be learned why the NSA differed from others \u2014 including the Central Intelligence Agency \u2014 about the strength of the intelligence. The differences weren\u2019t over the central assessment that operatives with Russia\u2019s GRU intelligence agency paid bounties to the insurgent Taliban movement to kill Americans, some of the people said. \u2026 The NSA focuses on electronic eavesdropping, mining intercepted phone conversations, texts and emails, and other electronic signals. The CIA\u2019s role is human intelligence, which on battlefields such as Afghanistan often means interrogation of enemy detainees.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany at a briefing in June did not deny media reports on the intelligence, but repeated the Trump administration\u2019s view that the information had not yet been \u201cverified.\u201d While numerous intelligence and former government officials have said that such reports would normally have reached the highest levels of government, including the president, McEnany said Trump is briefed only \u201cwhen there is a strategic decision to be made.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Trump claimed that \u201cif you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush administration, some of them, not any friends of mine, were saying that it\u2019s a fake issue; but a lot of people said it\u2019s a fake issue.\u201d That\u2019s an apparent reference to former secretary of state Colin L. Powell, who told MSNBC that coverage of the reported bounties \u201cgot almost hysterical in the first few days.\u201d Powell said \u201cour military commanders on the ground did not think that it was as serious a problem as the newspapers were reporting and television was reporting.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s history is off. The United States supplied weapons to the mujahideen rebels opposed to the Soviet Union\u2019s 1979-1989 occupation of Afghanistan. Some of the rebels later formed the Taliban in the early 1990s. The Taliban was able to seize power because the population had grown weary of corruption and infighting among the mujahideen. In 1996, the Taliban defeated the forces of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, one of the founders of the Afghan mujahideen, and seized the capital, Kabul.", "lang": "en"}
