We are watching !!! I will choose 100 lucky people $5,000 each by following the instructions.\u201d\n\nHowever, a closer inspection of the account reveals that it is not affiliated in any way with DeGeneres. It has the wrong name \u2013 The Ellens Fund rather than Ellen DeGeneres \u2013 and lacks the blue check mark, which notes that the account has been verified by Facebook.\n\nThe alleged giveaway doesn\u2019t hold up under scrutiny either. No such giveaway appears on any of the talk show host\u2019s social media pages, nor on the official website of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d where official giveaways are posted. It appears to be a scam.\n\nSimilar scams about DeGeneres giving away various monetary amounts for likes, shares and comments have circulated on Facebook over the years, according to Snopes.
