According to the ministry, the Russian fighter jet approached at a \u201csafe distance\u201d and the flight \u201cwas performed in strict compliance with international rule[s] of airspace use.\u201d\n\nAccording to independent experts, none of these statements is true or accurate.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said, in a written statement, The Russian fighter jet closed \u201cto within five feet and crossing directly in front of\u201d the U.S. aircraft.\n\nThe European Leadership Network [ELN] a London-based policy group focusing on defense and security issues, monitors encounters between the armed forces of NATO and its partners, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other, since March 2014.\n\nAccording to the ELN report \u201cRussia \u2013 West Dangerous Brinkmanship,\u201d 66 incidents identifiable from public sources took place between March 2014 and March 2015.\n\nThe Dangerous Brinkmanship report details three \u201chigh risk,\u201d 13 \u201cserious\u201d and 50 \u201cnear-routine\u201d incidents during that period.\n\nThe author of the ELN report, British security expert Thomas Frear, @FrearUK disagrees with the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s categorization of the January 29 incident over the Black Sea.\n\nFrear told Polygraph.info the encounter was \u201cserious\u201d and the Russian aircraft behaved \u201caggressively\u201d and \u201coutside of routine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would classify this incident as \u2018Serious\u2019 under the criteria developed for the Brinkmanship report, as it is an aggressive action outside of routine behavior, but based on currently available information did not pose a high risk of escalation,\u201d Frear said in an email to Polygraph.info.\n\nThe Brinkmanship Report provides the following criteria for the \u201cSerious\u201d category: \u201cSerious incidents go beyond the previously established pattern of interaction and involve close encounters of a more aggressive and unusually provocative nature.\u201d\n\nFrear\u2019s assessment accords with those of the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\n\"This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the Su-27 closing to within five feet and crossing directly through the EP-3\u2019s flight path, causing the EP-3 to fly through the Su-27\u2019s jet wash. The duration of the intercept lasted two hours and 40 minutes,\" the U.S. Naval Forces 6th Fleet Commander said in a .\n\n\u201cThe Russian side was flagrantly violating existing agreements and international law, in this case the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA),\u201d said Nauert, the State Department spokesperson. \"The United States notes with the highest level of concern the latest incident of unsafe Russian military practices.\u201d\n\nU.S. Naval Forces Europe called the incident \u201can unsafe interaction with a U.S. EP-3 in international airspace.\u201d\n\nNauert said this was just \u201cthe latest example of Russian military activities disregarding international norms and agreements.\u201d She added: \u201cWe call on Russia to cease these unsafe actions that increase the risk of miscalculation, danger to aircrew on both sides, and midair collisions.\u201d\n\nTASS reported the Russian Defense Ministry said the Russian jet followed the U.S. aircraft to \u201cprevent it from violating Russia\u2019s airspace borders\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, the U.S. Naval Forces 6th Fleet Commander said, \"The U.S. aircraft was operating in accordance with international law and did not provoke this Russian activity.\"\n\nThe Pentagon repeated the assertion and pointed to the protocols the U.S. Navy strictly follows: Office of the Chief of the Naval Operations\u2019 Instruction 5711.96C, which prohibits American personnel from engaging in any acts that could create a potentially dangerous incident, including harassment and aggressive behavior.", "lang": "en"}
