But Democrats, newly emboldened by their gains in the midterm elections, may not be willing to give that much.\n\nWhich brings us to a question: How much has already been spent on the wall?\n\nIn an Oval Office interview with the Daily Caller, a conservative publication, on Sept. 5, Trump said, \"We\u2019ve already started the wall. We\u2019ve gotten $3.2 billion for the wall. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on the wall.\"\n\nHe reiterated that amount in a rally in Billings, Mont., and at a fundraising event in South Dakota a few days later.\n\nAs lawmakers go head-to-head on funding, we decided to look into how much has been spent on the wall so far in his presidency.\n\nShort answer: What he said is too high, and misleading.\n\nHow much money has been allocated?\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Trump reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on March 23, 2018, that he threatened to veto in part because his promised border wall was \"not fully funded.\"\n\nThe bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border. Here's the catch that Trump omits: None of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign.\n\nLawmakers approved a continuing resolution in late September to keep spending flowing until Dec. 7. They didn\u2019t address the controversial topic of border wall funding, in order to forestall a government shutdown shortly before the midterm elections.\n\nTrump gets to his $3.2 billion total by factoring in an additional $1.6 billion, which appears to stem from funding included in a pending Senate bill. But that bill hasn\u2019t been passed by the Senate yet, much less approved by the House and signed by the president, so it\u2019s premature to count that as solid funding.\n\nSo, right off the bat, the $3.2 billion figure Trump cited is twice as high as has actually been approved for the wall.\n\nIt\u2019s also not going toward Trump\u2019s vision.\n\nIs it being spent on a Trump-style border wall?\n\nHere\u2019s how the government is authorized to spend the $1.6 billion package that Congress approved last spring.\n\nThe spending bill said the designated funds \"shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017\" (which was May 5, 2017). The bill mentioned steel bollards as an example. (See some of the specific uses.)\n\nTrump shared photos back in a March tweet that touted \"the start of our southern border WALL.\" According to Los Angeles Times reporting, the photos were for the replacement of an estimated 2.25-mile border wall in Calexico, Calif., built in the 1990s using recycled scraps of metal and old landing mat. That barrier is being replaced with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall. Plans for that replacement began in 2009, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe newspaper quoted Jonathan Pacheco, a spokesman for the Border Patrol\u2019s El Centro Sector, as having said earlier in March: \"First and foremost, this isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s wall. This isn\u2019t the infrastructure that Trump is trying to bring in. \u2026 This new wall replacement has absolutely nothing to do with the prototypes that were shown over in the San Diego area.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection issued a news release on March 30 that said the $1.6 billion funding would provide for the construction of about 100 miles of new border wall. However, it uses the term \"border wall\" to refer to fencing and other structures, not the prototypes Trump has touted.\n\nFor instance, the news release highlights a 20-mile replacement of primary vehicle barrier in Santa Teresa, N.M.; replacement in San Diego of 14 miles of outdated steel plate barrier with a bollard structure; replacement of at least two miles of border barrier in Calexico with 30-foot bollard wall; and four miles of bollard wall in El Paso.\n\nTrump's claim \"conflates walls and fences,\" said Hannah R. Gurman, a clinical associate professor at New York University who has researched the history of U.S. immigration enforcement and its intersection with criminal prosecution.\n\nAs the Dec. 7 expiration of the continuing resolution looms, lawmakers are negotiating about how much new border security funding to approve.\n\nIf they can\u2019t come to an agreement, the government would shut down, and the amount of the border funding package is a highest-profile obstacle to an agreement. (The negotiations are taking place within the current Congress, not the newly elected Congress that will be seated in early January.)\n\nTrump told Politico on Nov. 28, \"I will tell you, politically speaking, that issue is a total winner.\" But Democrats, who were never convinced in the wall\u2019s utility, are considered unlikely to give Trump everything he wants.\n\nThe outcome of the border-funding battle should be clarified in the next week or two, but one thing is clear: Trump\u2019s previous assertion that \"we\u2019ve gotten $3.2 billion for the wall\" already is wrong on several counts.", "lang": "en"}
