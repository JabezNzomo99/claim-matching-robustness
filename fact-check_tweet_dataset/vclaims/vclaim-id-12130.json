No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Be Best Website on January 27, 2019 titled \"Trump 'MAGA' Hats To Be Banned At Superbowl By Stadium Security\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they wouldn't have known this was not a reliable news site:\n\nThe site carries a warning in the header that reads \"Information you probably shouldn't trust to be best\" and the story was pubished in the \"AY PAPI IT'S SATIRE\" category.

A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake.
