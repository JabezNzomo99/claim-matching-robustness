While unemployment in the country is sky-high and predicted to climb, the tweet itself comes from a fake Trump Twitter account.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa has the biggest Unemployment rate in the world #unemployedSA,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cThe South African President is failing to deliver, instead of creating new job for the unemployed, he is busy stealing money from his own people (sic).\u201d\n\nA screenshot of the tweet has been shared on Facebook more than a thousand times in multiple posts, including here. \u201cThe Trumpster has that one right,\u201d reads the comment in another post here.\n\nThe screenshot also appears here, here, and here in other Facebook posts.\n\nSome Facebook users appear to believe that Trump said these words, with posts saying \u201c1st time hearing trump making sense\u201d, \u201couch\u201d or \u201cI concur with bra-Donald\u201d.\n\nThe original tweet is from an account called @pres_realtrump and has garnered 55 retweets and 95 likes since August 1, 2020.\n\nSeveral clues indicate this is not Trump\u2019s official and personal Twitter account. For example, Trump is a prolific Twitter user but the copycat account has fewer than 10 tweets since it was created in July 2020. It also has only 97 followers and the bio reads: \u201c45th President of the United States of Black Twitter\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s genuine account, created in March 2009, is verified with a blue tick and has more than 85 million followers. He has also tweeted more than 54,000 times.\n\nA search of tweets by Trump on a website that archives his posts shows that while he tweeted and retweeted numerous times on August 1, 2020, none of the tweets from that day were about unemployment in South Africa.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked fake tweets attributed to Trump here, here and here.\n\nMeanwhile, South Africa's jobless rate is indeed dire at 30.1 percent -- or 7.1 million unemployed -- as announced by South Africa\u2019s statistics agency, StatsSA on June 23, 2020.\n\nAnd as reported by AFP, President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned of massive job losses and \u201ctough times\u201d ahead as the country battles through the effects of COVID-19.\n\nRamaphosa imposed a strict lockdown on March 27, 2020 to try to limit the spread of infections and to prepare hospitals for an expected surge in cases.\n\nThis has led to widespread criticism of the government\u2019s approach to the pandemic, especially in light of numerous reports about politicians profiting from lucrative public contracts.", "lang": "en"}
