No, that's not true: A Facebook spokesman said the social media network has not banned the prayer -- also known as the \"Our Father\" prayer -- from its platform.\n\nThe claim appeared in a meme (archived here) on Facebook posted on April 10, 2020. The post read:\n\nFacebook is saying that posting the\n\nLords prayer goes against their\n\npolicies, I'm asking all Christians\n\nto please post the Lord's Prayer./ Our Father who art in heaven\n\nhallowed by Your name, Your\n\nKingdom come, Your will be done, on\n\nearth as it is in heaven. Give us this\n\nday, our daily bread, and forgive us\n\nour transgressions as we forgive our\n\ntransgressors and lead us not into\n\ntemptation but deliver us from evil,\n\nfor Thine is the Kingdom, the Power,\n\nand the Glory forever. Amen\n\nThis is what the (now deleted) post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nA quick search on Facebook reveals several pages and posts dedicated to the prayer, including many that have the full text. Some of them have been on Facebook for several years.\n\nIn a statement to Lead Stories, a Facebook company spokesperson wrote in an email:\n\n(Editors' Note: Facebook is a client of Lead Stories, which is a third-party fact checker for the social media platform. On our About page, you will find the following information:\n\nSince February 2019 we are actively part of Facebook's partnership with third party fact checkers. Under the terms of this partnership we get access to listings of content that has been flagged as potentially false by Facebook's systems or its users and we can decide independently if we want to fact check it or not. In addition to this we can enter our fact checks into a tool provided by Facebook and Facebook then uses our data to help slow down the spread of false information on its platform. Facebook pays us to perform this service for them but they have no say or influence over what we fact check or what our conclusions are, nor do they want to.)", "lang": "en"}
