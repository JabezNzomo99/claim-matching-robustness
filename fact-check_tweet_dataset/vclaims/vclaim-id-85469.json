Roberts Jr., and Justice Clarence Thomas partially agreed with the majority\u2019s opinion. They agreed that the North Carolina law\u2019s \u201cextraordinary breadth\u201d violated the First Amendment, but stressed that states have a responsibility to try to stop the abuse of children before it occurs. Alito, who authored the opinion expressing partial agreement, said convicted sex offenders are \u201cmuch more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThere are many limitations in recidivism data for sex offenders, so it\u2019s difficult to use rearrest rates to accurately measure their threat to public safety. Many sex offenses are not reported to police, so there are problems of underreporting. Rearrests are not the same as reconvictions or reincarceration, and researchers are inconsistent in their method of calculating recidivism. (This Department of Justice report offers a detailed look at limitations in sex offender recidivism data.)\n\nThere are two citations. The first is a reference in McKune to a 1997 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report on recidivism among prisoners released in 11 states in 1983. The report found: \u201cReleased rapists were 10.5 times more likely than nonrapists to have a subsequent arrest for rape. Prisoners who had served time for other sexual assaults were 7.5 times more likely than those who had not served time for sexual assault to be arrested for a new sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThe second citation is a 2013 Supreme Court opinion in United States v. Kebodeaux, which cites an updated version of the 1997 report. This report, published in 2003 using data from 1994, is considered one of the most comprehensive studies on sex offender recidivism. The 2013 opinion cites the report\u2019s finding that released sex offenders were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime than non-sex offenders, and 5.3 percent of sex offenders were rearrested for a sex crime within three years after release.\n\n\u201cThe broad majority of all rearrests for all offenders are not for new sex offenses, so we would be better off looking at recidivism rates generally, and not just for new sex offenses,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. \u201cFor example, if 90 percent of the rearrests of sex offenders were for homicide, that\u2019s clearly very important and would outweigh the relatively modest proportion of new arrests for a sex offense.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that questionable interpretation of sex offender recidivism statistics found its way to a Supreme Court opinion. Kennedy wrote in his McKune opinion: \u201cThe rate of recidivism of untreated offenders has been estimated to be as high as 80 percent.\u201d This traces back to one 1986 article in Psychology Today that had no research to back it up. Yet the 80 percent statistic even made its way to the Packingham case, and was included in an argument by a lawyer defending the North Carolina law.\n\nIra Ellman, law professor at the University of California-Berkeley\u2019s Center for the Study of Law and Society, wrote a detailed examination of the 80 percent figure. He wrote: \u201cThe label \u2018sex offender\u2019 triggers fear, and disgust as well. Both responses breed beliefs that do not yield easily to facts. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has fed the fear. It\u2019s become the \u2018go to\u2019 source that courts and politicians rely upon for \u2018facts\u2019 about sex offender recidivism rates that aren\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe reference to sex offender rearrest trends in Alito\u2019s opinion is quite misleading. It measures the likelihood of sex offenders to be arrested for sex crimes after release from prison, and compares it to the likelihood of non-sex offenders to be arrested for sex crimes after release. This makes it seem like recidivism among sex offenders to be a uniquely bad problem, but it is an apples-to-oranges comparison.\n\nThis opinion cites previous opinions that use outdated data going back to the 1980s \u2014 more than 30 years ago. Moreover, it obscures the fact according to 2005 data, the percentage of sex offenders getting rearrested for the same crime is low compared to non-sex offenders, with the exception of people convicted of homicide. It does the public no service when the Supreme Court justices make a misleading characterization like this. We award Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
