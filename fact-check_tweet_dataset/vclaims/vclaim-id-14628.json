Reports debunking the claim cited mismatched dates, wrong signatures, wrong Republic Acts, and wrong titles for the accused as proof that the document was a hoax. (READ: 5 reasons the gold shipment complaint vs Aquino is a joke)\n\nIn an email to Rappler on Wednesday, December 5, the PCGG said that no gold bars were recovered from the Marcoses: \u201cThere were no gold bars recovered from the Marcos loot nor annexed in cases filed.\u201d\n\nIll-gotten wealth recovered from the Marcoses is documented by the PCGG which was created on February 28, 1986 to recover the same from the Marcoses and their cronies. The blog posts did not present proof of the wealth that was allegedly transferred to the Aquinos.\n\nIn September, the PCGG also told Rappler that all of Imelda\u2019s jewelry are in their custody, stored in the BSP, and were not worn by Corazon Aquino or former chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.\n\n\u201cThe Marcos jewelry (Malaca\u00f1ang Collections, Roumeliotes Collection, Hawaii Collections) are all inventoried and accounted for. These are all kept in the vault of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,\u201d the PCGG said. (READ: The value of Marcos jewels according to the Philippine government)\n\nThe Malaca\u00f1ang Collection contains pieces of jewelry found in the presidential Palace following the People Power Revolution in 1986. The Roumeliotes Collection was seized from alleged Marcos crony Demetriou Roumeliotes when he tried to smuggle the jewelry out of the country. Both of these collections have been with the BSP since 1986.\n\nThe Hawaii Collection was the jewelry seized from the Marcoses when they fled the Philippines for Hawaii in 1986. This was turned over by the US District Court of Hawaii to the Philippine government on December 18, 1992. (READ: SC affirms forfeiture of Imelda Marcos' 3rd jewelry set) \u2013 Vernise L.
