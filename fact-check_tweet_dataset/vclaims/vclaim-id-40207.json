The claim is false; a closer analysis of the footage found it shows a rubbish bin being thrown off a pedestrian footbridge in Hong Kong\u2019s Kwai Chung district; police dismissed suggestions that a man who died after falling from a building the same evening in the same neighbourhood had been the victim of foul play.\n\nThe video was published here in a Facebook post on November 14, 2019.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 120,000 times and has received more than 3,200 shares.\n\nThe seven second video shows about a dozen people standing on a Hong Kong street.\n\nAt the four second mark, a loud crashing noise rings out after an object is seen falling from a pedestrian footbridge to the ground. A person wearing a white t-shirt can be seen standing on the footbridge above where the object fell.\n\nThe video\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA black-clad person was directly thrown from a high-rise building onto the street after being attacked on Kwai Fuk Road in Kwai Chung\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nPro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have become increasingly violent as the protests enter their sixth month, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe same video was also published on Facebook here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows a rubbish bin, not a person, being hurled onto the street from a footbridge.\n\nA keyword search on Google found a longer and clearer version of the same footage published here on Facebook on November 13.\n\nTranslated from traditional Chinese to English, the video\u2019s caption states: \u201cCorrection: Suspected triad members/undercover police officers attack citizens, later someone stops them by throwing a rubbish bin\n\n\n\n ---\n\n On another note:\n\n 22:39 Kwai Fuk Road near Kerry Cargo Centre\n\n\n\n A black-clad young person was slashed, and suspected to have been thrown off a building, with a big knife mark on the chest, unconscious.\n\n\n\n //Earliest witness account at 2233\n\n Found on Kwai Fuk Road outside Kerry Logistics\n\n No heartbeat, CPR and AED performed\n\n Compound fracture in hand\n\n Already on ambulance\n\n Ambulance number plate A137\n\n\n\n First aid said there was no eyewitness\n\n But he/she (first aider) has a first aid licence \n\n Judging from the extent of bone fractures, likely fell from height, and even more likely to have been slashed\n\n\n\n (Angry emoji)\n\n Blood for blood (swearwords)//\n\n\n\n #Telegramgroup\n\n\n\n - - -\n\n\n\n Video of the injured person: https://www.facebook.com/on9ccnews/videos/566128170866441/\u201d.\n\nA Cantonese-speaking journalist at AFP\u2019s Hong Kong bureau analysed the video. In the clip, a small group of people can be seen gathered under the bridge, some of whom are holding torches.\n\nIn the street, other people can be heard shouting in Cantonese at the group. Some of their comments can be translated to English as: \u201cTriads!\u201d; \u201cCan anyone help?\u201d and \u201cLet go of that person!\u201d\n\nAnother person can be heard narrating parts of the scene in Cantonese. Their comments translate to English as: \u201cPeople are beaten at Kwai Fuk Court\u201d; \u201cHelp save that person\u201d; \u201cA person was caught\u201d; \u201cComing out of Kwai Fuk Court, these people are probably residents of Kwai Fuk Court who came onto the street all geared up.\"\n\nA person wearing a white t-shirt can then be seen throwing a bin from the footbridge at the group standing underneath.\n\nThe clip in the misleading post corresponds with the one minute and 11 second mark to the one minute and 18 second mark of the longer Facebook video.\n\nBelow are three screenshots from the longer video with the rubbish bin circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe bin corresponds with images of rubbish bins in Hong Kong, such as one published in this article by Hong Kong news site hk01 on August 7, 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the hk01 photo:\n\nThe incident happened next to a footbridge on Tai Wo Hau Road near Kwai Chung Shopping Centre in the district of Kwai Chung, as seen here on Google Street View.\n\nOn the same evening (November 13) in Kwai Chung, a man was found unconscious on Kwai Fuk Road and later died in hospital, Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported here on November 15.\n\nHowever, Kwai Fuk Road, where Kerry Cargo Centre as mentioned in the caption of the longer Facebook video is located, is nearly two kilometres southwest of the filming location near the Kwai Fuk Court housing estate on Tai Wo Hau Road, according to Google Maps.\n\nBelow is the relevant Google Maps imagery with the filming location (pinned) and Kwai Fuk Court on Tai Wo Hau Road, as well as Kerry Cargo Centre on Kwai Fuk Road circled in red by AFP:\n\nIn this statement published on November 14, Hong Kong Police dismissed \u201conline rumours\u201d that the man\u2019s death was \u201csuspicious\u201d or related to police activity.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cOnline rumours state that the case involving a male deceased that occurred last night (2019-11-13) in Tsuen Wan is suspicious. They state that there appear wounds caused by knives on the dead body and even accuse police of killing the deceased. The Police clarify that these allegations are totally false and malicious.\n\n\u201cThe relevant CCTV has been disclosed by the management office of the building concerned. In the footage, it is seen that the deceased wandered alone and had no contact with any others at the material time. Initial medical examination reveals that there are fractures but no wound caused by sharp objects. The injury sustained is beyond suspicion of any kind.\n\n\u201cThe rumours go beyond the fact, making the family of the deceased feel being 'assaulted a second time'. The police appeal to the rumormongers to stop their irresponsible acts.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the statement:", "lang": "en"}
