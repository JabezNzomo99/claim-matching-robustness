Union Minister Jitendra Singh had also tweeted saying that he was \"relieved\" to hear that Mr Shah has tested negative.\n\n\n\nFollowing Manoj Tiwari's tweet, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a clarification saying no test has been conducted so far. According to a home ministry official, Amit Shah has not undergone any new COVID-19 test on August 9, PTI reported. Tiwari later deleted his tweet. In a report by Hindustan Times, Shah is stated to be asymptomatic and working from his hospital bed. The report which was published on August 9 added that Shah was expected to return home next week provided he tests COVID-19 negative. Sources in the Home Ministry also said that nothing other than the official health bulletin released either by the hospital, the government or the minister's own Twitter account should be referred to for an update on the Home Minister's health.
