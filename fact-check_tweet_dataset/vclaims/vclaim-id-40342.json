All professional football players used to do this, the post claims.\n\nThe picture shows the two players kneeling during a game that was already in progress. There is no evidence that it was common practice for NFL players to kneel during the anthem before 2016.\n\nIn August 2016, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the pre-game playing of the national anthem in protest of racism against \u201cblack people and people of color.\u201d Other NFL players, as well as professional athletes in the NBA and NHL, followed suit and protested their pre-game playing of the national anthem.\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized the practice in late September 2016, calling the practice a \u201ctotal disrespect of our heritage.\u201d He also suggested the protestor-players should be fired for kneeling during the national anthem. (RELATED: Did NFL Linebacker James Harrison Make This Remark About The Anthem Protests?)\n\nThe Facebook post, which features an old photograph of Namath and Woodall supposedly kneeling during the national anthem, uses the image to criticize the Trump administration\u2019s reaction to the protests. \u201cAll the players used to kneel for the National Anthem,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cNow do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and his minions?\u201d\n\nThe image does not, however, show Namath and his teammate kneeling during the playing of the national anthem, contrary to the post\u2019s claim. A reverse image search revealed the photo, which comes from The New York Times, was actually taken in the third quarter of a 1973 game, long after the anthem would have been played, per notes on the back of the original picture.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence that it was common for players to kneel prior to Kaepernick doing it in 2016. NFL players only began standing on the field for the pre-game rendition of the national anthem in 2009, according to Axios. Before that, teams stayed in their locker rooms, except during the Super Bowl and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\n\nNamath has expressed support for protestor-players in Fox News interviews but has said that the American flag must be respected as well.", "lang": "en"}
