While Gates and Epstein had met in the past, this claim, based on flight logs recently subpoenaed, is untrue.\n\nOne example reads: \u201cFlight records confirm that #BillGates went to #Epsteins child sex trafficking island, 17 times. It's a fact, not a theory\u201d. Similar posts can be seen here , here and here .\n\nFollowing his arrest on July 6, 2019, financier Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls at his mansions on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side and in Palm Beach, Florida. He had escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell on August 10, 2019.\n\nThe financier once counted U.S. President Donald Trump, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew as friends. They have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing ( here ). The private planes used by Epstein to travel to his island in the Caribbean (Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands) has been referred to in the media as the \u201cLolita Express\u201d, following the accusations of him trafficking minors ( here ).\n\nIn July 2019, the New York Times reported that the pilots that flew Epstein\u2019s private planes \u2013 including to his island in the Caribbean \u2013 had released records of flight logs including names of those who had travelled on the planes ( here ).\n\nCopies of these flight logs can be seen online, uploaded by Gawker.com here and by Factcheck.org here . Reuters found no mention of Bill Gates in the first collection of flight logs, and in only one instance in the second. The log shows \u2018Bill Gates\u2019 noted as a passenger on March 1, 2013, from Teterboro airport in New Jersey (TEB) to Palm Beach International airport, Florida (PBI) \u2013 not to Little Saint James.\n\nA screenshot circulating on some media reports replicates this log entry in 2013 ( here ). The New York Times corroborated this single trip to Florida and reported that Bill Gates\u2019s spokeswoman said, \u201cMr. Gates \u2014 who has his own $40 million jet \u2014 hadn\u2019t been aware it was Mr. Epstein\u2019s plane.\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe Times reported that Bill Gates had met in with Epstein multiple times ( here ). This was after Epstein had been convicted of past sex crimes. The Times reported that, \u201cbeginning in 2011, Mr. Gates met with Mr. Epstein on numerous occasions\u201d and \u201cEmployees of Mr. Gates\u2019s foundation also paid multiple visits to Mr. Epstein\u2019s mansion.\u201d Exchanges were recorded and reported by the newspaper, including possible philanthropic collaboration.\n\nTo claim, however, that Gates visited Epstein\u2019s island multiple times is baseless. Reuters was unable to find any flight logs corroborating this allegation. It appears Gates flew on an aircraft of Epstein\u2019s once, but this was to Florida. A spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation confirmed to Reuters via email that this claim is untrue.\n\nFalse. While Gates had met with Epstein, flight logs disprove he visited Epstein\u2019s Caribbean island multiple times.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
