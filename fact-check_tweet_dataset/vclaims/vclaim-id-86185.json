They want $12 billion more. It\u2019s $54.4 billion, which is by itself a lot, but in foreign aid they want 12 billion over the $54 billion. Think of it. We give $54 billion, a lot of it because they want to give it. They don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re giving it to. In many cases, people don\u2019t ever \u2014 don\u2019t even know the name of the country. They know nothing about the country, and yet \u2014 so they\u2019re going to give 54.4 billion in foreign aid but they want 12 billion more than that in foreign aid but they won\u2019t approve $5.6 billion for a wall that\u2019s going to pay for itself almost on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\nJust about every statement by Trump here is wrong. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a Communist government that had seized power before it was toppled by political unrest; there were no terrorists going into Russia. (Perhaps the president is thinking of Chechnya?) The United States secretly funded Afghan insurgents who helped make the war a quagmire for the Soviets \u2014 what the State Department says became \u201cthe longest and largest [covert action] in U.S. history to that point.\u201d The Afghan war might have been a contributing factor to the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse but it was certainly not the only factor. The biggest factor likely was a collapse in oil prices after Saudi Arabia altered its oil policy in 1985, which led to massive borrowing by the government and then an effective bankruptcy of the country.\n\n\u201cIndia, Russia, you look at some of the satellite countries that are extremely wealthy with oil surrounding. I spoke to some of this. I said to them a certain country, very rich country, what would you do if the United States pulled out? \u2018Oh, we\u2019d be taken over by the Taliban and terrorists.\u2019 I said then why are you charging us when we have to use your country to send product through? Why are you charging us when we send airplanes over your country? We are doing the job for you. Why are you charging us? He said to me, very great gentleman, smart, he said to me: \u2018Well, nobody ever asked me not to.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m asking you not to.\u2019 He said we will not charge you, and I am talking about millions and millions of dollars. Flights over his country. But I say to him what would happen if we weren\u2019t here and he looks at me and he goes, \u2018We would be overrun, we could not defend ourselves,\u2019 and yet he charges us, but he doesn\u2019t charge us anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople see that gasoline is way down and the reason it\u2019s way down is because I called up some of the OPEC people. I say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019 You know, if you look back a few months, gasoline was at $83 a barrel, that was going to be bad and it was going to $100 and some people were saying $125, Rick. And I made calls. I say, \u2018You\u2019d better let that oil \u2014 that gasoline flow,\u2019 and they did and now it\u2019s down to $44, and I put out a social media statement yesterday. I said, \u2018Do you think it\u2019s luck that that happened?\u2019 It\u2019s not luck. It\u2019s not luck. I called up certain people and I said, \u2018Let that damn oil and gasoline, you let it flow, the oil!\u2019 It was going up to $125. If that would have happened then you would have had a recession, depression like we\u2019ve had in the past when that happened.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
