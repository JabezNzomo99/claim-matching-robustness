It was later copied and reposted by other sites.\n\nThe story went up after the Boston Globe reported that Kerry had met with the Iranian foreign minister in an effort to preserve parts of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement that Kerry helped negotiate, and that President Donald Trump recently decided to abandon.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to criticize the former U.S. secretary of state, calling his meeting \u201cpossibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also tweeted that Kerry\u2019s meeting \u201ccertainly raises Logan Act questions,\u201d referring to the 1799 federal law that prohibits private citizens without authority from interfering in negotiations between the U.S. and other foreign governments.\n\nIn a statement to the Globe, Kerry spokesman Matt Summers said it\u2019s not unusual for former secretaries of state to remain in contact with foreign leaders.\n\n\u201cI think every American would want every voice possible urging Iran to remain in compliance with the nuclear agreement that prevented a war. Secretary Kerry stays in touch with his former counterparts around the world just like every previous Secretary of State,\u201d Kerry\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cLike America\u2019s closest allies, he believes it is important that the nuclear agreement, which took the world years to negotiate, remain effective as countries focus on stability in the region.\u201d\n\nAlthough the story shared on Facebook mentions Trump\u2019s tweet and the Logan Act, it does not offer any evidence to support the claim that Kerry is \u201cfacing prison\u201d because of the meeting. No one has been convicted under the Logan Act since it was passed more than 200 years ago.\n\nIn fact, the story itself contradicts its own headline when it quotes Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz as referring to the Logan Act as a \u201cdead letter.\u201d On Fox News, Dershowitz said, \u201cFortunately for everybody, the Logan Act [is a] dead letter but if it were in existence, my friend John Kerry would be violating the Logan Act.\u201d\n\nThis is at least the second time this year that websites have suggested that Kerry is facing charges under that law.\n\nAs we wrote in February, another group of sites that use click-bait headlines posted a story falsely claiming the White House had announced that Kerry was \u201cfacing felony charges.\u201d That story followed reports that Kerry had met with a friend of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cJohn Kerry Facing Prison After Interfering With Iran.\u201d Conservativestories.com. 10 May 2018.\n\nTrump, Donald J. \u201cRemarks by President Trump on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\u201d Whitehouse.gov. 8 May 2018.\n\nShaw, Adam. \u201cJohn Kerry under fire for reported \u2018shadow diplomacy\u2019 to save Iran deal.\u201d Fox News. 5 May 2018.", "lang": "en"}
