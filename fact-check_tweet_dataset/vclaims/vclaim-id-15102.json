The Facebook page shared what appears to be a fake tweet purportedly from a French news service.\n\nFrance 24 was one of the news outlets to watch as the fire at Notre Dame burned Monday. It tweeted many times throughout the day, updating the world about the attempts to stop the fire.\n\nThe supposed tweet posted on Statist Zombies\u2019 Facebook page does not appear on its timeline, though, and does not appear to have been deleted. When The Daily Caller searched for the phrase attributed to Macron in the tweet, it appeared only on sites like Reddit and Kiwi Farms that were re-sharing the same image. The quote did not appear in any news reports of the fire, and we could not find any footage of Macron making this comment.\n\nWhile France 24 has not responded to the Caller\u2019s request for comment, all of the images of the tweet are exactly the same, with a time stamp of 13 seconds after the tweet was posted. Despite the English account for France 24 having more than 200,000 Twitter followers, no screen grabs were found with a different time stamp.\n\nThe Catholic Herald published a piece on Tuesday that referenced the same unproven quote from Macron, but corrected its article after being asked by the Caller for a source.\n\nMacron did make a statement about the rebuilding of the historic cathedral Monday while speaking to reporters. Emphasizing its historical significance, he said that Notre Dame is a part of France\u2019s destiny and will be rebuilt by the entire nation. He also announced a national subscription to raise money for the rebuilding efforts.\n\nWhile the damage at the historic cathedral was feared to be ruinous, an inspection revealed the building to be structurally sound, despite losing its iconic spire and much of its roof.\n\nA number of donors have come forward pledging money to help rebuild the cathedral, including Apple, the parent company of Louis Vuitton and Total, a French oil and gas company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need hundreds of millions of euros to rebuild, maybe more, because 2,800 square meters of roof has burned and also \u2026 the big tower of the cathedral has burned too, so we really need to rebuild and it\u2019s going to be very costly,\u201d Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, president of the \u00cele-de-France region, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the Gothic cathedral began in the 12th century, and the site has seen many renovations over the years. Macron said Tuesday that he wants the cathedral rebuilt in five years, a timeline some experts say is unrealistic.", "lang": "en"}
