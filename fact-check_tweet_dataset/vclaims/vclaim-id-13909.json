He later deleted the tweet, which was captioned as, \u201cTMC goons brutally attacked BJP worker Sagar Roy in Kaligram village of West Bengal. Roy had reportedly resisted Trinamool attempt at booth capturing.\u201d\n\nSagar Roy, a BJP worker, was beaten up in West Bengal's North Malda, during the second phase of elections.\n\nSeveral Twitter users pointed out that the incident was not from Bengal but was from Bihar and had no political overtones. A user linked a news report by Prabhat Khabar on the incident.\n\nAnother user also pointed out that the women in video were crying for help in Hindi, which suggested that the video was unlikely to be from West Bengal.\n\nThe gruesome incident took place in West Tola village under the Goradih police station in Bhagalpur district on April 16 2019, when Suresh Mondal was killed by his father and younger brother over a family dispute.\n\nIt is not clear who shot the video at the time.\n\nAccording to the news report, it was a family feud which led to the murder of the elder son, though the exact cause of the dispute is not known. Ashish Mondal, the brother of the deceased, has been taken into custody. \n\n\n\nBOOM reached out to the Goshalla police station in Bhagalpur where a senior officer corroborated the events. Local police told BOOM that video was from the same incident and that the accused were in custody.\n\nOther news outlets have also reported on the incident.
