While the ACT is administered in every state, the percentage of students who take this test varies widely by state. Anywhere between 9 and 100 percent of students take this test in each state.\n\nRepresentatives from Walker\u2019s office and his Our American Revival PAC pointed the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction\u2019s announcements as the source of his statements. The agency compares Wisconsin to 29 other states with 50 percent or more of graduates taking the ACT. Using that measure, Wisconsin does rank second. Minnesota had the highest score in that group.\n\nNationally, just over half \u2014 57 percent \u2014 of graduates take the ACT. The average composite score for Wisconsin, where 73 percent of graduates took the test, was 22.2 in 2014. Wisconsin\u2019s average composite score, as well as scores for other college readiness benchmarks in the test, are higher than the national average.\n\nWhen compared to all 50 states, Wisconsin has the 17th highest average composite score. ACT spokeswoman Katie Wacker warned against comparing all states, or even comparing some states to others with 100 percent participation rate. Midwestern states tend to have strong scores because the ACT was founded in the region and grew organically from the Midwest, Wacker said.\n\nBut Wisconsin\u2019s 2014 composite score is the same as it was in 2011, when Walker took office. In 2012 and 2013, the score was lower by one-tenth of a point, at 22.1. So if Walker is measuring the increase in 2014 from the score in 2012 and 2013, he is correct that the score is \u201cbetter,\u201d though by a tenth of a point. But the score has been the same compared to his first year in office.\n\nThe four-year graduation rate for the class of 2010-2011 was 87 percent. The rate for the class of 2012-2013 was 1 percent higher, at 88 percent. This was the case for almost all subgroups of students \u2014 by race, gender, students with disabilities and students identified as \u201ceconomically disadvantaged.\u201d The six-year graduation rate also improved.\n\nWalker said reading scores \u201care up over the past four years.\u201d According to the state education agency\u2019s numbers, he is correct that the percentage of students scoring proficient and advanced in statewide assessments increased from 35.5 percent in the 2010-11 school year to 36.6 percent in the 2013-14 school year. That was a 3.1 percent growth. Fifth and eighth grade students fell in reading scores between those two school years.\n\nFor example, the percentage of students scoring proficient or advanced in fourth grade went from 33.9 in 2010-11; 35.2 in 2011-12; back down to 32.9 in 2012-13; and then up to 36.3 in 2013-14. For eighth grade, the percentage went from 39.7 in 2010-11; then dipped to 32.9 in 2011-12; then soared to 40.2 in 2012-13; and dipped back to 33.9 in 2013-14. This shows inconsistent performance among grade levels.\n\nWalker made the point that under his leadership, three measures of \u201cschool scores\u201d improved: ACT scores, graduation rates and reading scores. Walker is on point that the graduation rate improved since he took office. Reading scores in general among third to 10th graders also increased. But a closer look at grade-level performance shows that some grades experienced fluctuations (of higher percentage points than the overall growth) during those years.\n\nThe most problematic statement is his characterization of ACT scores. There is not an accurate measure of state-by-state ACT comparison because of the varying participation rates. In addition, just over half of graduates in the country take this test. Some states have the lowest participation rates but the highest ACT scores, and some states that require ACT testing and have 100 percent participation have extremely low scores. In addition, his claim that Wisconsin\u2019s ACT scores are the \u201csecond best in the country\u201d is misleading, because it is in comparison to 29 other states. It creates an impression that Wisconsin\u2019s score is better than 48 other states, but the state\u2019s raw score ranks at 17th out of 50 states.\n\nIt is important to note that growth in these areas was modest. The percent growth for ACT scores was 0.5 percent; graduation rate was 1.1 percent; and reading scores saw a 3.1 percent increase. That hardly indicates an overhaul of the state\u2019s education system, or improvements that can be credited to the state\u2019s top executive.", "lang": "en"}
