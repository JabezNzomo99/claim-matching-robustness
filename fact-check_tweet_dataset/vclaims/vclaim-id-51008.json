Its disfigurement and abuse was not related to Vick, according to the photographer.\n\nVick, a former NFL quarterback, pleaded guilty to federal and state charges in a dogfighting investigation in 2007 and 2008, respectively. He was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison but got released early, according to ESPN.\n\nThe viral Facebook post allegedly shows a pit bull that Vick disfigured for dogfighting purposes. The image has been shared more than 40,000 times.

So next time you say \u2018he did his time he\u2019s an NFL hero,\u2019 or \u2018it was part of his upbringing or culture\u2019 I want you to really think carefully before you say it around me.\u201d\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that Mike Bizelli, a St. Louis-based photographer, took the photo in July 2009. Rescuers removed the female pit bull, Fay, from a property near Hannibal, Missouri, during one of the largest dogfighting busts in history, according to Bizelli.\n\n\u201cThis is two years past the Vick case,\u201d Bizelli told the Caller in an email. \u201cVick had nothing to do with Fay.\u201d\n\nAccording to his 2007 federal plea agreement, Vick does not appear to have participated in any dogfighting activities in Missouri. He participated in dogfighting-related activities in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, New York and New Jersey.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many dogs died during his Virginia-based Bad Newz Kennels\u2019 operation but, according to Vick\u2019s federal plea agreement, Vick or his associates executed at least 15 dogs. Authorities rescued 47 dogs from the property in 2007, reported the Washington Post.\n\nDogs Deserve Better, an animal welfare nonprofit, purchased Vick\u2019s property in 2011, turning it into a rehabilitation center for abused and neglected canines, according to its website.", "lang": "en"}
