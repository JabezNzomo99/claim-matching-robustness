You're saying that would affect you because you earn over that sum?\" The man confirmed he did.\n\nIf you adjust that using average earnings figures from the ONS, it's likely that you need to be earning about \u00a381,000 to be in the top 5% of income taxpayers today.\n\nBut the figures from HMRC exclude people earning too little to pay income tax, which means that the audience member would have been well into the top 5% of all earners.\n\nAll the figures so far have been for the whole of the UK but there are clearly regional variations in these figures.\n\nWhile we do not have figures for how much you would need to earn to be in the top 5% of earners in a particular region, we do have figures for median earnings by region, that's the amount you'd have to earn to be in the top 50%.\n\nThe region with the lowest average weekly earnings is the North East of England at \u00a3531.10, which is 24% or \u00a3168 a week lower than the highest earning region, London at \u00a3699.20.\n\nThe audience-member also said: \"Every doctor in the country earns more than that [\u00a380,000]. Every doctor, every accountant, every solicitor earns more than that.\"\n\nThe median solicitor (that's the one half of solicitors earn more than and half earn less than) earns \u00a341,127 while the median chartered or certified accountant earns \u00a335,730.", "lang": "en"}
