This claim has also been repeated in articles published by GlobalResearch.ca, Sustainable.media and Natural News. The \u201cenzymes\u201d the article refers to appears to be nagalase.\n\nNagalase (also called alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) is not known to be in any vaccine, based on the fact-sheets by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oxford University\u2019s Vaccine Knowledge Project. The claim that it is present in vaccines is unsupported.\n\nNagalase is naturally produced by the body and is not inherently harmful. In fact, the enzyme is needed to enable cells to digest glycolipids and glycoproteins, and its importance is underscored by the fact that genetic mutations resulting in loss of nagalase activity lead to Schindler disease[1]. Severely affected individuals typically do not live past childhood.\n\nIn short, nagalase fulfills an important biological function and normal, healthy cells \u2013 not just cancer cells \u2013 produce nagalase.\n\nStudies have observed higher levels of nagalase in the blood of cancer patients[3,4], suggesting that nagalase production and/or secretion is increased in cancer patients. The same two studies also reported that nagalase reduces the production of the protein Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor (or GcMAF) by reducing the availability of its precursor called Gc protein. As GcMAF could potentially activate macrophages to target cancer cells, some researchers have explored circumventing reduced GcMAF levels in cancer patients through GcMAF injections.\n\nTo date, however, scientific studies supporting GcMAF as a cancer cure are rife with problems. The three studies purportedly showing the efficacy of GcMAF against cancer appear to have originated from only a single research group. Of these three articles, two have been retracted owing to problems with the study design and issues with ethics approval, as explained in this letter (retraction notices 1 and 2). Cancer Research UK and the Anticancer Fund have already warned the general public against using GcMAF as an anticancer cure, as scientific evidence for its effectiveness is greatly lacking.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Wang et al.
