Several viral posts on social media spread rumours about the government\u2019s decision to rename Mughal Garden in the premises of Rashtrapati Bhavan over the last few days. It is claimed that the Mughal Gardens are set to be renamed as \u2018Ashok Vatika\u2019.\n\nVishvas news investigation revealed the claim to be fake and similar claims like renaming as \u2018Rajendra Prasad Garden\u2019 was over the Internet even in the past.\n\nFacebook user \u2018Barharia Siwan\u2019 wrote, \u201cThe government is preparing to change the name of Mughal Garden to Ashok Vatika. We do not mind the hour.\u201d\n\nMany other users have shared these photos with similar claims. See the archive link for the post here.\n\nThe Mughal Gardens in the premises of Rashtrapati Bhavan have historical significance. The change in its name will be big news in itself. But we did not find any such information in the news search.\n\nSearching with other keywords, we found a link to some old news, according to which the All India Hindu Mahasabha demanded the renaming of the Mughal Gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan to \u2018Rajendra Prasad Garden\u2019. According to the news published on 20 August 2017 on the NBT website , the Hindu Mahasabha had also written a letter to President Ramnath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi with this demand.\n\nVishwas News contacted the press secretary of Rashtrapati Bhavan, Ajay Kumar Singh. We were informed by the press secretary\u2019s office that the claims were rumours. \u201cWe do not comment on any rumors. For any information about this, the website of Rashtrapati Bhavan can be checked,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter that we checked the website of Rashtrapati Bhavan. The main building is located in Circuit 1 of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, while the museum is present in Circuit 2. At the same time, there are many gardens in Circuit 3, including the Mughal Gardens. Here also we did not see any information about name change of the Mughal Gardens.\n\nMore than one lakh people follow the page sharing the viral claim on Facebook. This page has been active on Facebook since October 2012.\n\nDisclaimer: The article has been modified by removing some details which were not required or were irrelevant to the article. The process of updating the story is according to the SOP and there is no change in the conclusion.\n\nConclusion: The claim of renaming Mughal Gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan as \u2018Ashok Vatika\u2019 is fake. Earlier, the rumor of Mughal Garden being renamed Rajendra Prasad Garden has gone viral, which was proved wrong in Vishwas News investigation.", "lang": "en"}
