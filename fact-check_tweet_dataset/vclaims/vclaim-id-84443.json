To be photographed with politicians opposed to BJP has turned into a risky proposition for women. Unknown to them, right-wing social media warriors are sharing their pictures online along with lewd jokes and suggestive remarks.\n\nOne such Twitter user Jay @YesiamSaffron (now changed to @Saffron_Rocks) who is \u201cblessed and honored\u201d to be followed by Prime Minister Modi on Twitter recently tweeted pictures of women with AAP leaders with remarks suggestive of sexual exploitation to facilitate their \u201cration card\u201d.\n\nThe ration card reference traces its origins to the case of Sandeep Kumar, the AAP MLA who was sacked from the party last year over a sex tape. The women in the tape had alleged that he exploited them over the promise to get their ration cards made. While AAP has cut off its links with Sandeep Kumar, as per newspaper reports, he was last seen campaigning for a BJP candidate in Narela.\n\nThe lady in the middle picture here is of Manisha Gupta who had quit Axis Bank to join AAP in 2014. Though she quit the bank three years ago, BJP supporters have been trying to use her to link AAP with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) chargesheet against Axis Bank in the money laundering case of demonetized notes. This social media warrior has taken this one step further to make sexual innuendos with a caption, \u201cHansi to phansi, phansi to baat bani\u2026\u201d Get ration card made in three steps says the attached picture.\n\n\u201cThis is Kejriwal\u2019s MP Bhagwant Mann doing something with a party worker. Can you guess what he is doing\u201d reads the caption. The tweet goes on to make yet another ration card insinuation. In reality, this is a picture is of Bhagwant Mann with his wife, Inderjeet Kaur which has been picked from the Internet.\n\nWhen actor Preeti Jhangiani tweeted her picture with Arvind Kejriwal at the Sindhi Film festival in 2016, little did she know that BJP supporters will use the picture to link her with Kejriwal via a crude joke saying \u201cration card ban-ne deejiye\u201d.\n\nThis was the first official film festival exclusively for Sindhi films organized by the Sindhi Academy of Delhi government. This photograph has been picked from Getty Images where it is available along with several other photographs of the event.\n\nBeing photographed with a politician even in a public place is a reason for your picture to be shared widely on social media and become a butt of jokes. This is a picture of a crowd, a few women can be seen with Kejriwal and several others including policemen in the background. It is probably a picture from a rally. Once again it has been shared by the same handle with yet another \u201cration card\u201d suggestion. Is it even funny anymore?\n\nAnd there\u2019s this photoshopped picture of Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s wife Sunita Kejriwal and Swati Maliwal who is the Chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women with Arvind Kejriwal, again with a crude Ration Card joke. If this is not pukeworthy, what is?\n\nThe obsession with \u201cration card\u201d doesn\u2019t end there. The photographs and crude jokes continue.\n\nThe Twitter space is full of smear campaigns between political parties. Misogyny and sexist innuendoes are commonplace. Yet it is shocking when you come across a handle making lewd jokes on pictures of women with political opponents and in the same breath boasting of being followed by the Prime Minister of the country. This brings us back to the question that has been asked many times before: Why does PM Modi follow such handles? \u201cBeti bachao, beti padao\u201d, \u201cbahut hua naari par vaar, abki baar Modi Sarkar\u201d, all these seem to be hollow slogans if Mr. Modi himself doesn\u2019t take care about who he follows on twitter.\n\nOut of his 30 million followers, PM Modi has carefully selected less than 1800 people to follow back. Do these people feel encouraged in their behaviour because the PM follows them? Probably, yes. Do their tweets appear on his TL? Yes. Does he feel disturbed to see such material on his TL? Don\u2019t know. Should he send a strong message to the select few he follows about offensive tweets? Yes. Will he do it? Don\u2019t know.", "lang": "en"}
