This has been repeated in several other newspapers.\n\nIt mixes up the two kinds of \u2018deposit\u2019 that are involved in buying a house.\n\nThe Help to Buy ISA scheme allows savers to claim a government bonus on top of their savings when they apply to buy their first home. Those savings are commonly referred to as the \u2018mortgage deposit\u2019. It\u2019s what most people are referring to when they talk about \u2018saving for a deposit\u2019, and what banks themselves describe as your \u2018deposit\u2019.\n\nSo it was reasonable for Mr. Osborne to call these savings \u2018your deposit\u2019 when he introduced them in his 2015 Budget speech.\n\nThe Treasury told us that the government bonus was never meant to pay for the initial exchange deposit.\n\nThis is an upfront payment that discourages the buyer from pulling out before they complete the deal. It\u2019s made when the contracts are signed but before the sale completes, so before the bonus payments are provided by the government.\n\nThe Treasury said that the scheme had been communicated in line with existing government and industry practices, including information about when the bonus payments from the government would be made.\n\nThere are regulations that say it\u2019s the responsibility of the banks who sell Help to Buy ISAs to customers make sure that they are promoted in a way that is \u2018fair, clear and not misleading\u2019.\n\nThe government\u2019s bonus payment will count towards a mortgage deposit\n\nSome reports have also claimed that Help to Buy ISAs don\u2019t boost people\u2019s savings when they need a mortgage, because the payment isn\u2019t made until after the purchase is completed.\n\nIn practice, that claim is incorrect too.\n\nThe bonus will still be counted by the bank towards a buyers\u2019 mortgage deposit when they apply, even though it won\u2019t have arrived in their bank account yet.\n\nFinancial magazine Moneywise told us that \u201cmortgage lenders will treat the bonus as part of the buyers\u2019 mortgage deposit, as if it\u2019s already part of the buyers\u2019 savings\u201d.\n\nAnd that\u2019s also what six banks told the Financial Times.\n\nWe went down to our local bank with an \u2018agreement in principle\u2019 on a mortgage and asked about this point. The branch staff were unsure, but the adviser we spoke to over the phone thought that the bonus amount would be counted toward the deposit.\n\nInitial exchange deposits can be negotiated down\n\nFinally, some newspapers have claimed that because the government bonus can\u2019t be counted towards an initial exchange deposit, the scheme will only help people who already have the money to buy a house anyway.\n\nThey say there\u2019s not much point being promised a top-up on your mortgage deposit, if you can\u2019t afford the initial exchange deposit that\u2019s needed to sign the contracts.\n\nInitial exchange deposits don\u2019t need to be a problem because they\u2019re negotiable.\n\nMoneywise told us that exchange deposits can be negotiated down if the buyer can\u2019t afford it at that point in the process. As long as the seller is willing, they can agree to receive the full amount of money later on, when the sale completes.", "lang": "en"}
