But the cost to Russia of further advancement is already increased and will continue to increase. And if that\u2019s the case then you have to ask yourself if you\u2019re sitting in Moscow, what are we getting out of this? We\u2019re getting Russian casualties, soldiers being killed fighting in Ukraine, for what? That\u2019s why I hope they will see there is no benefit for them but the price will continue to grow. So why not exchange this for something positive, such as lifting sanctions? This will be something positive on the Russian agenda with the rest of the international community,\u201d Volker told the BBC in an interview.\n\nVolker told Polygraph.info that Russian media had misrepresented what he had said during his visit to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat I was saying is that Ukraine cannot take back the territories by military force \u2014 it can regain them only through Russia agreeing to withdraw its forces and implement the Minsk agreements,\u201d Volker wrote in an email. \u201cThe RT story seems to say the opposite \u2014 that I was saying U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is aimed at retaking the territory by force, which is also false.\u201d\n\nUkraine recently received its first shipment of Javelin man-portable anti-tank missiles from the U.S. The Ukrainian government paid $47 million for the missile systems, as well as training and instruction for Ukrainian military personnel.\n\nAlso on May 21, the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN reported that the first live-fire exercise with the Javelin on Ukrainian soil had been held.\n\nPresident Petro Poroshenko announced the test firing in a Tweet that same day.\n\nWhile the Javelin missiles are intended to increase the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 ability to repel further Russian attacks, their use and deployment near the front lines are heavily restricted.U.S. officials have insisted the missiles are only meant for \u201cdefensive\u201d measures.\n\nWestern media cite U.S. defense sources who say the Javelins are supplied only to units \u201cfar back\u201d from the front in eastern Ukraine to ensure they\u2019re not used for offensive purposes or captured by Russian-backed forces.", "lang": "en"}
