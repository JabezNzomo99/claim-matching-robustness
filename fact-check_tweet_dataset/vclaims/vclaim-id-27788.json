All outbound internet traffic will be filtered through these points.\n\u2022 ISPs will be required to install \u201ctechnical means of countering threats\u201d that will be provided free of charge by Roskomnadzor, Russia's state communications regulator. Those technical means will allow the operator to know the source of web traffic and block materials that are banned in Russia (as opposed to operators doing it themselves, thus releasing them from liability). When threats to the system arise, Roskomnadzor will be able to intervene in the management of the network. The operators of \u201ccommunication rendering services\u201d will be required to provide all relevant information, controls and supervisory powers to the executive authority within three days of the \u201ctechnical means\u201d being installed.\n\u2022 Operators must notify the authorities of cross-border communication channels.\n\u2022 A national domain name system (DNS) registry will be created for greater autonomy, allowing the controlling body to enact centralized management of communication networks in the event there are threats to the integrity of RUnet.\n\u2022 Telecom operators must correct the routes of the passage of messages, only using traffic exchange points which are in a special register, while also providing authorities with data on how their networks are arranged and what DNS servers they use.\n\u2022 See that exercises are conducted so that authorities are not caught off guard.\n\nThe creation of this so-called sovereign internet will, in short, allow Russia to sequester RUnet from the internet, giving them far more power to monitor and control web traffic within Russia.\n\nAs noted by the Moscow Times, Fang Binxing, the creator of \u201cThe Great Firewall of China,\u201d put forward the concept of establishing a sovereign internet in 2011.\n\nBeijing and Moscow have both viewed internet sovereignty as an extension of national sovereignty.\n\nBut the sovereign internet bill in Russia has been opposed on numerous grounds.\n\nRussia\u2019s Audit Chamber, a parliamentary financial watchdog agency, says the project, whose initial cost has been estimated at 25 billion rubles (approx. $38 million), will require additional funding.\n\nSome experts have put ancillary costs at 125 billion rubles (approx. $190 million) annually, the news portal AVA.MD reported.\n\nThe Audit Chamber likewise believes the sovereign internet project will raise the costs of goods and services in Russia.\n\nThe president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned Volodin that the sovereign RUnet could result in the \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d of the country\u2019s communications networks.\n\nIt further said disconnecting Russia from foreign root servers was an unnecessary step, as Russia already has 11 root servers to rely on.\n\nLikewise, Sergei Ivanov, a Duma deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), to which Lugovoi also belongs, said Russia was technically not in a position to sustain such a system on its own.\n\n\"Russia does not produce any IT hardware, only cables, which some people better hang themselves on.\"\n\nAudit Chamber head Aleksei Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister, tweeted that the bill had been adopted in its first reading \"too hurriedly and without open dialogue with IT and the industrial community.\"\n\nExperts told Russia\u2019s RBC news agency that the draft law in its current form is impractical, as it would require operators to continuously transmit the totality of their network scheme and traffic routing to Roskomnadzor, which they say is impossible as \"the network is constantly expanding and updating.\"\n\nBut some have put the need for the system in starker terms.\n\n\"This is very serious. This is a path towards isolating Russia as a whole...from the Internet,\" Radio Free Europe quoted Russian security analyst Andrei Soldatov as telling AFP.\n\nThe Guardian cited Filipp Kulin, a Russian internet expert, as telling the BBC\u2019s Russian language service: \u201cThe disconnection of Russia from the global web would mean that we are already at war with everyone. In this situation we should be thinking how to grow potatoes in a nuclear winter, and not about the internet.\u201d\n\nRussia is also no stranger to politically motivated censorship.\n\nIn March 2014, the government blocked the LiveJournal blogs of Alexei Navalny, Kasparov.ru and Grani.ru on the pretext that they had made \u201ccalls for unlawful activity\u201d during Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula.\n\nAmnesty International that year found that the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly in Russia had long been only partial and often involved risks for critics of the government.\n\nRoskomnadzor was also behind failed efforts to block the Telegram messaging app in April 2018 for refusing to give Russian security services access to users\u2019 encrypted messages. That ban, ironically, has been flouted by Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov and RT editor in Chief Margarita Simonyan.\n\nCritics have also noted that the same individuals behind efforts to further tighten state control of the internet and ban \u201cinsults\u201d against state officials are now behind the effort to bring the internet under the Kremlin\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cAmong the authors: Andrey Klishas and Andrey Lugovoi. The thief and the killer will ban us from the Internet. Class,\u201d tweeted Ruslan Shaveddinov, the host of Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel, who himself has ended up behind bars for retweeting calls to protest.\n\nWhile accusations aga inst Lugovoi are well-publicized, Navalny has accused Klishas of owning an undeclared 8.4 thousand square meter property in Moscow\u2019s prestigious Rublyovka residential area, as well as a $174,000 Maybach that had racked up over 100 traffic citations.\n\nVolodin is likely correct in his assertion that the bill\u2019s intention is not to entirely cut Russia off form the World Wide Web. However, the law gives the Russian government unlimited control over internet access as well as content.\n\nThe point of a sovereign RUnet was not just to send a message to those who are allegedly trying to \u201csteer\u201d Russia\u2019s information space from abroad, but Russians themselves who are generally accustomed to internet freedom \u201cby global standards,\u201d Anton Fortunatov, head of the Department of Electronic Media, Institute of Philology and Journalism at Nizhny Novgorod State University, told the Davidov Index blog.\n\nAnd, in a country where it is illegal to distribute images of Russian President Vladimir Putin wearing makeup, Google risks being suspended for identifying Crimea as Ukrainian territory and promulgating memes can lead to criminal prosecution, the risk that the RUnet project will result in an even smaller space for free expression online in Russia remains very real.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Volodin's claim it is important for Russia not to \"close\" the interent misleading.", "lang": "en"}
