As a part of the larger set of claims about the government\u2019s commitment to social justice, this infographic was published on the government\u2019s 48- months portal.\n\nHas the stipend for SC students been increased?\n\n The first claim is that stipend for day scholars has been raised from \u20b9150 to \u20b9225 and for hostellers raised from \u20b9350 to \u20b9 525. The stipend/scholarship is paid to the students belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community studying in the class IX & X, under the pre-matric scholarship scheme. The scheme was amended in September 2017 and the amount of scholarship has been increased. The amendment includes revision of maintenance allowance for Day Scholars from \u20b9150 per month to \u20b9225 per month and for Hostellers from \u20b9 350 per month to \u20b9525 per month.\n\nClaim: Stipend for day scholars has been raised from \u20b9150 to \u20b9225 and for hostellers from \u20b9350 to \u20b9525. Fact: Revision of maintenance allowance for Day Scholars from \u20b9150 per month to \u20b9225 per month and for Hostellers from \u20b9350 per month to \u20b9 525 per month was done in September 2017. Hence this claim is TRUE.\n\nHas the income eligibility been increased for SC and OBC students for availing free coaching?\n\n The second claim is that for free coaching for SC and OBC students, income eligibility raised from \u20b94.5 lakhs to \u20b96 lakh. The objective of this scheme is to provide quality coaching for economically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) candidates to enable them to appear in competitive examinations and also succeed in obtaining a job in Public/Private Sector. For students to be eligible under this scheme, the total family income from all sources should be less than or equal to \u20b96 lakh per annum. This was noted in the 2017-18 annual report of the Ministry of Social Justice. Further, a press release of the ministry in February 2018 notes that the income eligibility has been raised from \u20b94.5 lakhs to \u20b96 lakhs.\n\nHas the stipend been raised for SC and OBC students availing free coaching? \n\n The third claim is that stipend has been raised from \u20b91500 to \u20b9 2500 for local students and from \u20b93000 to \u20b95000 for outstation students. The 2017-18 annual report of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment notes that, \u2018monthly stipend of \u20b9 2500 per student will be paid for local students for attending the coaching class. Similarly, \u20b95000 per student will be paid per month for outstation students.\u2019\n\nFurther, a press release of the ministry in February 2018 notes that the stipend has been raised from \u20b91500 to \u20b92500 for local students and from \u20b93000 to \u20b95000 per month for outstation students.\n\nHave the rates of Pre-Matric scholarships increased for OBCs?\n\n The fourth claim is that for pre-matric scholarship of OBCs, the rates of scholarship increased substantially. According to a press release of the ministry in February 2018, \u2018the earlier rates of scholarships of day scholars from Class I to V, Class VI to VIII and Class IX to X of \u20b925, \u20b940 and \u20b950 respectively for 10 months has been revised to \u20b9100 per month for 10 months from Class I to X. Earlier rates of scholarships of hostellers from Class III to VIII and Class IX to X of \u20b9200 and \u20b9250 respectively for ten months has been revised to \u20b9500 per month for 10 months from Class III to X.\u2019 The scheme has been revised with effect from 2017-18.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
