Below is our analysis:\n\nCLAIM 1 : Tripura has the highest rate of crimes against women in the country\n\nBOOM's analysis found it to be false.\n\nThough Tripura is among the 15 states / union territories with high rates of crimes against women in the country, it does not top the list, according to 2015 data of National Crime Records Bureau.\n\nRate of crimes against women refers to crimes committed against women reported per 1,00,000 female population.\n\nDelhi (184.3) has the highest rate of violence against women followed by the north eastern state of Assam (148.2) and Telengana (83.1). Tripura has recorded a rate of 68.2 which is above the national crime rate of 53.9.\n\nThe BJP chief also said that 919 cases of crimes against women were reported in 10 months in Tripura.\n\nIt was not clear from his speech which months he was referring to. However, a study of crimes against women by Tripura Police shows that the number of crimes against women in 2016 reported between January to November has decreased by 20% from that of 2015.\n\nCLAIM 2 : 25% of the literate population of the state is unemployed\n\nBOOM found that government data shows unemployment among graduates in Tripura is about 23 percent, which is close to what Amit Shah said.\n\nOut of every 1000 graduates in Tripura 228 are unemployed, according to the 5th Annual Employment- Unemployment Survey (2015-16) by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. That means 22.8% of graduates in Tripura are unemployed.\n\nOut of every 1000 graduates in India, 100 (10%) are unemployed.\n\nWe assume that by \u201cliterate population\u201d (see BJP\u2019s tweet above), Shah is referring to the population with graduate level qualification.\n\nTripura ranks as the 4th worst state in terms of unemployment among graduates in the country.", "lang": "en"}
