It really pinches us when our work is used without our consent and we aren\u2019t even acknowledged.\u201d The founders of the social enterprise, Bhuli took to social media to raise their voice against the unauthorized use of their artwork at Haridwar Railway Station.\n\nSpotting their artwork on display at a prominent public place is a moment of pride for any artist. But not when the same has been done without their prior permission and without giving them credit for it.\n\nThe Bhuli team raised their concerns in a Facebook post as well: \u201cSpotted at Haridwar Station, happy to see it up there! It says \u201cTribal art of Uttarakhand\u201d (FALSE INFORMATION). Also, they didn\u2019t give us any credits. A lot of hard work and research goes into each and every Bhuli series. This is simply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nApart from using an artist\u2019s work without her permission, the board at Haridwar Station also displays misleading information. The paintings are presented as \u201ctribal art of Uttarakhand\u201d which is not true. The three images are not tribal art. As confirmed to Alt News by the artist, Tanya, these are her creations and represent the costume culture of Odisha, Uttarkhand and Manipur. It is matter of concern that an artwork displayed at a public place in Uttarakhand wrongly calls costumes of other states created by an artist as tribal art of Uttarakhand.\n\nBhuli is a social enterprise founded by Tanya Kotnala and Tanya Singh with an aim to revive and interpret the spirit of India\u2019s cottage industry through art and design. The stunning artwork showcases ethnic costumes from different states.\n\nThe founders have also tweeted to Union Minister, Piyush Goyal for his intervention in the unauthorized use of their artworks.\n\nThe Ministry of Railways has responded to the grievance raised by Bhuli. In a tweet, it said that the complaint has been forwarded to Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Moradabad.\n\nReplying to a comment that they should feel happy that their work is being displayed, the artists summed up their stand: \u201cAny art which is publicly displayed without the consent and acknowledgement of the artist is not publicity but theft.\u201d\n\nBy highlighting this story, Alt News hopes Bhuli will get justice. Action should be taken against those responsible for such blatant infringement of intellectual property rights, and the Bhuli team must receive due acknowledgment and royalty for the displayed artwork.", "lang": "en"}
