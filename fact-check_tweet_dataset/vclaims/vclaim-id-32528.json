A \u2018rate card\u2019 which puts a price tag on non-Muslim women was flashed during the broadcast to support the claim. The price range on the alleged card puts a Hindu Brahmin girl at Rs. 6 lakh, Rs. 3 lakh for a Jain girl and Rs. 7 lakh for a Sikh girl.\n\nThe caption shared with the broadcast claims that ISIS is selling Hindu girls in Kerala. The rate of the girls is based on their caste. It further suggests that Muslim boys marry these girls who study in tuition centres and sell them abroad as prostitutes. From the Facebook profile of one Ganapathi Rao, the clip has attracted 80,000 views and nearly 3,000 shares so far.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook. It has also been circulated using an English caption, \u201cCochin based ISIS Converts Hindu girls sells them online. See its rate cards,\u201d especially on Twitter.\n\nShivshankar can be heard saying during the show, \u201cIn this hub of ISIS activity, young Hindus are being radicalized, they might be saying that there is nothing untoward happening there but we can confirm that young Hindus are being radicalized in coaching centres and tuition classes by committed agents of the caliphate. Mysterious rate cards like the one on your screen are being distributed. It is these rate cards, ladies and gentlemen, are being held up as incentives. Look at what this rate card says, it puts up a price on religion, on your faith, if you look closely at the rate card, you\u2019ll see ladies and gentlemen, you\u2019ll see interesting details. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the kind of insidious fine print that is on this rate card, to convert Hindus, caste Brahmins, you have to pay five lakhs, you get paid five lakhs, ladies and gentlemen. A Hindu Brahmin girl \u2013 five lakhs, seven lakh rupees for a Sikh Punjabi gal, for a Gujarati Brahmin and so on and so forth, Hindu Khastriya gal \u2013 four and a half lakhs, Hindu OBC/SC/ST \u2013 two lakhs, Buddhist girl \u2013 one and a half lakh, a Jain girl 3 lakh rupees, the caliphate has put a price on your faith.\u201d\n\nFAKE NEWS BASED ON AN OLD PHOTOSHOPPED IMAGE\n\nThe \u2018rate card\u2019 flashed by Times Now was debunked by Alt News when it was broadcast in June 2017.\n\nBut the pamphlet has been circulating online for several years and Alt News was able to trace the earliest version to February 5, 2010, in a blog titled \u2018Sikh and Islam\u2019.\n\nSeveral clues in the \u2018rate card\u2019 hint at its falseness \u2013 it has the phrase \u201cin the name of allah\u2026\u2026most merciful, most benificiary\u201c, while the usual phrase used is \u201cIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful\u201c. Times Now and viral social media messages claim that the \u2018card\u2019 was issued by the Caliphate. Such a mistake would be unusual of an Islamic organisation.\n\nHowever, it is the heart-shaped image at the top of the pamphlet that gives the most concrete evidence of this poster being photoshopped. The gun-shaped image within the heart is actually the flag of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi\u2019a Islamist militant group. The heart-shaped image has been independently in circulation since 2006.\n\nThis false claim has also been published by various fake news sites like Hindutva.Info, Jagruk Bharat and Hindu Existence in February 2016. It was also featured in Saamana, the mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena in 2010.\n\nDespite debunking the fake rate card in 2017 and again in 2018, Times Now is yet to take down the disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
