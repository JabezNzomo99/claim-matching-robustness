The claim is false; the photos were taken at a BJP campaign event but the man in the photo dressed as Hanuman is not Sarkar.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, for example this one published on April 26, have shared a photo which shows a man dressed like Hanuman sitting on the bonnet of a car.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says: \u201cThis guy is BJP\u2019s Lok Sabha candidate from Ranaghat, WB.\u201d\n\nThe Lok Sabha is India\u2019s parliament. Ranaghat is a constituency in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. The BJP's candidate for Ranaghat is Jagannath Sarkar.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nIndia\u2019s six-week general elections began April 11. Here is a recent AFP story about the ongoing polls.\n\nThe same photos and similar claims have been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nThe tweet says: \u201cBelieve it or not, this cartoon sitting on bonnet of jeep is Jagannath Sarkar, BJP MP candidate from Ranaghat. Its easy to laugh but thats not the point. This shows 1. How much alien BJP is to Bengalis incl Hindu Bengalis, 2. Bengali-born BJP ppl are Dhimmis of Hindi imperialism.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe image in the misleading posts does show a campaign event for BJP candidate for Ranaghat Jagannath Sarkar.\n\nBut Sarkar is not the man seen dressed as Hanuman in the photo in the misleading posts.\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the photo was first posted here on Facebook by the BJP\u2019s West Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh on April 22 during a campaign event for Sarkar in the constituency of Ranaghat.\n\nThe caption alongside the pictures in the Bengali-language post translates to English as: \u201cRoad show with Jagannath Sarkar, candidate for Ranaghat seat. (Badkulla, Khamar, Simi, Chitroshali Bajar, Fulbari.) Common people are visibly enthusiastic for the BJP.\u201d\n\nThe original images can be seen in the Facebook post embedded below:\n\nSarkar is listed as the BJP candidate for Ranaghat constituency here on one of the party\u2019s official websites.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the website that shows his photo on the left next to the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi:\n\nBJP\u2019s West Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh posted another picture of the campaign event with Jagannath Sarkar here on Facebook on 22 April, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post, AFP has circled Jagannath Sarkar's face in red:\n\nJagannath Sarkar can also be seen in this photo of the same campaign event posted here on his official Twitter account on April 22, 2019.\n\nThe image shows him dressed in saffron and standing on left side of the frame.\n\nHis face is circled in red in the screenshot of the post below:\n\nThe Tweet's caption reads: \u201cState President Sri @DilipGhoshiBJP joined our rally from Badkulla to Bagula. Candidate for Assembly by-election of Krishnagunj also attended our campaign.\u201d\n\nThis composite image below shows candidate Sarkar from the BJP website (L), Sarkar during the parade (C) and the man dressed as the monkey god from the same parade (R):", "lang": "en"}
