The blog post was cited in a news release from the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel as a \"disturbing fact\" that \"undermine(s) her story.\"\n\n\"Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation,\" the release states, linking to YourNewsWire.com.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis theory that somehow Ford is linked to the Russia investigation through her brother\u2019s old job comes from the fact that in 2013, nine years after Blasey left BakerHostetler, the firm hired Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, to assist with a Russian money-laundering investigation.\n\nIn 2015, Fusion GPS subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer to produce the Russian dossier. Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated.\n\nIn a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford\u2019s lawyers said she had \"been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.\" They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford\u2019s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online.\n\nFord\u2019s brother, Ralph Blasey, worked for a law firm that worked with Fusion GPS nine years after he left the company. Fusion GPS\u2019s work on the Russian dossier began more than a decade after Blasey left BakerHostetler.\n\nWhile it\u2019s accurate to say Blasey worked for BakerHostetler \u2014 he says that clearly on his LinkedIn \u2014 it is ridiculously wrong to somehow link her brother\u2019s past employment to Fusion GPS\u2019s work in investigating Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
