No, that's not true: While WHO did say in a tweet, \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus\" in Wuhan, China, that post published on January 14, 2020, reflecting the earliest reports out of China - before much was known.\n\nSoon after, as understanding of the novel coronavirus grew, WHO warned -- and continues to warn -- that the virus is spread between people. In fact, even before WHO shared the preliminary results offered by Chinese authorities, the health organization tweeted behavioral tips telling people to avoid one another to prevent transmission of the infection.\n\nNone of this, however, has stopped some from promoting a conspiracy theory, pointing repeatedly to that January 14, 2020, tweet, while claiming that WHO is paid by China to spread misinformation.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) Facebook by Donald Trump Jr. on March 21, 2020. It opened:\n\nHere's how that post appeared on social media:\n\nTrump Jr. hasn't been alone in heaping accusations on WHO and pointing to this outdated tweet. For example, Breitbart, a far-right news outlet, posted a story on March 22, 2020, with the headline: \"WHO spread false Chinese government propaganda: Coronavirus not contagious among humans.\"\n\nTrump Jr. then tweeted out the Breitbart story, as seen here:\n\nThe day before WHO shared what the Chinese authorities were reporting, the global health organization tweeted tips on how to reduce the risk of infection. The tips included, \"Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.\"\n\nThis is how that post appeared on Twitter:\n\nWhat WHO tweeted on January 14, the next day, was a status update provided by Chinese authorities, which simply said evidence had not yet been found for human-to-human transmission (i.e. it didn't say that human transmission was an impossibility). In a short time, transmission between people became the obvious culprit for the pandemic's spread.\n\nCome January 19, WHO retweeted its January 13 advice about avoiding human contact with anyone who shows symptoms with these words of introduciton: \"WHO has provided advice to countries on how to identify people sick with the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV), how to care for them, and how to prevent spread.\"\n\nHere's how that message appeared in this social media:\n\nTo understand what might have fueled the tweet promoted by Trump Jr., Breitbart and others as evidence of a nefarious relationship between WHO and China, it may help to understand the timeline of information out of China.\n\nAccording to a March 13, 2020, report in the South China Morning Post, the first case of novel coronavirus may have been contracted in the Hubei province [where Wuhan is located] on November 17, 2020. This was based on government data seen by the Hong Kong newspaper.\n\nBut the paper also reported, in the same story, what WHO knew -- and when and how WHO knew it. \"According to the World Health Organisation's website, the first confirmed Covid-19 case in China was on December 8, but the global body does not track the disease itself but relies on nations to provide such information,\" the paper said. [The bold was inserted by Lead Stories for emphasis.]\n\nThe first death from novel coronavirus in China was reported on January 11, 2020, three days before the contested tweet. Also, as late as that date, the South China Morning Post reported that there were limited cases confirmed by authorities. Here's what the paper said:\n\nSo, while the world was first waking up to what was unfolding in China, WHO was scrambling to give guidance based on the information the organization had.\n\nBy January 23, 2020, the WHO situation report on novel coronavirus highlighted growing evidence of human-to-human transmission. Here's what the report said:\n\nAnd now, as the world fights against this pandemic, the importance of \"social distancing\" is touted by WHO and heath officials across the globe:", "lang": "en"}
