The channel, founded by journalist Barkha Dutt, reported that the boy was wandering the streets of Delhi\u2019s R K Puram in search of food.\n\nWhat followed were a series of tweets claiming that the outlet revived an 8-month-old video of a cop thrashing a chain snatcher attacking women on the road with blades. BJP Delhi leader Kapil Mishra wrote \u201cfake news by Barkha gang\u201d while tweeting that the boy \u201cattacked the cops as well with blades.\u201d His tweet drew 8,500 retweets.\n\nRaj Shekhar Jha, journalist with The Times of India, tweeted claims similar to Mishra\u2019s adding that the Delhi police has clarified that the boy had attacked cops before the video was shot.\n\nIncident took place on the intervening night of August 22-23: Police\n\nResponding to a Twitter user who had shared the video, DCP Delhi (South West) said policemen patrolling near Ekta Vihar JJ camp saw a group of 4-5 boys \u201csitting/ loitering\u201d around a public toilet. \u201cSince they were briefed about repeated concerns raised by women of nearby JJ camps, who had been using this public toilet especially at night, [they] were asked to leave the place immediately,\u201d reads the tweet adding that the boys were \u201cchased away\u201d when the cops spotted them during the second round of patrolling at 3 am.\n\n\u201cAn enquiry has been ordered into the conduct of constable as shown in the video,\u201d concludes the tweet.\n\nAccording to a report in The Indian Express, \u201cAn initial investigation revealed that lower staff in the R K Puram Police Station failed to brief their seniors with all the facts and tried to mislead them by saying it was an old video.\u201d\n\nPTI subsequently quoted police officials stating that the cop was suspended. \u201cSoon after the matter came into their notice, we immediately suspended the constable and have also initiated an inquiry into the matter,\u201d said police official Devender Arya per the report.\n\nThe boy who was beaten up was reportedly a minor. A video of the same was tweeted by Mojo Story but social media users including BJP leader Kapil Mishra and The Times of India journalist Raj Shekhar Jha rushed to the police\u2019s defence. They justified the brutality by claiming that the boy who was beaten up was a chain snatcher armed with blades.\n\nIn 2017, a false report published in The Times of India authored by Raj Shekhar Jha claimed that missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed had joined terror outfit ISIS.\n\nBarkha Dutt targetted for a report that turned out to be true\n\nThe video was massively viral on Facebook before it was tweeted by Mojo Story on August 24. Varun Sharma, who identifies himself as a Delhi-based journalist, had shared the clip on his profile drawing 63,000 shares. This was on August 23 at around 11 pm.\n\nThe video was earlier tweeted by ANI journalist Manish Gupta at 2:02 am on August 23. Gupta later deleted the video and also changed his username to @ANI_ManishG.\n\nHowever, the clip gained prominence only after Mojo Story\u2019s tweet which attracted flak from several people targeting Barkha Dutt for carrying \u2018fake news\u2019 on her channel. Among them were Rajesh Singh, Keh Ke Pehno and @Being_Humor.", "lang": "en"}
