Socialism,\" Scarborough said on the April 7, 2009, Morning Joe . \"And I'm not being negative toward the president. This is the truth though. Think about this. We've got a president who has never received a paycheck ... he's never received a check from a profitmaking business in his entire life, not one check. Think about it.\"\n\nAnother guest, New York Times reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, thought about it for a split second and pointed out that Obama had received plenty of checks from the publisher of his two books.\n\n\"Is that all you've got?\" Scarborough replied. \"Think about the radicalism of that.\"\n\nNo. That's not all.\n\nIt's true that Obama's most well-known jobs, as a community organizer and politician, have been for governments or nonprofit organizations.\n\nBut Obama has worked for plenty of private companies, from Baskin-Robbins to Business International Corporation. He worked at law firms. He was a telemarketer. He worked construction. He sold island trinkets in Hawaii.\n\nIn his diatribe, Scarborough remarked that \"if you're going to run the most complex financial sectors in the world, I hope that you have at least received a paycheck for working at a burger stand.\"\n\nWe're not sure whether the deli at which Obama worked as a young man in Hawaii sold burgers, but it's entirely possible.\n\nBelow, compiled from and cross-checked among a host of sources, is what we believe to be the most thorough account of the president's work history. (Several details from his early years are unknown, and will remain so for now; the White House did not respond to our request to verify the accuracy of our list and fill in the blanks.)\n\n1975 or 1976 \u2014 ice cream scooper, Baskin-Robbins \u2014 Honolulu \u2014 Obama claims to have lost his taste for ice cream during this, his first job, the duration of which is not publicly known.\n\nDate unknown \u2014 deli counter clerk, business name unknown \u2014 Honolulu \u2014 Obama had a summer job at a deli counter in Hawaii, making sandwiches, his spokesman said during the presidential campaign.\n\n1980 \u2014 gift shop sales clerk, business name unknown \u2014 Honolulu \u2014 Obama worked at a gift shop in Hawaii selling island souvenirs the summer after his freshman year at Occidental College in California.\n\nSometime between 1981-1983 \u2014 construction worker, business name unknown \u2014 New York \u2014 Obama cleared a construction site for a summer on Manhattan's Upper West Side while attending Columbia University, the Associated Press reported.

He runs the executive branch and serves as commander in chief of the armed forces.\n\nThere you have it. By our count, Obama earned paychecks from 11 for-profit businesses, compared to just six nonprofit or government employers. We understand the point that the most well-known part of Obama's work history is in positions outside the private sector, but Scarborough was absolute in his declaration. \"Not one check,\" from a for-profit enterprise, he said. We like Joe. He's hosted segments on PolitiFact. But this claim is False.", "lang": "en"}
