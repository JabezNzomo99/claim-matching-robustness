Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a family died due to novel Coronavirus. Fact: The video was found on the internet at least since the last week of December 2019. But the first death from the novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. It can be found that the same video was uploaded on YouTube in December 2019. Also, a user has tweeted the same video on 1 January 2020, with a claim different from the post.\n\nWhile the exact context of the video cannot be ascertained, it is definitely not related to the novel Coronavirus outbreak; because the first death from novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020.\n\nTo sum it up, an old unrelated video falsely shared as \u2018family died due to infection from the novel Coronavirus\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
