Here are a few of the regulations he has attempted to undo:\n\nIn August 2017, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released a report on states\u2019 GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017. Across the country, mining grew 21.6 percent, spurring growth in 48 of the 50 states. The BEA notes that the growth in mining was the leading contributor to growth in the three fastest-growing states \u2014 Texas, West Virginia, and New Mexico, which grew 3.9 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.7 percent, respectively.\n\nFor starters, the first quarter ended on March 31, 2017, just two months after Trump took office. And even though he wasted no time rolling back Obama-era protections, many of his newly loosened regulations on mining and coal haven\u2019t gone into effect. The comment period on the administration\u2019s proposal to open fracking on public lands closed Sept. 25, and the BLM now has to review the 459 public comments on the proposal as it drafts the final rule. Once the final rule is published in the register, it typically goes into effect within 30 days of publication.\n\nLikewise, the administration\u2019s repeal of the Clean Power Plan has yet to take effect. Pruitt claimed in October that he was ending the \u201cwar on coal,\u201d by rescinding the Clean Power Plan, but the agency\u2019s proposal is up for public comment until December. More importantly, the regulations proposed by the Obama administration have been on pause since February 2016, when the Supreme Court voted to stay the plan while it considers whether the administration exceeded its authority to regulate air pollution under the Clean Air Act.\n\nWhen Trump signed the law repealing the \u201cstream protection rule,\u201d the provision had been in effect only since Jan. 19, 2017 \u2014 a mere 28 days. In a January 2017 impact analysis of the Obama-era rule, the Congressional Research Service estimated it would take up to 42 months for states to implement the federal rules. Repealing a law that wasn\u2019t widely implemented would do little in the short term to increase growth in the industry.\n\nWest Virginia is the second-largest coal producer in the country, and in 2016 it accounted for 11 percent of the total coal production in the United States. The state is also the ninth-largest producer of natural gas in the country, with an estimated 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas extracted in 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration. While most of the economic growth in West Virginia is due to growth in these two industries, the boost can be attributed to rising productivity and prices.\n\nAccording to the BEA, in West Virginia, mining grew 26.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, and \u201cdata from EIA shows gains in the extraction of coal, natural gas, and petroleum bolstered mining in the state.\u201d The primary driver of the state\u2019s increased coal production is a surge in Asia-Pacific metallurgical coal demand as well as a temporary boost in demand from Australia after Cyclone Debbie damaged the country\u2019s rail infrastructure, according to a report on the state\u2019s economic outlook by West Virginia University.\n\nThe increase in extraction coincided with an increase in the price of metallurgical coal and natural gas. In the first quarter of 2017, the price of metallurgical coal exports was $153 per short ton, up from $76 in the third quarter of 2016. For the first nine months of 2017, the price of natural gas was $3 per million British thermal units on average, up from a 2016 average of just under $2.50 per million BTUs.\n\nAdditionally, the coal industry still has a way to go to recover from its losses. In 2008, the state produced nearly 158 million short tons of coal, and by 2016, that number had plummeted to 80 million, according to a report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research.\n\nTrump takes credit for West Virginia\u2019s economic gains, but it\u2019s undeserved. For one, when the first quarter ended on March 31, 2017, Trump was just two months into his presidency. While he was quick to do away with several regulations on energy production, many of the new policies have yet to take effect. The state\u2019s recent growth is due to increased mining production and a rise in prices for coal and natural gas.", "lang": "en"}
