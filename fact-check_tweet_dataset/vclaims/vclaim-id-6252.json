The story opened:\n\nTennessee, USA.-- A man was arrested for selling his own farts in jars, without even having a vending license. The man was caught by the authorities, which asked him if he had permission, and the man couldn't answer. \"He was selling farts from different foods, and with different ages. With around 150 jars, he was selling farts as old as one week\", said the police man Gary Cockburn. Every jar had around 30% fart and 70% air, although he didn't clarify that to his buyers. \"The man didn't have permission to sell those farts, so we seized them\", Cockburn stated.\n\nNone of it is true. The picture used to illustrate the article is actually Paul Pixley, a school bus driver who allegedly fell asleep at the wheel in 2016. There are several versions of this hoax floating around online but this one suddenly went viral again recently. (The image is somewhat reminiscent of the ones used at fake/satire site World News Daily Report which also uses a random mugshot found online in combination with an abstract background with almost all of its stories.)\n\nFurthermore, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nIt contains cutting edge satire on a diverse range of topics. The website publishes fake news, shocking rumors and reports with incisive sarcasm, and humor. We also post crazy real news which often sounds too good to be true.\n\nIn this case it must have been \"cutting edge satire\" since it definitely wasn't \"crazy real news\".", "lang": "en"}
