A spokesperson for the company refuted the claim.\n\nIn recent days, Wayfair has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that alleges the company engages in human trafficking, citing the seemingly high prices of utility cabinets, according to BBC News. The baseless theory, which appears to have originated on Reddit, has been widely debunked by fact-checkers, and the company has refuted it.\n\nDespite the human trafficking theory being debunked, it has sparked a number of related claims about Wayfair on social media. This particular Facebook post claims Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah has resigned over the allegations.\n\n\u201cBreaking: Wayfair CEO to \u2018step down\u2019 amid allegations the company is involved in child trafficking,\u201d reads the post.\n\nBut Shah has not stepped down from his position as the company\u2019s chief executive officer. Had he done so, it would likely be covered by major media outlets given how much attention Wayfair has received recently, yet the Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting about it.\n\nShah is also still listed as CEO on the company\u2019s website along with other executive leaders, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.
