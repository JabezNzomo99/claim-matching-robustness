The food waste claim also seems to be based on data from 2006 and we\u2019ve asked Labour for more details on Mr Corbyn\u2019s sources.\n\nData from the European Commission shows the UK\u2019s recycling rate is around average among the 28 EU member states with 44% of waste being recycled in 2017.\n\nFood waste data is hard to compare, because countries collect data using different methodologies, and, for some countries, data is not available.\n\nThe latest data from the EU that we\u2019ve seen dates to 2006. In 2006 the UK produced the most food waste in total compared to any other EU country.\n\nBut as the UK also has one of the largest populations in the EU this is perhaps unsurprising. A better measure is to look at how much food waste is recycled per person. Looked at this way the UK has the sixth-highest level of food waste.", "lang": "en"}
