We need to restore the norms and traditions of the Senate and get past this partisan filibuster.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery excuse (Senate Democrats) have come up with to engage in this unprecedented filibuster is completely without merit,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said Wednesday on the Senate floor.\n\nBut the filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee \u2014 although very rare \u2014 isn\u2019t entirely unprecedented, according to legal scholars and congressional records. Democrats\u2019 short-lived filibuster of Gorsuch on Thursday \u2014 Senate Republicans almost immediately opted for a \u201cnuclear option\u201d to change Senate rules and end the filibuster \u2014 was not the first Senate filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe only commonly recognized filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee on record occurred in 1968, when the Senate filibustered Abe Fortas, then-President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s pick for chief justice, legal scholars told CBS News.\n\n\u201cAlthough there has not been a formal filibuster of a Supreme Court justice before, Republican Senator Strom Thurmond essentially did this in 1968 to block Justice Abe Fortas\u2019s confirmation as Chief Justice,\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California\u2019s Irvine School of Law, told CBS News.\n\nFortas\u2019 situation did differ some from Gorsuch\u2019s. Fortas was already on the Supreme Court as an associate justice. Also unlike Gorsuch, opposition to Fortas was based on ethical grounds \u2014 he didn\u2019t disclose $15,000 he received in speaking fees from a university. Differing from Gorsuch, in Fortas\u2019 case, Republicans and Democrats alike pushed the filibuster.\n\nThat may be why some Republicans began calling a Gorsuch filibuster an unprecedented partisan filibuster, instead of an unprecedented filibuster.\n\nThe Fortas filibuster worked, as his supporters were unable to obtain enough votes to end it, and Johnson was ultimately pressured to withdraw the nomination.\n\nThe Senate has invoked cloture \u2014 an attempt to end debate on a nominee \u2014 four times in history, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. In addition to the attempt with Fortas, the Senate invoked cloture during the nomination of former Justice William R. Rehnquist twice \u2014 once in 1971 and once in 1986 \u2014 and during the nomination of Justice Samuel Alito in 2006. The latter two attempts were successful. In 1971, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on Rehnquist but went on to approve him as associate justice anyway. Technically, some scholars say, those were also filibusters, although they aren\u2019t typically considered as such.\n\nSenate Republicans attempted to invoke cloture with Gorsuch Thursday and failed, so they pursued a change in Senate rules, or \u201cnuclear option,\u201d through which McConnell was able to end debate on Gorsuch and pave the way for Republicans to require only 51 votes instead of 60 to approve Gorsuch.\n\nKent Greenfield, law professor at Boston College Law School, said the Senate\u2019s use of such a \u201cnuclear\u201d option to change the Senate rules and push a Supreme Court pick towards nomination is what\u2019s unprecedented.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time,\u201d Greenfield told CBS News.\n\nChemerinsky also dubbed the elimination of filibustering for Supreme Court picks \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cnuclear option\u201d is built upon Obama-era precedent. Democrats in 2013 used a simple majority to push through a number of Obama appointees, giving McConnell precedent to end debate on Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cIn terms of prior precedent, the most relevant would be that the Senate, Democrats ended the filibuster for lower federal court nominees and other executive branch nominees in 2013,\u201d Paul Collins, Jr., professor and director of legal studies for the department of political science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told CBS News.\n\nRepublicans have a point in claiming a simple majority vote is a return to how the Senate used to run.\n\nGenerally and historically, the Senate has voted on Supreme Court picks with an up-or-down, simple-majority vote, but the \u201cmajor exception\u201d to that was the Republican-led Senate\u2019s refusal to hold a vote on Merrick Garland last year, Chemerinsky said.\n\nThe Senate is expected to take up a vote and approve Gorsuch with a simple majority Friday.", "lang": "en"}
