John Linder (R-Ga.) and 9th Congressional District candidate Tom Graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the FairTax, particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event in Missouri in June 2009.\n\n\n\nNot exactly.\n\n\n\nGraves has been telling supporters and voters about his efforts to work with Linder on the FairTax.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve traveled the country advocating for the FairTax, along with Herman Cain, Neal Boortz and John Linder,\" Graves, a former state representative, said at an April 23 candidate debate at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville.\n\n\n\nLinder, who represents Georgia's 7th Congressional District and is retiring at the end of this term, says that's an exaggeration. The congressman took the unusual step of accusing Graves, a fellow Republican, of lying about his efforts to push the idea. Linder even said he \"didn't know who [Graves] was or why he was there.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tom Graves is telling you that he has traveled the nation with John Linder to sell the FairTax. That simply is not true,\" Linder said in a 30-second robocall on May 27 for Graves\u2019 opponent, Lee Hawkins.\n\n\n\nThe congressman added: \"If a candidate is willing to lie to you to get elected, what will you expect from him after he is elected?\"\n\n\n\nThe Graves campaign said it is surprised by Linder\u2019s remarks and baffled by Linder's seeming unfamiliarity with the candidate.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s kind of bizarre for the congressman to say he didn\u2019t know what he [Graves] was doing there,\" said Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker, who added the two men traveled together to the event.\n\n\n\nWe decided to check out how involved Graves has been with Linder to sell the FairTax.\n\n\n\nFirst, what is the FairTax? It would abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes and other taxes, and replace them with a federal retail sales tax, according to the Web site FairTax.org. It essentially is a consumption tax -- the more you buy, the more tax you pay.\n\n\n\nThe FairTax is an important cause to Linder. He\u2019s been advocating the idea for more than a decade and co-wrote a book with Boortz explaining its benefits. \n\n\n\nJennifer Drogus, Linder's communications director, said her boss appreciates Graves' support for the FairTax. But Linder felt like Graves exaggerated his role in the effort.\n\n\n\nWe asked Graves campaign officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a bit by saying he \"traveled the country\" in support of the idea.\n\n\n\n\"The record speaks for itself,\" said Baker, the campaign manager. \"If you look at the fact, he was there.\"\n\n\n\nWhen asked whether they made other trips to talk about the FairTax, the Graves campaign focused on that Missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct. Yes, they made a trip halfway across the country. But we think one trip to Missouri does not equate to \"traveled the country.\"\n\n\n\nWe find Tom Graves\u2019 claim is Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
