It may be a version of a statement written about him by Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud.\n\nAn artist, scientist and inventor, da Vinci was one of the most celebrated figures of the Italian Renaissance period. His best known paintings include the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the \u201cLast Supper\u201d and \u201cLady with an Ermine.\u201d\n\nThough da Vinci took thousands of pages of notes over the course of his career, there is no reason to believe he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his writings.\n\n\u201cAbout 80% of the Leo \u2018quotes\u2019 on the internet are not by him. This is not amongst the 20%,\u201d Trinity College art historian and da Vinci expert Martin Kemp told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe quote appears to be a version of a comment made about da Vinci in Freud\u2019s 1910 essay \u201cLeonardo da Vinci: A Memory of His Childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Merezhkovsky\u2019s admirable simile, he was like a man who had awoken too early in the darkness, while everyone else was still asleep,\u201d Freud wrote, crediting Russian author Dmitry Merezhkovsky with the imagery.", "lang": "en"}
