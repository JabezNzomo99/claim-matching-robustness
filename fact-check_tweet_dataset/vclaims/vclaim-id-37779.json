The fact is, it\u2019s unclear what Zelensky was referring to when he thanked Trump \u201cfor your great support in the area of defense.\u201d\n\u2022 Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries claimed that Zelensky\u2019s reference to defense \u201cincludes the security assistance passed by this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that Donald Trump held up in violation of the law.\u201d\n\u2022 Deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura claimed that Zelensky was only referring to Ukraine purchasing Javelin missiles from the U.S. because he talked about that \u201cin the very next sentence.\u201d\n\nPurpura further argued that \u201cHouse Democrats claim that the Javelin sales discussed in the July 25 call are part of the paused security assistance,\u201d saying that was \u201cmisleading.\u201d But Purpura is the one being misleading. Jeffries didn\u2019t equate the Javelins with the security assistance hold.\n\nOverall, Purpura said, \u201cthe transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything.\u201d But there is additional evidence, beyond the memo of that phone call, that suggests the administration tied a White House meeting for Zelensky and the security aid for Ukraine to Trump\u2019s request for investigations.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we know about Zelensky\u2019s comments from the White House memo on the July 25 phone call. That memo includes a \u201ccaution\u201d note saying it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript,\u201d but rather the \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of staff assigned to listen in and \u201cmemorialize the conversation.\u201d So we don\u2019t know exactly what Zelensky said.\n\nBut Jeffries and Purpura offer their interpretations of what we do know from the White House memo.\n\nAccording to that document, Trump commented: \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.\u201d After mentioning Germany, Trump adds: \u201cA lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it\u2019s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Zelensky says next:\n\nZelensky, per White House memo: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I\u2019m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\n\nTrump then says, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d He asks Zelensky to \u201cfind out what happened\u201d with CrowdStrike and the Democratic National Committee server. (We have written about Trump\u2019s reference to this conspiracy theory before.) Trump later asks Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. (As we\u2019ve written, Trump has distorted the facts on that issue, too.)\n\nWhat \u2018Great Support\u2019 Was Zelensky Talking About?\n\nOn Jan. 22, Jeffries, one of the House managers who presented the Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment of Trump, said during the Senate trial:\n\nThe United States\u2019 support for Ukraine in the \u201carea of defense\u201d would include the security assistance, but it\u2019s not clear from the White House memo on the July call whether that\u2019s what Zelensky meant. Congress had appropriated $391 million in security assistance for fiscal year 2019 \u2014 and Trump had ordered that aid to be frozen in mid-July.\n\nPurpura, on Jan. 25, argued that Zelensky was only talking about buying Javelins from the U.S., because he mentioned that in the next sentence. But that\u2019s not clear from the memo, either.\n\n\u201cThe paused security assistance funds aren\u2019t even mentioned on the call,\u201d Purpura said during the White House lawyers\u2019 opening statements in the Senate trial. He went on to say:\n\nIt\u2019s possible Zelensky had been referring to broad support from the U.S., as well as \u201cspecifically\u201d the purchase of the Javelins. Or perhaps Purpura\u2019s interpretation is correct. We simply don\u2019t know. We reached out to both Jeffries\u2019 office and the White House press office to ask whether there was any additional evidence to bolster their interpretations. We haven\u2019t received a response from either.\n\nPurpura went on to say: \u201cWhen the House Democrats claim that the Javelin sales discussed in the July 25 call are part of the paused security assistance, it is misleading. They are trying to confuse you and just sort of wrap everything in, instead of unpacking it the right way.\u201d But that\u2019s not what Jeffries claimed.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say the Javelin sales were part of the security assistance; he said Zelensky\u2019s reference to \u201csupport in the area of defense\u201d included the security assistance.\n\nThe State Department first approved the potential sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine on March 1, 2018, and approved a second sale on Oct. 3. The approvals included other equipment and were valued at $47 million and $39.2 million.\n\nThe frozen security aid, meanwhile, included $250 million Congress had appropriated for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through the Defense Department for fiscal year 2019 and $141.5 million for the Foreign Military Financing program through the State Department. The latter amount included money for various equipment and training, including sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a breakdown by Defense News published on Sept. 12, the day the State Department announced the aid had been released.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, acknowledged that the security assistance that was held up by Trump wasn\u2019t the same as the Javelin purchase. Schiff said in questioning Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the White House\u2019s National Security Council, during an Oct. 29 deposition: \u201cIn that [July 25] call, the foreign military financing, the two aid packages, were not explicitly brought up, but the Ukraine president did bring up a form of military support, that is the Javelins, right?\u201d\n\nVindman responded: \u201cThe Ukrainian president did bring that up, correct.\u201d\n\nOther Evidence Linking the Hold to Investigations\n\nPurpura\u2019s larger point was that \u201cthe transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything.\u201d But as we\u2019ve written before, focusing solely on the July 25 phone call ignores other evidence from the impeachment inquiry suggesting that the White House tied an announcement by Ukraine of investigations into Democrats to a White House meeting for Zelensky and the security aid.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified on Nov. 20 that \u201cyes\u201d there was a quid pro quo linking such an announcement to a White House call and White house meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, \u201cexpressing the desires of the president of the United States,\u201d Sondland said, \u201cdemanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma,\u201d the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served.\n\nSondland further said that \u201cin the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\u201d On Sept. 1, Sondland told Andrey Yermak, a close aide to Zelensky, that \u201cresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.\u201d That statement would include an announcement of investigations into Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, according to text messages provided to Congress.\n\nSondland also testified that he mentioned his concerns that the aid was linked to an announcement of investigations to Vice President Pence before Sept. 1 meetings with Ukrainian officials. Pence nodded, in a \u201csort of duly noted\u201d way, Sondland said. Pence\u2019s chief of staff denied Sondland\u2019s account.\n\nTwo officials at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine testified to Congress that they, too, came to believe the security aid hold was linked to investigations.\n\nWilliam Taylor, then the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told congressional investigators about a Sept. 1 phone call with Sondland, during which \u201cSondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\u201d Taylor said in his prepared statement. \u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d\n\nDavid Holmes, a political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, also testified that \u201cwith no explanation\u201d given for the freeze on the security aid, the logical conclusion was that it was tied to the investigations. He said he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if the Ukrainians \u201cwouldn\u2019t have drawn that conclusion\u201d as well.\n\nMark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security at the Office of Management and Budget, testified at his Nov. 16 deposition that he signed a document officially placing the first hold on the security aid on July 25 \u2014 the same day as the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nSondland also testified that in a Sept. 9 phone call, he asked Trump what he wanted from Ukraine, and the president responded, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u201d But Sondland declined to say whether he believed Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not going to characterize whether I believed or didn\u2019t believe. I was just trying to convey what he said on the phone,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nThere were two other occurrences on Sept. 9: The inspector general of the intelligence community notified the House intelligence committee about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, and three House committees announced an investigation into whether Trump and Giuliani tried to pressure Ukraine into conducting \u201cpolitically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d\n\nThe day after Purpura made his opening statement in the Senate trial, the New York Times reported more information linking the hold on aid to investigations. Citing people who had read drafts of a book manuscript by John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, the Times said that Trump told Bolton he wanted to freeze the aid to Ukraine until it agreed to investigating the Democrats, including Biden. Trump has denied the claim.", "lang": "en"}
