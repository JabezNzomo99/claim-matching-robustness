Military spending has decreased in recent years.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump prepared on Friday to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill, just hours after threatening to veto it, he offered a few misleading and selectively worded claims to explain why he was reluctantly authorizing the legislation. \u201cWe looked at the veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cBut because of the incredible gains that we\u2019ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our \u2014 any of our thinking.\u201d But his explanation did not accurately describe just why those gains were enough to ultimately approve the spending bill. Nor did it correctly demonstrate why the legislation did not include programs that he had prioritized. Here\u2019s a fact-check.\n\nMore important, military pay increases are, by law, tied to the employment cost index, which measures private-sector wages \u2014 although the president or Congress can ask for more or less. The Pentagon requested, and Congress enacted, pay increases smaller than the index\u2019s growth rate from 2014 through 2016. But both before and after that time \u2014 from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 \u2014 pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent \u2014 rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress. \u201cFor the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what\u2019s taken out, they\u2019ve hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.\u201d Mr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011. Adjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in the 2010 fiscal year from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year. War-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. \u201cI can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.\u201d In September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work. It is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats \u201cfought\u201d efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all. Democrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a \u201cclean DACA bill.\u201d At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.", "lang": "en"}
