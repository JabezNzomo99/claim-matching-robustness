(Translation: A bitch died a dog\u2019s death and all of her litter is crying in the same voice)\u201d\n\nA journalist Jagrati Shukla wrote, \u201cSo, Commy Gauri Lankesh has been murdered mercilessly. Your deeds always come back to haunt you, they say. Amen.\u201d Jagrati Shukla has a history of hateful tweets against Dalits, Sikhs and other sections of the society.\n\nAnother senior journalist who is the editor-in-chief of Vishwavani Daily and former OSD to BJP MP Ananth Kumar couldn\u2019t resist labelling her as a Naxal Sympathiser while announcing her death.\n\nRita who claims to be a former presenter on All India Radio and is followed by PM Modi on Twitter gave not one but multiple labels. Apparently, that was the most important thing to do in this hour of grief.\n\nOxomiya Jiyori which is yet another account followed by PM Modi on Twitter said \u201cGod had different plan for group of Bharat tere tukde Honge\u201d while commenting on Gauri Lankesh\u2019s pictures with JNU students Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid. Those masked men who actually raised those slogans in JNU have never been arrested but the propaganda is being used to malign and justify Gauri Lankesh\u2019s murder.\n\nThe list is endless as who all among the right-wing thought that the horrifying murder of a person is the right time to spew all the venom they had against them because of ideological differences. There are many more on Facebook and Twitter who said things that are so hateful that it cannot be reproduced here. Is this the same hateful ideology that consumed Gauri Lankesh?", "lang": "en"}
