Then, she unveiled a funding plan, and the flames got even hotter.\n\nSet aside the dismissals from Republicans. Her Democratic presidential primary foes offered plenty of their own.\n\nBernie Sanders, the original author of the legislation, said her plan would \"have a very negative impact on creating jobs.\"\n\nJoe Biden said \"she\u2019s making it up.\" Pete Buttigieg talked about Warren\u2019s \"aggressive math,\" and that \"we don't need to spend tens of trillions of dollars in order to address this problem.\"\n\nWarren laid down a challenge to others to be as forthcoming as she has been.\n\n\"We are the only Democratic primary campaign that has laid out the true, full costs of any health care plan, Medicare for All or otherwise,\" she said Nov.1. \"I look forward to others doing the same.\"\n\nWarren said she would provide comprehensive health coverage to everyone in the United States, with essentially zero premiums, deductibles or other personal costs, and the additional price tag for the federal government would be $20.5 trillion over 10 years. That\u2019s about $14 trillion less than the most recent estimate by analysts at the Urban Institute, a left-of-center policy center in Washington\n\nShe gets there through a mix of spending cuts and taxes.\n\nEverything in Warren\u2019s plan is a prediction, and neither she nor her critics nor fact-checkers can say with certainty what the future holds. So we looked at five of the big dollar assumptions in her plan, and what might cause them to fall short.\n\nAssumption No. 1: She will save $2.3 trillion by changing how doctors and hospitals are paid\n\nThe concern: One of her key methods might not pan out.\n\nA central belief in Warren\u2019s plan is that Medicare for All will drive down what we pay for health care, including providers. One of the mechanisms to do that is through paying them differently than today.\n\nWarren counts on cutting costs by $2.3 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe key benchmark for Warren is the Urban Institute cost estimate study. The institute\u2019s computer model painted a tougher fiscal nut for Medicare for All to crack than Warren lays out.\n\nThe single biggest chunk of those payment reform savings comes through something called \"bundled payments.\" That\u2019s when hospitals are guaranteed a set amount for the full course of treating a patient, rather than getting paid for each separate service they provide.\n\nWarren\u2019s panel of experts cite studies that support their forecast that this would cut $1.2 trillion.\n\nBut it could turn out that bundled payments don\u2019t work as well as hoped. Medicare has tested the approach.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based health policy group, reported in 2018 that \"no significant difference was found between the hospitals participating in Medicare\u2019s bundled payment program and the control hospitals.\"\n\nAssumption No. 2: She will save $1.8 trillion in administrative costs\n\nThe concern: Spending less on oversight can cost, not save.\n\nThe rule of thumb in private insurance is administrative overhead eats up about 12% of the premiums they are paid.\n\nTraditional Medicare\u2019s administrative costs \u2014 direct payments to hospitals and doctors \u2014 are about 2.3%. Warren uses that percentage for her Medicare for All program.\n\nIn contrast, the Urban Institute set overhead at 6%, still half of what happens in the private sector but it makes for a $1.8 trillion difference between its estimate and Warren\u2019s.\n\nThe Urban Institute said 6% would be essential to reduce fraud and abuse, and to make sure that everyone was getting quality care.\n\nWaste in health care is a huge problem. In 2010, the National Academy of Medicine estimated that nearly 19% of health spending is wasted, mainly through providing care that wasn\u2019t medically needed, but also through inefficiency and fraud.\n\nThe concern is that the less spent on oversight, the more waste that gets through.\n\nA study that argues in favor of Medicare for All, and one that Warren\u2019s experts cite, casts a dark picture of the challenge of rooting this out.\n\nA 2018 study from the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, first the first five years, even with all the changes in Medicare for All, it probably would be \"difficult to achieve significant savings through waste reduction.\"\n\nSo, it\u2019s possible that Medicare for All could spend less on administration, but that could make it harder to achieve savings in overall health care spending.\n\nAssumption No. 3: She can save $1.7 trillion in prescription drug costs\n\nThe concern: This hinges on making drugs cheaper than in any of our peer nations.\n\nWarren has ambitious goals for cutting the nation\u2019s prescription drug bill. She aims to pay 70% less than current Medicare rates on brand name drugs and 30% less for generic drugs. She\u2019d do that \"principally through price negotiation,\" backed up by a couple of other measures to get less expensive generic drugs to market.\n\nTo get an idea of how ambitious that is, the Political Economy Research Institute, looking only at the power of negotiating with drug makers, said \"Medicare for All program will be able to reduce pharmaceutical prices in the United States by an average of 40%.\" (That figure reflects that brand name sales dominate the drug market.)\n\nThe study called that a lower end estimate, but it suggests the challenge of reaching Warren\u2019s target.\n\nAnother analysis found that if Americans paid what Canadians do for drugs, they\u2019d save about 30%. If they paid what the Danes pay, they\u2019d save 65%.\n\nAssumption No. 4: She will gain $2.3 trillion from stronger IRS enforcement\n\nThe concern: A lot of pieces would need to fall in place.\n\nThe IRS knows it doesn\u2019t get all the money the law requires. People have all sorts of ways to shave down what they report. The IRS estimates that it collects about 15-18% less than what its owed.\n\nWarren says that beefing up IRS enforcement could knock the uncollected fraction down to 10%. That would add up to $2.3 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe job could be a heavy lift.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center notes that \"almost 60% of the underreported individual income tax is owed on business and self-employment income, which the IRS has no easy way to verify independently.\"\n\nAssumption No. 5: Medicare for All rolls out fully on Day One\n\nThe concern: No one buys this premise.\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about here isn\u2019t so much an assumption as it is a convenient way for talking about the numbers. But if nothing else illustrates why all these estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, this is it.\n\nAll of the savings, and all of the revenues, are calculated as if every policy were in force Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nWarren\u2019s experts are blunt with this major caveat: \"While it is of course the case that any shift to Medicare for All would require a significant transition period, because Urban estimates the costs of a single-payer proposal as if it were fully implemented and at steady-state starting in 2020, we use the same approach in our analysis for ease of comparison.\"\n\nThe Medicare for All bill itself has a four-year transition period. But given that no other current study can match the computer modeling behind the Urban Institute estimate, Warren\u2019s team followed suit.\n\nJohn Holahan, a key architect of the Urban Institute\u2019s study, said their goal was to compare a variety of health care reform plans, not give a road map of how they would unfold.\n\nAs a result, the timing of the all the dollars is off. Some costs tied to enrollment would be lower than expected at the start.", "lang": "en"}
