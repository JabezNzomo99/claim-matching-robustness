The quote attributed to Mr Conte was not reported by any credible media. It is also not corroborated by an official account of Mr Conte.\n\nViral social media posts claim an overwhelmed Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has broken down and has called on God to intervene in the coronavirus fight. The Prime Minister is reported to have said they have \u201cexhausted\u201d all solutions and can only hope in God \u201crescue your people.\u201d\n\nIn the posts, a grey-haired man is seen behind a microphone with tears streaking down his face.\n\nThe photo is accompanied by the texts: \u201cItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte: \u201cWe have lost control, Can\u2019t understand what more we can do, all solutions are exhausted on ground. Our only hope remains up in the Sky, God rescue your people. Pray for Italy and the Whole world.\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared several times on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nSo far, Italy has been the hardest hit by the Covid-19. It has recorded more Covid-19 deaths, 10,023, than even China, 3,304, where the pandemic started. The country currently has the second-highest number of confirmed cases, 92,472. It comes next to the United States of America which has 124,686 cases. \n\n\n\nAs some social media users rightly noted, the man in the photo is not the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte. It is the rather the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nA Google Reverse Image search led us to PODER 360 site. The website carries the viral picture and captions it \u201cBolsonaro cried during an evangelical service in a hall at the Planalto Palace.\u201d\n\nThe photo was taken at a thanksgiving service in December 2019 and is unrelated to coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the story on the PODER 360 site (translated into English), President Bolsonaro had broken down at the thanksgiving service after remembering a knife attack he had suffered during the 2018 Brazilian elections.\n\nThe occasion was also captured in a youtube video.\n\nDid the Italian President ever make the comment?\n\nThe quote cannot be found on any credible website or from any official source.\n\nOur independent search of the comment attributed to the Prime Minister did not find the quote anywhere.\n\nConsidering the newsworthiness of the said quote, one would expect it to be reported by the international media and other reputable source. However, none of them did.\n\nAdditionally, no such comment was found on any platform belonging to the Prime Minister. In fact, in various posts on his official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, Mr Conte\u2019s response to the Covid-19 has been to pledge his full commitment and to rally all to support the fight against coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
