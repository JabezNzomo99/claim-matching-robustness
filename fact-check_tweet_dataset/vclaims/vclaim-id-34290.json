An attempt has been made to project Ramdev as a womanizer. The photo has been shared by a few users on Twitter. Alt News found a screenshot of this tweet posted on Facebook by a user.\n\nThe social media claim surrounding the picture is false. The narrative was debunked by Baba Ramdev himself, on social media. In fact, this image has been circulating for several years now. Ramdev had issued a clarification almost five years back, on November 26, 2014. In a tweet, he had said, \u201cI am ashamed and sad to know that people are not leaving even a cancer patient, to spread maligning messages.\u201d\n\nAccording to the infographic tweeted by Ramdev, the woman seen in the picture is Priti, a cancer patient who was undergoing treatment at Vedanta hospital, where Ramdev had paid her a visit. The same was posted on Facebook on the official page of Baba Ramdev, on November 26, 2014.\n\nA photograph of Baba Ramdev with a female cancer patient, has been shared on social media for several years with a false claim, maligning the yoga guru.", "lang": "en"}
