Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggests Democrats are open to GOP ideas for fixing the health-care law. Is that so?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T16:29:40Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85967", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/26/schumers-claims-about-democratic-and-gop-efforts-to-fix-obamacare/", "vclaim": "Any large piece of legislation contains drafting errors, just as bugs in computer code are often discovered after the release of new software. But one consequence of passing the Affordable Care Act with only the votes of one political party is that no so-called \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d bill has been passed, let alone introduced, because political passions continue to run high about the law. Thus, when unexpected problems have emerged, the White House has preferred to order administrative work-arounds.\n\nA Democratic congressional aide said it would be wrong to assume that Schumer was speaking about legislative fixes. He said that senators have the ability to advocate for changes in other ways, and the administration has been responsive.\n\nAs an example, he pointed to legislation proposed by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) that would have allowed people to keep their pre-Affordable Care Act plans; the administration took part of the legislative concept and implemented it administratively. (Skeptics might argue the administration and the Democratic leadership did not allow a permanent legislative fix to proceed, so Landrieu\u2019s solution \u2014 which had the support of many Republicans \u2014 was blocked.)\n\nOkay, what about Republicans? Schumer said that they are \u201cfocused on repeal\u201d and that \u201cwe urge our Republican colleagues to join us in fixing it.\u201d Certainly, many Republicans dislike the law and, especially in the House of Representatives, have voted often to repeal it; indeed, some Republicans who have spoken openly about trying to improve the law have been attacked by GOP rivals for not adequately supporting full repeal.\n\nFor instance, Republicans have pressed for a repeal of the 2.3 percent tax on medical devices, which would raise about $30 billion of revenue over the next decade but which manufacturers claim (perhaps wrongly) is costing jobs. Many Democrats also favor repealing the tax \u2014 a nonbinding amendment to the budget resolution passed 79 to 20, with Schumer voting in support of repeal \u2014 but the Senate Democratic leadership has refused to schedule a binding vote, even though the measure has passed with Democratic support in the House.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have also pushed to delay the individual mandate for a year, winning the support of at least one Senate Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin has pitched the idea of a \u201ctransitional year\u201d to improve the product and discover any possible flaws. \u201cThis transitional year gives you a chance to adjust the products to the market and to see if the market will absorb and buy the product,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\nWe take no position on whether these proposals are good or bad, but simply note that they are Republican proposals to fix the law, in cooperation with at least some Democrats \u2014 which have been blocked by the Senate leadership that includes Schumer.\n\nSchumer\u2019s comment was carefully worded to suggest that Democrats are working hard to improve the law while being open to Republican ideas. But his remarks leave out a significant part of the story. Senate Democrats generally have not offered legislative fixes \u2014 and the leadership often has blocked legislation backed by Republicans and even some Democrats from coming to the floor for a vote. Administrative fixes engineered by the White House can only go so far in addressing some of the problems that have emerged from the drafting of the original law.\n\nSchumer\u2019s comment is an example of political rhetoric that misdirects through omission and its tone, leaving listeners in the dark about the actual dynamics on the Senate floor. This comment is on the tipping point of between One and Two Pinocchios, but we don\u2019t have 1/2 Pinocchios. Given the gap between Schumer\u2019s rhetoric and the reality, we lean toward Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
