We got 12,000 people off the street,\" Newsom said during a gubernatorial debate in San Jose on May 8, 2018.\n\nThe event was broadcast statewide on NBC and NPR stations.\n\nNewsom is a Democrat and California\u2019s lieutenant governor. He was San Francisco\u2019s mayor from January 2004 through January 2011. Before that, he served eight years on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors starting in January 1997.\n\nPolls show Newsom is currently the favorite in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nWhoever becomes California\u2019s next governor will be faced with a growing homeless crisis, one made worse by a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness in the state shot up nearly 14 percent in 2017, as it remained flat nationwide, according to federal data and our recent fact check on the topic.\n\nGiven the importance of the issue, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his facts right.\n\nWe set out on a fact check.\n\nWe started by examining Newsom\u2019s claim about a 40 percent reduction in the city\u2019s \"street population,\" which includes people living outside, in abandoned buildings, tents, cars and storage structures. It\u2019s a subset of the city\u2019s overall homeless population, which includes people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing.\n\nSome might interpret Newsom\u2019s statement as meaning the city\u2019s overall homeless population dropped significantly during his time in office. That\u2019s not the case. But because Newsom twice referenced \"street population,\" we examined that category.\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t give a timeframe, we assumed Newsom was speaking mainly about his tenure as mayor.\n\nNathan Click, Newsom\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the candidate\u2019s statement is supported when comparing street population totals from 2002 to 2009, or two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office.\n\nA 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey does show the total dropped 40 percent, from 4,535 individuals to 2,709.\n\nBy 2011, however, the city\u2019s street total climbed to 3,100, a gain of about 400 people over Newsom\u2019s final two years as mayor, according to the city survey from that year.\n\nTrent Rhorer, who served as Newsom\u2019s homeless czar, has worked as executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency since 2000.\n\nHe said the increase during the last part of Newsom\u2019s tenure took place \"in the context of a massive recession\" that forced many onto the streets.\n\nRhorer said it was also driven by the shuttering of several nonprofit homeless programs, including two drop-in centers, a shelter and a treatment program when private landlords sold buildings housing those services. Even considering the uptick in the last two years of Newsom\u2019s term, the city\u2019s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011, he noted.\n\nThe executive director added that the city\u2019s overall homeless population held steady from 2009 to 2011, hovering near 6,500.\n\n\"Is homelessness solved? Absolutely not,\" Rhorer said, but Newsom \"got results.\"\n\nRohrer also explained the 12,000 figure. He said it represents the total number of people removed from the streets through two strategies from January 2004 through November 2010, a period that nearly spans Newsom\u2019s time as mayor.\n\nThe city placed about 7,000 in permanent housing programs, while the remainder left the streets with a bus ticket through Homeward Bound, a program that\u2019s been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem to another city.\n\nChris Herring, a doctoral candidate of sociology at UC Berkeley who studies homelessness, told The San Francisco Examiner in June 2016 the program \"should not be used as a policy to boost up numbers or some vision that San Francisco is ending homelessness.\"\n\nRohrer described Homeward Bound as a well-vetted and voluntary program that connected homeless street people with caretakers who agreed to take them in. It included three follow-up phone calls by city officials, he said.\n\nNewsom\u2019s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco\u2019s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of 6,248. By January 2011, Newsom\u2019s final month in office, that number was 6,455.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499.\n\nWhile the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had \"moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score.\"\n\n\"Yet many of San Francisco's neighborhoods,\" the article continued, \"remain plagued with panhandlers, and residents and tourists alike complain of feeling scared or just plain disgusted.\"\n\nCandidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed at a gubernatorial debate that, \"In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street.\"\n\nHis campaign spokesman pointed to a city homeless survey that shows for one selective window of time, 2002 to 2009, San Francisco reduced its homeless street population by 40 percent.\n\nBut that report ignores the last two years of Newsom\u2019s tenure as mayor. Looking at those years, we found San Francisco\u2019s homeless street population jumped by 400, diminishing the reduction Newsom described at the debate.\n\nWe interpreted his statement as reflecting his full tenure as mayor, not part of it.\n\nNewsom also spoke of just one segment of the homeless population -- those on the streets, but not the overall total including people in shelters. The overall total has gone up, not down.\n\nHis claim that \"We got 12,000 people off the street,\" is supported by statements from his former homeless czar. It\u2019s important to note, however, that the city used Homeward Bound, a bus ticket program, to move about 5,000 of those people out of San Francisco.\n\nNewsom\u2019s overall statement is partially accurate. But the first portion uses a cherry-picked timeframe that ignores the last quarter of Newsom\u2019s term as mayor. The second part of his claim leaves out some key context.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "lang": "en"}
