(The rest of the states do their own background checks.) If the check isn\u2019t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale.\n\nRoof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors.\n\nRoof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didn\u2019t show a conviction, the examiner couldn\u2019t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof\u2019s criminal history.\n\nRoof\u2019s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county\u2019s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices.\n\nWhen the three days were up, the case was still listed as \"pending\" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces later this year.\n\nThose three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didn\u2019t contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.) Rather, the bill set a time limit -- sometimes called a default to proceed -- for the government to conduct its background checks.\n\nSanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the Brady Bill five times -- including a version that In November 1993, Sanders voted an amendment imposing an instead. The problem was technology for instant checks didn\u2019t exist at the time.\n\nAs a result, according to the , supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days.\n\nThe final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. (We did not get a response from the Sanders\u2019 campaign on debate night about Clinton\u2019s attack.)\n\nSo to recap: Sanders supported shortening the time the government had to conduct background checks. Whether extra time would have kept Roof from purchasing a gun is unclear.\n\nClinton said that Sanders \"voted for what we call the Charleston loophole.\"\n\nIn 2015, Roof was able to buy a gun after time ran out for the government to perform a background check -- the result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Roof. Whether more time would have made a difference remains unknown. But Roof was able to purchase the gun after a three-day waiting period expired.\n\nSanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct its check. Roof was able to purchase a gun after waiting out a three-day time limit on background checks. We rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nClarification: This fact-check was edited on Jan. 19 to clarify waiting periods and and time limits on background checks.", "lang": "en"}
