Those plans won\u2019t go ahead, so all things being equal, government spending will be that much higher over the period than had been predicted.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that useful to talk about this figure as a \u201cblack hole\u201d in the budget, as was widely done in the last week. It makes more sense to think of its effect on the budget in annual terms, because spending on this sort of measure runs on until policy is changed again. Otherwise you could pick any arbitrary period\u2014ten years say\u2014and then the \u201cblack hole\u201d would be twice as big.\n\nThe government has been known to present figures in this way too. Last year it announced a \u201c\u00a327 billion improvement in the public finances\u201d that was spread in the same way over five years (and which later disappeared).\n\nIn 2016/17, the financial year that\u2019s about to start, the PIP changes were only due to save \u00a315 million according to the Treasury, rising to \u00a31.3 billion in 2019/20.\n\nWhile the financial position of the government will be \u00a31.3 billion worse than had been forecast that year, the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) still has the government moving into surplus.\n\nYesterday the OBR chairman Robert Chote told MPs that that the chance of reaching surplus by 2019/20 isn\u2019t \u201cmaterially\u201d lower due to the changes to PIP, still at around 55% according to its forecasts.\n\nThis forecast had already counted unspecified savings of \u00a33.5 billion towards meeting the surplus that year. These are to be delivered through an efficiency review to conclude in 2018.\n\nPutting this \u00a33.5 billion together with the \u00a31.3 billion that was meant to be saved from the changes to PIP in 2019/20 means that the Chancellor will have to find a total of \u00a34.8 billion from non-protected spending in 2019-20 to make his sums add up.\n\nThat\u2019s if the underlying forecast does not change again in the autumn\u2014and forecasts do change a lot between \u201cfiscal events\u201d, as last week\u2019s Budget showed.", "lang": "en"}
