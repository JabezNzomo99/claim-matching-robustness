Scott Walker\u2019s reforms.\"\n\n \n\n The billboards hit on a theme voters undoubtedly will hear over and over from Republicans if Barrett takes on Walker in a possible recall election in 2012.\n\n \n\n The billboards refer to Walker\u2019s controversial budget legislation that took health care and pensions out of collective bargaining for most public employees.\n\n \n\n That allowed local governments and schools to impose cost-sharing for those benefits instead of negotiating with labor leaders.\n\n \n\n Barrett\u2019s campaign, reacting to the ad, denounced it as completely off base, in a statement to WTMJ4 that said: \"The only thing accurate about that billboard is the picture of Tom Barrett.\"\n\n \n\n What\u2019s the truth?\n\n \n\n Club for Growth didn\u2019t respond, but the Journal Sentinel reported in August that the city of Milwaukee will indeed save $25 million in 2012 just on health care costs, in large part by asking employees to pay more.\n\n \n\n In fact, Barrett\u2019s budget document said revisions to the city\u2019s health insurance -- the ones made easier by Walker\u2019s changes -- would help drive overall health care costs down for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\n \n\n We contacted the same Milwaukee budget official quoted in August 2011, and he told us the city still expects a $25 million drop in health costs.\n\n \n\n Case closed?\n\n \n\n The official, city economist Dennis Yaccarino, says the $25 million actually overstates savings related to the Walker budget alone. He said city officials didn\u2019t make that clear in early August when a Journal Sentinel reporter first got the number from the city and published the $25 million figure in the context of Walker\u2019s changes. That story ran Aug. 8, 2011.\n\n \n\n The newspaper followed up August 21, 2011, quoting city officials saying $6 million of that savings number was from the city\u2019s own decision to switch from an insured HMO to a self-funded approach due to projected cost savings. The $6 million switch is noted that way in Barrett\u2019s budget.\n\n \n\n The move, we should note, was negotiated with the city\u2019s largest union two years ago but was not put in place until now for reasons unrelated to the state budget, according to Yaccarino and Richard Abelson, executive director of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which represents general city employees.\n\n \n\n Yaccarino said the city calculated in 2011 that it was paying a profit to its carrier and could keep the money for itself by going self insured. That scenario had not existed until 2011, hence the delay, he said.\n\n \n\n So that leaves $19 million of savings for Milwaukee from Walker\u2019s original budget plan and the amended one he signed, right?\n\n \n\n Not exactly.\n\n \n\n Remember, the $25 million figure is just on the health care costs side fo the equation. What about public employees paying more in pension costs? That\u2019s the second part of Walker\u2019s limits on collective bargaining over benefits. Milwaukee didn\u2019t put them in place due to questions about the legality of the state changes as they apply to Milwaukee. So that\u2019s a 0.\n\n \n\n Finally, city official note Walker\u2019s overall budget cut municipal aid, leaving the net \"savings\" to the city much reduced from $19 million.\n\n \n\n But the billboard refers to Walker\u2019s \"reforms,\" which is the changes tied to the collective bargaining issue. It is making a narrower claim, on how much was saved from the reforms, not how the city fared overall.\n\n \n\n Our conclusion\n\n \n\n Billboards say Walker\u2019s \"reforms\" allowed Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to save $25 million for the city.\n\n \n\n The city is that much ahead, but a portion was Barrett\u2019s doing before Walker\u2019s budget was enacted.\n\n \n\n We rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
