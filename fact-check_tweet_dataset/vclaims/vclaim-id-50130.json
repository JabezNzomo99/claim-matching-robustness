Joe Biden!\" it says.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reuters and AFP have already found it to be inaccurate.\n\nPublic property records for the U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory, show no results as of Aug. 11 for Joe Biden. They do show results for Biden\u2019s younger brother James and his wife Sara.\n\nJames Biden bought an acre of land with ocean views on nearby Water Island in 2005 and later resold a third of it to a lobbyist, according to a January report from Politico. Google Maps shows Water Island is slightly over 8 miles from Little St. James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.\n\nThe Politico report said it was not clear whether Joe Biden was aware of his brother\u2019s dealings related to the Water Island property. The former vice president has vacationed elsewhere on the island at least three times, the report said. But there\u2019s no sign of any ownership by Joe Biden.\n\nThere\u2019s no reference to any Caribbean property in Biden\u2019s financial disclosures from 2020 and 2019 or his federal tax returns from 2018, 2017 and 2016, as other fact-checkers have noted. Those forms are available on his campaign website. PolitiFact also found no credible reports of Biden owning a Caribbean island on Google or the Nexis news database.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates told AFP that Biden \"does not and never has\" owned any property in the U.S. Virgin Islands or anywhere else in the Caribbean.\n\nBiden and his wife Jill own two properties in Delaware, where Biden served as a senator for decades. They have their primary residence in Wilmington, and another home in Rehoboth Beach. They also rent a home in McLean, Va., according to the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Google Maps, the nearest islands to Epstein\u2019s Little St. James are Great St. James Island, which Epstein also bought in 2016, and Dog Island. As AFP first reported, Google Maps shows no obvious buildings or other signs of habitation on Dog Island.\n\nThe Facebook image also says the FBI found \"multiple skeletons\" in the water around Epstein\u2019s island. PolitiFact previously examined online claims that the bones of children were found on Epstein\u2019s island. We rated those claims False.\n\nA Facebook post says Biden owns a private island next to Epstein\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s no public evidence that\u2019s the case. The recorder of deeds for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which includes Esptein\u2019s Little St. James, shows no results in its database for Joe Biden.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
