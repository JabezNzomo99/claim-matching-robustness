These reports offer detailed forensic analyses unveiling the cyber espionage and criminal hacking activities of the group as well as demonstrating their affiliation with the Russian military intelligence/Russian government.\n\nThe groups\u2019 multiple nicknames have been revealed, they include Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28, Sofacy, STRONTIUM and others.\n\nThe detailed forensic evidence of Fancy Bear\u2019s criminal activities and its direct connection to the Russian state was published in April 2017 by a Tokyo, Japan-based cyber security firm Trend Micro.\n\nFor over the seven years, Trend Micro tracked and documented Fancy Bear\u2019s activities. The security firm has known of Fancy Bear\u2019s existence since 2004. The chronology of the groups\u2019 cybercrimes documented in the report begins in June 2014.\n\nDuring two years \u2013 2014 to 2015, Fancy Bear:\n\u2022 None Attacked a U.S. nuclear fuel dealer, setting up fake Outlook Access login pages for its employees;\n\u2022 None Launched fake login page attacks against American and EU military and defense institutions;\n\u2022 None Attacked corporate accounts of 55 employees of a U.S. newspaper;\n\u2022 None Launched a massive Gmail phishing attack against three popular YouTube bloggers after they interviewed then-president Barack Obama;\n\u2022 None Attacked the French channel, TV5Monde, putting its global channels off air;\n\u2022 None Launched a domestic spying campaign targeting Russian dissidents, including the spouses of senior U.S. officials;\n\u2022 None Set up a fake server mimicking the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) server of the Safety Board and created a fake Outlook Web Access server to target the MH17 investigation;\n\u2022 None Launched a spear phishing Email attack against multiple foreign ministries worldwide using the Adobe Flash exploit code.\n\nThe Trend Micro report said in 2016 alone, the groups\u2019 activities increased by 400 percent becoming more focused on cyber espionage, targeted cyber propaganda campaigns and hacking of high profile political targets. During that presidential election year, United States political groups and individuals dominated the groups\u2019 targeting, though among other victims were the Bulgarian army, the Polish Defense Ministry, Turkish and Arabic media outlets, Turkish, German, and French political parties, the Parliament of Montenegro, the World Anti-Doping agency and many others.\n\nPolygraph.info has previously debunked the Russian denials that Fancy Bearhacked into the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and published confidential medical data of U.S. athletes.\n\nA cyber security and forensic consulting firm, FireEye Inc., d/b/a Mandiant, hired by WADA conducted an investigation into Fancy Bear, which, the firm said, led to the Russian military intelligence.\n\nWADA then published a report calling the Fancy Bear, a \u201cRussian cyber espionage group\u201d which revealed evidence of the group\u2019s affiliation with the Russian military.\n\nWe have also debunked a denial of Russia\u2019s cyberattacks targeting the campaign of France\u2019s then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said the evidence of such activities was just a \u201cfantasy\u201d but the fact check showed the evidence was verifiable and plausible.", "lang": "en"}
