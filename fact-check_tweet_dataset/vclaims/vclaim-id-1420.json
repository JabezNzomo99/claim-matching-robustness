This is the estimated increase in the overall population of the UK when you compare the number of people coming to live in the UK and the number going abroad.\n\nThat\u2019s almost as many people as live in Cardiff. The population there was 357,000 in mid-2015.\n\nThis is a type of claim we\u2019ve seen before and there are several towns and cities that could be used for comparison: Wakefield, where the population is around 334,000, Belfast where it\u2019s 339,000 or Wigan where it\u2019s 322,000.\n\nBut net migration isn\u2019t at this level every year. It\u2019s been increasing and has been at roughly record levels since 2015.\n\nIn 2014 net migration was around 243,000 people, or roughly a population the size of Swansea or Salford.\n\nThere is a large margin of error in these migration figures as the number is estimated from surveys taken at the main air and sea ports and routes into the UK.", "lang": "en"}
