The \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d are considered a key to the health law\u2019s success, since they are healthier and won\u2019t require as much health care as older Americans. If the proportion of young and old enrollees was out of whack, insurance companies might feel compelled to boost premiums, which some analysts feared would lead to a cycle of even fewer younger adults and higher premiums. (There is also a dissenting viewpoint about the importance of this figure.)\n\nBut some readers cried foul, saying the president highlighted a misleading number in his news conference. The young invincibles are between the ages of 18 and 34 \u2014 and as White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d acknowledged, that figure is 28 percent. The 35 percent figures includes children under the age of 18.\n\nLast summer, in background briefings for the media, the administration set an ambitious goal: 40 percent of the enrollees would be between the ages of 18 and 34. That added up to 2.7 million of the anticipated 7 million enrollees.\n\nBut the early numbers for Affordable Care Act were a bit grim, as reporters homed in on the percentage of enrollees between 18 and 34. In February, as the percentage edged up from 24 percent to 27 percent, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius touted what she called a \u201c65 percent rate of growth.\u201d (She was counting the increase in the raw number of young-invincible enrollees.) But the percentage stayed stuck at 27 percent in March.\n\nSo you can see why there might be some excitement about a figure of 35 percent, as it sounded rather close to the original 40 percent goal. Indeed, the 35 percent figure was first spread a few hours before the president\u2019s remarks by state insurance commissioners, who had met privately with the president at the White House.\n\n\u201cThey shared the 35 percent under 35, but no details on that number, and they did not disclose the 18-34 (28 percent) figure during the meeting,\u201d said an official with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nAri Melber, MSNBC: \u201cThe Kaiser Family Foundation in 2013 estimated that more than a third of the enrollments should be between 18 and 34 years old for these types of plans to succeed. Again today, the president was able to announce, 35 percent of enrollees are under 35.\u201d\n\nNow, to be fair, the more relevant number of 28 percent was in the White House fact sheet, and many of the news reports for the Friday print editions eventually got it correct. (The New York Times had to correct a summary on its Web site.)\n\nJon Gruber, an MIT professor who was the source of the figure, said that there is no equivalent 0-18 figure for the Massachusetts plan because it is only for adults. The Massachusetts plan achieved 35 percent in 2008 and 34 percent in 2009, Gruber said.\n\nIn this case, officials were able to put into circulation a really good number, without context, via the state insurance commissioners. That\u2019s the number the president highlighted in his news conference. By the time reporters realized that the relevant number was different, the White House highlighted the fact that it was the same as the Massachusetts figure.\n\nEither way, the White House got its spin out. By the time the dust settled, the original 40 percent goal was largely forgotten \u2013 -as well as the fact that the final 28 percent figure was only slightly better than the 27 percent achieved in March.", "lang": "en"}
