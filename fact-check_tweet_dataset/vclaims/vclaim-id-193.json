Examples ( here , here and here ).\u200b Kurt Cobain was a musician and lead singer of the popular band Nirvana. He died in 1994.\n\nThe image reads: \u201cKurt Cobain quote from 1993!\u201d followed by the quote, \u201cIn the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we\u2019ll elect a true outsider when we fully mature. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a business tycoon who can\u2019t be bought and who does what\u2019s right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.\u201d\n\nThis claim is false. The image alleges Cobain said this in 1993 and provides no source or other information. Danny Goldberg, one of Nirvana's managers, wrote an article for The Nation in 2018 referring to this fabricated quote. Goldberg wrote: \"As one of Nirvana\u2019s managers when Kurt was alive, I know that the quote is not only made up but it is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs. He often differentiated Nirvana from more overtly political punk bands like Dead Kennedys and Fugazi, but Kurt was unambiguous about where his political sentiments lay and, although he identified with anarchist imagery in some contexts, Kurt had no problem making choices at election time.\"\u200b ( here )\u200b\n\nThe article explains that this claim originated from a Facebook page called \u201cTrump Train\u201d during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn an interview with Sergio Marchi in 1992, Kurt Cobain said that he would vote for Bill Clinton in the upcoming elections. When asked about Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman candidate, Cobain said that Perot was a rich man and that he did not trust him. ( here )\u200b\n\nIn the same interview, Cobain also said (Spanish translation): \"Republicans are an incarnation of Satan. I hate them.\" ( here , \u200bhere )\u200b\n\nFalse: Kurt Cobain did not say in 1993 that Trump should be elected\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
