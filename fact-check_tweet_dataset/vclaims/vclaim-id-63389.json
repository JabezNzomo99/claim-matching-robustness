FACTLY has found no information about bail being granted to him. No media agency has reported anything about Kuldeep Singh being granted bail. As it is a high-profile case, any such grant of bail would have been widely reported by media. Previously, he was convicted of Unnao minor\u2019s rape and killing the victim\u2019s father. Also, he was expelled from BJP in 2019. While there is no information regarding Kuldeep Singh getting bail, it was found that Mahesh Singh, the uncle of Unnao rape survivor, was granted bail in a forgery case by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court. The bail order can be read here. The posted photo is also an old one.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
