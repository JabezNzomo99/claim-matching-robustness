A leaked of email supposedly sent by SecGen CBCI to Archbishop Bangalore\u2026.this says much\u201d. The tweet by a twitter user Swami Nishchalanand (@swamijitweets) was also retweeted by BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP, Subramanian Swamy.\n\nThe email attached to the tweet was titled \u2018Our Prayers have been answered\u2019. The email addressed to Archbishop Bangalore from His Eminence Oswald Cardinal Gracias, Secretary General of Catholic Bishop\u2019s Conference of India (CBCI), celebrated the granting of separate religious status to Lingayats and urged him to work hard for the \u201crich harvest of souls in Karnataka.\u201d\n\nThe letter circulated by him had some fairly outlandish points that perhaps only the most gullible would believe as true. On its own, it may not have gained much traction, but it got circulated widely as it was retweeted by Subramanian Swamy who has close to 7.3 million followers in Twitter. Since the user @swamijitweets has deleted his tweet, the retweeted tweet cannot be seen on Subramanian Swamy\u2019s Twitter timeline anymore. However, Swamy\u2019s tweets get pushed to his official Facebook page which still carries evidence of him having retweeted the tweet.\n\nA website called rightactions.in also published the above claim and was shared over 5000 times on Facebook including Francois Gautier of the fake Nostradamus claims fame.\n\nBishop Theodore Mascarenhas, Secretary General, Catholic Bishops Conference of India dismissed the claims as fake and diabolic.\n\nThough initially @swamijitweets claimed that his sources were reliable, the original tweet was deleted by him after bishop Mascarenhas issued an official clarification and warned possible legal action against those involved in making and promoting the letter.\n\nIn his letter, bishop Mascarenhas stated that \u201ca very malicious fake letter is being circulated in social media and in Karnataka on the eve of the elections\u201d. He added that \u201cthe false letters makes wild allegations about the Church involvement in the Lingayat issue\u201d. The response of the bishop is reproduced below.\n\nThere were several elements about the fake letter that gave a clue that it was nothing more than pure malice. It is perhaps only in the wonder world of fake news peddlers that bishops email each other rejoicing and setting targets to harvest souls. Here are some inconsistencies in the letter, some of which were pointed out by Bishop Mascarenhas:\n\u2022 Cardinal Oswald Gracias is the President of the Catholic Bishop\u2019s Conference of India and not the Secretary General.\n\u2022 The email wrongly addresses him as Oswald Cardinal Gracias instead of Cardinal Oswald Gracias.\n\u2022 The biggest giveaway as always was the language used and the grammatical errors in the letter.\n\nBishop Mascarenhas asserted that \u201cCatholic Bishops Conference of India or Cardinal Gracias will never ever indulge in divisive tactics as indicated in that letter.\u201d He ended his letter saying \u201cMay God bless Karnataka and may God bless our beloved country, India. Jai Hind\u201d. We have seen in the last few weeks how the Karnataka has been the target of the fake news brigade. Discerning social media users are now well familiar with their divisive strategies.", "lang": "en"}
