Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The images in the post were taken from the CCTV footage of the TMC workers destroying the Vidyasagar statue in West Bengal. Fact: The photos in the post are in no way connected to West Bengal. The screenshots were taken from a video related to ISIS destroying the ancient statues in Mosul. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photos in the post are run through Google Reverse Image Search, links to several videos reported from Iraq will be found in the search results. According to the CNN article, the video was taken in 2015 when ISIS destroyed several artefacts and statues in the Mosul Museum. The photos in the post are taken from that video. So, the posted photos are not related to the destruction of Vidyasagar statue in West Bengal.\n\nTo sum it up, Visuals from Iraq are being shared as being from the incident in West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
