These events sometimes resulted in violent confrontations between police and the public. Breathless and false rumors about members of the far-left \u201cantifa\u201d movement being shipped around the country in buses to sow violence and discord in various major cities soon followed, elevating this diffuse movement to the level of a national boogeyman.\n\nAt the height of this panic, Deputy Director of Communications for the Trump 2020 Campaign Matt Wolking tweeted a screenshot of a tweet apparently from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison \u2014 who is overseeing that state\u2019s response to the officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 holding a copy of the book \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook\u201d and joking that the book would \u201cstrike fear\u201d into the heart of U.S. President Donald Trump:\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted, but archived versions of it prove that the screenshot shared by Wolking is an authentic tweet from Jan. 3, 2018.\n\nThe book had been published just a few months prior by then-Dartmouth scholar Mark Bray, a former Occupy Wall Street activist and \u201chistorian of human rights, terrorism and political radicalism in Modern Europe.\u201d The book, as reviewed by The New Yorker, \u201cis many things: the first English-language transnational history of Antifa, a how-to for would-be activists, and a record of advice from anti-Fascist organizers past and present.\u201d\n\nIt was also, once, photographed in the hands of Ellison.", "lang": "en"}
