The link to the video is at the bottom of the post.\n\nPuneet Sharma\u2019s twitter video was embedded in a blog post by a site called \u2018hindutva.info\u2018 with a title \u201cVIDEO : \u0915\u0947\u0930\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 RSS \u0914\u0930 BJP \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0916\u094c\u092b\u0928\u093e\u0915 \u092e\u0902\u091c\u0930!\u201d (A horrifying instance of the torture on RSS/BJP workers in Kerala). This post, in turn, has been shared close to 10k times on different social media networks.\n\nThe video was uploaded multiple times on various social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp with thousands and thousands of shares. Others in the Hindutva brigade gave it a further spin and claimed that it is Muslims murdering RSS/BJP members in Kerala and there\u2019s a need to give up casteism to fight this evil. For eg, the following Facebook account called \u201cKattar Hindu\u201d wrote:\n\nSo, what\u2019s the truth? The truth is that this video first went viral on Mexican social media around January 15-17th, 2017.\n\nAccording to a website called Crime Junkie, the video if of one Antonia being stabbed to death and was uploaded from an unidentified location in Mexico.\n\nIn a video that\u2019s gone viral on Mexican social media, an alleged gang member identified only as Antonio is brutally stabbed to death.\n\n According to reports, the victim admitted to carrying out various crimes on behalf of a gang known as \u201cEl Cholo\u201d.Included footage shows an unidentified man repeatedly stabbing the victim to death.This video went viral on January 15, 2017, out of an unidentified location in Mexico.\n\nFurther, there are posts on Facebook around the same date which also make the same claim.\n\nThe video was also posted on youtube around the same data.\n\nSo, after the right-wing made viral a fake video of Gurmehar Kaur, now they have taken a video from Mexico and are claiming it to be an RSS member being murdered in Kerala.
