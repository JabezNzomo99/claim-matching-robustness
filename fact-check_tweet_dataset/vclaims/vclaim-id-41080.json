(This point, previously examined by PolitFact, was found to be Half True \u2014 but Trump didn\u2019t note that the reductions didn\u2019t affect the program\u2019s beneficiaries, or that he has used a similar approach in projecting future Medicare spending reductions.)\n\nHe challenged Congress to approve legislation to curb surprise medical bills and lauded improvements in the veterans\u2019 health system.\n\nBut the speech included several other claims directed at Democrats and the currently buzzy proposal of \"Medicare for All\" that could easily have left some people befuddled. We broke down a few.\n\nTrump told his audience that \"Democrats are draining your health care to finance the open borders.\"\n\nWe asked the White House for the basis of this remark and never got a specific answer. But there are various issues to examine.\n\nIn August, the president argued that Democrats \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" But that isn\u2019t accurate. The statement, part of a Trump 2020 television advertisement, was rated Mostly False.\n\nThat claim examined Democratic candidates who had said during one of the televised debates that their health care plans would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants. But the question posed by a debate host didn\u2019t ask whether coverage would be free. In fact, multiple candidates said coverage for undocumented people would not be free. Some, meanwhile, include copays and deductibles in their health care proposals. Plus, if any Medicare for All plan was financed through, for instance, payroll taxes, undocumented immigrants would also be subject to paying those.\n\nTrump argued that Democratic proposals for universal health care \"would totally obliterate Medicare\" \u2014 adding that \"whether it\u2019s single-payer or the so-called public option \u2026 they want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.\"\n\nThe argument here is nuanced but, fundamentally, Trump\u2019s characterization misses the mark and is misleading.\n\nThe \"single-payer\" bill he refers to is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The bill would put all Americans \u2014 including the seniors currently covered by Medicare \u2014 into a single health plan. It would share Medicare\u2019s name but look dramatically different: Unlike the existing program, the proposal envisions covering virtually all medical services and eliminating cost sharing. It would not be administered by private, for-profit contractors.\n\nPredicting what this looks like is difficult since it\u2019s grounded in hypotheticals. And one could argue that using the term \"obliterates\" is not completely off base because Medicare in its current form would no longer exist. But that misses the broader impact. Under the proposal as it\u2019s written, seniors would be insured through a program at least as generous \u2014 if not more \u2014 than what they currently receive.\n\nAs for \"public option\" proposals put forth by candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, they would leave Medicare more or less as it is, while also creating a public health plan uninsured people could buy into.\n\nDescribing Medicare for All, Trump said the plan would \"reduce Americans\u2019 household income by $17,000 a year.\"\n\nWe contacted the White House to find out the source of this number. The administration acknowledged receipt but never sent an answer.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s unclear where this number comes from, because the evidence simply doesn\u2019t exist to make such a precise claim. After all, many details about Medicare for All are still being worked out. That makes it exceptionally difficult to figure out how much such a system would cost \u2014 let alone how an individual household\u2019s finances might change under such a system. (This ambiguity is why the Congressional Budget Office has declined to estimate single-payer\u2019s fiscal impact.)\n\nAnd different households would likely make out differently under Medicare for All. Some might end up paying more. But others would likely pay more in taxes while still seeing their health care costs go down \u2014 meaning they could ultimately save money.\n\nTrump said, \"the Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they will also deny your treatment and everything that you need.\"\n\nThis statement relies on a talking point that\u2019s been widely debunked.\n\nWe focused on the first part of this claim. Both conservatives and moderate Democrats have argued that single-payer health care, in particular, would drive hospitals and doctors to shutter en masse. (Conservatives have made this argument about a public option as well.) In a past related fact check, we rated this as False.\n\nThe argument springs from the way Medicare currently reimburses hospitals, at 87 cents for every dollar spent on health care. But the Sanders bill does not set a reimbursement rate, and instead would charge the federal government with devising an appropriate rate.\n\nSome hospitals might struggle under a new system \u2014 but others, health care economists have previously told us, would likely do better.\n\n\"It really depends on which hospitals you\u2019re talking about,\" Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in hospital pricing, told Kaiser Health News in July.", "lang": "en"}
