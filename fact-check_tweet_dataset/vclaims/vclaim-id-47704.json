Franklin Graham suggested on Facebook that Trump\u2019s \"enemies and the liberal media\" want a prolonged national shutdown in order to prevent Trump from being re-elected.\n\nThe Christian minister and son of Billy Graham, the late evangelist, also made a claim about Sweden and its contrarian approach to combating the coronavirus. \"I read yesterday that Sweden had not shut down, but their people were following social distancing and other protocols with the government stressing personal responsibility, and their infection rate still remains lower than the UK\u2019s, Italy\u2019s and Spain\u2019s,\" Graham wrote in an April 17 post on Facebook.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) After PolitiFact published a rating on this statement April 24, Graham edited his original Facebook post to remove reference to the infection rate.\n\nData support Graham\u2019s claim about infection rates. But the epidemiologist credited with developing Sweden\u2019s COVID-19 strategy said infection rate is not a reliable indicator of how a country is doing.\n\nSweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas; about 20% of residents were born abroad.\n\nIn contrast to most of the United States, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although groups of larger than 50 people are banned. With elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged, what\u2019s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it.\n\nThe idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity \u2014 let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune or a vaccine becomes available.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get replies when we asked for information from two North Carolina-based organizations led by Graham, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the international relief organization Samaritan's Purse.\n\nWe found infection-rate figures from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.\n\nHere are the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1 million people as of April 17, the day of Graham\u2019s post:\n\nSo, Sweden\u2019s known rate of infections is lower than the other countries Graham mentioned (and lower than the U.S. rate, as well).\n\nWe\u2019ll note that Our World in Data figures for April 17 show that the death rate \u2014 the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases \u2014 in Sweden was slightly higher than Spain\u2019s, though lower than the other countries Graham cites.\n\nSweden\u2019s death rate was much higher, however, than the three countries that border it: Denmark: 4.67%; Finland: 2.23%; Norway: 2%.\n\nExperts urge caution on reading too much into the infection-rate figures that Graham alludes to.\n\nTesting has been focused on health care workers and people whose cases who are serious enough to end up in the hospital, so we don\u2019t know the number of people infected who suffer mild or no symptoms, wrote Paul Franks, a genetic epidemiology professor at Lund University in Sweden and an adjunct professor at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"The existing data suggest that the infection rates are probably much higher in Stockholm than in London and a little higher across Sweden than across the UK,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nIndeed, Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist who is credited with developing Sweden\u2019s COVID-19 strategy, says infection rate is not a good measure of how a country is doing.\n\n\"The recorded infection rate depends hugely on the number of tests performed and what indications for testing that are used,\" Tegnell, the director of the Swedish Public Health Agency, told PolitiFact. \"In other words, an unreliable measure.\"\n\nAsked if Sweden\u2019s strategy has been effective, Tegnell told us: \"Partly, to the extent that the health system managed the challenge and that there are always free beds. Not so well in protecting the elderly.\"\n\nAs we were preparing this fact-check, there were reports that confirmed infections in Sweden were rising sharply. For example, according to The Guardian, Sweden reported 812 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 24, the highest number of new cases in the country yet reported.\n\nAt the same time, if Swedish studies are accurate, infections and deaths in Stockholm, where more than half of the country\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have occurred, should \"drop substantially in the coming weeks,\" Franks wrote on April 23.\n\nUrging that the reopening of the United States not be delayed, Graham said the COVID-19 infection rate in Sweden, which has no forced lockdown, is lower than in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nInfection rates are lower, but that\u2019s not necessarily a telling metric. Experts, including the epidemiologist credited with devising Sweden\u2019s no-lockdown strategy, said there are other reasons, including a lack of testing, not to read too much into infection rates as a measure of how well a country is responding to the virus. Sweden\u2019s death rates, for example, are higher than some of its peers.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.\n\nUPDATE, April 27, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect that Graham edited his original April 17 Facebook post to remove reference to Sweden's COVID-19 infection rate following the April 24 publication of this fact-check.", "lang": "en"}
