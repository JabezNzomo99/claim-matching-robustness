The claim is false; the video was created using a flight simulator programme.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 12 million times after it was broadcast here on Facebook on May 22.\n\nThe seven hour-long video repeats a clip that features an animated image of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft crashing following an engine fire.\n\nThe video was published the same day as a PIA plane crashed in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, killing almost 100 people on board, AFP reported here.\n\nThe footage was also shared repeatedly in videos published on Facebook here and here alongside an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video was produced using a flight simulator programme.\n\nAFP conducted an analysis of keyframes extracted from the clip using the video verification tool InVID-WeVerify and found the video consists of computer-generated imagery.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a corresponding video published here on YouTube in December 2016. The title states: \u201cExtreme Crash PIA ATR 42 Flight 661 Islamabad\u201d.\n\nIn the video description, the YouTube channel states the footage is a simulation created using Flight Simulator X, a flight simulation programme published by Microsoft, and not a real life incident.\n\nIt states: \u201cAll crashes are no real plane crashes, real one are terrible. This here is just for entertainment.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube video features an ATR-42 aircraft, not the Airbus 320 that crashed in Karachi on May 22. While PIA owns both models of planes, the ATR-42 is considerably smaller.\n\nAnother flight simulation video from the same YouTube channel has also been wrongly described as showing the May 22 PIA plane crash in Karachi, as The Times of India reported here.\n\nThis screenshot from the video shows parts of the PIA plane appearing to sink into the ground upon contact, leaving no damage to the lawn. This would not be possible in a real-life event.\n\nOne of the last frames of the video shows a large plume of smoke rising from the supposedly crashed aircraft, which appears intact.\n\nThis does not correspond with an account from a Karachi firefighter, who told AFP that the nose and fuselage of the plane had been heavily damaged by the impact, or with images from the crash site.\n\nBelow is an AFP photo of the wreckage of the PIA plane taken two days after the crash in Karachi on May 24:", "lang": "en"}
