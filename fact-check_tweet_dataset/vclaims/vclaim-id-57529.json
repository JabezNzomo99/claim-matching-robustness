Rodrigo Duterte is \u201cbetter\u201d than his United States counterpart Donald Trump in managing the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nFour days after Duterte placed the whole of Luzon under enhanced community quarantine, a netizen uploaded on March 20 a Getty Images photo of the Los Angeles Lakers forward taken during a Jan. 7 game with the New York Knicks, wiith this statement: \u201cI am amazed how President Duterte manages his own country in this time of crisis. He is better than Donald Trump. His leadership is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nTo give legitimacy to the quote card, the post also featured News5\u2019s logo, the media organization\u2019s URL and its social media usernames, arranged in a way that mimics News5\u2019s template for quote cards.\n\nA keyword search on Google bears no official record of the professional basketball player making such a remark. No legitimate media organization published any report on James calling Duterte\u2019s leadership \u201cextraordinary\u201d or describing him as as \u201cbetter than\u201d Trump. Neither has the basketball player mentioned Duterte in any of his official accounts on FB and Twitter.\n\nThe same day the fake post was published, News5 released a statement calling the quote card \u201cfake,\u201d and warned netizens to \u201cbe careful of people using the News5 template to spread wrong information.\u201d\n\nThe fabricated quote card, which has been reposted as original content by several other social media users and by at least one FB Page -- Breezy Basketball -- was uploaded the day James asked people to stay safe and support the stay-at-home directive of Los Angeles\u2019 local government.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s viral post containing the fake quote card already has over 780 reactions, 200 comments, and more than 3,600 shares.", "lang": "en"}
