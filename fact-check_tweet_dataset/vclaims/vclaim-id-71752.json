Yes she really said this and is really this damn crazy and stupid!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWarren did make a comparison between abortion and tonsil removal procedures, but the quote shared in the post is heavily edited and is not something Warren said or wrote.\n\nAfter searching the web and Nexis news archives, the first instance we could find of Warren discussing tonsils and abortion came in a Jan. 21, 2018, opinion column in Time magazine.\n\n\"On the 45th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, I think about what has changed since abortions became legal. Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe vs. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women are alive today because of Roe.\"\n\nWarren made the same statement a few days later in a speech she delivered on the Senate floor in opposition to legislation that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn another opinion column, published in Marie Claire magazine in July 2018, Warren wrote that Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court could threaten the overturn of Roe vs. Wade.\n\nIn the column, she again makes comparisons between the safety of the two procedures:\n\n\"The threat of overturning Roe vs. Wade is also serious. When abortions are illegal, women don\u2019t stop getting them \u2014 they just risk their lives to do it. Today, thanks to Roe, getting an abortion is safer than getting your tonsils out. Before Roe vs. Wade, many women turned to back-alley butchers to end their pregnancies.\"\n\nIn the piece, Warren links to a Time magazine article, which reported in 2014 that women who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their wisdom teeth removed, citing a study published in the peer-reviewed Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal.\n\nDr. Ushma Upadhyay, the author of the study, told Time that of the 54,911 abortion procedures analyzed, \"only 2.1% resulted in a complication \u2014 considerably lower than the 7% complication rate for wisdom tooth removal and 9% rate for tonsillectomy.\"\n\nA Facebook post shares an image of Warren and claims she said \"having an abortion is no different than someone having their tonsils removed.\"\n\nWarren never said having an abortion \"is no different\" than removing a tonsil. In arguments defending Roe vs. Wade, Warren compared the overall safety of the two medical procedures, once by citing a study.\n\nThis post takes Warren\u2019s statement, swaps out her words and places the heavily edited statement inside quotation marks to make it look like she said something she didn\u2019t. So while it contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
