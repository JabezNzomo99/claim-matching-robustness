Twice,\u201d says the caption.\n\nClinton, a former presidential candidate, does discuss the role that society plays in the development of children in her 1996 book \u201cIt Takes a Village,\u201d but there is no evidence that she ever wrote or said this quote.\n\nThe statement does not appear in that book, or any of her others.
