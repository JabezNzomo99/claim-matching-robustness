A reader also sent this claim to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe photos these pages used were not taken in Cebu. They were taken in Japan and Kosovo.\n\nA reverse image search showed that the photo posted by I AM A CEBUANO is that of the Shin-T\u014dmei Expressway in Japan, and was sourced from Wikimedia Commons. The description read, \"Fuji Viaduct of Shin-T\u014dmei Expressway in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture.\"\n\nIn the other photoset, at least 5 photos contained a logo that read, \"Bujar Gashi Photography.\" Facebook page Explore Kosovo - with Bujar Gashi posted these photos in June 2019, depicting a motorway in Kosovo.\n\nOne caption said it is the new highway to North Macedonia.\n\nIn January 2020, SunStar Cebu reported that only 60% of the 2018 project component and less than 10% of the 2019 project component of the Metro Cebu Expressway's third segment has been completed. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
