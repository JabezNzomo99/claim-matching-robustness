{"title": "PolitiFact - Has one-third of Texas seen a 25% population loss?", "subtitle": "In 2019, the United States saw the slowest population growth rate in a century, according to an NPR analysis of Census B", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-30350", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/10/gene-wu/has-one-third-texas-seen-25-population-loss/", "vclaim": "The NPR analysis attributed the slow population growth rate to declining fertility rates and more deaths, as \"post-World War II baby boomers reach old age.\" It also highlighted lower immigration rates, as the number of people moving to the United States from other countries has declined since 2016.\n\nBut is Wu\u2019s statement about the population in a third of Texas accurate? An analysis of population estimates for Texas counties over the past five years shows that, while the population in about one third of the state's counties did go down, the decline was less pronounced than Wu\u2019s tweet indicates.\n\nWu\u2019s claim was limited to the last five years. Looking at the last five years of available Census Bureau data, from 2013 to 2018, the population in Texas grew roughly 9% \u2014 from 26.4 million to 28.7 million.\n\nWhen asked about the map, Wu said it was the wrong reference material from the hearing to support his claim. He said he received a different map that showed \"massive declines\" in population in parts of rural Texas, but did not have a copy of the map he could share.\n\nThe three counties that saw the largest percent change in population were Mitchell, Schleicher and Wheeler counties, which each saw a reduction of about 9%. The remaining 84 counties saw a decline of 7% or less.\n\n\"Like you, I was unable to find population losses in the range of 20-25% over the last 5 years,\" she said in an email. \"However, I was about to reproduce the third in Rep. Wu\u2019s quote. Of the 254 Texas counties, 87 (or 34.25%, about a third) experienced population losses between 2013 and 2018.\"\n\n\"I just compared the 5-year estimates from ACS for 2012 and 2017, and I only see 6 districts with population losses during this time period,\" she said. \"So I\u2019m not sure that brings us any closer to Rep. Wu\u2019s figures.\"", "lang": "en"}
