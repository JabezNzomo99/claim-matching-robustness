No scandals. We sure are going to miss the Obamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell except for the\u2026 Fast and Furious scandal, Uranium One scandal, Benghazi scandal, IRS targeting scandal, NSA spying scandal,\u201d reads the bottom half of the meme. \u201cShould I continue?\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found no record of DeGeneres making the statement. It likely got linked to her after an unaffiliated Twitter account called @EllenReaction tweeted the quote.\n\nDeGeneres has hosted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on her daytime talk show \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d numerous times. In January 2017, just a day before President Donald Trump got sworn into office, DeGeneres paid tribute to the Obama family with a video of \u201cher favorite moments\u201d with them.\n\nYet, while DeGeneres often spoke favorably of the Obama family, there is no evidence that DeGeneres said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily caller didn\u2019t find any credible online sources linking her to the expression, and resources like TVEyes have no account of her saying it. The statement doesn\u2019t appear on her verified social media accounts either.\n\nAn internet search revealed numerous instances of Twitter users tweeting the expression around the time of the 2016 presidential election. (RELATED: No, Tribal Leaders Did Not Give Barack Obama A Derogatory Native American Name)\n\n\u201c8 years. No scandals. No mistresses. No impeachment hearings. Just class and grace, personified. We sure are going to miss this family,\u201d reads a popular version of the quote. It is often accompanied by an Obama family photo.\n\nThe statement likely got attributed to DeGeneres after the Twitter account @EllenReaction tweeted it out, garnering more than 12,000 retweets and 30,000 likes. The account, which has since been suspended, did not disclaim in its bio that it had no affiliation with the host of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d likely spurring the misattribution.\n\n\u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
