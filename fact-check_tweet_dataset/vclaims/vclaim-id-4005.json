No, that's not true. There are no reliable sources that confirm the news about her 'confession' and the site on which it originated has a long history of taking a piece of real news, copy pasting some other articles about it together and then adding an inflammatory headline and introductory paragraph with made up, unsourced claims.\n\nThe Rothschild/Clinton confession story originated from an article published on April 29, 2018 on YourNewsWire titled \"'Smallville' Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons\" (archived here) which opened:\n\n'Smallville' star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult. According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians. Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: \"As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,\" U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.\n\nNone of the links in the story provide any basis for the claim that Mack confessed to providing children for the Rothschilds or the Clintons. The 'according to police' link goes to a memo about Keith Raniere, (which does mention his earlier history of sexual abuse of a minor) but it doesn't even mention Mack. The other link also doesn't mention any confession by Mack (although it does attempt to make the link between the Clintons, the Rothschilds and the NXIVM group).\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.
