It was 2.32 million in January 2018.\n\nPSA data on unemployed Filipinos per age group, however, support De Guzman\u2019s claim that employers have a large pool of fresh graduates and young Filipinos candidates to tap.\n\nThe youngest group (15-24 years old) represents 43.7 percent of unemployed Filipinos.\n\nPhilippine Statistics Authority.
