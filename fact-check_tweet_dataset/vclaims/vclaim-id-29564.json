The elegant All-In-One Identity solution for every Indian Citizen very soon. There won\u2019t be any stamp. It will be like debit/credit card. Swipe it and move out,\u201d reads the message.\n\nAlt News also received queries on WhatsApp regarding the authenticity of the smart passport.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News uploaded the image on Google and searched it with the keyword \u2013 \u2018passport\u2019. The first link that turned up was an article published in Medium titled \u2013 \u201cThe Passport \u2014 Concept.\u201d\n\nThe article was penned by an engineer and designer, Siddhant Gupta, who created a concept design for a passport card that resembles a pocket-sized ATM card. \u201cI tried to design the very passport, after wondering just too much. What if, our Passport was a card and not a booklet, which would sit easily inside our wallet and we are not worried if the pages will eventually run out,\u201d wrote Gupta.\n\nHe used his own name and photograph on the design, which is now being circulated on social media as a new soon-to-be-launched smart passport.\n\nViral messages such as these can be easily debunked with a simple reverse image search. One can conversely search for articles in the media that might have reported the news. A lack of reportage is sufficient hint that the message is most likely false.", "lang": "en"}
