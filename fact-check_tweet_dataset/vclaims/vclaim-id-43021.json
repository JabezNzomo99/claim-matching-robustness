It also claims onions can have harmful effects, such as a cut onion becoming \u201chighly poisonous\u201d if left overnight and that dogs should never be fed onions because their stomachs cannot metabolise them.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 3,800 times, seen by more than 190,000 people in three months and has attracted more than 800 reactions.\n\nRelating the story of the supposed flu-surviving farmer, the post tells a story that, when a doctor examined the onions left by the farmer\u2019s wife, \u201che did find the flu virus in the onion\u201d. \u201cIt obviously absorbed the bacteria, therefore, keeping the family healthy\u201d, the post concludes.\n\nThe post interchanges the terms \u201cvirus\u201d and \u201cbacteria\u201d but, as stated on the Australian government\u2019s healthdirect.gov.au website, viruses and bacteria are two different things. While they both cause \u201cmild to serious infections\u201d, a bacterium is a single complex cell which can survive on its own inside or outside the body while a virus is not a cell and needs a host in order to multiply.\n\nDr Emma Beckett, a molecular nutritionist at the University of Newcastle, told AAP FactCheck in an email response that onions do not absorb bacteria or viruses from the air to protect humans.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence to back up this claim,\u201d Dr Beckett said.\n\n\u201cStop and think about how dangerous onions would be to eat if that happened.\u201d\n\nThe post also claimed an onion would turn black if left next to someone who was sick but Dr Beckett told AAP FactCheck that an onion left anywhere long enough will turn black.\n\n\u201cAfter any plant food has been picked it eventually runs out of sources of energy and the cells start to break down, when that happens bacteria will grow and it will rot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut leaving it near a sick person won\u2019t change the rate at which this happens.\u201d\n\nThe post goes on to claim that onions have \u201cpowerful antibacterial, antiseptic properties\u201d.\n\nDr Beckett said part of this claim is correct in that onions are \u201cslightly acidic\u201d, meaning they will \u201cinhibit the growth of some bacteria, and the sulphur compounds in them have some antibacterial properties\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut these effects would be from juicing or otherwise extracting these elements and using them in medicines or as concentrates, and they still wouldn\u2019t be as powerful as other antibiotics or cleaning products,\u201d she told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get a benefit through eating them or having onions sitting near you.\u201d\n\nClaims about onions being able to absorb viruses and bacteria from the air have been debunked in the past by fact checkers Hoax Slayer, Snopes, who traced the earliest instance of the practice back to 1900, and Canada\u2019s McGill University.\n\nThe second part of the post, under the headline \u201cLEFT OVER ONIONS ARE POISONOUS\u201d, purports to tell about a tour of a mayonnaise factory where the post\u2019s author was told by the tour guide that leftover onions could become poisonous.\n\nThe post claims \u201conions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions\u201d and that a sliced onion is \u201cnot even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag\u201d in the fridge because it is \u201calready contaminated\u201d by having been cut open and left out.\n\nAAP FactCheck has previously debunked the claim that onions are a bacteria magnet and would not be safe to consume even if it was placed in an airtight container and stored in the fridge.\n\nIn that check, Simone Austin, a dietician and spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, told AAP FactCheck she had not seen any research to support such a claim and that onions contain very little protein.\n\n\u201cFoods that are going to develop bacteria are often due to protein in the food,\u201d Ms Austin said.\n\nOnce chopped, Ms Austin advised onions should be stored correctly in a container so no moisture can cause mould issues.\n\nOnions Australia, the representative body of the industry, states that if you only use part of the onion, it can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to four days.\n\nThe post ends with the claim that dogs \u201cshould never eat onions\u201d because \u201ctheir stomachs cannot metabolize onions\u201d.\n\nKasra Ahmadi, a poisons specialist from the Australian Animal Poisons Centre, told AAP FactCheck in an email onions contain compounds called disulfides and thiosulphates which can be toxic to cats and dogs if ingested.\n\nMr Ahmadi said disulfides and thiosulfates \u201care metabolised by compounds that then cause oxidative damage to red blood cells resulting in anaemia\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe severity can range from minor gastrointestinal effects to a potentially serious, life-threatening anaemia which can result in lack of oxygen to tissues,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Mr Ahmadi, toxicosis is dependent on the amount ingested and the weight of the dog, with the risk and severity of toxicosis increasing with the amount ingested.\n\n\u201cPoisoning has occurred from the ingestion of whole raw onions but also from chopped, cooked and dehydrated onions as well as products containing onion powder,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Anne Fawcett, a veterinarian and lecturer at the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck in an email onions contain toxic components that can damage red blood cells, leading to anaemia in a range of species including dogs and cats.\n\n\u201cAs onions \u2026 are potentially toxic to dogs (and cats), it is good practice to avoid feeding onions \u2026 to companion animals altogether,\u201d she said.\n\nIn response to the claim that dogs\u2019 stomach cannot metabolise onions, Dr Fawcett said: \u201cthe canine stomach can metabolise onions, that isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is one of toxicity.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to contain a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information. Onions cannot absorb bacteria or viruses from the air and do not turn black from absorbing \u201cgerms\u201d, according to nutritionist Dr Emma Beckett. Onions do have antibacterial properties through being slightly acidic but those properties are present only if onion extracts are concentrated. The claim that onions are a \u201chuge magnet for bacteria\u201d is also false. Dietitian Simone Austin said foods prone to developing bacteria are often high in protein and onions have very little. It is correct that feeding onions to dogs should be avoided, with veterinarian Dr Anne Fawcett advising against feeding onions to companion animals, including dogs. Dr Fawcett said dogs\u2019 stomachs can metabolise onions but toxic compounds can affect the animals. Partly False \u2013 The claims of the content are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
