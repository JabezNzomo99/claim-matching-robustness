John McCain (R-Ariz.) supported a trade of five Taliban fighters for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl back in February, only to turn around and denounce it once the deal was made. McCain may have thought he left himself an out when he said his support was dependent on the details. But the most important detail \u2014 the identity of the prisoners \u2014 was known at the time he indicated his support. McCain earned an upside-down Pinocchio, constituting a flip-flop.\n\n2: How many people would be \u2018out of work\u2019 if USPS eliminates Saturday delivery?\n\nThis column examined claims from Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.)and the National Association of Letter Carriers that 80,000 postal workers would find themselves out of work if Saturday delivery was eliminated. But it\u2019s an inflated number \u2014 the equivalent of 25,000 full-time jobs, which the U.S. Postal service says can be accomplished through attrition, not layoffs. This claim merited Three Pinocchios.\n\n3: The letter that supposedly led to the crash of Lois Lerner\u2019s hard drive\n\nRep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) earned Three Pinocchios for suggesting that a letter sent to the IRS by the House Ways and Means Committee was somehow related to the crash of former IRS official Lois Lerner\u2019s hard drive. The causal connection to Lerner\u2019s hard drive was far too tenuous for Roskam to make such claims, given that the letter did not discuss the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\n4: An \u2018eyeball to eyeball\u2019 moment that never happened\n\nNew York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman erred badly when he repeated a debunked myth in the opening of his recent column. He compounded the error by refusing to issue a correction \u2014 even though his newspaper had previously reported that primary source documents proved Soviet ships never came within \u201ca few miles\u201d of the U.S. quarantine line during the Cuban missile crisis. So he earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n5: GOP lawmakers rush to cite study to discredit new EPA rule, but study assumed EPA rule would be tougher\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers earned Four Pinocchios for quickly citing a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report on the Obama administration\u2019s plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants by up to 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. It turned out the report assumed the rule would be tougher \u2014 and thus the numbers cited were overblown.\n\nThis column did not quite make it into the top five, but readers who missed it might be interested in learning more about the profusion of fact-checking Web sites that have sprouted up around the world. The column includes many clips of the impressive work of these journalists.", "lang": "en"}
