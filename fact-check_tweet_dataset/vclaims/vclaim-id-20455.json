Facebook users flagged one of the posts, published on DailyInsiderNews.com, as potentially fake news.\n\nDaily Insider News, June 10: Today [the Supreme Court] came out with a major decision about the illegal aliens, ruling that they do not, in effect, possess the right to sue anyone in case they feel abused or mistreated. President Trump wins this decision by a simple 5-4 majority voting [sic] along partisan lines. According to the The Politcal [sic] Tribune, the right-leaning Court one more time showed the United States that those illegal immigrants are first and foremost, illegal, hence should not have the same rights as natural born, or naturalized U.S. citizens. That implies if somebody\u2019s arrested, and appears to be illegal, he does not have the right to a federal nor a private attorney, nor to a speedy trial in America.\n\nDaily Insider News attributed the story to the Political Tribune, which picked it up from Conservative Nation, which sourced it to USA Politics Today.\n\nIt\u2019s bogus. None of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings this term support the story\u2019s claims. Many of the websites that ran the story are repeat fake news offenders.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously debunked posts on USAPoliticsToday.com, ConsNation.com and WashingtonFeed.com, to name a few. And FreedomCrossroads.us, which also posted the story, is a satirical website. Its \u201cabout us\u201d page says, \u201cFreedom Crossroads uses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here.\u201d\n\nSome believed the made-up story, but others saw through it. One commenter on liberty-courier.com \u2014 which ran the story under the headline \u201cBREAKING: Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals! \u2014 wrote: \u201cNotice that there is no case cited, a dead giveaway that the story is fake. When have you ever seen a legitimate story on a SCOTUS ruling that doesn\u2019t name the case? Or at least touch on the points argued? The headline calls it a reversal. Reversal of what? We aren\u2019t told. No sources are cited.\u201d All good points that we have made in \u201cHow to Spot Fake News.\u201d\n\nA visitor on scout.com posted the fake story on the Ohio State University sports page and was challenged by another reader to produce evidence. That \u201cevidence\u201d turned out to be a Feb. 21 NPR article that said the Supreme Court will rule \u2014 not has ruled \u2014 on whether Mexican nationals have the right to sue a U.S. border agent who shot and killed an unarmed 15-year-old Mexican boy on Mexico\u2019s side of the U.S. border fence.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court still hasn\u2019t issued a ruling. On June 26, the Supreme Court sent the case back to an appeals court, which made a mistake in its earlier decision, the high court ruled.\n\nImmigrants in the U.S. illegally do have the right to file lawsuits if they feel they\u2019ve been mistreated, legal experts told us.\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Sarah Paoletti, a practice professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Transnational Legal Clinic, wrote, \u201cAll immigrants, regardless of their legal status within the country, are entitled to equal access to the courts and the right to petition before the courts if their rights have been violated or are being threatened in any way. U.S. federal and state law does not grant the right to sue or the right to defend oneself in court based on citizenship status.\u201d\n\nIn Zadvydas v. Davis, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his 2001 majority opinion that \u201conce an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all \u2018persons\u2019 within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nWarren, Alexander. \u201cBREAKING: Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals!\u201d Liberty-courier.com. 3 May 2017.\n\n\u201cSupreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals!\u201d Consnation.com. 2 May 2017.\n\nStrouse, Aaron. \u201cBREAKING: Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump An AMAZING Present And A Win Over Illegal Aliens.\u201d ThePoliticalTribune.com. 10 Jun 2017.\n\nD.K. \u201cSupreme Court Ruling Is Another Win For Trump.\u201d Maganewsblog.com.
