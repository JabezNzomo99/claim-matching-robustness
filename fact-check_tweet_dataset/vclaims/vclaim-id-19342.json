The claims are false; the footage shows Algerian football fans.\n\nThis 28-second video, posted to Facebook on July 21, 2019 and shared more than 27,000 times, shows a packed stadium full of excited people.\n\nThe caption says in part: \u201cWhat a Crowd in USA....! just for see to Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video has been shared in this Facebook post with an Urdu caption. Translated, it reads: \u201cImran Khan has not yet reached the rally spot and this is the state of rally spot in America. May Allah keep Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan safe. Amen.\u201d\n\nThe same video was shared on Twitter here with the caption: \u201cUSA right now @ImranKhanPTI #PMIKInUSA.\u201d\n\nHere is the screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe tweet was liked by more than 9,500 people and retweeted by more than 2,400 users.\n\nThis post from the official Facebook page of Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehrek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party shows that Khan did speak in Washington on July 21, 2019.\n\nBut Khan\u2019s rally was held at Washington\u2019s Capital One Arena, according to the PTI Facebook page. The arena is an indoor facility, while the stadium shown in the misleading Facebook posts and Twitter videos is an open air facility.\n\nHere is a comparison of screenshots from Khan\u2019s Washington speech (L) and the misleading tweet (R):\n\nThe video has circulated online prior to Khan\u2019s speech.\n\nIt was posted here on Twitter on July 20, 2019, by a verified account called @GMS__Football with a caption describing it as footage from a stadium in Algeria, where football fans were watching a broadcast of the Africa Cup of Nations final.\n\nThat match was played between Algeria and Senegal in Cairo July 19, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe tweet\u2019s caption reads: \u201cThis is how Algerian fans celebrated their African Cup of Nations win last night. The final was played in Cairo, Egypt. This stadium is in Algiers, Algeria. Incredible.\n\nThe video was originally published on Twitter by Maher Mezahi with an accompanying caption that said it was shot at Stade 5 Juillet in Algiers.\n\nMezhai is an Algerian journalist covering football in North Africa, according to his profile.\n\nMezahi told AFP via direct message that the video was shot by his friend.\n\nA YouTube video by Ruptly gives another view of the stadium during the Africa Cup final. Details from the stadium in that video match the footage published by Mezahi.\n\nHere are comparison screenshots of the Ruptly video (L) and the video tweeted by Mezahi (R):", "lang": "en"}
