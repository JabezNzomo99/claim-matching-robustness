On 8 July 2017, for instance, the \u201cHistorical Pics\u201d Twitter account shared the image along with the caption \u201cMuhammad Ali showing off his wealth, 1963\u201d:\n\nThis image has also been shared with similar claims, such as \u201cMuhammad Ali with his winnings in 1964\u201c, \u201cMuhammad Ali with his winnings in 1974\u201c, and \u201cMuhammad Ali showing off his money\u201c.\n\nThe photograph was originally taken for the cover of Sports Illustrated in February 1964. In the cover story, titled \u201cMy $1,000,000 Getaway,\u201d Ali, who was going by the name Cassius Clay at the time, wrote that he was looking at \u201c$1 million in cold cash\u201d in the photograph:\n\nIf I were like a lot of guys\u2014a lot of heavyweight boxers, I mean\u2014I\u2019ll bet you a dozen doughnuts you wouldn\u2019t be reading this story right now. If you wonder what the difference between them and me is, I\u2019ll break the news: you never heard of them. I\u2019m not saying they are not good boxers. Most of them\u2014people like Doug Jones and Ernie Terrell\u2014can fight almost as good as I can. I\u2019m just saying you never heard of them. And the reason for that is because they cannot throw the jive. Cassius Clay is a boxer who can throw the jive better than anybody you will probably ever meet anywhere. And right there is why I will meet Sonny Liston for the heavyweight championship of the world next week in Miami Beach. And jive is the reason also why they took my picture looking at $1 million in cold cash [see cover]. That\u2019s how much money my fists and my mouth will have earned by the time my fight with Liston is over. Think about that. A southern colored boy has made $1 million just as he turns 22. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bragging to say I\u2019m something a little special.\n\nAlthough the image was clearly staged, the money is likely real. However, we are doubtful that it actually belonged to the famous boxer, for two reasons: Clay wrote in the article accompanying the photograph that he \u201cwill have earned\u201d $1 million, not that he already had earned it. Also, a man can be seen on the opposite side of the vault. This is most likely a bank manager keeping on eye on the cash.\n\nThe Guardian identified this person as a \u201csecurity guard\u201d when they published a different photograph of Ali in the bank vault:\n\nThe version of this photograph which made the cover of Sports Illustrated was shot by Richard Meek. But I prefer this picture taken shortly beforehand by Ali\u2019s friend Howard Bingham. It\u2019s just a little more fun. And I like how the security guard is there in the background keeping tabs.\n\nAlthough Cassius Clay did make a fortune early on in his boxing career and went on to earn $1 million and more and gain worldwide fame, and although the picture likely shows real cash inside of a bank vault, this photograph doesn\u2019t show the boxer\u2019s specific earnings at any time.", "lang": "en"}
