Kamala Harris said, \u201cAfter we impeach, we round up the Trump supporters.\u201d\n\nHarris never made this statement. It comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nThe image, which has been shared on pro-Trump Facebook pages, seemingly shows two screen grabs from an unidentified news article. One appears to be a headline directly attributing the quote to Harris, and the other is a longer statement, also presumably from her:\n\nAnd once he\u2019s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we\u2019ll be coming for you next. You will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation. For it is you who have betrayed us.\n\nWhile Harris has publicly stated that she supports Congress taking steps to impeach President Donald Trump, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Harris ever made the two statements attributed to her in the Facebook post. An internet search revealed no credible sources linking them to her.\n\nThe screen grabs in the image actually come from an article on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
