But Pepsi says its own flavourings are not developed this way.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-15731", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/pepsi-foetal-flavouring/", "vclaim": "A post on Facebook claims that Pepsi uses a flavouring made from the cells of aborted babies.\n\nThe claim is inaccurate. It\u2019s a misunderstanding to say that flavouring is \u201cmade of\u201d human cells. PepsiCo have said they do not conduct or fund any research that uses tissue or cell lines derived from human embryo or foetal cells, and that the flavourings in question are not developed in this way.\n\nThe claim centres on something called \u201cHEK-293\u201d\n\nHEK-293 is the name given to a specific line of cells used in various scientific applications.\n\nIt is not in itself a flavouring (as the post suggests), but one of its applications is to help mimic taste-receptor cells in the development of new flavourings.\n\nThe original cells were taken from the kidney of an aborted baby in 1973. HEK 293 cells used nowadays are clones of those original cells, but are not themselves the cells of aborted babies.\n\nWhy do people think Pepsi\u2019s flavourings are developed using HEK 293?\n\nIn 2010 PepsiCo entered into a contract with biotech firm Senomyx related to \u201cSenomyx\u2019s sweet-taste technology.\u201d\n\nSenomyx have patents appearing to relate to using HEK 293 cells for developing flavourings. And in 2014 a Senomyx-developed sweetener called Sweetmyx was approved for use by Pepsi.\n\nSo some people assumed that PepsiCo flavourings were developed using these HEK 293 cells.\n\nHowever PepsiCo said in 2012:\n\n\u201cPepsiCo does not conduct or fund research \u2013 including research performed by third parties \u2013 that utilizes any human tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or fetuses.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Senomyx does not use HEK cells or any other tissues or cell lines derived from human embryos or fetuses for research performed on behalf of PepsiCo.\u201d\n\nThey confirmed to us this was still the case.", "lang": "en"}
