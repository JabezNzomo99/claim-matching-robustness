The photos show houses and bridge pillars painted with the images of Hindu deities. PM Modi is scheduled to visit Ayodhya on \u20185 August 2020\u2019 to perform \u2018Bhoomi Pujan\u2019 for the Ram temple. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photos of houses and bridge pillars in Ayodhya painted with images of Hindu deities as part of the preparations for Ram temple\u2019s \u2018Bhoomi Pujan\u2019 event. Fact: The photos with Hindu deities painted over the houses and bridge pillars are of Prayagraj (Allahabad), not Ayodhya. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the photos to reverse image search technique, reports were found which confirmed that the photos are of houses and bridge pillars in Prayagraj city painted with images of Hindu deities.\n\nThe photo can be seen in an article of \u2018Outlook\u2019. In the description of the photo, it was mentioned that the photo is of houses in Prayagraj painted with Hindu deities.\n\nSurroundings seen in the photo can be seen in a news video of NDTV that reported about houses in Prayagraj painted with pictures Hindu deities. A similar photo can also be seen in a tweet of \u2018ANI UP\u2019.\n\nThe photo can be seen in a tweet of \u2018ANI UP\u2019 that had information about complaints being registered in Prayagraj for painting houses in a street in saffron without the owner\u2019s consent.\n\nThe photo can be seen on the website of \u2018Getty Images\u2019 with the description that the photo shows pillars of Shastri bridge in Allahabad (Prayagraj) painted as part of \u2018Paint My City\u2019 project for the Kumbh Mela festival.\n\nTo sum it up, photos of houses and bridge pillars painted with images of Hindu deities in Prayagraj city are falsely shared as those from Ayodhya.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
