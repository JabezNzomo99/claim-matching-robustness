This quote is missing context, as Fauci said that in-person voting could be done safely only if polling places enforce mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines and voters follow these guidelines.\n\nExamples of posts making this claim can be found\n\nhere , here , here . The accompanying text reads, \u201cThe media loved repeating everything Fauci said until he said, \u2018There is no reason why we can\u2019t vote in person.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe quote included in the posts comes from ABC News\u2019 Deborah Roberts interview with the top U.S. infectious diseases expert during a National Geographic Event on Aug. 13 ( here ). Asked by Roberts whether in-person voting is safe, Fauci says the following that it can be \u201cif carefully done according to the guidelines.\u201d He likened the risk posed by heading to the polls to the risk of going to the grocery store during the pandemic, saying, \u201cIf you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don\u2019t have a crowded situation, there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d\n\nHe added that mail-in voting, \u201cdone for years in many places,\u201d remains an option for those who are \u201ccompromised, physically or otherwise\u201d or those who simply \u201cdon\u2019t want to take the chance.\u201d\n\nIn saying \u201cthere\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to vote in person or otherwise,\u201d Dr. Fauci specified that doing so safely would require adhering to certain safety protocols. In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines for election polling locations and voters, available here .\n\nThe posts also claim \u201cthe media\u201d suddenly did not report on this statement by Dr Fauci, but instances can be seen here, here, here.\n\nOn August 14, Dr Fauci told the Washington post he would \u201clikely vote in person,\u201d expressing his faith in polling stations observing social distancing measures. He added that those with health concerns over voting in person should be allowed to vote by mail (here).\n\nThe claims appear to undermine the need for vote-by-mail access ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Advocates of mail-in voting, which is expected to nearly double due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see it as a safe and secure way to participate in the Democratic process while protecting voters and poll workers from infection ( here ). Despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claims to the contrary, election experts see little reason to expect a consequent increase in ballot interference and voter fraud ( here , here ).\n\nMissing context. Fauci said that there is \u201cno reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to vote in person\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic as long as polling place workers and voters adhere to safety guidelines and recommendations.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
