We looked into a portion of the statement for our debate roundup and determined that the claim lacked context, although the data supported his claim about Democrat-led cities. There was more to explore here, so we decided to dig further. How accurate is Paul\u2019s claim?\n\nThe first half of Paul\u2019s claim comes from a Brookings Institution study on income inequality in cities. Researchers measured inequality using census data and applying the \u201c95/20 ratio,\u201d which is the income of households in the 95th percentile divided by the income of households at the 20th percentile. The higher the ratio, the greater the inequality.\n\nEight of the 10 cities with the most inequality have Democratic mayors (six of the eight are non-partisan offices). Miami has a Republican mayor, and the Minneapolis mayor in 2012 and 2013 was a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Among the cities with the least inequality, six are led by Republicans (Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Colorado Springs, Mesa, Arlington, Virginia Beach). Raleigh\u2019s mayor is unaffiliated with a party. Columbus, Las Vegas and Nashville are led by Democrats and the latter two are non-partisan offices.\n\nIndeed, there are other factors that the cities at either end of the spectrum have in common with each other than their mayors\u2019 political parties. The most unequal cities also are urban cities contained within a small geographic boundary, with bigger, yet more concentrated populations. Many of the unequal cities have concentrations of high-paying jobs in technology and financial or professional services, noted Alan Berube, the study\u2019s author and senior fellow and deputy director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.\n\n\u201cThe lower you get in the U.S. system, the less the political affiliation [of the leader] really matters,\u201d Berube said. Most mayors, regardless of their party, care about the economic development of their city, want to improve residents\u2019 incomes and invest in low-income neighborhoods. Plus, structural economic policies set at the federal level have more to do with income inequality than local policies, Berube said.\n\nThe cities with the most equal income distributions mainly are geographically big cities in the South and West, with large swaths of incorporated suburban territory, the authors wrote. They are not home to concentrations of lucrative industries. These cities could agree to include a new subdivision or annex unincorporated area \u2014 therefore, expanding city boundaries to accommodate more middle-income, suburban communities.\n\nFor the second part of Paul\u2019s statement, his campaign pointed to the Gini index of each state from 2014 Census data. The Gini index is the most common measure of income inequality that scores states between zero (everyone earns the exact same amount) and one (one person earns all the income).\n\nThe campaign noted that the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut had the highest Gini index (therefore the most inequality). Of course, D.C. does not have a governor, but it does have a Democratic Party-majority government body and Democratic mayor. The governors of New York and Connecticut are Democrats. The three lowest were Alaska, Wyoming and Utah \u2014 all with Republican governors.\n\nSo Paul\u2019s claim appears to check out. But, as our friends at FactCheck.org found, the top 10 and bottom 10 states show a much less clear divide. We excluded the District of Columbia, and looked at the 10 states with the highest Gini index. The governor party control was evenly split five and five. Among the states with the lowest Gini index, three of 10 states were led by Democratic governors. See this chart below, which we compiled using 2014 Census data and 2014 state leadership composition data from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nRolf Pendall, director of the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said rising income inequality mainly has been driven by rapid growth of incomes among top earners. High-inequality states have economies that are oriented toward technology, finance, law and other industries where the United States holds significant international advantages, and whose employees earn significantly more than similarly qualified people in other locations, he said.\n\n\u201cThese activities thrive most in metro areas that have high densities of jobs and populations. These very same metro areas also tend to have high numbers of African Americans because of historic domestic migration patterns and high proportions of foreign-born residents who have been drawn in the past three decades to these metro areas by thriving economies,\u201d Pendall said.\n\nAlaska and Wyoming, the states with the most equal income distribution, are more reliant on resource extraction, Pendall noted. These jobs \u201cproduced gains in middle-income jobs during the days of high international energy prices but not as many jobs at the top of the income distribution.\u201d Utah also is mineral dependent, but its population is relatively young \u2014 meaning they generally earn less. The proportions of African Americans and Latinos \u2014 who are more likely to vote Democrat \u2014 are lower in these three states than in the high-inequality states.\n\nPaul is correct that the cities and states with the highest income inequality are led by Democrats. But this is a misleading claim. In many of the cities on both ends of the scale, the mayoral offices are non-partisan. The cities with the most inequality tend to have bigger, urban populations that have more range in income distribution and an electorate that skews Democratic. Paul\u2019s data on Democrat-led states are cherry-picked; his campaign sent three states on both ends of the scale, but expanding that grouping just slightly shows the governors\u2019 party affiliations are more mixed than they first seem.", "lang": "en"}
