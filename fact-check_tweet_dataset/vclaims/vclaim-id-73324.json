All are quite tame as they are groomed for the breeding program so when they have cubs, they can be monitored closely... I was granted special permission to spend my nights with the three because I had watched them grow up and built up a relationship with them during past volunteering.\u201d\n\nCheetah Experience is a \u201cregistered non-profit endangered species breeding centre in Bloemfontein, South Africa\u201d, according to information on its website.\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the YouTube video (R):", "lang": "en"}
