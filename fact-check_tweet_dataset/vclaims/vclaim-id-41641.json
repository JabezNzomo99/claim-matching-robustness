Please register your reason for travel by calling 1300 1MY GOV (+61 1300 169 468) within 15 minutes of receiving this SMS (10:12am AEST Monday 27 April 2020). Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cSo this is the real reason they want the corona app (sic) out to control us.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck found eight examples of the image posted to Facebook, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here. In total the posts have been viewed over 250,000 times and received more than 1100 shares and 500 interactions.\n\nAustralia\u2019s states and territories will consider easing COVID-19 restrictions next month after a drop in the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Amid the good news, an image claiming to be from the federal government\u2019s new COVIDsafe app is being widely shared on Facebook.\n\nThe COVIDsafe app is designed to help health officials identify people who have come into contact with somebody infected with COVID-19, according to the app\u2019s website. Since its launch on April 26 the voluntary app has been downloaded almost three million times as of April 29, with the government expecting more than half the population to eventually become users.\n\nThe April 27 post purports to show a text message linked to or generated by the COVIDsafe app, with the image reading: \u201cThe COVIDsafe App has detected you are now +20km from your nominated home address. Please register your reason for travel by calling 1300 1MY GOV (+61 1300 169 468) within 15 minutes of receiving this SMS (10:12am AEST Monday 27 April 2020). Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health, who are responsible for maintaining the app, told AAP FactCheck in an email the Facebook post is \u201ca hoax message\u201d and that it was \u201cabhorrent scammers would attempt to use the COVIDSafe app, a public health tool, to try and catch out Australians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe COVIDsafe app doesn\u2019t have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people\u2019s phones that have downloaded the app and cannot monitor a person\u2019s location at any time,\u201d a department spokesperson said.\n\nExperts at the University of Sydney have also stated the app cannot track location.\n\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) told AAP FactCheck in an email they are investigating the message. \u201cThe AFP is aware of an alleged hoax involving the COVIDSafe app and is currently investigating the matter,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nPoliticians and doctors have come out in support of the app and encouraged Australians to use it so the federal government can wind back restrictions on movement. During an April 26 press conference the Australian chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said he would be using the app. \u201cNo Australian should have any concerns about downloading this app\u201d he said.\n\nNot all have been in support of the app, with some federal politicians and privacy groups expressing concern.\n\nOne IT expert has stated that the app delivered on the government\u2019s promises about data security, while another has pointed to potential, albeit low-likelihood vulnerabilities via bluetooth connection. The Department of Health told AAP FactCheck the app doesn\u2019t register a person\u2019s home address and doesn\u2019t share information unless authorised by the user. Only state and territory health officials are involved in using the app for contact tracing, a department spokesperson said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. A federal Department of Health spoksperson and experts at the University of Sydney have said the COVIDsafe app does not trace the location of a user. The post has been described by the Department of Health as a hoax and the Australian Federal Police said they are investigating the message.
