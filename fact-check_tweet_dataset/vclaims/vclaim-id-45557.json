As of June 1, Delhi has reported 19844 cases of COVID-19 out of which 10893 are active cases. 473 people have lost their lives to COVID-19. In light of this, a video is being circulated online which shows a COVID-19 ward in a hospital. The viral posts claim that the hospital is in Delhi.\n\n\"This is the condition of Delhi where due to the large number of dead bodies, some have not been cremated from the last five days. There are 106 dead bodies in Lok Nayak hospital itself. 80 in mortuary and 26 on the ground (Translated to English),\" reads the caption of one such post.\n\n The video has been viewed over 14000 views. The video was extensively shared on Twitter and Facebook. A person in the video can be heard complaining about the negligence of the hospital. She also adds that there is a lack of beds for the patients.\n\nDead bodies are piling up at a hospital in Delhi. The claim is misleading. The video was shot in a hospital located in Mumbai. The woman talking in the video mentions KEM hospital. KEM here refers to King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. A keyword search based on the claims led to a news report by Jansatta published on May 27. The report cites the video and says that there is over-crowding in the COVID-19 wards in the hospital. It also states that dead bodies are being kept with the patients.\n\nFurther, Sachin Sawant, Congress spokesperson for Maharashtra quote-tweeted Kadam. Sawant posted a clarification Issued by BMC, the civic body in Mumbai. BMC in their clarification stated that the video was shot during a sudden strike called by the staff member of KEM. The civic body stated that this strike was the reason behind the shortage of medical staff and unhygienic conditions inside hospital wards.\n\nAccording to a report by Indian Express published on May 26, Class III and IV employees of the KEM hospital in Mumbai staged a protest on May 26 after one of their colleagues died, and his body was kept in the mortuary for two days. The protestors claimed that they were working in harsh conditions.\n\n \"We are working in poor conditions, and for longer hours. Ideally, we should be quarantined and treated if we have symptoms, but that is not happening,\" Pradeep Narkar, a representative in the union was quoted as saying. Therefore, the video was not shot in a hospital located in Delhi, but in KEM, Mumbai, during a staff protest on May 26.
