This doesn\u2019t mean scrapping all immigration controls.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-31349", "url": "https://fullfact.org/immigration/labour-immigration-policy/", "vclaim": "Following the conclusion of the Labour Party conference on Wednesday, the front page of the Telegraph\u2019s Thursday edition reported that the party had agreed a policy to remove all controls on immigration.\n\nThis is incorrect, as the Labour party pointed out.\n\nAt its annual conference, Labour passed a broad proposal for its future migration policy.\n\nThe motion said Labour will include manifesto pledges to, among other things, \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d, \u201cclose all detention centres\u201d and to \u201creject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants\u2019 utility to business, and number caps/targets.\u201d The full text of the proposal is available here.\n\nAfterwards, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was quoted by the Guardian as saying: \u201cBe assured, our plans for government include these provisions and a lot more,\u201d indicating that the proposal would be adopted as party policy.\n\nThe provisions laid out in the motion do seem to represent significant reductions in the barriers to immigrants coming to the UK and settling here. However claiming these proposals amount to the removal of \u201call controls on immigration\u201d is exaggeration.\n\nCurrently, EU citizens have the have the right to live and work in the UK (as an EU member state), with some exceptions. Labour\u2019s motion plans to maintain this but does not specify how far it would extend rights of free movement (for example whether it would be applied to citizens of any other countries).\n\nNon-EU citizens are subject to more controls and enforcement, some of which the conference motion wants to relax, but it\u2019s far from clear at this stage how far the party would want those changes to go. The motion doesn\u2019t rule out all possible controls on migration\u2014only certain types of immigration system.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that a motion passing conference is a fairly early stage of the policy development cycle. The motion will now be fleshed out by the party.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible this could extend to scrapping all controls on immigration, claiming this is what was voted for yesterday is disingenuous.\n\nThe Telegraph\u2019s article online didn\u2019t contain the word \u201call\u201d in the headline and copy. The headline online reads : \u201cLabour to scrap controls on immigration and hand foreign nationals the right to vote.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
