Turn! Turn!\u201d) had undergone more personnel changes than the manager\u2019s office at Yankee Stadium under George Steinbrenner. Gene Clark quit the group in 1966; David Crosby was fired in 1967 and drummer Michael Clarke also took his leave shortly afterwards; Gene Clark then rejoined the band, only to quit a second time three weeks later, reducing the Byrds to a duo. Two new musicians, Kevin Kelley and Gram Parsons, were recruited in 1968 to fill the gap created by the departures of Crosby and Clarke, but Parsons resigned from the Byrds less than five months later and was replaced with Clarence White, while Kelley hung on only a few months longer before being sacked in favor of Gene Parsons. That newly-revamped lasted only a month before Chris Hillman opted out as well, leaving Roger McGuinn as the sole remaining original Byrd. Hillman\u2019s replacement, John York, managed to serve out most of 1969 before he too was given his walking papers.\n\nWhen veteran musician Skip Battin was invited to join the Byrds as their bassist in late 1969, Roger McGuinn was optimistic that he had finally assembled a stable for his band. (He was right: this version of the group lasted two and half years, longer than any other incarnation of the Byrds.) Accordingly, McGuinn and his bandmates sought a name for their first album together that would express their faith in the viability of the resurrected Byrds. Suggestions such as \u201cPhoenix\u201d and \u201cthe first Byrds album\u201d were considered, but the double album (half studio tracks and half live recordings) that finally hit record store shelves in bore the odd title of (Untitled):\n\nWhy (Untitled)? Was it a perverse joke? A sign of resignation at being unable to come up with an acceptable title? In fact, the unusual title was an accident, the result of a record company\u2019s mistake.\n\nThe details of how the album came to be called (Untitled) differ slightly depending upon the source, but evidence confirms the accidental origins of the name. As Roger McGuinn explained the title\u2019s origins in an advertisement for the album: \u201cActually it was a mistake. Somebody from Columbia called up our manager and asked him what the title was. He told them it was \u2018as yet untitled\u2019 and so they went ahead and printed that\u201d:\n\nThe Byrds\u2019 producer-manager, Terry Melcher, related a slightly different version of events, claiming that he had written \u2018Untitled\u2019 on the official label copy sheet sent to the record company because the group had not yet settled on a name for the album, and before anyone realized what was happening the albums had been pressed up as (Untitled). (The fact that the name printed on the album sleeves included parentheses makes Melcher\u2019s explanation the more likely one.)\n\nMuch as we like to think that all aspects of artistic efforts are deliberately infused with meaning, sometimes random chance and coincidence have their say as well.
