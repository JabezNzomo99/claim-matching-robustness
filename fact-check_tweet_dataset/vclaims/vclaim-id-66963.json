In the first picture, the whiteboard reads, \u201cJacob Blake is shot by police while resisting arrest,\u201d while the second says, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.\u201d\n\nBlake, a 29-year-old black man, was shot multiple times in the back by police after they attempted to arrest him in Kenosha on Aug. 23, according to BBC News. The shooting, which left Blake paralyzed from the waist down, sparked protests and rioting in Kenosha.\n\nThe inaccurate claim about him spending time in prison for raping a 14-year-old appears to have stemmed from confusion about a third-degree sexual assault charge Blake faces.

Those charges are related to an alleged incident of domestic abuse against an adult in May, according to the criminal complaint filed on July 6.\n\nIn Wisconsin, third-degree sexual assault is a felonious crime that involves having nonconsensual sexual intercourse or other sexual contact with a person. The statute does not specify that such charges relate to the sexual assault of minors. Some iterations of the claim show a screen grab of Rhode Island\u2019s statute for third-degree sexual assault, which includes language about victims being minors and may have led some to erroneously conclude that Blake\u2019s alleged crime involved one.\n\nWisconsin law mandates that all people found guilty of raping a child must register as a sex offender. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find Blake\u2019s name in Wisconsin\u2019s sex offender registry.\n\nBlake\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
