In Georgia, provisional ballots are often cast if someone doesn\u2019t have the proper ID or because the person\u2019s name doesn\u2019t show up on the list of registered voters.\n\nProvisional voting was mandated nationally by the Help America Vote Act, passed in 2002, but is applied in accordance with state laws. For example, in Georgia, a state that has a voter ID law, if the reason a voter has cast a provisional ballot is because he or she didn\u2019t have identification on Election Day, that person has three days to produce an ID, according to state law.\n\nAfter the Nov. 6 election, 1,994 provisional ballots in Fulton County were counted as votes, according to the numbers certified by the county\u2019s Board of Registration and Elections on Nov. 13. Of those, 356 were cast by voters who were in the right precinct, but had an issue with their voting status or ID and were able to resolve it before the three-day deadline, Richard Barron, director of registration and elections for Fulton County, told the board at a Nov. 13 meeting. The other 1,638 were duplicate ballots, which are ballots that were cast by eligible Fulton County voters who had gone to the wrong precinct, Barron said.\n\nBecause the precinct where the ballot was cast must duplicate the ballot and send it to the precinct where the voter is registered, such ballots are called duplicate ballots, explained April Majors, spokeswoman for Fulton County, in an interview with FactCheck.org. Those ballots aren\u2019t rejected; they are re-routed, so the claim that \u201ca vast amount of the provisional ballots submitted in the Democrat stronghold were rejected for being duplicate ballots\u201d is wrong.\n\nThe actual number of ballots that were rejected in Fulton County was 1,555, Barron told the board. Of those, 581 voters were not registered; 972 voters had been in the wrong county (ballots don\u2019t get re-routed if the voter is registered in a different county, Majors said), and two voters had failed to provide proof of citizenship.\n\nThat means that 44 percent of the provisional ballots cast in Fulton County were rejected, which is comparable to statewide averages in recent election years. In 2016, which was a presidential election year, the state of Georgia rejected 55 percent of the provisional ballots that were cast. In 2014, which, like this year, was a midterm election, Georgia rejected 43 percent of the provisional ballots cast.\n\nSo, the claim that \u201cbombshell\u201d numbers show \u201ca vast amount\u201d of provisional ballots were \u201crejected\u201d for being \u201cduplicate[s]\u201d is false.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. House. \u201cH.R. 3295, Help America Vote Act of 2002.\u201d U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
