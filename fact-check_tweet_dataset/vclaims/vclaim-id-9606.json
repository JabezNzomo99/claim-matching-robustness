It starts with written treaties agreed between countries, but also includes custom and practice. All of these can be interpreted differently by different countries and not all countries are signed up to all treaties.\n\nThe UK government has said that killing people in Syria can be lawful under international law. An RAF drone targeted and killed Reyaad Khan, a British national, in Syria in 2015.\n\nThe UK government\u2019s view of international law was set out in a speech by the Attorney General earlier this year.\n\nThe UN Charter, the founding treaty of the United Nations, requires member states to \u201crefrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force\u201d. Article 51 makes an exception for \u201cinherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations\u201d. That\u2019s all in black and white.\n\n\u201cLike many other states\u201d, the Attorney General said, the UK believes that right extends to \u201cself-defence against an \u2018imminent\u2019 armed attack\u201d not just to when a country has already been attacked.\n\nIn warfare, it's generally lawful to target enemy troops. But the UK government takes the view that international law may allow the use of force against individuals who are not members of a conventional foreign army. It says force, which may be lethal force, may be used against these individuals if that's what's needed to defend the UK against an actual or imminent armed attack.\n\nThe UK's view is that it can use force in self-defence against individuals based in a foreign state if that state is unable or unwilling to prevent an actual or imminent armed attack on UK interests. The same would apply if the foreign state does not have effective control of the territory from which the attack might come.\n\nThe Attorney General says \u201ca number of states\u201d agree with the UK on that.\n\nSo those are the arguments you would need to accept to agree with to accept the UK government\u2019s argument about what strikes can be legal in international law.\n\nFinally, you would have to decide whether a particular strike is legal based on the facts of the case. Is it necessary? Is it proportionate? And what counts as an imminent threat?\n\nThe Security Service MI5 says that \u201chundreds of British extremists\u201d have travelled to Syria. Its Director General said in a speech: \u201cA growing proportion of our casework now has some link to Syria, mostly concerning individuals from the UK who have travelled to fight there or who aspire to do so.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
