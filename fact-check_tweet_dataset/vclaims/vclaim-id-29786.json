Fill your news feed with dedications to them, as they were fighting for our country.\u201d\n\nBut they were killed in 2013, and the meme is missing one soldier. A total of six soldiers died in that helicopter crash, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe five featured in the recent Facebook post include:\n\u2022 Chief Warrant Officer 2 Randy L. Billings, who was 34 and came from Heavener, Oklahoma.\n\u2022 Chief Warrant Officer 2 Joshua B. Silverman, who was 35 and came from Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\u2022 Sgt. Peter C. Bohler, who was 29 and came from Willow Spring, North Carolina.\n\u2022 Sgt. 1st Class Omar W. Forde, who was 28 and came from Marietta, Georgia.\n\u2022 Spc. Terry K. D. Gordon, who was 22 and came from Shubuta, Mississippi.\n\u2022 Staff Sgt. Jesse L. Williams, who was 30 and came from Elkhart, Indiana.\n\nThose six soldiers were killed when their Black Hawk helicopter was blasted with an improvised explosive device as it hovered about 79 feet above a ridge line in southern Afghanistan on Dec. 17, 2013, according to an Army report about the crash. The seventh soldier in the helicopter survived.\n\nBetween Oct. 7, 2001, and Jan. 6, 2020, there have been a total of 2,301 military deaths in Afghanistan, according to the most recent figures released by the Department of Defense. The latest military casualty in Afghanistan was on Dec. 23, when Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble, 33, of Washington Township, New Jersey, was killed in combat.\n\nThe meme began circulating as tensions in the Middle East rose after a U.S. strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 2, prompting Iran to threaten \u201csevere revenge\u201d against the United States. Although the information in the meme is outdated by six years, one recent post was shared 30,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
