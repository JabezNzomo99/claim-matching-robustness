Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.\"\n\nThis is the fourth time we\u2019ve weighed in on a statement from Trump about America\u2019s tax rate. The difference tonight is the slightly tempered tone. Instead of declaring the United States as having the highest tax rate, he said we\u2019re one of the highest-taxed countries.\n\nThat\u2019s progress. But it\u2019s still not 100 percent accurate.\n\nBack in May, Trump said, \"We\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world.\"\n\nWe rated that False because, according to the Pew Research Center last year, America is slightly behind the middle of the pack when it comes to the taxed revenue portion of gross domestic product.\n\nRaj Shah, a Republican National Committee spokesman, told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about the corporate tax rate.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t specify that distinction in his speech, though his tax-rate claim was immediately followed by the business-specific line about reducing taxes that will spur growth of new companies and jobs.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked a statement about whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and found it pretty accurate.\n\nOf the most advanced and industrialized nations in the world, America ranks third highest for general top marginal corporate income tax rates with a 39.1 percent tax on corporate profits, exceeded by Chad and the United Arab Emirates. So the United States does have a higher corporate tax rate than most of its industrialized peers.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth remembering that the official tax rates are one thing, while the tax rates corporations actually pay can be substantially less. In practice, U.S. companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exclusions.\n\nTrump teed up his statement by mentioning the tax impact on \"middle-income Americans and businesses,\" which could easily lead listeners to perceive this as a question of overall tax burden, not businesses specifically.\n\nTrump called the United States \"one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.\"\n\nTrump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying it\u2019s \"one of\" the highest taxed nations. If you believe that he meant the corporate tax rate, given the details about companies and jobs that followed the claim, then Trump\u2019s comment is pretty accurate.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t specify that distinction, and a reasonable listener could take away from Trump\u2019s remark that he meant taxes overall, particularly given that he set up the line with a joint reference to middle-income Americans and businesses.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
