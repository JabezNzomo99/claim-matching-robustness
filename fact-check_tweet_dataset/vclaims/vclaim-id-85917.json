He apparently believes that the Affordable Care Act is such a loser that it has resulted in a \u201cnet loss of people with health insurance.\u201d Many readers tweeted us or wrote e-mails asking whether this is indeed the case.\n\nBoehner said about 6 million people received notices that their insurance was canceled. (That number may be a little high \u2014 usually it is estimated at nearly 5 million.) Then he notes that HealthCare.gov reports that 4.2 million have selected a plan. (As Boehner pointed out, it is still unclear how many actually paid for their first premium, but limited state data indicate it\u2019s at least 80 percent.) So 4 million minus 6 million equals a net loss of 2 million.\n\nWe readily concede that there are problems with the data on health-care sign-ups, many of which were first detailed here at The Fact Checker. But Boehner\u2019s math is absurdly simplistic if he is trying to claim that the number of people with health insurance is now lower because of Obamacare.\n\nA large percentage of the people whose old plans were canceled were automatically moved to new plans offered by the same insurance companies. These people may not be happy with their new coverage \u2014 and may have appeared in an ad sponsored by Americans for Prosperity \u2014 but they got a plan without going through HealthCare.gov. (Here\u2019s an example of such a letter, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact.)\n\nOn top of that, the White House ordered an administrative fix last year that, depending on the actions of individual states, allowed as many as 2.3 million people with \u201ccanceled plans\u201d to simply stay on their old plans for at least another year. (In early March, the White House extended that deadline to 2016.) The administration in December also announced a new catastrophic exemption to fill any remaining gaps in coverage \u2014 estimated to affect as many as 500,000 people.\n\nIn other words, almost nobody in that pool of 6 million does not have insurance. If they didn\u2019t, they surely would be featured in an anti-Obamacare ad. But those ads feature people who don\u2019t like their new plans, rather than being left high and dry with no coverage.\n\nThe Fact Checker dug into the more recent reports and found that it was based on a single quarterly figure that was not sustained in later quarters. (That might be why the report was never updated.) However, the overall increase in the percentage of insured young adults suggests a gain of about 2.8 million from the third quarter of 2010 to the first half of 2013. Given quarterly fluctuations, a more conservative approach would be to use the average figure for 2010 as the base; that would reduce the increase to 2.2 million people. That is still substantial.\n\nThe Fact Checker has been critical of the administration\u2019s Medicaid numbers, but there is little doubt that many people are gaining insurance through this route. Through January, the health consulting firm Avalere estimates that at least 2.4 million people got insurance for the first time through the Medicaid expansion. That\u2019s the lowest estimate \u2014 others put it as high as 5.6 million, including people previously eligible but not signed up, through mid-March. But even so, that\u2019s more than enough to demonstrate that no matter how you count it, there has been no net loss in insurance coverage.\n\nNo one knows how big the off-exchange pool is, but it is at least 500,000 people and could be as high as 2 million. For instance, Highmark, an insurance provider based in Pittsburgh, has reported that as many as one-third of its total enrollments are off-exchange. In Pennsylvania, for instance, out of 108,000 enrollees, 74,000 signed up on HealthCare.gov and 34,000 got insurance off-exchange.\n\nThis was not a mere flub by the speaker, as he restated his position when an incredulous reporter asked for clarification. But his assertion flies in the face of the facts. He certainly could claim that enrollment is disappointing and has lagged behind various estimates, but he can\u2019t claim that the law has reduced the number of insured Americans.", "lang": "en"}
