Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nFact: The video was taken at Altare della Patria building in Rome (Itlay), not in London (UK). Also, the tri-colours in the video represents the Italy flag, not the Indian flag. The air show in the video is a demonstration by the aerobatic team of Italian Air Force called \u2018Frecce Tricolori\u2019 (Tricolor Arrows) and it usually takes place on the Republic Day of Italy. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the building shown in the video is Altare della Patria, which is located at Piazza Venezia (Rome) in Italy, not at Trafalgar Square (London) in the UK.\n\nAlso, it was found that the air show in the video is a demonstration by the aerobatic team of Italian Air Force called \u2018Frecce Tricolori\u2019 (Tricolor Arrows) and it is usually organized on the Republic day of Italy. Some more pictures of \u2018Frecce Tricolori\u2019 can be seen here. The three colours (Green, White, Red) in the \u2018Frecce Tricolori\u2019 demonstration represents the Italian flag.\n\nTo sum it up, Italian Air Force air show of Italian flag tri-colours in Rome falsely shared as Indian Independence Day celebrations in London.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
