Hitler died about nine years before Merkel was born, so it is impossible for him to be her father. He killed himself in April 1945, the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe Canadian government in 2018 denied claims that Trudeau is Castro\u2019s son, according to The Associated Press. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife Margaret, was born in December 1971, about nine months after their marriage. Margaret Trudeau did meet Castro, but their first meeting occurred several years after Trudeau\u2019s birth, per The Associated Press.\n\nBush, the wife of former President George H.W. Bush, was born to Marvin and Pauline Pierce in 1925, according to the White House website. Marvin Pierce was the president of publishing firm McCall Corporation, per The New York Times.
