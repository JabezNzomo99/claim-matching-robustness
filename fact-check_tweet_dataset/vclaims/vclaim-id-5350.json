Request \u2013 Kindly share this message with all your friends, relatives and groups \u2013 translated).\n\nThis is one of the latest rumours doing rounds on Whatsapp via the facade of a government website. It claims that the Indian government has launched a scheme to give away free cycles to youngsters. Accessing the \u201cbharat-sarkar.co\u201d link attached to the message opens up a form that mentions the details of the purported government initiative. It says (translated) \u2013 \u201cTo get cycles for free, fill the form below with your name, your school\u2019s name and the state you\u2019re from.\u201d It goes on the add that \u201call cycles will be distributed on 15 August 2018 at your nearest government school.\u201d The website asks for personal details, including father\u2019s name and residential address.\n\nThe same \u201cfree bicycle\u201d advertisement is also propagated on another website of the same name but different domain \u2013 \u201cbharat-sarkar.com\u201d\n\nAlt News found two other websites staging the similar interface but a different government scheme. Websites \u201cpm-yojna.in\u201d and \u201chelmet.pm-yojna.in\u201d claim that the central government is giving away free helmets under its \u201cPradhan Mantri Sadak Surasha Yojana\u201d. Both websites include the Prime Minister\u2019s photograph and forms similar to the \u201cfree bicycle\u201d scheme. To enter the initiative the websites ask for your name, bike registration number and state.\n\nThe web design of these sites is optimised for mobile phone users. Furthermore, an image of the Prime Minister and the state emblem of India are added to make the website look credible and the possibility of getting something for \u201cfree\u201d, takes away users\u2019 hesitance. Those who have been newly introduced to the virtual world and are smitten by the internet, might not delve into its perils.\n\nThe messages of these fake government schemes are also circulating on social media.\n\nThere are various clues that call these websites\u2019 bluff, some more glaring than the rest. Below is the analysis of \u201cbharat-sarkar.co\u201d, however, all other websites echo these same characteristics.\n\nIf one were to scroll down the form, a \u201cterms and conditions\u201d link is visible at the bottom and this alone is enough to bust the scam. Clicking on this link redirects to a page that clearly mentions \u201cthis site is not associated with Indian government or any political party\u201d and \u201cbicycle distribution depends on us\u201d.\n\n2. All government websites either end with \u201cgov.in\u201d or \u201cnic.in\u201d\n\nThe makers of the aforementioned website attempted to make it resemble a government portal, which also explains the name \u201cbharat-sarkar\u201d. However, its URL ends with a \u201c.co\u201d while websites of the Indian government either end with a \u201cgov.in\u201d or \u201cnic.in\u201d.\n\nThe official website of any ministry or government department always ends with the domain \u201cgov.in\u201d. For example \u2013 Ministry of External Affairs (mea.gov.in), Government of Uttarakhand (uk.gov.in), Swachh Bharat (swachhbharatmission.gov.in), Prasar Bharati (prasarbharati.gov.in).\n\nThe website of any organisation affiliated to the Indian government ends with a \u201cnic.in\u201d. Domain name \u2018nic.in\u2019 is owned by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which is the science and technology organisation of the Government of India under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. \u2018Nic.in\u2019 can be allocated only to Indian government entities. For instance, Central Board of Secondary Education (cbse.nic.in), Indian Institute of Mass Communication (iimc.nic.in).\n\nAlt News first searched the IP address of \u201cbharat-sarkar.co\u201d.\n\nWe then located the website\u2019s region of origin and found that it was registered in Singapore, under GoDaddy.com. An Indian government website cannot be registered abroad and is always registered under National Informatics Centre (NIC). The website details of MEA in the image below affirms the same.\n\nGoogle AdSense is an easy method to make quick bucks and one cannot help but notice the ads placed through the length of the forms on all the four websites. The reason for the makers of these shady websites to popularise fake advertisements via Whatsapp is to redirect as many people as possible to their portals. If the traction is high, a number of individuals would click on the Google ads thus, giving the sites more money on cost-per-clicks.\n\nAlt News had, in an earlier article, reported how such websites are created to make money off of deceiving people and collecting their personal data. Last year, a Whatsapp forward claimed that PM Modi is giving free balance. This too redirected users to a form that asked for their name, phone number, mobile service operator and the state of residence. Alt News found how the person behind this scam was operating a host of other such websites to make money.\n\nSuch instances are commonplace on the internet, and Whatsapp is one of the quickest ways to garner an audience. Recently, another fake message was viral on Whatsapp, calling Hindus to vote for Ram Mandir against Babri Masjid. It provided a link at the end that redirected people to a voting form. The one-page form also adorned two Google ads.\n\nThe internet is infested with shady websites and pages/groups on social media that post content of \u201cmass appeal\u201d. We have observed in the past as well, instances of publishing provocative content \u2013 political, communal or sleazy \u2013 to amass countless clicks on a page. However, when such websites resort to faking government schemes and blatantly use the Prime Minister\u2019s photograph for the same, the issue deserves greater attention and the need for law enforcement agencies to pay heed.", "lang": "en"}
