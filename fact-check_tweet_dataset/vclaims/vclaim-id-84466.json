The beheading video was actually shot in Brazil and the victim in this case is 47 year old Orides Telles Da Silveria. He was beheaded using an axe and then the people who beheaded him posed with the severed head as a trophy.\n\nOn Facebook, the first instance of this video that we could find was by an account called \u201c\u0939\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0941 \u091c\u094b\u0936\u0940 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 (Himanshu Joshi Hindu) on May 10th.
