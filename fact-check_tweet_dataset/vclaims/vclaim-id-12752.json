It\u2019s what they voted for. Notice no fires in red states.\u201d The meme originated on a Facebook page called \u201cStop the World, the Deplorables Want Off,\u201d and was shared by users in email chains and across the social media platform. Along with the meme, the Facebook page posted: \u201cJust when I thought his dad was the most heartless person in the Trump family\u2026 How can someone blame victims for their houses getting burned down?\u201d\n\nSome comments on the Facebook meme were critical of Trump Jr., suggesting that some believed the quote to be true. \u201cThe apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree,\u201d one person wrote. Other users flagged the meme as false, which it is.\n\nThe first clue indicating the quote was fabricated is the text superimposed on Trump Jr.\u2019s tie that identified the source of the meme: \u201cFacebook/StopTheWorldTheDeplorablesWantOff.\u201d That Facebook page describes itself as a \u201cmixture of political memes & messages\u201d that creates \u201ca lot of parody posts & those are NOT meant to be taken seriously. Check for \u2018quotation marks.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlso, the meme cites Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on Nov. 12 as the source of the invented quote. But Trump Jr. did not appear that night on the show, which covered topics such as the Florida recount and whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will run again for president in 2020.\n\nContrary to the meme, Trump Jr. on Nov. 9 tweeted his support for setting aside \u201ceven deep political differences\u201d to help all Californians suffering from the devastating effects of the wildfires.\n\nSatirical stories and memes have deceived readers in the past. We\u2019ve debunked multiple stories that originated on satirical websites but then were republished on other websites and platforms without being labeled as satire.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cAbout: \u2018Stop the World, the Deplorables Want Off.\u2019\u201d Facebook. Accessed 13 Nov 2018.\n\nTrump Jr., Donald (@DonaldJTrumpJr). \u201cWell said and well done @RealJamesWoods! We need to be able to set aside even deep political differences more often to do the right thing and be human. Great example for others to hopefully follow.\u201d Twitter. 9 Nov 2018.", "lang": "en"}
