We also found an excerpt from it on Google Books, where it is explicitly mentioned that he was born in 1952.\n\nIn this case, the result of 1952+67 would be 2019.\n\n Hence it is verified that Rishi Kapoor was not born in 1953 but 1952 and the claims in the post are false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
