Gov. David Dewhurst claimed in an Aug. 19, 2013, , he knows how to keep Texas\u2019 job growth going.\n\n\"Soy un hombre de negocios, el \u00fanico official estatal qui\u00e9n es un hombre de negocios,\" he said on the Houston Univision 45 show \"Conexi\u00f3n Texas\" \u2013 \"I am a businessman, the only state official who is a businessman.\"\n\nDewhurst, whose fluency in Spanish to his 1970-74 Central Intelligence Agency posting in Bolivia, phrased the same claim in a tighter way in another part of the interview, saying he is the only state elected official who is a businessman: \"Yo soy el \u00fanico hombre de negocios eligido estatal.\"\n\nCurrently running to keep his job as lieutenant governor, a post he\u2019s held since 2003, Dewhurst makes a similar on his campaign website, saying he\u2019s \"the only businessman elected to statewide office.\" D magazine quoted Dewhurst in a June 23, 2011, , as saying, \"Out of 29 elected state officials, I\u2019m the only traditional businessman.\"\n\nDewhurst a multimillion-dollar fortune as an energy entrepreneur and investor in Houston after his service in the Air Force and CIA.\n\nAccording to Spanish-English and consultation with our colleagues at the Austin American-Statesman\u2019s weekly Spanish newspaper, , the adjective \"estatal\" would translate simply as \"state.\"\n\nBy email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us that a June 29, 2013, quotation in a Dallas Morning News represented what Dewhurst \"typically says in English\": \"I\u2019m the only traditional businessperson elected statewide.\"\n\nIn the \"Conexi\u00f3n\" interview, Considine told us, Dewhurst was referring to Gov. Rick Perry, Attorney General Greg Abbott, Comptroller Susan Combs, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, whose occupations Considine said were, respectively, rancher, lawyer, rancher, retired military and rancher.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state\u2019s office lists 27 , and the Texas Legislature has 31 senators and 150 representatives, who are members of state government and make state law even though they are elected from regions rather than statewide.\n\nWe pulled together information on Texas officials\u2019 occupations from news stories, biographies on state websites and interviews with officeholders\u2019 aides. A full list of sources is at right.\n\nAmong the five executive statewide elected officials Considine named, Staples himself as a \"former rancher and businessman\" on his campaign website. Staples, Patterson and state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, a , are each challenging Dewhurst for the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.\n\nStaples\u2019 campaign manager, Cody McGregor, told us by phone that Staples started and owned a real estate firm from 1986 until 2007, was part owner of a plant nursery and started and ran a cattle-raising operation.\n\nBefore entering public service, Perry farmed cotton and wheat, raised cattle and served in the Air Force, according to news stories from the Austin American-Statesman archives and . Spokespeople told us by email that Abbott is a lawyer and Combs was a lawyer and rancher.\n\nAmong the 27 state officials elected statewide, we spotted an accountant and an investment banker. That group includes the officials above plus the Texas Railroad Commission\u2019s three members, the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s nine justices and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 nine judges.\n\nMembers of those courts are lawyers and judges, as required by state law -- specifically, each must have as a practicing lawyer or judge.\n\nRailroad Commission chairman Barry Smitherman, a candidate for attorney general, was an investment banker and briefly a prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office, according to a June 26, 2013, Texas Tribune . His colleagues are Christi Craddick, described in her on the commission\u2019s website and Statesman stories as an oil and gas and former advisor to her father, then-House Speaker Tom Craddick; and David Porter, an accountant whose says he \"built a successful small business around his CPA practice.\"\n\nAdding in Texas\u2019 two U.S. senators, federal officials elected statewide, would bump the number up to 29, matching Dewhurst\u2019s 2011 statement. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are lawyers.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s official to senators and the House Chief Clerk\u2019s Office of representatives\u2019 biographical data give business as an occupation for dozens of members of the current (83rd) Legislature. Others are listed more specifically as owning companies, restaurants, agencies or firms. Here, too, \"lawyer\" is a common occupation, but there are also engineers, contractors, educators, insurance agents, ranchers and doctors.\n\nDewhurst said he\u2019s \"el \u00fanico official estatal qui\u00e9n es un hombre de negocios,\" which his camp would translate as \"the only statewide elected official who is a businessman.\"\n\nThis claim falls down without going beyond the five executive offices that his spokesman said Dewhurst was referring to. Past that, the claim is incorrect in a commonsensical way, if one accepts, as we do, that legislators are elected state officials as well. Dozens of legislators are in business.\n\nDewhurst isn\u2019t \"\u00fanico\" in this regard. We rate his statement as False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
