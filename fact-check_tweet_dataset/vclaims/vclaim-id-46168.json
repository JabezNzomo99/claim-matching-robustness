The claim is false and was dismissed by the hospital\u2019s owners Netcare, which denies even having a laboratory at the facility in question.\n\nMore than a dozen Facebook posts have published the claim, which begins: \u201cIn our laboratory, we found trace amount of the virus on the skin of fruits and vegetables after 12 hrs. of being touched by another customer who was infected (sic).\u201d\n\nSome of the posts have been archived here and here.\n\nThe claim says that staff at the private Umhlanga Hospital in South Africa\u2019s KwaZulu-Natal province have been warned to avoid salads, or to wait for two days before eating fresh fruit and vegetables. The other suggestion is to disinfect produce with boiling water.\n\nThe worst offenders are said to be berries, cucumbers, apples and tomatoes \"because some people eat the skin\".\n\n\u201cThis would explain why the virus is spreading faster in the West than Asia. Most Asians do not eat salad, and very few eat the skin of any fruit,\u201d the claim continues.\n\nThe entire statement is attributed to a certain \u201cDr Sanjay Lundlal\u201d.\n\nThe claim was brought to AFP\u2019s attention via our dedicated tip-off line on WhatsApp messaging service.\n\nIn an email to AFP, Netcare rejected the claim about uMhlanga Hospital as \u201cabsolutely untrue and fake news\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no Dr Sanjay at the hospital, the hospital does not have a laboratory where such tests are done and the hospital general manager confirmed that there was no such notice to staff,\u201d Netcare communications manager Marietjie Shelly said.\n\n\u201cPeople who start such fake news cause unnecessary anxiety among the public and waste all of our time trying to set the record straight. Please ask your readers not to forward it on if they receive it.\u201d\n\nNetcare\u2019s denial also appeared in the comments section of one of the posts responsible for publishing the claim.\n\nA study reported by AFP found that the novel coronavirus can survive for various lengths of time on some surfaces.\n\nHowever, medical experts and health organisations here, here and here said there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization says there is not yet a vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
