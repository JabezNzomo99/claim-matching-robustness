They just need to close there (sic) border with California.\u201d\n\nThe tweet appears to be fabricated. There is no evidence that Trump ever made such a statement.\n\nTrump on July 3 gave a speech at South Dakota\u2019s Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebration. Soon after, social media users began sharing a screen grab of a tweet, purportedly from Trump, praising South Dakota\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet, \u2018Ask Ukraine If They Found My Birth Certificate\u2019?)\n\n\u201cThank you to the Great people of South Dakota,\u201d the tweet reads. \u201cThe state is doing a tremendous job with the coronavirus. I told the governor that everyone is fine without a mask. They just need to close there border with California. That state is full of LOSERS.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no record of Trump ever sending such a tweet. A search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2014 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2014 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets turned up no instances of the remark. Nor does the tweet appear in screen grabs of the president\u2019s Twitter timeline from the Internet Archive.\n\nIt appears the tweet has been fabricated. Trump\u2019s tweets often garner media attention, especially when he makes factual errors in them, but there has been no reporting of Trump stating South Dakota and California share a border.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president has been the target of a number of fake tweets. Earlier this month, social media users shared a fabricated tweet that falsely claimed Trump tweeted, \u201cMy staff is telling me there\u2019s a huge movement to add me to Mt Rushmor (sic).\u201d", "lang": "en"}
