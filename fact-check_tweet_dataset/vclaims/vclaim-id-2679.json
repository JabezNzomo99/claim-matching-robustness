Patrick Murphy at Broward College that Rubio voted against airstrikes in Syria, and asked if he favored committing ground troops there.\n\nRubio said he would support a plan if he thought it would work but didn\u2019t think using American soldiers was a good option. He said he voted against Obama\u2019s plan because he had favored helping factions already in Syria over committing to airstrikes.\n\n\"He (Obama) was proposing what they called pinprick strikes \u2014 basically a symbolic strike to send a message, but not backed up by a clear plan,\" Rubio said, without elaborating on who \"they\" were.\n\nObama did use the term \"pinprick strikes,\" but it was to specifically advocate against what Rubio is attributing to him.\n\nRubio\u2019s \"pinprick strikes\" go back to 2013, when Obama was grappling with how to deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attack against civilians.\n\nWashington had planned a military response against the Assad regime, but Obama changed his mind on Aug. 31. Instead of acting unilaterally, Obama planned to first ask Congress to authorize an attack. His approach reportedly would have involved surgical missile strikes by Navy destroyers.\n\nObama did use the term \"pinprick\" several times. But every time he did, it was to describe what he wanted the U.S. military to avoid.\n\nObama said it during an interview blitz on Sept. 9. In one example, he told the Today show\u2019s Savannah Guthrie that \"the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria.\"\n\nThere is no technical term like \"pinprick\" when describing any kind of military intervention, Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution\u2019s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us in a previous fact-check of this Rubio attack. O\u2019Hanlon said that in his experience, when the word is used, \"it is always pejorative.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1, 2013, that he wondered whether surgical strikes are \"just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America.\"\n\nThe vote mentioned at the debate came on Sept. 4, when Rubio voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution allowing Obama to use limited force against Assad\u2019s regime. It passed by a 10-7 vote and was sent to the Senate.\n\nThe same day, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also used the term during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria.\n\n\"The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability,\" Hagel said.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry did refer to the planned intervention as an \"unbelievably small, limited kind of effort\" on Sept. 9, but he didn\u2019t call it a \"pinprick.\"\n\nAs support waned in the Senate, Obama asked the Senate majority leader, then Harry Reid, to pull the measure. Obama said on Sept. 10 that the military would not intervene but could in the future.\n\n\"As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria,\" Obama said. \"Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks.\"\n\nRubio voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels a year later.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed out that Obama revisited the term in the November 2016 issue of Vanity Fair when he said there were no easy solutions in Syria.\n\n\"The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels \u2014 that somehow that would have led to Assad\u2019s overthrow more decisively,\" Obama said. \"The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out \u2014 that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Obama is characterizing his own proposed strike as a \"pinprick,\" or describing a potential attack the way others may have suggested. Even so, it\u2019s still clear that back in 2013, he specifically avoided defining his proposal as any form of \"pinprick.\"\n\nRubio said Obama \"was proposing pinprick strikes\" for military intervention in Syria.\n\nIn 2013, Obama did suggest a limited military response \u2014 likely airstrikes from Navy ships \u2014 after Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Obama only used the word \"pinprick\" to describe what he didn\u2019t want the attacks to be, and said repeatedly that the U.S. military isn\u2019t built for small-scale action. And while some officials have used the term, \"pinprick strikes\" aren\u2019t a true military description for any kind of operation.", "lang": "en"}
