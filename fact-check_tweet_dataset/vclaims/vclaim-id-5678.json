Page asked Johnson about his efforts to appeal to young voters who supported Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nPage, June 16: Some people think you have the potential to be appealing to millennial voters, who were, many of them supported Bernie Sanders, now have to consider Hillary Clinton. In part because you\u2019re a longtime and the most prominent supporter in the country of legalized marijuana. Is that a good issue for you, do you think? Johnson: I think it\u2019s a litmus test for having a brain, myself. When 56 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana and no politicians outside of Bernie Sanders and myself support legalizing marijuana \u2014 and I\u2019m talking now at the congressional, gubernatorial, senatorial level \u2014 it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s an unbelievable disconnect.\n\nJohnson is wrong that no other governor, representative or senator, besides Sanders, supports legalizing marijuana at the federal or state level.\n\nWe reached out to Johnson\u2019s campaign for an explanation of his position on legalizing marijuana, but did not hear back.\n\nJohnson, who also ran for president in 2012, explained his position this way at the time:\n\nSanders introduced a bill in 2015 that would do exactly that. The bill, \u201cEnding Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act,\u201d would remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances and repeal all federal penalties for growing, possessing or using marijuana. States, on the other hand, would be allowed to impose their own restrictions on the drug.\n\nThe Sanders proposal has no cosponsors and has never been brought up for a vote in the Senate. But a similar bill in the House of Representatives has 18 cosponsors.\n\nThe \u201cRegulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act\u201d was introduced earlier in 2015, by Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado. It would also declassify marijuana as a federally controlled substance and make it subject to the same regulations as alcohol under federal law, while allowing for state-specific restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to replace the failed prohibition with a regulatory system that works and let states and municipalities decide for themselves if they want, or don\u2019t want, to have legal marijuana within their borders,\u201d Polis said in a statement announcing the bill.\n\nAlso, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley supported legalizing marijuana for recreational use in his home state of Oregon in 2014. Merkley was reportedly the first U.S. senator to do so.\n\n\u201cI lean in favor of this ballot measure,\u201d Merkley said, referring to Measure 91, which Oregon residents voted into law that year.\n\nSo, at least 20 \u201ccongressional level\u201d politicians, other than Sanders, support the legalization of marijuana. And at least one \u201cgubernatorial level\u201d politician does as well.\n\nDemocratic Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, in his State of the State address in January, outlined a legalization plan in his state. Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont decriminalized marijuana in 2013.\n\n\u201cI believe we have the capacity to take this next step and get marijuana legalization done right,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s statement that \u201cno politicians outside of Bernie Sanders and myself support legalizing marijuana\u201d at the \u201ccongressional, gubernatorial, senatorial level\u201d is inaccurate. At least 20 others in Congress and one governor favor legalizing the drug.", "lang": "en"}
