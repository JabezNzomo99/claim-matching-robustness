Converting the iconic building into a mosque is Turkey\u2019s historic right and internal affair, he said, condemning those who criticized the move and accusing the Western world of Islamophobia.\n\nErdogan then gave assurances that Hagia Sophia would remain open to all. \u201cLike all our mosques, the doors of the Hagia Sophia will be wide open to all \u2013 locals or foreigners, Muslims or non-Muslims,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s plans do not include sharing the structure, part of a United Nations World Heritage site, with Christians for worship ceremonies. Non-Muslims will only be allowed in as tourists under a strict dress code and visiting hours will be significantly reduced to accommodate five Islamic prayers daily.\n\nThe details of new regulations for Hagia Sophia have not been published, and the museum\u2019s government websites maintained by the culture and tourism ministries became inaccessible immediately after the court\u2019s decision.\n\nTurkish government officials have said that the traditional five Islamic prayers will be held daily in Hagia Sophia. During these prayers, Christian symbols will be \u201cobscured\u201d or \u201cveiled,\u201d but also \u201cpreserved,\u201d they said.\n\nThe officials named the mosaic of the Virgin and Child in the main hall, among other Christian symbols. None of the officials shared details on how this will be done, or whether some of the mosaics will be removed, displayed elsewhere or just temporarily covered.\n\nErdogan\u2019s assurance that \u201cHagia Sophia will be open to all,\u201d repeated and amplified by other Turkish officials, appears to refer only to tourists.\n\nSome claimed ending Hagia Sophia\u2019s status as a museum and converting it into a mosque \u201cwill not change anything for tourists.\u201d\n\nThe claim is not accurate: During Hagia Sophia\u2019s past as a museum, there were no scheduling or dress code restrictions for those visiting it during regular hours. Its conversion into a mosque will significantly impact the rules and regulations for tourists.\n\nAlthough visitor rules haven\u2019t been specified, they are expected to be similar to those at another of Istanbul\u2019s greatest tourist attractions, the Suleymanyie mosque.\n\nThe guidance on Suleymanyie mosque\u2019s website advises all women to cover their heads and bodies before entering, and notes that headscarves and body wraps can be rented at the reception area. Men are forbidden from wearing shorts or sleeveless tops, and all visitors must take off their shoes and carry them in plastic bags.\n\nVisiting hours are strictly adjusted to accommodate the times of Muslim prayers. On normal days, visitors are allowed in from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. On Fridays \u2013 the day on which praying at a mosque is obligatory for Muslims \u2013 doors open to visitors at 1:30 p.m.\n\nFollowing international criticism of the change in Hagia Sophia\u2019s status, Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said that Hagia Sophia \u201cwill always belong to the world historic heritage.\u201d\n\nBut UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said Turkey\u2019s move is contrary to the \u201cspirit\u201d of \u201cinclusive and equitable participation of communities.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s decision, made without giving UNESCO prior notification, \u201cbreaches\u201d its obligations as a World Heritage site state host, UNESCO said in a statement. To \u201cprevent any detrimental effect on the universal value of this exceptional heritage,\u201d the issue \u201cwill be examined by the World Heritage Committee at its next session,\u201d UNESCO said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said it \u201cviews a change in the status of the Hagia Sophia as diminishing the legacy of this remarkable building and its unsurpassed ability \u2014 so rare in the modern world \u2014 to serve humanity as a much-needed bridge between those of differing faith traditions and cultures.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, the Catholic leader, said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by what is happening in Istanbul.\n\nModern Turkey was forged under Ataturk as a secular and democratic republic. Since Erdogan first assumed national office as prime minister in 2003, he has worked to reassert Islam as a force in government, education and culture.\n\nFollowing a failed coup attempt in 2016, Erdogan has pushed Turkey toward autocracy under his Justice and Development Party (AKP), steadily increasing control over the courts, media and state security.", "lang": "en"}
