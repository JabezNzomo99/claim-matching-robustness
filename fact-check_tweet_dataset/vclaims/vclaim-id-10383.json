The video, code named Frazzledrip, has been circulating on the dark web since Monday, according to reliable sources who have viewed the material and confirm the content is \u201cworse than any nightmare.\u201d \u201cThe people who are coming back from viewing this tape are just not the same.\u201d. Many people are unable to watch the video due to the horrific nature of the content, according to sources familiar with the tape. In the video, they take a little girl and they fillet her face, according to reports, and then they take turns wearing the little girl\u2019s face like a mask. It is believed they were terrorizing the young girl, deliberately causing the child\u2019s body to release Adenochrome into her bloodstream before bleeding her out and drinking the blood during a Satanic ritual sacrifice. Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline (ephinephrine, norepinephrine) that is extracted from a living donor\u2019s adrenal gland. According to those familiar with the elites\u2019 drug of choice, the high is \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cexotic\u201d.\n\nThe reports amounted to an escalation of a thoroughly discredited conspiracy theory (associated with such hashtags as #Pizzagate, #SpiritCooking, and #QAnon) alleging that Clinton and other so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d conspirators run a massive Satanic pedophile ring based out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. YourNewsWire has granted uncritical credence to such theories in the past.\n\nThe article\u2019s author, \u201cBaxter Dmitry,\u201d took his cues from social media posts featuring still images allegedly extracted from the mysterious \u201c#Frazzledrip\u201d video. One of the earliest such posts appeared on Facebook during the first week of April 2018:\n\nHowever, it only took a few moments of investigating to determine that the sepia-toned images came not from incriminating footage found in some dank corner of the dark web, but rather from a maniacally inscrutable YouTube video uploaded (coincidentally or not) on April Fools Day 2018 (regrettably, that video has since been deleted).\n\nWe found, moreover, that the image purporting to show Huma Abedin wearing a mask made from the face of a mutilated child (discernible at the 1:23 minute mark in the above video) was actually taken from the website of a well-known \u201cunderground\u201d Indian restaurant in Washington, DC, called Hush Supper Club. The masked woman is the restaurant\u2019s proprietor, Geeta, who has been profiled in a number of national news venues.\n\nHere is the photograph in its original context:\n\nInsofar as it\u2019s supposed to serve as evidence that Huma Abedin participated in a Satanic ritual involving the mutilation of a child, then, the video is demonstrably a hoax. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped social media users from trying to find other imagery in the video to support the \u201csnuff film\u201d thesis, though the results \u2014 even with the addition of visual aids \u2014 remain laughably incomprehensible:\n\nIn point of fact, there appeared to be some disagreement among conspiracy theorists as to whether the two-minute YouTube clip and the much-ballyhooed \u201cFrazzledrip\u201d video were even one and the same. Some claimed the YouTube video was only a teaser, and that somewhere a full-length version existed, which if and when it were made public \u2014 would finally expose Hillary Clinton for the murderous Satanic pedophile ringleader she truly is. Others suspect \u201cFrazzledrip\u201d may not really exist, that the persona is actually a deep-state prank meant to make them look foolish.\n\nWe were only able to find one other probable contender for the title of \u201cthe real Frazzledrip video,\u201d and though we\u2019ve not been able to vet its authenticity, we include it here so interested parties can make up their own minds (caution, the linked content may not be suitable for all viewers):", "lang": "en"}
