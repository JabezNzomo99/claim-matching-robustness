The claim appears to imply that guests actually consume human flesh, but the existence of this venue is fictitious and an old hoax.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nA reverse image search shows that the logo of the venue on the social media posts stems from the website for Cannibal Club ( www.cannibalclub.org ), a restaurant purportedly \u201cspecializing in the preparation of human meat,\u201d that brings the \u201ccutting edge of experimental cuisine to the refined palates of L.A.\u2019s cultural elite.\u201d\n\nIts description also notes that the clientele of the club includes \u201cnoted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe \u201cStaff\u201d tab, however, shows photographs from stock catalogues and other websites, indicating that the website is a hoax. The profile image for Elspeth Blake, the alleged proprietor appears bit.ly/3gcvsq0 . A photo of Sophie Lafitte, listed as \u201cChef de Cuisine\u201d, appears here . Hero Conners, listed as \u201cArt Director\u201d, appears bit.ly/2EloP7z , and Raven Chan, Service Manager appears bit.ly/329122P .\n\nThis hoax has been addressed online since early 2018 here .\n\nAccording to domain information websites (search cannibalclub . org www.whois.net/ or lookup.icann.org/ ), the website was created in 2008 to a private user out of California and the phone number 714-706-4182. This number has been reported as scam here and also shows up as belonging to a small company apparently dedicated to internet services, here .\n\nFalse. Celebrities are not consuming human meat at the \u201cCannibal Club.\u201d This so-called venue is fictitious and part of an old hoax.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
