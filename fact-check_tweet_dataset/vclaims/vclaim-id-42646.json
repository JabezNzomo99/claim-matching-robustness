Critics noted that these anthropomorphic creatures appeared to live in the \u201cuncanny valley,\u201d a term to describe the unsettling nature of a non-human object appearing too human, while audiences mocked the seemingly unfinished animation. While the movie was poorly received, it did gain somewhat of a cult appreciation.\n\nThen in March 2020, fans of the movie learned an even more bizarre version potentially existed: an original cut of the film that featured several CGI cat buttholes:\n\nRumors about the alleged \u201cbutthole cut\u201d went viral, and soon the hashtag #ReleaseTheButtholeCut started to trend on Twitter. However, the rumors may have been exaggerated.\n\nBen Mekler, a writer and producer, reached out to a visual-effects crew member on the movie and learned that \u201cthere were never any shots of cats with butt holes.\u201d The anonymous crew member explained some scenes may have inadvertently appeared to show some cat nether regions, but that buttholes were not intentionally inserted into the movie at any point.\n\n\u201cThere were never shots of cats with butt holes. Or at least by design, None that i saw anyway. However, there were a dozen or so shots where the skin and fur sim was groomed or just folded in a way that really REALLY looked like very furry lady genitals and buttholes by accident. The task (as typical with heavy cg shows) fell on 2D to paint out the offending articles where it was brought up and spotted. Daily reviews were constant awkward discussions of people plucking up the courage to point things like this out; \u2018does that [look] like a fanny to you?'\u201d\n\nWe reached out to a few VFX crew members and will update this article if any more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
