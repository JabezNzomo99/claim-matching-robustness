The lessons include instructions on condom use, but they do not include detailed information on anal sex or any pornographic materials.\n\nAll of the instructional materials and student handouts for the human sexuality curriculum for third through fifth grades and sixth through eighth grades are available on the school district\u2019s website.\n\nMegan Maas, an assistant professor of human development and family studies at Michigan State University, reviewed the new curriculum at the request of PolitiFact Texas and said that it \"clearly does not meet the definition of pornography.\"\n\n\"It seems comprehensive enough to give students the language they need to enforce the decisions they want to make around sexual behavior,\" she said in an email. \"Even maintaining abstinence requires comprehensive education so that they have the language and skills to refuse some kinds of sexual behavior (e.g. oral sex), but engage in others (e.g. holding hands).\"\n\nThe bulk of the sex education lessons for both third through fifth graders and sixth through eighth graders focuses on personal identity and safety as well as identifying and maintaining healthy relationships with family, friends and romantic partners.\n\nIn addition to lessons on abstinence in the new materials, there are also lessons about other contraceptive methods, but those are limited to sixth through eighth grade instruction.\n\nFirst of all, parents are allowed to decide whether their children can participate in any sex education instruction offered in the school district. In other words: it is not mandatory.", "lang": "en"}
