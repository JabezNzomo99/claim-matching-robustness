We took a closer look. (The West Virginia Republican Party did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Economic Data website, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for women was 3.7% in July 2019, the latest data that was known at the time of the party\u2019s tweet. In August 2019, the rate ticked down slightly, to 3.6%; the best showing came in April, with a rate of 3.4%.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart showing the full run of data for women\u2019s unemployment.\n\nThe data shows one period with a lower unemployment rate for women: a 12-month period in 1952 and 1953. That\u2019s about 66 years ago, which qualifies as \"nearly 70 years\" ago.\n\nBrian Lego, an economist at West Virginia University, told PolitiFact that the Korean War in the early 1950s created some labor market distortions. Because the military draft pulled men out of the labor market, temporary jobs opened up for women.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that presidents don\u2019t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.\n\nIn fact, the unemployment rate for women has been falling since 2010, when President Barack Obama was president. The unemployment rate for women fell from 8.7% in October 2010 to 4.7% when Obama left office in January 2017 -- a decline of four percentage points, or almost half.\n\nSince Trump entered the White House, women\u2019s unemployment has fallen by one point, or almost one-fifth.\n\nThe West Virginia Republican Party said, \"Women\u2019s unemployment has been lower under President Trump than it\u2019s been in nearly 70 years.\"\n\nThe actual number is 66 years, which qualifies as \"nearly 70.\" However, it\u2019s important to note that presidents don\u2019t deserve full credit or blame for such statistical changes on their watch.\n\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
