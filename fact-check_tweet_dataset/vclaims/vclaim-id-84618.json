Prakash Balbudhe, who is Bhandara BJP VP according to his Twitter bio, also shared this video.\n\nThis video is currently viral on all forms of social media.\n\nThe video carries the BBC watermark on the top left as well as the watermark of an application called \u201cMadlipz.com\u201d on the bottom right.\n\nA simple google search for MadLipz shows that it is an application that \u201clets you dub your voice over a short video clip (up to 15 seconds)\u201d.\n\nThe video that is currently viral where the little child responds with \u201cModi\u201d when being asked \u201cWho do you like the most\u201d is actually a dubbed video. The actual incident is from a Trump election rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on 10th October 2016, and was covered by multiple media outlets. This Washington Times report states, \u201cToddler Trump stole the show at the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s latest appearance in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump spotted 2-year-old Hunter Tirpak, dressed in a dark blue suit, power tie, and his hair poofed up to somewhat resemble Trumps famous comb-over at a rally Monday night before about 9,000 people at Mohegan Sun Arena near Wilkes-Barre.\u201d\n\nThe part which has been now dubbed over with Trump asking \u201cWho do you like the most\u201d and the child responding with \u201cModi\u201c, was originally Trump asking him, \u201cDo you want to go back with your mommy and daddy or do you want to stay with Donald Trump?\u201d and the boy responding with, \u201cTrump\u201c.\n\nIt is strange that it didn\u2019t occur to all these people as to why would a 2-year old American child respond with \u201cModi\u201d to the question and the crowd would applaud to it. With various smartphone applications which make editing and morphing of images and videos super-easy, a motivated person can keep dishing out such fake news all day. At the same time, there are virtually no applications that are accessible to the common man which can help in detection of such fakery. This hoax demonstrates yet again as to how easy it is to mislead people on social media.", "lang": "en"}
