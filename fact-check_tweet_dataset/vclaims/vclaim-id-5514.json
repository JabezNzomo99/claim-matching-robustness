Make no mistake, it is a racist organization promoting the Hispanic race exclusively. If this judge were white and affiliated with thehe would be excoriated and removed from the bench. However, because he is Hispanic and can be used by the Clintons to push their narrative he is made out to be the victim. People need to wake up. Our country is being hijacked by radical progressives and socialists. The democrats, especially the demonic Clinton's, will completely transform the United States into a 3rd world country full of poverty, disease and perversion.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Donald Trump became notorious for making inflammatory comments or assertions. Trump\u2019s stances on Mexico (that \u201crapists\u201d are crossing the southern border in droves, for example) provoked outcries and demonstrations across the United States.\n\nIn June 2016, Trump repeatedly said that a federal judge presiding over the Trump University case, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, may have a biased perspective because of his Mexican heritage (Curiel is American, but born to Mexican immigrants in the state of Indiana).\n\nThe lawsuit brought against Trump University says that while the school claimed to teach Donald Trump\u2019s real estate strategies and techniques, it was actually an unlicensed and illegal school, and a thinly-veiled scam to sell high-priced seminars.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Trump alluded to Curiel\u2019s alleged involvement with a \u201cvery pro-Mexican\u201d group:\n\nWhile Trump did not mention any group by name, his spokeswoman identified the group as the La Raza Lawyers Association:\n\nWhile Curiel is indeed a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association, several conservative pundits, politicians, and supporters of the Republican presidential candidate accused the federal judge of being a member of a different organization with \u201cLa Raza\u201d in its name: the National Council of La Raza, a civil rights organization that advocates for (among other things) immigration reform and better opportunities for Latino families.\n\nLuis Osuna, president of the La Raza Lawyers Association, confirmed to the Washington Post that these two organizations are not connected:\n\nHowever, neither the NCLR nor the La Raza Lawyers Association could accurately be described as \u201cradical\u201d or equated with the Ku Klux Klan. The NCLR has actively worked for immigration reform and is a nonpartisan civil rights group, not a hate group. In fact, on 6 June 2016, NCLR president Janet Murgu\u00eda released a statement condemning the violence at Trump\u2019s rally in San Diego and informing protesters that \u201cviolence is never the answer\u201d:\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to be angry. We\u2019re angry too. But violence is never the answer.\u201d That is my message to the protesters who engaged in violent acts at a Donald Trump rally in San Jose last week. Due to that troubling incident and Trump\u2019s despicable attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a lot of misinformation about NCLR\u2014and the Latino community in general\u2014is being pushed out by people who know nothing about my organization. I would like to clear up a few things. First, NCLR does not condone and has never called for violence in our 50-year history as an American institution. We do believe in the right to engage in civil and nonviolent protest. We, ourselves, at NCLR have marched; we have fasted; we have picketed; and we have boycotted, but always in a dignified manner that is well in line with American values. In addition, anyone familiar with our history would know that it is a true affront to assert that NCLR has any association with violence. My predecessor, Raul Yzaguirre, served as a volunteer at the March on Washington in 1963 and marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We worked with Cesar Chavez and continue to work with the organization he founded, the United Farm Workers. These civil rights icons and paragons of nonviolent protest have been our guide stars throughout our history. Finally, NCLR has not called for nor participated in protests at any candidates\u2019 events, including Donald Trump\u2019s. Since the term \u201cLa Raza\u201d is a nod to our common heritage, many, many groups share our name, but we are all separate, unaffiliated organizations. We want people to exercise their right and obligation to engage in our nation\u2019s political process. But we want them to engage constructively and effectively.\n\nThe NCLR is not a \u201cradical\u201d group similar to the Ku Klux Klan and U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel is not the \u201cgrand master,\u201d or affiliated in any way, with this group. The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association (of which Curiel actually is a member) is one of more than a dozen affiliates of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, and not an outlier group:\n\nFormed in 1979, with a handful of Latino attorneys, San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association (SDLRLA) has grown to represent over three hundred Latino and Latina lawyers practicing in San Diego County. SDLRLA is one of 18 affiliate bar associations of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, which serves several thousand Latino lawyers practicing in the State of California. Our purpose is to advance the cause of equality, empowerment and justice for Latino attorneys and the Latino community in San Diego County through service and advocacy. We are dedicated to promoting diversity on both the bench and bar. We support law students with mentorship programs and scholarships.\n\nAccusations that the National Council of La Raza and the La Raza Lawyers Association are akin to the Ku Klux Klan seem to hinge on a mistranslation of \u201cla raza.\u201d While \u201cla raza\u201d does mean \u201cthe race,\u201d the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association noted that this is not the only translation:\n\nMany people incorrectly translate the name, \u201cLa Raza,\u201d as \u201cthe race.\u201d While it is true that one meaning of \u201craza\u201d in Spanish is indeed \u201crace,\u201d in Spanish, as in English and any other language, words can and do have multiple meanings. As noted in several online dictionaries, \u201cLa Raza\u201d means \u201cthe people\u201d or \u201cthe community.\u201d Translating our name as \u201cthe race\u201d is not only inaccurate, it is factually incorrect. \u201cHispanic\u201d is an ethnicity, not a race. As anyone who has ever met a Dominican American, Mexican American, or Spanish American can attest, Hispanics can be and are members of any and all races.\n\nThe phrase \u201cLa Raza\u201d is actually truncated from \u201cLa Raza C\u00f3smica,\u201d a phrase coined by politician and philosopher Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos (also a former secretary of education and 1929 presidential candidate in Mexico) to describe the ideology that the mixture of ethnicities in the New World ushered in a new era of humanity characterized by love and inclusivity.", "lang": "en"}
