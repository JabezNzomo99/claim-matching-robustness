But we found that the photo and many other images in the post were not actually taken in Australia.\n\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe tracked down the image through a reverse-image search and found that it is a real photograph, but it shows a scene from California in late 2019.\n\nThe picture was taken by photographer \u00c9tienne Laurent on Oct. 30, 2019, in Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nIn the photo\u2019s original caption, Laurent says that horses were being evacuated from a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spread near Simi Valley, which sits north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe image does not have a caption that says its from Australia, but it\u2019s included in a gallery post that does. For that reason, we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
