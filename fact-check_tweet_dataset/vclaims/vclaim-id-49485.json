The video has been overlaid with a bollywood song. Since the video has been shot from a higher vantage point, the text on the banners and placards is hard to read.\n\n\n\nAlso read Did PM Modi Appoint Drone Wiz Prathap As A DRDO Scientist?\n\nA Hindi caption with the clip translates to 'The day Ajmer SHarif Dargah reopened, senior officials of Rajasthan police paid obeisance at the Dargah and offered prayers to get rid of the Coronavirus'.\n\nWatch the video below and check its archived version here.\n\nBOOM also received the same message on its helpline with a request to fact check the clip.\n\nBOOM checked the Twitter handle of Ajmer Police and found that several such videos had been tweeted from their timeline with captions suggesting that these clips are from awareness rallies about Coronavirus conducted by the Rajasthan Police.\n\nHowever, as the tweets were not shared from a verified Twitter handle, we decided to contact Rajasthan police for more information.\n\nBOOM contacted Amer Superintendent of Police Kunwar Rastradeep who confirmed that the video showed a 4-km-long Corona Awareness flag-march conducted by the department on June 29. \"The Dargah has not opened yet and neither have the officials visited the Dargah for any offerings,\" the SP told BOOM.\n\n\"Can you see any chadar for offering.
