The terrorists and the terror incident mentioned in the article are fictional: they come from a movie. Don't fall for it.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NewsThump on August 14, 2018 titled \"Jeremy Corbyn laid wreath for Hans Gruber outside Nakatomi Plaza\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJeremy Corbyn caused huge controversy last night, as pictures emerged of him laying a wreath for terrorists associated with the 1988 Christmas Eve incident at Nakatomi Plaza.

Corbyn was in Los Angeles as part of a wider trip in search of peace in the region and was invited to the ceremony by supporters of Gruber and his family.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and they might have thought it was a real story about a real incident:\n\nCorbyn was indeed involved in a controversy about him being present at a wreath-laying ceremony but it was for different terrorists entirely.\n\nThe terrorist Hans Gruber and his attack on a building on Nakatomi Plaza in L.A. are fictional: they appear in the 1988 movie \"Die Hard\" starring Bruce Willis:\n\nNewsThump comes with an about page that explains what is going on:\n\nWelcome to NewsThump!
