No, that's not true: the picture was taken from the Etsy shop of an artist named Yumi Okita who specializes in making sculptures of giant moths and butterflies.\n\nAn example of the image can be seen in a recent Facebok post (archived here):\n\nThis is the image in question:\n\nIt can be found in the Etsy shop of Yumi Okita:\n\nSpecifically here (archived version), where it is marked as \"Sold\" and described as a statue of an \"Hemileuca elganterina\", with following details:\n\nThis moth is about 6 inches tall and 12 inches wide. The wings are made from fabric which is hand painted and embroidered with layer of thread creating texture and depth of color . The body is made of faux fur. You may display on the wall (metal hook attached on the underside) or display free standing. It is a one of a kind unique sculpture.\n\nThe Hemileuca Elganterina is a moth native to North America and has nothing to do with Japan:\n\nThe sheep moth, or common sheep moth ( Hemileuca eglanterina), is a member of the family Saturniidae of silk moths and is native to western North America. In California, its range is west of the Sierran crest and the mountains of Southern California, ranging near to the coast.\n\nIt is unclear where the name \"Japanese Giant Emperor Moth\" comes from as that species does not exist.", "lang": "en"}
