And in the absence of a vaccine yet, social media is full of theories on how to combat the deadly Covid-19.\n\nA viral social media post claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has suggested men to shave facial hairs to prevent coronavirus. The viral post contains the link of an article which describes suggestions regarding the same along with a graphic.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is not true. CDC authorities have not told people to shave off beards and moustaches to avoid Covid-19.\n\nThe graphic attached to the article link is an older one. CDC had released the graphic in 2017 to help people who sport beards to alter their style so that their face mask could adjust more effectively. The reason is that hair shouldn't cross the respirator-sealing surface so that the person wearing the mask is properly protected from outside germs.\n\nIt is clear that the graphic showing facial hair options was not created in relation to the current outbreak of coronavirus, but is one of many respiratory protection infographics listed by a sub-branch of CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. One can read the original recommendations by CDC here.", "lang": "en"}
