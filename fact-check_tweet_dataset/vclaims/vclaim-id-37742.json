The purported report by \u2018The Telegraph\u2019 says that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was accused of rape by a local girl when he was 19 years of age and a student at IIT Kharagpur. One @AshokGo46043024 has shared the alleged newspaper clipping on Twitter.\n\nIt was also shared by another user @sanataniameric1.\n\nThe same is circulating on Facebook.\n\nIt is also viral with a Hindi text alleging the same: \u201c\u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930 08/06/1987 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u092e\u0947 \u0906\u0908 \u0906\u0908 \u091f\u0940 \u0916\u0921\u094d\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0940 \u090f\u0915 \u0932\u094b\u0915\u0932 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0930\u0947\u092a \u0915\u0947 \u0907\u0932\u094d\u091c\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0915\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u0930 \u0906\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0915\u093f \u0909\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0905\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0939\u0948 \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094c\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0909\u0938 \u0938\u092e\u092f \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0916\u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u0940 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092b \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u092d\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d\n\nA keyword search of the alleged news does not redirect to any reports that claim Kejriwal was accused of rape in 1987. In fact, the clipping itself gives clues that it is not genuine and has been manufactured.\n\n1. The spacing between some words and paragraphs is unusually large.\n\n2. The language of the report is immature.\n\n3. The report starts with \u2018Kharagpur\u2019 and has neither a date nor a reporter\u2019s name.\n\nThe clipping has been created on the website fodey.comthat gives one an option to write a story, give it a headline, name the newspaper and change the date. We have juxtaposed the viral clipping with a clipping manufactured by Alt News. If one notices carefully, the third column of the report has the same words, thus confirming that the viral clipping was created on fodey.com.\n\nEarlier, a fake newspaper clipping created on the same website was used to target Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Former BJP MP Paresh Rawal and RBI director S Gurumurthy were among those who tweeted the fake clipping.", "lang": "en"}
