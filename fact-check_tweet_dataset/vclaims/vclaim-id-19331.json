It may actually come from a story written by science fiction writer Ray Cummings.\n\nBest known for his contributions to the field of physics, Einstein famously developed the theory of general relativity, which dealt with gravity and the distortion of space-time.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no evidence that this specific quote about time originated with Einstein. A search of the Einstein Archives Online, which houses around 80,000 documents related to the theoretical physicist, turned up no record of the expression.\n\nIt does appear in \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d a preeminent text on sayings from the theoretical physicist, where it falls under the \u201cProbably Not By Einstein\u201d section. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say, \u2018Creativity Is Contagious. Pass It On\u2019?)\n\nAccording to Quote Investigator, the quote may actually come from Cummings\u2019 1919 story, \u201cThe Girl in the Golden Atom,\u201d which was originally published in a magazine, but later expanded into a novel. In 1921, he also used the expression in another story.", "lang": "en"}
