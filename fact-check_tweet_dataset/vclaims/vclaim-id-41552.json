The initial version said, \u201cHow far can you be saved from religious fundamentalism? Not just in India, but such a mentality is spread worldwide. Two youths in Britain, Mohammad Abdul Basit and Amjad Bhatti serve human bodily waste to non-Muslim customers.\u201d The article has received 12,000 shares and 14,000 likes on Facebook where it was shared with the caption, \u201cThey used to misbehave with non-Muslims, the truth has come out (\u0917\u0948\u0930\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u0928\u0940\u091a \u0939\u0930\u0915\u0924, \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0906\u092f\u093e \u0938\u091a.)\u201d\n\nThe article further stated, \u201cThere were two restaurant owners here [in Britain] \u2013 Mohammad Abdul Basit and Amjad Bhatti. According to reports, they used to mix human faeces in the food and serve it to non-Muslim customers. The duo was running their restaurant for a long time in Nottingham.\u201d The story doesn\u2019t state when the incident took place.\n\nThe original Zee News article is still available on . An archive link of the same can be viewed here. A screenshot of an excerpt from the article (posted below) shows that Zee News claimed that the restaurant used to prepare two kinds of dishes and people from non-Muslim religions were served food with human faeces.\n\nZee News has now updated its report claiming that cases of such food contamination are not only reported in India but also in England. The URL of the article still reads \u201ctablighi jamaat mentality\u201d.\n\nZee News\u2019s story is based on a message viral since April 21. The message carries a link of UK-based Daily Mail which is not a part of the Zee News story. This is perhaps why the story neither mentions a source nor the date when the incident occurred. Daily Mail\u2019s report is from September 2015.\n\nIn this report, we will fact-check two claims separately \u2013\n\n1. Was the food contaminated based on a person\u2019s religion?\n\n2. Was human faeces intentionally added to the food?\n\nThe Daily Mail report does not state that the restaurant owners used to serve unhygienic food to non-Muslim customers. We found that BBCand The Guardianhad also reported the incident in 2015. These reports also don\u2019t carry the religion angle. Therefore, the first claim is false.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the second claim. According to the report in Daily Mail, the food was indeed contaminated with human faeces however this wasn\u2019t intentional but due to \u201cinadequate hand-washing techniques by the staff.\u201d The report states, \u201cMohammad Abdul Basit and Amjad Bhatti, of the Khyber Pass takeaway in Nottingham, were responsible for an outbreak of E.coli that saw 142 customers fall seriously ill.\u201d Justice Jeremy Lea, who gave the duo a four-month jail sentence and a fine of \u00a325,000, has been quoted in the report as saying, \u201cWhat was going wrong here was the poor handwashing with soap and clean water to reduce the risk of contamination.\u201d\n\nThe report published by The Guardian states, \u201cMore than 100 takeaway customers were sick for up to two months with a rare strain of E coli \u2013 after staff did not wash their hands when using the toilet, a court heard.\u201d The report also quoted the prosecutor \u2013 \u201cNine of the 12 members of staff who handle food at the takeaway were found to have traces of the bacteria, and one of the defendant\u2019s daughters fell ill.\u201d\n\nBBC\u2019s report carries a statement of Paul Dales, from Nottingham City Council\u2019s food, health and safety team \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s clear that hand-washing practices by some workers were wholly inadequate and this led to food becoming contaminated.\u201d The court ordered that the restaurant owners would be suspended for 12 months.\n\nTherefore, the claim that human faeces was intentionally added to the food is also false.\n\nWe found that the restaurant \u2018The Khyber Pass\u2019 is now functional. However, it does not have great reviews on tripadvisor.com. Several people complained of unhygienic standards.\n\nTo sum it up, Zee News carried a manufactured version of a true incident from 2015. While two restaurant owners in Britain were indeed found guilty of serving food contaminated with human faeces, this was neither religiously-motivated nor was the contamination intentional. As laid earlier, the court found that the restaurant staff did not wash their hands properly after using the toilet.", "lang": "en"}
