However, the size is more than 22 meters with a width of four meters.\n\nInitial news reports had trouble identifying the animal, but they did provide some information about the creature\u2019s size that should have dispelled the rumor:\n\nThis creature is far too large to be a squid of any type. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the giant squid has an estimated maximum length of thirteen meters, nearly ten meters shy of the animal that was found in Indonesia. The colossal squid, the precisely named world\u2019s largest squid, is also too small to be the pictured animal, as it only reaches an estimated maximum length of around fourteen meters, or 45 feet.\n\nSo what is it? On 11 May 2017, Indonesian outlet Tribun News reported that it was a whale\u2019s carcass, not a squid\u2019s:\n\n\u201cAt first people thought it was squid, but after being examined it is a whale carcass because it is more similar to whales,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
