This is false; the video actually shows drowned migrants off the coast of Libya in 2014.\n\nThe video, shared here, here and here on Facebook and here on YouTube has racked up more than 4,000 views. The posts claim that the footage shows victims of Cyclone Idai, a powerful . tropical cyclone which ravaged southern Africa in March, leaving more than 700 dead, as reported by AFP.\n\nThe misleading video of washed up bodies has been viewed more than 1,800 times on YouTube, with the caption \u2018Mozambique floods 2019 Horrible scenes dead bodies float along the shores Indian Ocean\u2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nThe same footage has been shared on multiple Facebook accounts, with users claiming it shows \u2018bodies of people who were swept away by cyclone Idai\u2019, which are \u2018beginning to appear in the Indian ocean in Mozambique\u2019.\n\nA Google reverse image search, using video stills obtained using verification tool InVID, led to Turkish news site Haberler, which features the video in an article from August, 26 2014 about the death of migrants whose boat sank off the coast of Libya. The article gives the source of the video as \u2018AA\u2019, referring to Turkish Anadolu Agency.\n\nThe same video was published online by Getty Images with the caption \u2018Rescue teams try to remove dead body of refugees in Libya on August 25, 2014. An overloaded boat carrying suspected illegal African immigrants sank and at least 200 passengers drowned, many of them missing.\u2019\n\nAFP reported on the disaster in an article from August 25, 2014 entitled \u2018170 bodies of African migrants found from Libya shipwreck\u2019.\n\nThe same video was also presented as showing victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami last year in Indonesia.\n\nOn Sept 28, 2018, a 7.4-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami razed swathes of Palu on Sulawesi island, killing about 2,200 people and displacing more than 220,000, as AFP reported here.\n\nA Google reverse image search with InVID leads to a site called The Joo Joo, where the video is posted under the caption, \u2018Korban tsunami palu donggala yang terbawa ombak di kembalikan lagi k pantai\u2019.\n\nA YouTube search with this Indonesian caption reveals similar posts of the video here and here, each claiming it shows victims of the tsunami last September.\n\nIn October 2018, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, from Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management, called out the video as a \u2018hoax\u2019. He posted the footage on Twitter with a caption that translates as: \u2018If you see this video with a claim saying it is a video of tsunami in Palu, it is a HOAX. This is not a tsunami in Palu but an incident abroad. The conditions of the sea, the shore, victims and the officers show that it is not an incident in Palu or Indonesia. Please disregard it when you encounter it.'\n\nOld images are often reused in misleading posts online.", "lang": "en"}
