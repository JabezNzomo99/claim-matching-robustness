Machel is a respected advocate for women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights who is the widow of former South African president Nelson Mandel and of former Mozambican president Samora Machel. The book was an update and expansion of a well-regarded 1996 U.N. report on children in armed conflict that did not mention the 300,000 figure.\n\nSo already, one can see that the 300,000-number circulating in 2016 as a current fact was based on an estimate first published almost 20 years ago. The authors even conceded that \u201cit is impossible to give an exact figure as most of them are the \u2018invisible soldiers\u2019 of our title.\u201d They described the figure as a \u201cbest guess\u201d as of May 1998, but added: \u201cThere is a wide variation in the estimates of the number of child soldiers involved. The total number of child soldiers in each country, let alone the global figure, is not only unknown but unknowable.\u201d\n\nBut the 300,000-figure becomes suspect when the specific numbers that make up Brett\u2019s estimate are examined. (\u201cThe work on this was a long time ago and I do not remember the details,\u201d Brett said in an email, saying an appendix in her book is the best source for her methodology. That appendix lays out country by country estimates.)\n\nFor instance, more than half of the 300,000-figure stems from just two countries \u2014 108,000 children in Afghanistan and 50,000 in Burma. The Afghanistan figure is based on an estimate that 45 percent of the fighters in various factions were children, though the book also acknowledges a nationwide survey indicated the figure was under 30 percent. The Burma figure of 50,000 is also an estimate based on a survey that indicated between 10 and 66 percent of fighters are children, but total number of child soldiers estimated for various factions only adds up to 6,450.\n\nBy 2003, researchers began to question the accuracy of Brett\u2019s estimate. When UNICEF published a report on the 10th anniversary of Machel\u2019s landmark study, it cited the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers as saying the number of armed conflicts involving children had declined \u2014 and any estimates should be viewed with caution. (The group was founded with the help of the Quaker United Nations Office in Geneva, where Brett was a key figure.)\n\n\u201cWhile it is possible to determine where children are associated with armed forces or armed groups, it is much more difficult to determine how many children have been involved,\u201d the 2007 report noted. \u201cIn fact, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers no longer provides estimated figures. However, there is a sense that the numbers have fallen over the past decade, as conflicts in some countries have ended and demobilization agreements have been reached.\u201d\n\nAn annual report on children and armed conflict issued by the U.N. Secretary General said that the United Nations in 2014 documented the recruitment and use of 68 children by the Afghan National Police and armed groups, a decline from 97 in 2013. (The report said the numbers are almost certainly underreported.) Nearly 260 boys were held in juvenile rehabilitation centers for association with armed groups.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly impossible to provide authoritative figures for the number of child soldiers worldwide today \u2014 all numbers we quote are estimates, and even estimates are not available for all situations of conflict,\u201d said Nick Scarborough, administrative officer of Child Soldiers International. \u201cHowever, the fact that seven national armies and 50 armed groups are listed by the U.N. Secretary General as parties that recruit and use children points to the persistence and severity of the violation.\u201d\n\nThis is yet another example of a \u201czombie statistic\u201d that detracts from the cause it is supposed to assist. With good intentions, an estimate was produced to help explain the scope of the problem \u2014 and to rally public awareness. Yet very quickly the figure was abandoned by experts in the field. And yet it continues to be cited as if it were an actual fact, in part because of outdated material circulating on the Internet. Even though the UNICEF report in 2007 noted the figure was no longer valid, a UNICEF fact sheet with the 300,000-number remained on the Internet until 2016, when it was discovered by The Fact Checker.", "lang": "en"}
