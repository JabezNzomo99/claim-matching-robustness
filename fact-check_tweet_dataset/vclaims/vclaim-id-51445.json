Through this article lets verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The video was shot at Altare della Patria building in Rome (Italy). Also, the tricolours in the video represent the Italian flag, not the Indian flag. The air show in the video is a demonstration by the aerobatic team of Italian Air Force called \u2018Freece Tricolor\u2019 (Tricolor Arrows) and it usually takes place on the Republic Day of Italy. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the screenshots of the video to Google reverse image search, we found that the air show in the video is by the aerobatic team of Italian Air Force called \u2018Freece Tricolori\u2019 (Tricolor Arrows) and is usually organized on the Republic Day of Italy. Few more pictures of \u2018Freece Tricolori\u2019 can be seen here. The three colours (Green, White, Red) in the \u2018Freece Colori\u2019 represent the Italian flag.\n\nWhen we searched on YouTube using the keywords \u2018Italian Air Force tricolori Altae Della Patria\u2019 many videos like the one in the post popped up. One such video can be seen here. With this, we can conclude that the video is related to Italian Republic Day celebrations and has nothing to do with France and Rafale.\n\nSimilar news, attributing the video to that of Indian Independence Day celebrations at Trafalgar Square, London was debunked by FACTLY earlier, which can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, air show video of the Italian Air Force is being falsely shared as the farewell to Rafale by France in Indian tricolours.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
