But that did not mean all of the 14 million or 24 million would be \u201ckicked off\u201d health insurance or \u201close\u201d health insurance.\n\nMany of the people who would be uninsured, at least initially, would choose not to have insurance, because they had decided to obtain coverage only to avoid a penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate; the replacement bill would eliminate the mandate. The CBO estimated an additional 5 million people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment \u2014 after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under the ACA. But that would probably not happen in California.\n\nWe did not give a Pinocchio rating because we covered these statements as part of a roundup. Probably it would have been worth two Pinocchios. But note that in this ad, the DCCC did not say \u201cmillions\u201d but \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d The CBO did estimate that 2 million people with coverage through their employers would lose it because companies would no longer be required to provide insurance. So \u201ctens of thousands\u201d is actually defensible.\n\nAs we have documented, the GOP bill would have weakened protections for people with existing health conditions. States would have had the option to make changes that could have left people with preexisting conditions vulnerable to large increases in premiums, according to the CBO report. In effect, the CBO said, in the states that took full advantage of the possible waivers, the guarantee that preexisting conditions are protected would be so undermined that it would be worthless.\n\nIn other words, it would be a real stretch to say the DCCC was filled with \u201clies.\u201d So how did the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a group affiliated with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), manage to quote the Fact Checker as saying the AHCA vote did not change the guarantee to cover preexisting conditions?\n\nOur May 10, 2017, a fact check concerned a tweet by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) after an amended version of the AHCA passed the House: \u201cOnce again, 129M people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage and insurers could charge sick people more money.\u201d Most of the fact check was on whether 129 million people really would be affected \u2014 and we concluded it was much too high to be credible.\n\nAs a secondary matter, we looked at the question of whether people with preexisting conditions would be denied coverage. The amended AHCA had a line saying, \u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.\u201d Harris argued that her tweet referred to the possibility that people would be \u201ceffectively denied coverage\u201d because they could not afford it.\n\nThere were two versions of the AHCA. The first one failed to pass the House, but the CBO had said it could \u201cattract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market.\u201d The revised version, allowing waivers for states, was hustled through without a CBO score. So when we evaluated the Harris tweet, there was no CBO report on the legislation. It later turned out that the CBO report on the revised bill, as we noted, found that in states that sought the waivers \u2014 estimated to contain about one-sixth of the U.S. population \u2014 people might end up being priced out of the market.\n\nThe core of the fact check, however, was about Harris\u2019s estimate of 129 million, not the guarantee of coverage. So the CLF is cherry-picking the Pinocchio rating, even though the fact check mostly examined an entirely different issue \u2014 the 129 million number. And the CLF ignores the fact that the CBO showed that the AHCA did undermine the guarantee in states that sought waivers; it just conveniently pretends the critical CBO analysis was never issued.\n\nA CLF spokesman defended the use of the Pinocchios in the ad: \u201cThe fact check states the AHCA didn\u2019t weaken the guarantee of coverage for people with preexisting conditions and to use a vague statement to suggest it did is misleading. It makes it sound like Denham weakened preexisting protections, when in fact, he voted to protect people with preexisting conditions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
