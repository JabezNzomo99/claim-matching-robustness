This claim has been put up by Facebook page 'NAMO' which has more than 45 lakh followers.\n\nThe post had been shared more than 9,700 times at the time of filing this report. Users are calling Sibal \"anti-national\" and even giving him death threats.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be totally false. The original Facebook post can be seen here.\n\nWe found no media report about Sibal's role in the extradition of Mallya. Speaking to India Today, Sibal said, This is absolutely false, I have never represented Mallya.\"\n\nWe found that this post was picked from a report on website fakingnews.com which clearly states it is a satire website. The disclaimer on the website reads, \"Content of this website, unless categorised as 'Editorial' is a work of fiction.\"\n\nThe screenshot of the post has been mischievously put up in a way that it looks like real news.\n\nBritish Home Secretary Sajid Javid recently signed the order for completing the process in less than two months after a UK court ordered Mallya\u2019s extradition. The liquor baron has decided to appeal against the extradition order.", "lang": "en"}
