Tom Wolf has mandated all schools and workplaces with 20 or more employees close for two weeks to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThere is no record of Wolf mandating these measures. The local affiliate mentioned in the post has not published any reports about mandated school or workplace closures.\n\nThe number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassed 1,000 on March 10 as the outbreak continues to spread worldwide. At press time, Pennsylvania has 2 confirmed and 13 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\n\nA viral post masquerading as a breaking news alert from local affiliate Pittsburgh\u2019s Action 4 News claims the Pennsylvania governor has mandated school and workplace closures in response to the outbreak. The accompanying link to the \u201cfull article\u201d leads to a 403 error page.\n\n\u201cALL schools will be closed for 2 weeks beginning March 12, 2020,\u201d reads the post. \u201cSchools and workplaces with 20 or more employees will resume after 2 weeks of the mandatory closure. A list of all schools and businesses in your area can be found on this list.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller found no press releases announcing these mandates on the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s website. Nor did the local affiliate station publish any media reports about them.\n\n\u201cThe Wolf Administration is aware of the fake meme,\u201d said Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Health Department, in an email to the Caller. \u201cIt is important that people are getting their coronavirus information from reputable sources, such as the Pennsylvania Department of Health. If a news outlet was to post something like this, it would come from their account.\u201d\n\nJim Parsons, the news director at Pittsburgh\u2019s Action 4 News, confirmed to the Caller that the local affiliate did not publish the information. (RELATED: Did The WHO Make A Coronavirus Infographic Warning Against Unprotected Sex With Animals?)\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with us, and we did not post this information anywhere on any platform,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt\u2019s bogus information that is being spread on social media.\u201d\n\nThere have been some school closures and event cancelations across Pennsylvania over concerns about the novel coronavirus. Various colleges, including Bucknell University and the University of Scranton, are moving to virtual instruction, and several cities in the state have cancelled their St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades, according to Pittsburgh\u2019s Action 4 News.", "lang": "en"}
