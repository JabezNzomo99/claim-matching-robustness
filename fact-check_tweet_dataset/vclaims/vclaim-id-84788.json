The city signed up for getting water from a new $600-million pipeline from Lake Huron \u2014 but a gap emerged between the completion of the pipeline and the end of the contract with Detroit. So city officials decided to tap the Flint River as an interim water source, since it had on occasion been used as a back-up supply if Detroit\u2019s system had problems. Officials thought the move would save the cash-strapped city $5 million.\n\nSo there are several things going on here: Snyder\u2019s decision to hire managers with extraordinary powers, a dispute over water costs and incompetence over handling the new water source. But what we have to examine is Clinton\u2019s specific claim that the crisis was the result of the governor wanting to save money.\n\nAfter Flint decided to sign up for the Lake Huron project, Detroit canceled a long-term contract in 2013, but attempted to keep selling Flint water at a reduced rate while a new pipeline was being built. The Flint city council voted to join the Lake Huron pipeline, but took no vote on whether to use the river in the interim while that was being built.\n\nDocuments show that on June 17, 2013, two Flint city employees proposed using the Flint River for water; nine days later, one of Snyder\u2019s appointed emergency managers added his signature to the plan. Then, in March 2014, another emergency manager appointed by the governor rejected Detroit\u2019s final offer to keep supplying water, thereby sealing the decision to switch to the river. That was revealed in a letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by ACLU of Michigan, embedded below.\n\nOddly, in 2012, the Flint emergency manager had previously nixed a plan to switch to the river water after discussing the option with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, according to testimony under oath. It is not clear what changed a year later, but Flint Public Works Director Howard Croft, who proposed the 2013 plan to use the river water, told ACLU reporter Curt Guyette that the decision to switch to the Flint River went \u201call the way to the governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nIt has been documented that complaints about the water reached Snyder\u2019s inner circle in 2014, with at least one aide urging the system be switched back to Detroit. But the recommendation did not reach the governor. \u201cTreasury Department officials concluded the cost to reconnect Flint to Detroit water \u2014 an extra $1 million per month \u2014 was deemed more than the cash-strapped city of Flint could afford,\u201d the Detroit News reported.\n\n\u201cThis was never about money, so Hillary Clinton\u2019s claim is bogus,\u201d said Ari Adler, communications director for Snyder. \u201cThis was a failure of government at all levels that could be described as a massive error of bureaucracy.\u201d He added: \u201cThe decision to move to the Flint River as the primary temporary water source was not made at the direction of the governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nAdler described a cascade of errors, including a failure to use corrosion control chemicals, repeated assurances from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that the water was safe, poor follow-up by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a lack of questioning in the governor\u2019s office about the DEQ assurances as residents\u2019 complaints and news reports should have raised alarm. \u201cThis is why Gov. Snyder has apologized, taken responsibility for what happened and has begun a top to bottom culture change in Michigan state government,\u201d Adler said.\n\nWe should note that our colleague Dana Milbank, in an opinion column, has blamed Snyder for the crisis, saying it stemmed from his decision to appoint emergency managers in the first place. Milbank pointed out that all three critical decisions \u2014 using Flint river water, terminating the Detroit contract and overturning the council\u2019s vote to stop using the water \u2014 were made by Snyder\u2019s appointments. \u201cThe unelected viceroys had mandates to improve municipal finances but little incentive to weigh other considerations,\u201d Milbank said.\n\nOne difficulty in making a ruling is that not all of the facts have been gathered about the decision-making behind the fateful decision to shift to the river water. But that also means that Clinton cannot be so definitive in her statements assigning the blame to the Republican governor.\n\nAs far as we know, there was no direct involvement by Snyder in the decisions regarding Flint\u2019s water supply, especially concerning questions about costs. The key decisions were made by people he appointed \u2014 and perhaps his office was kept in the loop about those decisions \u2014 but that is not the same thing as directly assigning blame to Snyder. If Clinton wants to make the argument that Milbank makes \u2014 that Snyder\u2019s system of emergency managers was to blame \u2014 then she needs to explicitly make that case.", "lang": "en"}
