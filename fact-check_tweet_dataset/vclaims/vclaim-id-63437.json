This is not true, and the man identified as Mr Cummings is actually called Harry Eastwood.\n\nThe photograph shows Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson with eight other men, all dressed in formal tailcoats. The Bullingdon Club is a male-only society, which is notorious for the drunken behaviour of its usually wealthy members.\n\nThe Facebook post identifies a man standing on the right hand side of the group to be Mr Cummings. However, the photograph has been widely reported on in the past, and these reports all identify this man as Harry Eastwood\u2014a businessman and TV producer.\n\nMr Cummings did attend Oxford University where he studied Ancient and Modern History. There is no evidence he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. As Mr Cummings started at the university in 1991, graduating in 1994, he is unlikely to have been present at the university in 1987 when this Bullingdon Club photograph was taken.", "lang": "en"}
