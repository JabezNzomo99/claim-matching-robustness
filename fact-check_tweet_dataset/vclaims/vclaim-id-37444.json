We used to hang by the Golden Tee machine at the 9th Hole Cantina at Bedminster and he'd tell me he couldn't let himself beat someone as cool as TJ Hooker. He was a bit delirious, but he thought it was cute that Trump thought it was TJ Hooker who played Captain Kirk. Bill got Christmas cards addressed to 'TJ' every year and he loved them. He was pretty sure it was a joke, but there on his deathbed he admitted he wasn't sure.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nShatner is actually 87 years old and not dead.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
