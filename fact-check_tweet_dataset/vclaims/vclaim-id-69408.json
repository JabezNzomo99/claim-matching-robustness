We found that the story was misleading because no such federal law kicked in at the end of January.\n\nThe blog said that the law applies to any private vehicle and that violators would face up to a $100 fine. It included a photo of a woman smoking in the driver\u2019s seat while children sat in the backseat.\n\nThe blog didn\u2019t explain if it was a federal or state or local law -- as evident by comments posted by confused readers who asked what jurisdictions would fall under the new law. The broad statements in the blog could leave the false impression that it refers to a federal law.\n\nThe story linked to a Feb. 1 Yahoo Lifestyle story and lifted many paragraphs from that article.\n\nThe Yahoo story stated that on Jan. 30, the Alabama state House of Representatives passed a bill to ban smoking in vehicles with any riders under the age of 19. So that means the bill itself wasn\u2019t enacted as a law by that date -- it still has additional legislative hurdles.\n\nHowever if it becomes law, Alabama would be the ninth state to do so since 2006.\n\nThere is no federal law -- or proposed federal legislation -- prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children. Alabama is one of 12 states that are considering similar bills this session, said Liz Williams, project manager for Americans for Nonsmokers\u2019 rights.\n\nThe blog included a few sentences describing of the type of vehicles that it applies to, which closely mirrored the wording of an announcement in July 2015 by the government of the United Kingdom, which banned smoking in cars with children effective Oct. 1, 2015.\n\nThe lovethispic blog appears to recycle a similar story from 2016, Snopes found.\n\nWe emailed the lovethispic blog and did not hear a reply. The headline \"smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018\" is misleading because it could lead readers to believe that a national ban started in January. In reality, the Alabama House did pass such a ban on Jan. 30, but it\u2019s not state law yet.", "lang": "en"}
