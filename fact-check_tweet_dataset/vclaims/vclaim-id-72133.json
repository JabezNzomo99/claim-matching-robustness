(He also went on to that we\u2019ve previously fact-checked).\n\nTodd interjected by returning to the national perspective and making a claim of his own.\n\n\"But I\u2019ve got to show you,\" he told Walker, as a appeared on the screen, \"compared to the national average, when it comes to wage growth, it's below the national average, Wisconsin is. When it comes to job growth, it's below the national average.\"\n\nHow Wisconsin's economy compares nationally could bear on Walker\u2019s viability as a presidential contender, a prospect .\n\nSo let\u2019s check both sets of figures.\n\nThe graphic that flashed on the screen cited figures from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report, which compared March 2013 to March 2014.\n\nOn job growth, the \"Meet the Press\" graphic said Wisconsin\u2019s rate from increased 1 percent, less than the national average of 1.7 percent.\n\nThe so-called QCEW numbers are considered the most accurate source for jobs numbers, but lag behind real time by six to nine months.\n\nThe graphic quoted the figures accurately, according to a from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWalker\u2019s office didn\u2019t dispute this part of Todd\u2019s claim, but said most states had job growth during the period that was at or below the national average.\n\nThe graphic also accurately cited the average changes in wage growth from March 2013 to March 2014 -- 2.9 percent in Wisconsin, which was behind the national average of 3.8 percent.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t affect the accuracy of Todd\u2019s statement, but we decided to use the to take a longer view on both job and wage growth to see how Wisconsin and the United States have compared during Walker\u2019s nearly four years as governor.\n\nThe quarterly time frames don\u2019t match up precisely with Walker\u2019s time in office because, as we noted, there is a lag of several months in reporting the figures. But when compared March 2011 to March 2014, and December 2010 to December 2013, the results were essentially the same: Wisconsin has lagged the national average on job growth, but was slightly higher on wage growth.\n\nCiting statistics for the most recent year, Todd said Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth.\n\nThe latest federal figures, comparing March 2013 to March 2014, show Wisconsin\u2019s job growth rate at 1 percent, below the national average of 1.7 percent, and its wage growth rate at 2.9 percent, behind the national average of 3.8 percent.", "lang": "en"}
