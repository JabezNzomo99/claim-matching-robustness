What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\"\n\nWhen the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump\u2019s chances, Trump rejected it.\n\n\"We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,\" he said on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, 2016. \"I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She\u2019s down to a very low number. No, I don\u2019t believe that at all.\"\n\nIn a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn\u2019t think Russia meddled, and that it might have.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\" Trump said. \"That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say \u2018oh, Russia interfered.\u2019\"\n\nBut a moment later he said, \"I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.\"\n\nDuring an overseas trip to Asia in November 2017, Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.\n\n\"Every time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn't do that,\u2019 \" Trump said. \"And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"\n\nAsked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials \"political hacks,\" and argued that other matters were more important.\n\n\"You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that,\" Trump said. \"Now, you\u2019re not going to get into an argument. You\u2019re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.\"\n\nSo there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible.\n\nIn the same interview with NBC\u2019s Holt where he called the Russian thing \"a made-up story,\" Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections.\n\n\"If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it\u2019s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said. \"And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.\"\n\nAt a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture.\n\n\"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" he said. \"But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\"\n\nPressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings, Trump backpedaled.\n\n\"All right, but you know what, it could have been others also,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said that he \"never said that Russia did not meddle in the election.\"\n\nIn reality, he called the matter a \"made-up story,\" and a \"hoax.\" He has said that he believes Russian President Putin\u2019s denial of any Russian involvement. He told Time, \"I don\u2019t believe they (Russia) interfered.\"\n\nEven when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals.\n\nTrump\u2019s denial doesn\u2019t match what he has actually said.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
