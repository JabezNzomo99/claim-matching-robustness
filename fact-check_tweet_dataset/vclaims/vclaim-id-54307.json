But the group behind the card \u2014 \u201cFreedom to Breathe Agency\u201d \u2014 is not a government agency, and federal officials say the ADA \u201cdoes not provide a blanket exemption\u201d from requirements to wear masks.\n\nA purported \u201cface mask exempt card\u201d has circulated online in recent weeks, suggesting that people can use it \u2014 and its citation of federal law \u2014 to avoid wearing face masks in public.\n\nBut the card is not government-issued and does not give people permission to simply flout face mask requirements. Health officials advise \u2014 and many governors mandate \u2014 that people wear face masks in public settings to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nIterations of the \u201cexempt card\u201d have been circulating since June, and some sharing it encouraged people to print out copies of the card. Other posts showed photos of laminated copies of the card.\n\nA recent version posted by the musician Ted Nugent on Facebook was shared more than 4,000 times.\n\n\u201cI am exempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public,\u201d the card claims. \u201cWearing a face mask poses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you.\u201d\n\nThe card includes a logo for the \u201cFreedom to Breathe Agency\u201d and says \u201cdenying access\u201d to a business or organization \u201cwill be reported to FTBA for further actions.\u201d The card includes a phone number to report violations of the ADA; some of the versions also include a logo for the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nBut the implication that the FTBA is a government agency \u2014 and that it has enforcement powers (\u201cfurther actions\u201d) \u2014 is wrong. It\u2019s actually a group that says its mission is to \u201cstop face mask orders and human rights oppression from spreading nationwide and globally.\u201d\n\nOn June 30, the Justice Department warned against such \u201c[i]naccurate flyers or other postings \u2026 regarding the use of face masks and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these notices included use of the Department of Justice seal and ADA phone number,\u201d the department said.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe ADA does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advises people to wear cloth face masks in public settings, does note that such coverings shouldn\u2019t be worn by \u201cchildren under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the Southeast ADA Center \u2014 a project of the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University \u2014 says some disabilities may prevent people from wearing face masks.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean anyone citing a disability, or showing the viral \u201cexempt card\u201d for that matter, can simply bypass face mask requirements enforced by businesses or government agencies.\n\nThe Southeast ADA Center said in a recent brief that \u201c[i]f a person with a disability is not able to wear a face mask, state and local government agencies and private businesses must consider reasonable modifications to a face mask policy so that the person with the disability can participate in, or benefit from, the programs offered or goods and services that are provided.\u201d\n\n\u201cA reasonable modification means changing policies, practices, and procedures, if needed, to provide goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to an individual with a disability,\u201d the center added.\n\nExamples might include allowing a person to order online or by phone with curbside pickup; permitting someone to wait for an appointment in the car; or carrying out appointments by phone or video.\n\n\u201cWhat the ADA basically mandates is that they have to consider serving the customer in another way,\u201d the center\u2019s project director, Vinh Nguyen, told PolitiFact. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to allow entry into the actual store.\u201d\n\nThe center\u2019s brief also emphasizes that the ADA\u2019s \u201crequirement to modify a policy, practice, or procedure does not\u201d pertain to individuals without disabilities. (That said, the brief notes that \u201c[g]enerally, guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice has not allowed asking for documentation [regarding a disability] for accommodations at businesses where you would have a brief interaction, such as grocery stores or pharmacies.\u201d)\n\nIn short, businesses and organizations requiring face masks are expected to accommodate people with disabilities that impede their ability to wear a face mask \u2014 but that accommodation may not always mean physical access to the establishment without a mask. And the supposed \u201cface mask exempt card\u201d spread across social media doesn\u2019t permit anyone to simply be \u201cexempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public,\u201d as it wrongly claims.", "lang": "en"}
