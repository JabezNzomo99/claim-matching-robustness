It urges social media users to circulate the video across the country. The caption, tweeted by a user Amarnath, suggests that the man beaten up by this group is a Dalit as the caption also said, \u201cSubalterns, Dalits cannot drive a luxurious car\u201d.\n\nSeveral individuals on Twitter and Facebook have shared the video with an identical narrative.\n\nUpon searching for the relevant keywords on Google, Alt News found a video report published, by The Times of India, on April 4, 2017. According to the report, a man was mercilessly beaten up by his in-laws in Gandhinagar.\n\nThe relatives were angry at the man\u2019s violent behaviour towards his wife. \u201cThe man allegedly had been hitting his wife for the five years, apparently since the time they had tied the knot. He had a history of domestic violence against her, which had time and again angered the woman\u2019s relatives.\u201d, stated a Mumbai Mirrorreport.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video of violence against an individual in Gujarat was falsely shared as a Dalit man attacked by a BJP leader. Moreover, the candidate\u2019s name \u2013 Anil Upadhyay \u2013 was also fictitious. My Neta, a website that contains details about state and central legislators, did not include any information about a person by that name who belonged to either of the parties. In the last month, four different, unrelated videos have been circulated on social media as that of misdeeds conducted by this fictitious character.", "lang": "en"}
