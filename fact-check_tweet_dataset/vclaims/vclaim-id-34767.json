Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: The book in the photo is an ancient Bible, which has been found at the bottom of the ocean and is still readable. Fact: The book in the photo is a crystallized German-English Dictionary. The book was crystallized using Borax, a chemical. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE..\n\nWhen the photo in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, a blog (\u201cStuff you can\u2019t have\u201d) with similar images was found in the search results. Catherine Mcever, the author of the blog, writes that the book in the image is a German-English Dictionary crystallized using a chemical solution of Borax. Images of the same book in other angles can be found on her blog. So, the book in the post is not Bible and was not found at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nOther similar crystallized works by an artist, Alexis Arnold, can be found here. To sum it up, a crystallized German-English Dictionary falsely shared as \u2018Bible found at the bottom of the ocean\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE Lite series.", "lang": "en"}
