This is how environmentalists left a park in California after an Earthday celebration.\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo began to pop up online shortly after Earth Day celebrations on April 22. The image isn\u2019t fake \u2014 but it is miscaptioned.\n\nThe photograph was captured nearly 10 years ago to show trash that was left from a University of Georgia tailgate party following the school\u2019s home opener football game against South Carolina on Sept. 12, 2009.\n\nA reverse-image search shows that the photo was published in a story by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in September 2009 to illustrate the trashed lawn. The newspaper reported that crews collected about \"70 tons of trash\" following the tailgate.\n\nA local radio station also uses the same photo, credited to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in a 2011 story about the university\u2019s tailgating policies. The caption explains the scene was \"in front of the University of Georgia Law Library one Sunday morning in September 2009, the aftermath of tailgating activities during a football game the night before.\"\n\nIn response, the university tightened rules around tailgate parties but relaxed them in 2011.\n\nA viral photo that shows trash strewn across a lawn comes with the claim that the littering was caused by environmentalists after an Earth Day celebration in California.\n\nThe photo has nothing to do with environmentalists, California or Earth Day. It was captured in 2009 following a tailgate party at the University of Georgia.", "lang": "en"}
