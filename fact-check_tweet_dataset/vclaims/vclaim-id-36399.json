The video has been shared in a misleading context; Wuhan fire officials said the fire was sparked accidentally by a discarded cigarette and refuted the claim that alcohol disinfectant was the cause.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post published on February 7, 2020. It has viewed more than 13,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe 15-second video shows a residential building on fire. An explosion can be heard at the 10-second mark.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cFor those in Wuhan who have been compulsorily locked and separated, are they still alive? Do you think this country is safe? In Wuhan disinfecting room with alcohol and tuning on air conditioner led to explosion!\u201d\n\nWuhan is the epicentre of a novel coronavirus, which has killed at least 1,367 people and infected at least 60,000 people, AFP reported here.\n\nThe same video was also shared on YouTube here and on Twitter here with a similar claim.\n\nThe video has been shared in a misleading context; fire officials in Wuhan said the blaze happened in Wuhan but was not caused by alcohol disinfectant.\n\nA keyword search on Weibo found this February 3, 2020 post published by the Wuhan Fire Aid Rescue.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese caption translates to English in the first paragraph as: \u201c#WeiboRumourDebunk# An incident happened at 11:46 on February 3, 2020 on Floor 4, Unit 1, Building 3 of Tuanjiejiaxing Garden on Changfeng Road.\u201d\n\nThe caption states in the second paragraph: \u201cBased on investigation so far, the incident is not caused by disinfecting with alcohol at home as claimed online!\u201d\n\nThe red text superimposed on the screenshot of the misleading video says \u201cRumour\u201d. Below is a screenshot of the post:\n\nA corresponding residential tower block at Tuanjiejiaxing Garden can be seen on Baidu Maps here. The block is in Wuhan\u2019s Qiaokou district.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the location on Baidu Maps (R):\n\nQiaokou\u2019s fire brigade also posted detailed investigation results on the incident here on its official WeChat account on February 3, 2020.\n\nThe article is headlined: \u201cStatement on '2.3' fire in Tuanjiejiaxing Garden residential area, Qiaokou district\u201d.\n\nThe article content follows in part as: \u201cA fire incident took place at 11:45 on February 3 in Room 404, Unit 1, Building 3 of the residential area. The fire started from the balcony, when no one was in the room. According to investigation at the scene, Room 404 is rented by Jin from Yaoji Street, Huangpi district, who was back to Huangpi with family before the Chinese new year. The fire is caused by outcoming kindling (cigarette end) which ignited materials on the balcony. According to the investigation, there is no inflammable and explosive materials such as alcohol in the house. The bang heard at the scene is from a small gas tank explosion within the household hotpot furnace after burning. It's not caused by alcohol disinfection.\u201d\n\nThe article also includes a screenshot of Wuhan Fire Rescue\u2019s Weibo post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nAnother video of the same fire was shared here, here, here and here on Facebook with a similar misleading claim about alcohol disinfectant causing the blaze.\n\nThe video corresponds with an image of the same tower block in Tuanjiejiaxing Garden.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the second video (L) and the location on Baidu Maps (R):", "lang": "en"}
