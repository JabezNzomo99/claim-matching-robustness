But the Census Bureau\u2019s most recent household food security survey found that about 6.5 million children, or 8.8 percent, \u201clived in households in which 1 or more child was food insecure\u201d in 2016.\n\nAlso, the federal definition of \u201cfood insecurity\u201d includes households with \u201clow food security\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d at any point during the previous 12 months. Until 2006, \u201clow food security\u201d was known as \u201cfood insecurity without hunger\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d was called \u201cfood insecurity with hunger.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery low food security among children was 0.8 percent in 2016, essentially unchanged from 0.7 percent in 2015,\u201d said the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s 2017 report on food security.\n\nPelosi made her remarks at her weekly press conference on April 26, which was \u201cTake Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day.\u201d At her press conference, the California Democrat was joined by the children of Capitol Hill staffers and the media.\n\nThe Intercept released a tape recording that day of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer urging Levi Tillemann, a progressive candidate in Colorado\u2019s 6th Congressional District, to drop out of the Democratic primary to clear the field for the party\u2019s preferred candidate, Jason Crow. Asked if the Democratic leaders in Washington should get involved in primaries, Pelosi pivoted to the issue of childhood poverty and hunger.\n\nLater in the news conference, Pelosi repeated that \u201c1 in 5 children in America goes to sleep hungry at night because they are so poor.\u201d\n\nDo 20 percent of the children in the United States go to bed hungry?\n\nPelosi\u2019s office referred us to Table 1B of the USDA\u2019s September 2017 report, \u201cHousehold Food Security in the United States in 2016.\u201d The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as the food stamp program, and several child nutrition programs for low-income Americans in an attempt to combat hunger.\n\nThe USDA report is based on the 2016 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, an annual survey conducted by the Census Bureau. And, as Pelosi\u2019s office told us, the report says 16.5 percent of U.S. households with children were food insecure at some point during 2016. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the children in those households go to bed hungry.\n\nIn an attempt to identify the number of \u201cfood-insecure children,\u201d the federal government differentiates household food insecurity \u201cby whether it affected the dietary intake of adults only or adults and children.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents and guardians try to shield children from experiencing food insecurity to the extent possible, and they are often able to maintain adequate food intake and normal meal patterns for their children even when parents themselves experience food insecurity,\u201d the USDA says in a separate June 2017 report on children\u2019s food security.\n\nThere were nearly 3.1 million \u201chouseholds with food-insecure children,\u201d which is 8 percent of U.S. households with children, according to the September 2017 report. Of course, some of those households have more than one child.\n\nSo, how many U.S. children were \u201cfood insecure\u201d in 2016?\n\n\u201cAbout 6.5 million children (8.8 percent) lived in households in which 1 or more child was food insecure,\u201d according to the USDA report cited by Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nThere are also ranges of food security that help the USDA determine \u201cthe severity of food insecurity experienced\u201d by children. Here\u2019s the definition of \u201cfood insecurity,\u201d as described on the USDA website:\n\u2022 Low food security (old label=Food insecurity without hunger): reports of reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet. Little or no indication of reduced food intake.\n\u2022 Very low food security (old label=Food insecurity with hunger): Reports of multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.\n\n\u201cIn 0.8 percent of households with children (298,000 households), food insecurity among children was so severe that caregivers reported that children were hungry, skipped a meal, or did not eat for a whole day because there was not enough money for food,\u201d the September 2017 report says. \u201cThese households are described as having very low food security among children.\u201d\n\nAs noted by the USDA, \u201clow food security\u201d was once known as \u201cfood insecurity without hunger\u201d and \u201cvery low food security\u201d was known as \u201cfood insecurity with hunger.\u201d But the USDA in 2006 stopped using the \u201cwith hunger\u201d and \u201cwithout hunger\u201d labels, and combined those categories into a single \u201cfood insecurity\u201d category. As the USDA explains on its website, the Committee on National Statistics at the time recommended that the USDA stop using those labels because \u201chunger is not adequately assessed in the food security survey.\u201d\n\nThat means the USDA does not use the food security survey to measure hunger, even though Pelosi does.\n\nHenry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us: \u201cA child in a household without enough food on the table is in danger, and that\u2019s the point Leader Pelosi is making.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But the statistic she cited to make her point misrepresents the government data.", "lang": "en"}
