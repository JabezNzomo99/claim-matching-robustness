Black Lives Matter Thugs Blocking Emergency Crews From Reaching Hurricane Victims.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, some false stories about the devastating storm have appeared online.\n\nOne Aug. 26 post, published on flashamericannews.com, was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake news. The headline was: \u201cBlack Lives Matter THUGS Blocking Emergency Crews From Reaching Hurricane Victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just sick!\u201d the story begins. \u201cEmergency crews are working hard to make sure that they can be there to rescue Hurricane Harvey victims, but leftist punks from the Black Lives Matter clique don\u2019t think people deserve to be saved.\u201d\n\nThe story claims that \u201cpolice are currently engaged in a standoff with the \u2018protesters,\u2019 who decided to block traffic because Donald Trump is a \u2018racist\u2019 according to chants from the unruly mob.\u201d It includes a photo of protesters in front of police cars.\n\nOnly there was no standoff in Texas. The image embedded in the story is a CNN photo from July 2016. It shows Black Lives Matter activists in Atlanta, Georgia, during a protest against police shootings of African Americans. Georgia state troopers and Atlanta police were blocking protesters from entering a highway.\n\nThe bogus story of protestors blocking emergency responders during Hurricane Harvey was originally published by ourlandofthefree.com, a prolific satire website.\n\nThe website\u2019s \u201cabout us\u201d page says: \u201cOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nEllis, Ralph, et al. \u201cBlack Lives Matter protesters return to the streets.\u201d CNN. 9 Jul 2016.\n\nLandrum Jr., Jonathan. \u201cThousands march in Atlanta to protest police shootings.\u201d Associated Press. 8 Jul 2016.", "lang": "en"}
