In this context, a video has gone viral on social media claiming that the video was taken by Amitabh Bachchan after he was admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment. In the video, Amitabh Bachchan applauds the work of doctors, nurses and health staff of Nanavati hospital during COVID-19. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Amitabh Bachchan applauding doctors, nurses and health staff of Nanavati hospital after he was admitted for COVID-19 treatment. Fact: Amitabh Bachchan has tested positive for COVID-19 on \u201811 July 2020\u2019 and he was admitted to Nanavati hospital for treatment. But the viral video is found to exist on the internet at least since \u2018April 2020\u2019. So, the video was not taken after he was tested COVID-19 positive and admitted to Nanavati hospital. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn \u201811 July 2020\u2019, Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek Bachchan were tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to Mumbai\u2019s Nanavati hospital for treatment.\n\nTo know the details of the viral video, we subjected the screenshots of the video to reverse image search technique, the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube.

So, the video was not taken after he was tested COVID-19 positive and admitted to Nanavati hospital.\n\nNanavati hospital has also clarified that the video of Amitabh Bachchan acknowledging the efforts of health staff was taken in \u2018April 2020\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, video of Amitabh Bachchan applauding the efforts of health staff of Nanavati hospital was not taken after he was admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
