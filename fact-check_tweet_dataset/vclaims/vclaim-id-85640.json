But he only tells half of the story.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-11-21T08:00:38Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85640", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/21/meet-paul-ryans-cindy-a-single-mom-who-he-says-gets-700-from-the-tax-bill/", "vclaim": "The key to the increase is the boost in the child tax credit by $600. Because of the way the tax bill is structured, Cindy makes enough money that she does not run into a problem that children in one of three working families will face \u2014 not making enough to fully qualify for the increase in the credit. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that families who miss out on the increase have an average income of $22,000.\n\nFirst of all, House Republicans adopted a different inflation rate for calculating changes in tax rates, which over time will increase taxes (and thus eat away tax refunds). Second, the personal/dependent exemptions, eliminated under the bill, currently increase over time because they are inflation-adjusted but the replacement credits are not, so the value of the credits dilute over time.\n\nThe nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget estimates that if the House bill did not let individual tax breaks expire at various points throughout the decade, then it would add $225 billion to the revenue loss of the bill. All told, various budget gimmicks disguise the fact that the revenue loss is actually $1.9 trillion. The Senate Finance Committee bill, while structured differently, also has gimmicks that hide the fact that it reduces revenue by $1.9 trillion.\n\nTrump administration officials and lawmakers have claimed that the tax bill will actually pay for itself through greater economic growth. But Congress is rushing the bill so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office has said it does not have enough time to do a full economic analysis that would allow for calculations of the feedback effect.\n\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on Nov. 20 released an analysis that concluded the feedback would be relatively modest \u2014 only reducing the revenue loss by $169 billion from 2018 to 2027. That suggests about $2 trillion in additional deficits over the next decade if the full tax bill were implemented \u2014 which if true would put pressure on Congress to address the problem in some way. One route would be to let the provisions expire rather than add to the deficit.\n\nAccording to a calculator created by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the impact on Cindy would have varied greatly depending on where she lived. In Rock County, Wis., (where Ryan lives) she would have her health insurance costs decline by about $600 in 2020. But in Santa Cruz County in California, her health insurance costs would have climbed more than $3,500. And in Duval County in Florida, there would have been virtually no difference. (We assumed cost-sharing assistance was eliminated and that none of the states took advantage of provisions that would have allowed states to waive certain consumer protections. We also assumed Cindy was 40 years old.)\n\nThe touching tale of Cindy only tells half the story. At the beginning, she likely would be happy to find an additional $700 in her tax refund. But as the tax bill is written, that savings is frittered away over time. Republican lawmakers insist that expiring provisions will not expire; the tweet even says Cindy will get $700 \u201ceach year under our tax bill.\u201d But then they should be forthright and explain that they have not figured out how to fund the full tax cuts either. There are no guarantees in tax policy, and lawmakers should not pretend that there are.", "lang": "en"}
