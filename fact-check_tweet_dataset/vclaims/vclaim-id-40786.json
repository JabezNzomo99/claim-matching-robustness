No, that's not true: the only report about that came from a notorious prank website where anyone can upload any headline they choose in order to prank people. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on NSFNews on October 25, 2018 titled \"22 Year old South Carolina State Student has won 1.5 billion\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and many seemingly thought it was real:\n\nHowever it is not known who the winner is and it is unlikely to come out. According to this CNBC article winners in South Carolina can claim their prize anonymously and nothing is known about the identity of the winner yet:\n\nThe picture illustrating the story seems to have been taken from this Twitter account and it makes no mention of being a lottery winner.\n\nOne thing is certain though: the site that published the story is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nEach site in the network comes with a disclaimer (sometimes translated into a different language) that reads:\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!\n\nWe wrote about nsfnews.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Young Buck Did NOT Admit He Is Gay\n\u2022 Fake News: Jackson Man NOT Arrested For Hacking College Computer And Returning All Funds to Students Since 2010\n\u2022 Fake News: Shark NOT Found By Boat Ramp in Gallipolis Ohio\n\u2022 Fake News: Urban Meyer NOT Cleared Of All Charges From Panel (Yet?)\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Snakes Released in Hinckley Lake, Did NOT Cause Mass Hysteria", "lang": "en"}
