{"title": "Six Kremlin Foreign Policy Boasts and Why They\u2019re Wrong", "subtitle": "Each year, the Russian Foreign Ministry issues an annual review. Polygraph.info fact-checks six of the false or misleading claims made about cybersecurity, Syria, the United States, Latin America and the INF treaty.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "January 21, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-29910", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-foreign-policy-fact-check/30389899.html", "vclaim": "\u201cIn 2019, we vigorously promoted on international platforms Russian approaches to international information security.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading: Russian state actors have been proven to be actively involved in cyberwarfare, including malicious cyberattacks, hacking of foreign states and entities, as well as running disinformation campaigns.\n\u2022 The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that there is no alternative to mobilizing assistance for the voluntary, dignified and safe return of Syrian refugees and IDPs (internally displaced persons) to their original places of residence.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading: Russia and the Assad regime are accused of forcibly relocating refugees and internally displaced people to Syrian government-controlled territories, after which they are subjected to forced enlistment in the army or imprisonment.\n\n\"Russia has always adhered to balanced approaches, has not been biased in favor of one or another participant in the internal Libyan processes with a view to receiving special dividends and preferences, and has maintained equal relations with all the country's influential socio-political forces.\"\n\nThis is false: Russia\u2019s material and military support for Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar has been well documented.\n\nClaim No. 4, on the INF Treaty:\n\n\u201cOn August 2, the United States unilaterally withdrew from the INF Treaty, resulting in its termination. The most outrageous thing is that they justify this by referring to Russia's alleged \u2018violation\u2019 of the treaty. The United States has not produced a single piece of evidence of the charges they are throwing out against us, because there is no such evidence and cannot be such evidence.\u201d\n\nThis is false: The U.S. provided detailed evidence of Russia\u2019s violations of the INF Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987 and banned all of the two nations\u2019 land-based intermediate and medium range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\n\u201cThe Russian approach to interaction with Latin Americans is extremely logical: Do not put anyone against anyone, do not create dividing lines and artificial barriers, do not divide partners into \u2018ours and others\u2019, and strengthen cooperation on a de-ideologized, pragmatic basis with mutual respect and consideration of interests.\u201d\n\nThis is false: Russia has been picking sides and supporting regimes from Cuba to Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia, as well as increasing its military presence on the South American continent.\n\nClaim No. 6, on the U.S.:\n\n\u201cThe Foreign Ministry also continues to take all possible measures to return six objects of Russian state property in the United States, which, despite [having] immunity, were illegally seized by the American authorities in 2016-2018. These are the suburban recreation centers of the (Russian) Embassy in Washington and permanent mission to the U.N. in New York, the trade mission\u2019s Washington mansion, two buildings of the Consulate General in San Francisco and the residence of the Consul General in Seattle.\u201d\n\nThis is false: Russia has gravely violated diplomatic protocol by using its diplomatic properties to conduct intelligence activities prohibited by the Vienna convention, including interfering in the U.S. 2016 elections.", "lang": "en"}
