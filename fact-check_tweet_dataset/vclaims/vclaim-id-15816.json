India is a rich country but people are poor),\u201d is a caption affixed to the video that shows piles of half-burnt cash staked together. The video tweeted by Chowkidar Rohini (@RohiniShah73), who is followed by PM Modi, received over 2,000 and nearly 30,000 views (archive).\n\nThe video is circulated on Facebook alike, with claims suggesting it shows the cash recovered from Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath\u2019s secretary. From the account of a user Kanak Mishra, it received over 63,000 views (archive).\n\nIf one carefully watches the video, it is quite clear that the currency notes are not the Indian Rupee, but the Euro.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked this video when it was circulated in the names of Tamil Nadu MLA SP Velumani, Karnataka Congress minister DK Shivakumar and BJP MP Rajeev Chandrashekhar.\n\nThe clip actually represents a 2018 art installation in Spain. The notes were hand-painted by Spanish artist, Alejandro Monge, who uploaded the same video on his Instagram account, calling out the false claims ascribed to his artwork.\n\nThe caption of his post, written in Spanish, says, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things about the internet that something can go viral without knowing why it does\u2026 and then nobody knows what it is or who it is from. If people knew what sculpture is and knew the tickets are painted by hand\u2026 @monge-art share!!\u201d\n\nThe income tax department did carry out raids against alleged close aides of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath. However, this video has nothing to do with the recent raids and has, in the past, been pinned to several leaders across political parties.", "lang": "en"}
