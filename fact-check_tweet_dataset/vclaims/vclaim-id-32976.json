The data was not previously in the public domain.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s inappropriate for Ministers to use figures that aren\u2019t in the public domain, and figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from and how they\u2019re calculated.\n\nIt shows that each year, in England and Wales, roughly 40-60 people are convicted of rape who had previous rape convictions.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, there were 263 such convictions, making up 4% of all rape convictions.\n\nOver the same period, there were around 1,900 convictions for sexual assault, where the offender had a previous conviction for sexual assault. Based on the latest data for July-September 2017, the proportion of sexual offenders who reoffend (with a crime of any type) within a year is around 14%.\n\nThis covers all adult sexual offenders who were released from custody, received a non-custodial conviction at court or received a reprimand or warning in that three-month period.\n\nIt covers offences they committed in a one year period after their release/non-custodial conviction/reprimand. The level has stayed at between 14% and 16% for the last two years.", "lang": "en"}
