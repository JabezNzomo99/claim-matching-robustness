In the edited picture, the Trump-Pence campaign slogan has been superimposed over the words \u201cFraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\u201d on the banner.\n\nThe original photo, found on Getty Images, shows members of the Fraternal White Knights of the KKK participating in a march recognizing the birthday of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first grand wizard of the KKK, in Pulaski Tennessee, according to its caption. It was taken in July 2009, almost five years before Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election cycle, former KKK leader David Duke and KKK publication The Crusader expressed support for Trump. The then-candidate disavowed both endorsements.", "lang": "en"}
