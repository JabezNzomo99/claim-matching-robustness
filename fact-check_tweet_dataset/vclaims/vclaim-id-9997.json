That is more than the NHS pay bill, it is more than our schools budget, more than we spend on defence, as a result of the record we were left by Labour in government\u201d\n\nThe UK government\u2019s debt interest bill was about \u00a348 billion in 2016/17, but that\u2019s not the most meaningful figure to be using.\n\nThe government effectively pays some of that to itself. As we\u2019ve covered before, almost a quarter of government debt is owned by the Bank of England, which pays the profit back to the Treasury.\n\nThe total amount of spending on what are called \u2018public debt transactions\u2019 amounted to \u00a339 billion in 2016/17, once you take off what the Bank of England owns.\n\nThis is higher than spending on defence and primary education, but slightly lower than spending on secondary education.\n\nIt is also lower than the NHS pay bill. The Department of Health\u2019s annual report shows that \u00a348 billion was spent on permanent staff costs in 2016/17, increasing to \u00a354 billion when including other staff.", "lang": "en"}
