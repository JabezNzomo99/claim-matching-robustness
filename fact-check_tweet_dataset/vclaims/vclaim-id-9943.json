No, he did not, that is fake news made up by a website with a very dubious reputation.\n\nYourNewsWire posted an article on April 5, 2018 titled \"Body Of CDC Doctor Who Exposed Flu Shot Found Floating In River\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe body of the missing CDC doctor who controversially warned that this year's \"disastrous\" flu shot was responsible for the deadly flu epidemic, was found in an Atlanta river on Tuesday evening. Dr. Timothy J. Cunningham, 35, a team lead with CDC's Division of Population Health, went missing on February 12th, according to Atlanta police, with family and police desperate for answers regarding his sudden disappearance. Today police confirmed that his remains were pulled from the Chattahoochee River on April 3rd after being found by fishermen. He was found face up and covered in mud.\n\nThe part about the doctor being missing and later found dead is unfortunately accurate.\n\nBut the bit about the doctor claiming all sorts of things about the flu vaccine is completely fictional and no evidence has been provided for this claim:\n\nThe only source provided by YourNewsWire for their claim is a link to one of their own articles which in turn does not contain any verifiable sources for the things Cunningham supposedly said about the flu shots. It did however say that Cunningham was involved in administering shots directly to patients and that is something he would not be qualified for given his education and actual job as we noted at the time.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Russia And China Did NOT Roll Out 100% Gold-Backed Currency\n\u2022 Fake News: NOT Busted, Soros Did NOT Pay March For Our Lives Protestors $300 Each\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Forgive 4,444 Pedophile Priests In Australia\n\u2022 Fake News: Obama Did NOT Announce Bid To Become UN Secretary General", "lang": "en"}
