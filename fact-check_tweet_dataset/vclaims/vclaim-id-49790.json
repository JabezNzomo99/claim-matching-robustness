As per the screenshot, Patra tweeted on May 16, \u201cI am watching Ertugrul nowadays & I see narendra modi has similar leadership qualities as Ertugrul .His Strong belief in God, his Courage to not give up, His conviction to Stand on his principles even when everyone is against him. @narendramodi\u201d.\n\nSeveral Pakistan-based Twitter users shared the alleged screenshot of Patra\u2019s tweet including @Nomii394 (archive link) and an anonymous account Pakistan Strategic Forum (archive link).\n\nErtu\u011frul was a 13th-century Turkish warrior. Historical fiction series \u2018Dirili\u015f: Ertu\u011frul\u2019 is based on Ertu\u011frul\u2019s life who is considered the father of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire. The show, which glorifies Muslim heroes, depicts Ertu\u011frul as a champion for the cause of Islam. He is shown fighting off external enemies such as the Mongols, Christian Byzantines and Templars. The series has been banned by the governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt alleging that Turkey wishes to influence the regions via soft power. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan however has praised the show.\n\nThe screenshot was also tweeted by two Jammu & Kashmir National Conference members \u2014 Sajjad Shaheen (archive link) and Shafqat Watali (archive link).\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nIn order to check the authenticity of the viral screenshot, Alt News performed a keyword search on Twitter restricting results between May 15-17, to check if Sambit Patra made such a tweet. We were unable to find any results, suggesting that the tweet with either never posted or it has been deleted.\n\nTaking a closer look at the screenshot, Alt News noticed several visual clues that indicate the screenshot isn\u2019t authentic.\n\n1) \u2018Following\u2019 button is incorrectly placed \n\n The \u2018following\u2019 button appears on the right-hand-side of a genuine tweet, just beside the user\u2019s bio as seen below.\n\nHowever, the \u2018following\u2019 button appears on top of the tweet in the manufactured screenshot.\n\nThe date and time stamp are separated by a hyphen in the viral screenshot.\n\nHowever, Twitter places a \u2018dot\u2019 before and after the date stamp. Another point worthy of mention is that the fake tweet does not carry information about the device used to post the tweet, unlike in the case of genuine tweets.\n\n\n\nAll screenshots circulating online have the same number of likes and retweets. If Patra had indeed made such a tweet more screenshots would have been available.\n\nHence, the tweet where BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra is depicted comparing PM Modi with Ertu\u011frul is manufactured.", "lang": "en"}
