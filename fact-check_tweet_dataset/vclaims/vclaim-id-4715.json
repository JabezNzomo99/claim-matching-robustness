The claim, itself, is inaccurate in singling out Mexicans as the issue, which implies that illegal immigration has, in effect, been completely reversed. We\u2019ll get to that.\n\nThe domestic politics surrounding the issue are just as complicated. To state, simply, that the issue is \u201cnot so acute,\u201d is such a broad simplification as to be nearly meaningless. We have no such verdict. So, we have settled on \u201cpartially true,\u201d though it was a close call on whether the RT article, overall, is \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\nIs \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy an easy path to higher poll ratings?\n\nDmitry Evstafyev, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, argued that President Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric on immigration is just a \u201cpropaganda\u201d trick and the \u201ceasy path to raising his rating\u201d in an effort to win the Republican majority in the upcoming Congressional elections. \u201cFor him the ultimate goal of meetings with Putin [and] Kim Jong-un, and of immigration policy, is to win the elections, because it is not just about victory but about survival,\u201d Evstafyev said.\n\nThe Russian expert\u2019s claim about President Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration being an \u201ceasy path to raising his (poll) rating\u201d may have some factual basis.\n\nThe highly-cited blog on U.S. politics and polls Five Thirty Eight, states the immigration issue might have been \u201cmost responsible for Trump\u2019s winning the Republican nomination\u201d in 2016.\n\nAnd in the general election vote, the national exit poll showed Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 31 percent \u201camong voters who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country.\"\n\n\u200bYet current polling can cast a cautionary shadow on the president as he and his party approach the mid-term election. The Gallup Poll has asked Americans since 1967 if they believe immigration should be kept at its present level, increased or decreased.\n\nGallup finds in 2018, the number who believe immigration should be decreased is at its lowest level ever, 29 percent while those who respond that it should be increased is at its highest level, 28 percent.\n\nWhether that is a backlash to the president\u2019s tough policies, or a reflection of something else is, you guessed it, complicated.\n\nIs Immigration \"not so acute\" an issue in the U.S.?\n\nThe other expert cited by RT, Dmitry Mikheyev, dean of the Moscow International Business School, was a star of the Cold War era. According to his biography, after years in a Soviet prison, Mikheyev was handed over to the United States as a \u201cradical dissident.\u201d He became a U.S. citizen in 1985 and served as a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. After Vladimir Putin came to power, Mikheyev returned to Russia and became a supporter of Putin and adviser on Russia\u2019s U.S. policy.\n\nCommenting the U.S. President\u2019s immigration tweet, Mikheyev argued that the \u201cissue of migration to the United States is not so acute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outflow of Mexicans to their homeland is now higher than the influx into the States. The number illegally arriving in the country has also decreased,\u201d Mikheyev said.\n\nMikheyev is right that the number of illegal arrivals on the U.S. Southwest border has decreased and by quite a bit.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a comprehensive report on the Southwest border, reported the peak of illegal entries reached 1.8 million in the year 2000. The numbers fluctuated for several years but dropped precipitously during and after the 2008 economic crisis to 170,000 by 2016.\n\nApprehensions of illegal immigrants at the U.S. border are another measure of declining illegal immigration. The U.S. Customers and Border Patrol statistics for the last four years show a steady decrease of apprehensions -- from half a million in 2014 to 304,000 in 2017.\n\n\u200bIn the first nine months of this fiscal year, apprehensions stand at 382,526, up from last year but still trending downward relative to previous years.\n\nSo there is at least a kernel of truth in Mikheyev\u2019s analysis, though his focus on Mexicans is odd, reflecting perhaps the former Hudson Institute pundit\u2019s recent isolation from U.S. culture.\n\nThe combined flow of immigrants from Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatamala and Honduras, outpaced Mexicans beginning 2014.\n\nIn 2016, the Pew Research Center did report more Mexicans were leaving the U.S. than entering it. Yet, Mexicans are still a significant factor. So far this year 12,137 family members have tried to cross. Compare to 2,775 from El Salvador, 9,146 from Guatemala and 5,841 from Honduras.\n\nImmigration to the U.S. fluctuates over time but a constant is that many Americans consider their country to be \u2018a nation of immigrants.\u2019 The question of \u201cwho\u201d and \u201chow many\u201d is a political issue.\n\nAmid the recent mass protests against the \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, President Trump\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to 35 percent \u2013 his lowest, according to a CNN poll.", "lang": "en"}
