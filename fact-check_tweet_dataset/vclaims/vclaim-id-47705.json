(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo shared in the post is not from the Lansing rally, which was held April 15.\n\nThe photo dates back to at least March 2, when a Twitter user included it in a tweet. The user wrote that the photo showed counterprotesters at a rally for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that she attended at Ann Morrison Park in Boise, Idaho.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the photo whether the banner was in support of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, or whether it was meant to smear them.\n\nVideo that the fact-checking organization Snopes linked to appears to show the same man holding the banner at the Boise event.\n\nBoise news media reported that hundreds of people on Feb. 29 had marched from the capitol to the park, where an event was held in support of Sanders, who ended his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on April 8.\n\n\n\n A post containing a photo of a man carrying a banner that bears a swastika and the last names of the president and the vice president is not from a demonstration in Lansing, Mich., that protested stay-at-home coronavirus orders.", "lang": "en"}
