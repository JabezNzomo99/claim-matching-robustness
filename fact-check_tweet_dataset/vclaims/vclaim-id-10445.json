A Syrian news website by the name of Muraselon claims there was but the headline is highly misleading and the article itself seems to suffer from a bad understanding of French news articles.\n\nThe story was published on April 18, 2018 under the headline \"French naval scandal: Total failure in launching French naval missiles to strike Syria - Muraselon\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFrench newspaper revealed a scandal that the French navy failed to launch missiles in the night of the \"Tripartite Aggression\" on Syria. According to l'Opinion newspaper, a French military source has confirmed that the French navy faced a major failure in launching of many \"Scalp naval\" missiles from the group of missiles \"16\" in the frigate \"Freem\", which was on its way to hit targets in Syria. The source added that a number of rockets supposed to be fired at Syria. \"often, there was an intention to fire 16 rockets,\" the source said, adding that only three were fired from the entire French fleet. The source said that the French Navy and the maritime industry groups had not provided any explanations so far about the incident.\n\nUsers who only saw the summary of the story on social media could have gotten the impression the French navy did not launch any missiles at all:\n\nThe original source article the story is based on just states there were technical glitches with the launch of some missiles:\n\nThe Syrian article also incorrectly identifies the French ship as the frigate \"Freem\" while in reality there were three frigates present of the type \"FREMM\" (which stands for \"Fr\u00e9gate Multimissions\", or multi-mission frigate). The article goes on to talk about \"Scalp Naval\" missiles misfiring while this is the name of the air launched variety of the actual \"Missiles de Croisi\u00e8re Naval (MdCN)\" ship launched cruise missiles that were actually being talked about in French sources.\n\nThere appears to be actual video of the launch of the missiles according to website Navy Recognition:\n\nThere were media reports that an inital salvo of missiles failed to launch but that a second salvo was fired by a backup ship that was present for such contingencies:\n\nHaving an issue and then resorting to a backup plan that worked out as expected does not count as a total failure in our book, it rather speaks of effective planning and organisation.", "lang": "en"}
