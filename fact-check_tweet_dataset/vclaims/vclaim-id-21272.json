That would amount to \u201can average increase of 2.2% a year in real terms funding\u201d for the rest of this decade, according to analysis by the Health Foundation. Similar figures were reached by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto also said at the outset: \u201cLet\u2019s build a country where we invest our wealth to give everyone the best chance. That means \u2026 restoring the NHS to its place as the envy of the world\u201d. The party didn\u2019t directly connect this to its specific spending plans for the NHS.\n\nSo the funding increases the NHS is now set to get are higher, at least in the first few years, than Labour\u2019s plans at the last election.\n\nBut that\u2019s only part of the story.\n\n3.4% is also a lot more than the Conservatives initially pledged in 2017. Their plans were less generous than Labour\u2019s, amounting to 1.2% per year until 2020/21 according to both think tanks.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to the funding increases under the Coalition government until 2014/15. The historical average for health spending across the UK was 3.7% a year between 1950/51 to 2016/17.\n\nEven though Labour\u2019s plans were more generous, neither party pledged enough funds to meet growing demands on the NHS. The Health Foundation said Labour\u2019s plans would leave a \u00a37 billion funding gap by 2020/21, while the Conservative plans would have left a \u00a312 billion gap.\n\nThe latest 3.4% outstrips both of those, and will \u201chelp stem further decline in the health service\u201d according to the Health Foundation. But they and other health think tanks say funding needs to increase by at least 4% a year in real terms in order to meet the NHS\u2019s needs.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about this in our explainer on the government\u2019s funding announcement.", "lang": "en"}
