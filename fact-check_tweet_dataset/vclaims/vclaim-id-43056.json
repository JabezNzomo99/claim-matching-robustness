The claim is false; the video shows tower blocks in the Chinese city of Shanghai; the audio in the clip directly corresponds with audio from a scene in the 1988 film Coming to America.\n\nThe video was published on Twitter here on February 12, 2020.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 200,000 times.\n\nThe nine-second footage shows a group of apartment blocks. In the clip\u2019s audio, a person can be heard shouting: \u201cGood morning my neighbours! Hey fuck you! Yes, yes, fuck you too\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cMeanwhile in Wuhan, China. Residents are quarantined..\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan remains on lockdown after the oubreak of the novel coronavirus which has killed nearly 1,800 people and infected more than 70,000 in China, as reported by AFP here on February 17, 2020.\n\nThe same video was shared here, here and here on Twitter with a similar claim.\n\nThe video was also shared here on YouTube with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video was filmed in Shanghai and the audio has been edited to include the dialogue.\n\nA building in the background of the footage displays simplified Chinese characters which translate to English as \u201caffiliated Putuo hospital\u201d.\n\nThe location shown in the misleading video was can be seen here on Baidu Maps next to the Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, also known as the Central Hospital of Putuo, Shanghai.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a photo from the hospital page on Baidu Maps, which shows the same building with Chinese characters on the top:\n\nAFP found this identical video on the Chinese app Douyin based on the Douyin ID seen in the top left-hand corner of the video in the misleading posts.\n\nDouyin is the Chinese version of mobile video app TikTok.\n\nThe original video, published on February 3, 2020, can be seen with a green location tag in the bottom left-hand corner which states \u201cShanghai\u201d. The sound bar at the bottom side states the user who posted the video has used a background sound created by another Douyin user called \u6c49\u54e5\u7684\u6545\u4e8b (American flag emoji).\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original video on Douyin\u2019s mobile version, with the location tag and background sound bar circled in red:\n\nThe audio in the clip directly corresponds with the audio of this scene in the 1988 film Coming to America.\n\nIn the film scene, lead actor Eddie Murphy can be heard saying: \u201cGood morning my neighbours! Yes, yes, fuck you too!\u201d\n\nAs of February 4, 2020, Shanghai\u2019s city government ruled that mandatory quarantine would only be implemented for people who have travelled from key epidemic areas including Wuhan.\n\nThe ruling was published here on Chinese State Council Information Office\u2019s website.\n\nIt translates in part as: \u201cFor those who come to or back to Shanghai from key places such as Hubei province, according to related regulation, shall strictly follow the order to stay at home or centralized isolation sites for 14 days, also report to communities consciously and accept their management. If no abnormal situation happens during the time, they would be allowed to work normally after that.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
