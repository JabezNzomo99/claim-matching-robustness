Beto O\u2019Rourke got it wrong in claiming \u201cno other country comes even close to\u201d the number of gun-violence deaths in the United States. Brazil had more firearm injury deaths in 2016 and several countries have higher firearm death rates.\n\u2022 Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson made misleading claims about the 2017 Republican tax cut, wrongly painting it as providing all or nearly all its benefits to the wealthiest Americans.\n\u2022 Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper implied that there has been no manufacturing job growth when he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the small manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back?\u201d Under Trump, the economy has added nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\u2022 None When addressing climate change, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg called 2030 a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d and O\u2019Rourke said scientists say there aren\u2019t \u201cmore than 10 years to get this right.\u201d Those conclusions misconstrue the findings of a special report from the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u2022 None Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio falsely claimed farmers \u201chaven\u2019t made a profit in five years.\u201d Actually, farm profits haven\u2019t fallen below $60 billion a year in over a decade.\n\u2022 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said \u201ctonight in America\u201d there are \u201c87 million uninsured or underinsured.\u201d The figure includes 19.3 million who were insured when surveyed but had a gap in coverage in the prior year.\n\u2022 Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pitched her \u201cwealth tax\u201d plan to fund several child care and education programs, but some economists are skeptical that she can deliver as much revenue as she expects.\n\u2022 O\u2019Rourke said \u201c wind and solar jobs are the fastest-growing jobs in the country.\u201d The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that solar photovoltaic installers and wind turbine technicians will be the fastest-growing, on a percentage basis, by 2026. But they aren\u2019t currently the fastest-growing occupations.\n\u2022 Both former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and Hickenlooper said, incorrectly, that the Green New Deal guarantees every American a government job. The nonbinding resolution does not specify that the jobs are in the public sector.\n\nThe second set of Democratic primary debates was hosted by CNN at Detroit\u2019s Fox Theatre on July 30 with 10 candidates. Another 10 will take the stage on July 31.\n\nO\u2019Rourke falsely claimed that \u201cno other country\u201d has as many firearm-related deaths as the U.S.\n\nO\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t specify a time period, but 39,773 people died from firearm-related injuries in the U.S. in 2017, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Of those deaths, 60% were suicides and 36.6% were homicides.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true that no other country comes close to the U.S., as O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 43,200 firearm injury deaths in Brazil, according to a 2018 study published in JAMA. That was more than the estimated 37,200 firearm deaths that year in the U.S. Mexico, with an estimated 15,400 deaths by firearms, was the next closest country.\n\nThe U.S., with 10.6 deaths per 100,000 people, also did not have the highest firearm injury death rate. More than a dozen countries had a higher rate than the U.S., including Brazil (19.4), Honduras (22.5), Guatemala (32.3) and Venezuela (38.7). El Salvador\u2019s rate of 39.2 deaths per 100,000 people was the highest.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also claimed that the CDC is \u201cprevented from actually studying the issue [of gun violence] in the first place.\u201d Under what\u2019s known as the Dickey Amendment, no CDC funds \u201cfor injury prevention and control \u2026 may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control.\u201d However, compromise language accompanying a 2018 spending bill clarified that, while that prohibition remains, \u201cthe Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 31: A spokesman for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told us the former congressman meant that \u201cno other developed country comes close to the number of gun deaths\u201d in the U.S. That claim is accurate, but it\u2019s not what he said in the debate.\n\n\n\nThe candidates engaged in some misleading claims about the effects of the 2017 Republican tax cut.\n\n\u201cLeft everyone behind?\u201d \u2014 Klobuchar referred to the bill as \u201cthat regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer.\u201d\n\nThe bill did benefit wealthy people like those able to afford the $200,000 membership fee to join Trump\u2019s Palm Beach resort. A 2017 analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that in 2018 the average tax cut for those in the top one-tenth of 1% in income would amount to $193,380.\n\nBut the bill certainly didn\u2019t \u201cleave everyone behind.\u201d The TPC analysis estimated that the middle 20% in income would get an average cut of $930 in 2018.\n\nKlobuchar would have been correct to say that the bill favored the rich more than others. The TPC analysis estimated that the middle 20% would see their after-tax income go up 1.6%, less than half the 3.4% increase in after-tax income for the top 1%.\n\n\u201c83 cents\u201d? \u2014 Williamson dusted off a shopworn and misleading Democratic talking point that we\u2019ve debunked before. She said, \u201cWe had a $2 trillion tax cut, where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us.\u201d That\u2019s misleading.\n\nButtigieg broached the subject in his opening statement, saying, \u201cScience tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.\u201d O\u2019Rourke also referenced a similar time period. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to the scientists on this, and they\u2019re very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 10 years to get this right.\u201d In his closing statement, Buttigieg returned to the idea, adding, \u201cBy 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate.\u201d As we explained in our coverage of the last Democratic debate, the time frames both politicians reference are pulled from a special report issued by the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018. The IPCC report concluded that to avoid many of the more severe impacts of climate change, global warming would have to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u2014 or about half a degree more than current warming. To reach that goal, the report said carbon dioxide emissions around the world would need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, and be net-zero by 2050. With just 12 years between 2018 and 2030, the report\u2019s message was misinterpreted by many to mean that just over a decade remained to take action on climate change, or before an ecological catastrophe. \u201cThe problem with that framing from a scientific perspective is that climate change is not pass/fail,\u201d Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist at NASA explained in a phone interview. \u201cThe 1.5 and 2 degree thresholds aren\u2019t magical tipping points,\u201d he said, where \u201cwe\u2019re okay before then and it\u2019s a disaster afterwards.\u201d The consequences will be worse if we wait, he said, but even if the world surpasses 2 degrees of warming, any action we take to prevent further warming would still have value. It\u2019s a point that other scientists have made as well. \u201cPlease stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030,\u201d wrote Myles Allen, an author of the IPCC report and the leader of the ECI Climate Research Programme at the University of Oxford, in a Conversation article. \u201cBad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters, but the IPCC does not draw a \u2018planetary boundary\u2019 at 1.5\u00b0C beyond which lie climate dragons.\u201d Sonali McDermid, a climate scientist at New York University, noted in an email that the longer we wait to take action, the harder it will be to make progress on climate change, which after the 1.5 degree target, could lead to or exacerbate loss of key ecosystems, increases in extremes, changes in seasonality that affect food production and infrastructure, and higher sea level rise. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 imply or mean that we just give up after 12 years,\u201d she wrote. So while the candidates are correct to say that scientists have warned about the effects of climate change \u2014 and advocate for sooner, rather than later movement on the issue \u2014 it\u2019s not the case that 2030 is a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d or that there is a particular deadline for taking action. Ryan said of farmers, \u201cThey haven\u2019t made a profit in five years.\u201d That\u2019s far from being true. The Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently projected that net farm income would rise 10% this year, to $69.4 billion. And that broad measure of farm profits hasn\u2019t been below $60 billion since 2006. It\u2019s true that net farm income peaked at $123 billion in 2013 \u2014 a period of high commodity prices. Ryan would have been on firmer ground had he said farmers haven\u2019t seen a big profit increase in five years.\n\nSanders twice said that there were \u201c87 million uninsured or underinsured,\u201d saying this was the case \u201ctonight in America, as we speak.\u201d A Commonwealth Fund study supports that figure, though it includes those who were insured at the time they were surveyed but had had a gap in coverage in the prior year. \u201cOf the 194 million U.S. adults ages 19 to 64 in 2018, an estimated 87 million, or 45 percent, were inadequately insured,\u201d the study found, directing readers to Tables 1 and 2. The 87 million figure includes: 24 million uninsured in 2018, 43.8 million who were \u201cunderinsured\u201d and 19.3 million who were insured at the time of the survey but had a gap in coverage in the previous year. The underinsured measure looks at out-of-pocket costs, not including insurance premiums, and the plan deductible. It includes people whose out-of-pocket costs were 10 percent or more of household income over 12 months, or 5 percent or more of household income for those earning under 200% of the federal poverty level; it also includes those whose deductibles were 5 percent or more of household income. The study found that fewer adults were uninsured in 2018, compared with 2010, but more people were underinsured. Warren defended her plan to fund child care and education by taxing \u201cthe top one-tenth of 1% of fortunes in this country.\u201d By collecting a 2% tax on net worth over $50 million and a 3% tax on net worth over $1 billion, Warren promises to provide universal child care for kids up to age 5 and universal pre-K, raise the wages of child care and preschool teachers, offer free tuition at community and technical colleges, dedicate $50 billion to historically black colleges and universities, and cancel student debt for 95 percent of those who have it. Delivering on that promise depends on her tax plan generating $2.75 trillion over 10 years. But some economists are skeptical that it will actually raise that much. We wrote about it here. An op-ed from Lawrence Summers, a former treasury secretary and an economic adviser to former President Barack Obama, and Natasha Sarin, a law and business professor, suggested that Warren\u2019s plan would raise about 40% of the projection. The Warren campaign hit back on the criticisms raised in that piece, arguing that the tax plan wouldn\u2019t be weakened by loopholes and would include funds to bolster IRS enforcement. But it\u2019s far from settled as to whether or not Warren\u2019s plan will be able to pay for everything it has promised. When asked about the economic impact of policy proposals that would reduce public reliance on fossil fuels, O\u2019Rourke said \u201cwind and solar jobs are the fastest-growing jobs in the country.\u201d We covered this issue once before \u2014 when Washington Gov. Jay Inslee made a similar statement \u2014 and found no federal data that could support such a claim. The BLS, the country\u2019s official custodian of employment data, discontinued collecting data on all so-called \u201cgreen jobs\u201d in 2013. However, the agency does measure the number of jobs for some individual green occupations on an annual basis and projects job growth for these occupations. In 2017, BLS projected that solar photovoltaic installers and wind turbine technicians will be the two fastest-growing occupations by 2026. But that\u2019s future growth, not current growth, and it is on a percentage basis. The actual number of additional jobs projected by 2026 is quite small. By 2026, BLS projects there will be 11,800 additional solar installers and 5,600 new wind turbine service technicians. That would be a 105 percent increase in solar photovoltaic installers and a 96 percent increase in wind turbine technicians from 2016 levels. By contrast, the third fastest-growing occupation \u2014 home health aides \u2014 will add 431,200 jobs, an increase of 47 percent. Home health aides also appears on the agency\u2019s \u201cmost new jobs\u201d projections, but the solar and wind jobs do not. We also found that, as of May 2018, there were an estimated 8,950 solar installers and 5,580 wind turbine service technicians. But a BLS spokesman told us that those figures represent a moving three-year average, so those figures should not be compared with those from previous years. The BLS data limitations make it impossible to measure the growth in \u201cgreen jobs\u201d in a way that is comparable with other occupations tracked by the agency.\n\nTwo candidates misrepresented the Green New Deal during the debate, inaccurately stating that the nonbinding resolution offers Americans a guarantee of a government job. When asked why he felt the Green New Deal was unrealistic, Delaney responded, \u201cWell, first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.\u201d Hickenlooper made the same claim in the last debate, and repeated it again twice in this debate. The Green New Deal, he said, would \u201cmake sure that every American is guaranteed a government job that they want.\u201d Later, when Hickenlooper was also asked why he is opposed to the Green New Deal, he replied, \u201cWell, I think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem. It\u2019s a distraction.\u201d As we explained after the June debate, the Green New Deal guarantees \u201ca job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d The legislation, which failed to advance in the Senate in March, does not require the job be a public sector position.\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease 2016 Injury Collaborators. \u201cGlobal Mortality From Firearms, 1990-2016.\u201d JAMA. 28 Aug 2018.\n\nSanthanam, Laura. \u201cThere\u2019s a new global ranking of gun deaths.
