And to be sure, the president has shifted some existing resources in an attempt to reduce violent crime in cities and has proposed significant increases in school-choice programs for students from low-income families. But the reductions to other programs that benefit cities cut much deeper.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about funding for inner cities came during a press conference on Aug. 15 in which he defended his response to the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Trump argued that job creation would have \u201ca tremendous, positive impact on race relations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re spending a lot of money on the inner cities,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix \u2014 we\u2019re fixing the inner cities. We\u2019re doing far more than anybody\u2019s done with respect to the inner cities. It\u2019s a priority for me. And it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office for support for the president\u2019s claim, but we did not receive a response.\n\nTrump promised repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would fix the \u201cunacceptable\u201d condition of America\u2019s inner cites, but the president\u2019s proposed 2018 budget provides little backing for his claim that \u201cwe\u2019re doing far more than anybody\u2019s done with respect to the inner cities.\u201d And while Congress is unlikely to pass Trump\u2019s budget plan, it provides a window into the president\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cThere is no discussion taking place in the White House that I am aware of about new initiatives, programs, or investments in inner cities,\u201d Robert Silverman, a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University at Buffalo, told us. \u201cThe federal agencies that have some of the greatest impacts on urban areas are [Housing and Urban Development], the Department of Education, [Health and Human Services], Transportation, and the [Environmental Protection Agency]. The Trump Administration has proposed to cut the budgets of all of those agencies by at least 12 percent in FY2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EPA has some of the most drastic cuts, exceeding 30 percent,\u201d Silverman said via email. \u201cIn my area, housing, the White House has reduced proposed funding levels for fair housing and a variety of affordable housing programs, and delayed implementation of newly adopted administrative rules related to those programs. It seems that is the approach in other agencies as well.\u201d\n\nIn a survey of 68 (mostly Democratic) U.S. mayors in April, Politico Magazine found that 88 percent said Trump\u2019s proposed budget \u201cwould be \u2018devastating\u2019 or \u2018extremely painful\u2019 to their city.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, the budget proposal would increase funding for defense, homeland security and veterans affairs, and make cuts in all other executive departments and agencies.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, nondefense spending would be cut by about $54 billion, or 10 percent.\n\nCRFB says the cuts to housing and community development programs would include the elimination of: the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Community Services Block Grant program (a program designed to lessen poverty in communities), HOME Investment Partnership Program (which provides grants to develop low-income housing), the Choice Neighborhoods program (which seeks to help communities struggling with distressed housing), and the Community Development Financial Institutions program (which provides sources of capital to distressed neighborhoods). It would also reduce rental assistance programs by 5 percent and funding for NeighborWorks, a nonprofit housing and community development organization, by 85 percent.\n\nIn the \u201cfull\u201d budget proposal released in May, Trump proposes cutting the Housing and Urban Development budget by $6.2 billion, or 13.2 percent. In a press briefing in March, Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, singled out HUD as being rife with wasteful and duplicative programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of money on Housing and Urban Development over the last decades without a lot to show for it,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nThe biggest ticket item on the HUD chopping block is the Community Development Block Grant program, which Trump has proposed to completely eliminate.\n\nAccording to the budget blueprint released in March, CDBG, which provides grants to cities and states for a variety of community development programs, \u201chas not demonstrated results.\u201d\n\nThat assessment is not shared by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which sent Congress a letter in July urging its members to support the CDBG program at a level of $3.3 billion next year.\n\n\u201cCDBG is one of the most effective federal programs for growing local economies and for providing a lifeline to families and communities with proven results,\u201d the mayors\u2019 letter states. \u201cIt has provided funds in every state, including housing investments, public infrastructure improvements, and economic development, while also providing public services, including services for seniors, youth, the disabled, and employment training. \u2026 This program helps more than 1,200 cities, counties, states, and rural areas that meet the needs of low- and moderate-income people and communities.\u201d\n\nPenned by the U.S. Conference of Mayors president, vice president, second vice president and CEO, the letter was signed by the mayors of more than 350 U.S. cities.\n\nThe Urban Institute also has contested the White House\u2019s determination that the CDBG program has not demonstrated results. The report \u201cTaking Stock of the Community Development Block Grant\u201d concluded: \u201cThe Trump administration has proposed to eliminate CDBG funding, and the program has faced criticism for the lack of evidence on its benefits. This lack of evidence, though, may be more related to a lack of investment in evaluating the program rather than to a lack of true impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s special about the Community Development Block Grant program is that it provides the flexible resources you need to revitalize neighborhoods that are struggling,\u201d Solomon Greene, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told us. What it means to \u201cfix\u201d a city can mean different things to different cities, Greene said, whether that be affordable housing, addressing crumbling infrastructure or connecting people with jobs. And CDBG funds allow cities the flexibility to address those unique needs.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s proposed budget would cut education spending by $9.2 billion, or 13.5 percent, including cuts in programs designed to help young children from low-income families.\n\nThe budget, for example, would eliminate $1.2 billion in funding for an after-school program \u2014 the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \u2013 that the Education Department says targets \u201cstudents who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools.\u201d\n\nThe administration, however, points to increased funding in other areas for low-income students.\n\nThe biggest increase would be in Title 1 funding, which is awarded to schools with high numbers of children from low-income families. The department\u2019s budget proposes an additional $1 billion for Title 1, up to $15.9 billion, to provide funding for a new school-choice program called Furthering Options for Children to Unlock Success, or FOCUS. The grant money would be awarded to school districts \u201cwith open enrollment systems that allow Federal, State, and local funds to follow students to the public school of their choice,\u201d the department budget says.\n\nThe FOCUS grant money is part of what Education Week described as \u201ca historic $1.4 billion federal investment in school choice.\u201d The budget also would award $250 million in scholarships for low-income students who want to attend private schools and increase charter-school funding by $168 million.\n\nThe NAACP opposes the shift of funds to school-choice programs, saying such efforts undermine \u201calready underfunded [public] school districts.\u201d\n\nOn balance, John B. King Jr. \u2014 the president and CEO of The Education Trust, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of low-income students \u2014 called Trump\u2019s budget \u201can assault on the American Dream,\u201d citing cuts in after-school and preschool programs in particular.\n\n\u201cThis shortsighted and cruel proposal would make the climb to success much steeper for all our young people, especially students of color and students from low-income families,\u201d King, a former education secretary under President Barack Obama, said in a May 23 statement. \u201cInstead of investing in the future, the proposal underfunds or eliminates many vital supports that give people the opportunities and tools to better their lives.\u201d\n\nDarrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, told us that the Trump administration is still operating under the budget enacted under President Obama, \u201cso there has not been any increase in funding for dealing with crime in inner cities.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, the Department of Justice has taken some steps to address violent crime in certain cities using existing resources.\n\nIn June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would partner with 12 cities to combat violent crime as part of a program called the National Public Safety Partnership.\n\n\u201cThe program existed before \u2014 it was the Violence Reduction Network \u2014 in addition to the name change I think there were cities added,\u201d Stephens wrote to us in an email. \u201cPolice routinely work with the federal agencies on a number of problems.\u201d\n\nStephens said \u201cthe big increase [in resources] was in Chicago,\u201d where the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in June sent 20 ATF agents in an attempt to reduce the gun violence in that city.\n\nAs for next fiscal year, Stephens said his organization has not done an analysis of Trump\u2019s proposed budget for 2018. However, Michael F. Crowley, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, has done a review of nine federal grant programs that could potentially reduce violent crime. Crowley\u2019s analysis found a slight decrease in violence-related grants.\n\nCrowley, who worked as a budget analyst in the White House Office of Management and Budget under both Republican and Democratic presidents, said there are two major federal grant programs for combating crime: the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs, known as Byrne JAG, which provide general operating funds based on a formula, and the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, grant for hiring police officers. According to Crowley, Trump\u2019s proposed budget would increase funding for COPS, but decrease it for Byrne, resulting in a net reduction of $55.1 million, or nearly 12 percent, in the two major programs.\n\nOverall, there would be a net reduction of about $7.1 million, or 1 percent, across nine grant programs that could potentially address violent crime, according to Crowley\u2019s analysis.\n\nMayors and police chiefs in major U.S. cities have expressed concern about the potential for the Trump administration to take away some of that money for failure to comply with the president\u2019s executive order on so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nSanctuary cities limit the degree to which local police are willing to cooperate with federal requests to detain immigrants living in the country illegally. The president\u2019s order would withhold funding for cities that do not cooperate.\n\nIn a joint statement, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities Chiefs Association warned earlier this year that a crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities will interfere with \u201cpolice-community relations\u201d and hamper efforts to reduce crime.\n\n\u201cCities that aim to build trusting and supportive relations with immigrant communities should not be punished because this is essential to reducing crime and helping victims, both stated goals of the new Administration in Washington,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn balance, Crowley said discretionary funding resources available to the president and attorney general for fighting crime are limited. \u201cSo, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019re seeing any great surge in resources for cities in terms of DOJ grants based on anything that the Trump administration is doing,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
