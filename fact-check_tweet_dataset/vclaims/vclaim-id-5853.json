This claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nOn July 9, de Blasio, accompanied by his wife Chirlane Irene McCray and Reverend Al Sharpton, joined activists to paint \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in giant yellow letters on the city\u2019s exclusive Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, once the crown jewel in President Donald Trump\u2019s property empire ( here , here ).\n\nDe Blasio joined dozens of people wearing masks and pushing paint rollers to create the block-long mural, following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.\n\nOn Thursday, August 13, organizers of the annual event known as \u201cTribute in Light,\u201d which pays tribute to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, announced the event would be cancelled in 2020 due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic ( here ).\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s beloved twin beams of light regrettably will not shine over Lower Manhattan as part of this year\u2019s tributes,\u201d Michael Frazier, a memorial and museum spokesman, said in a statement ( here )\n\nThe event usually requires over 40 stagehands and electricians working in close quarters for over a week, the New York Times reported ( here ). The decision was made by officials \u201cafter concluding the health risks during the pandemic were far too great for the large crew.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore false to claim that de Blasio cancelled the annual memorial event.\n\nThe National 9/11 Memorial and Museum does not regularly receive city or state funds to cover its operating costs, although it has received federal aid due to the pandemic ( here ).\n\nThe cancellation of the event prompted a backlash, and two days later New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that it would continue as planned with financial support from the state and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg ( here ).\n\nPartly false. Bill de Blasio joined activists to paint a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d mural but did not cancel 9/11 memorial light show. The show was reinstated by Andrew Cuomo after the organizers announced it was cancelled.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
