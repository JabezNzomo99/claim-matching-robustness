As reported by the Russian government-funded broadcaster RT, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the U.S. sanctions back in September, said that the U.S. was seeking to \u201cbury\u201d Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and \u201cforce-feed\u201d its own LNG to Europe.\n\nRussian media coverage of the issue generally has a similar spin. In a recent example, RT\u2019s website posted an analysis headlined: \u201cHow long can Europe survive without Russian gas?\u201d\n\nThe RT piece cited a report by Italy\u2019s La Stampa newspaper, but misrepresented it. The La Stampa piece examined possible scenarios and consequences \u201cif new supply problems arise from Russia,\u201d noting that such \u201cblockade crises\u201d occurred in the past, when Gazprom, Russia\u2019s giant natural gas monopoly, left entire countries without gas for a week during bitterly cold winter weather.\n\nHowever, the thrust of the La Stampa piece was contrary to RT\u2019s claim that \u201creplacing the Russian pipeline gas with American LNG does not increase, but reduces the energy security of the EU.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cenergy security\u201d actually mean?\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), the Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization consisting of 29 member countries, defines energy security as \u201cthe uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price.\u201d\n\nIn supplying gas to Europe, Russia has clearly not provided for \u201cthe uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price.\u201d Indeed, it has repeatedly failed to provide for an \u201cuninterrupted availability of supplies\u201d to its European clients, not because of accidents or other circumstances beyond its control, but because it intentionally cut off or significantly reduced gas supplies to Europe in the dead of winter, leaving millions without heat.\n\nRussia has dominated the European energy market for nearly two decades, supplying the continent with more than 34 percent of its entire gas consumption.\n\nDuring that time, European governments repeatedly accused Russia of systematically abusing its dominant position in the market and using the EU\u2019s dependency on Russian gas supplies as leverage against those Moscow considered political rivals.\n\nBased on these accusations, the European Commission in 2012 initiated an anti-trust case against Gazprom. In announcing the investigation\u2019s preliminary findings in April 2014, the Commission accused Gazprom of \u201cunfair practices,\u201d saying the Russian gas monopoly \u201chad used its commanding position in the region to demand high prices and restrict its captive customers' ability to secure supplies from other sources.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 38 European countries, including all of those in the EU, carried out energy security stress tests in 2014. They simulated two energy supply disruption scenarios for a period of one or six months: a complete halt of Russian gas imports to the EU and a disruption of Russian gas imports through the Ukrainian transit route.\n\nStill, the Russian government and Gazprom\u2019s management continue to insist that Russia is \u201cone of the world\u2019s most reliable\u201d suppliers \u2013 a claim Polygraph.info previously investigated and debunked.\n\nBut is U.S. LNG export really \u201creplacing\u201d Russia on the EU market, and is it \u201creducing\u201d European energy security?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. exported LNG to Europe in 2017, with three shipments to Portugal, two to Lithuania and Italy and one each to the United Kingdom, Poland and Netherlands. All the shipments totaled 33,915 MMcf (million standard cubic feet), which is less than one percent of Europe\u2019s gas consumption.\n\nThe European Union estimates that LNG from providers including the U.S., Norway, United Arab Emirates and Russia could represent 25% of the total EU gas supplies by 2030.\n\nThis means, however, that even from a long-term perspective, the U.S. will not become a dominant trader in the EU energy market even if demand for American LNG increases significantly. The \u201cRoadmap of the EU-Russia Energy Cooperation until 2050\u201d plan demonstrates that, despite all the problems, Russia will remain one of Europe\u2019s main natural gas suppliers.\n\nRussia\u2019s projected long-term domination of the European energy market is most likely due to the fact that five major EU companies have been investing in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is 100 percent owned by Gazprom. Austria\u2019s OMV, France\u2019s Engie, Germany\u2019s Uniper and Wintershall, and Anglo-Dutch Shell together invested 1.43 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in Nord Stream 2 in 2017, and committed to fund up to 10% each of the project's total estimated cost of 9.5 billion euros ($11.2 billion), if needed.\n\nTherefore, RT\u2019s claim about U.S. LNG \u201creplacing\u201d Russian gas in Europe is exaggerated, if not false.\n\nContrary to RT\u2019s claim, the U.S. entry into the EU energy market is helping to provide energy security as defined by the IEA, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. LNG is the price setter driving down Gazprom prices,\u201d Anders Aslund, a Senior Fellow in Global Business and Economics at the Atlantic Council, told Polygraph.info.\n\nFormer Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, currently a Senior Fellow in Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution, called RT\u2019s claim \u201cdefinitely not accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more suppliers you have to choose from the more stable and secure is your position as a consumer. Normally, competition leads to lower prices. I do not understand why the European gas market should be different,\u201d Aleksashenko told Polygraph.info.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data from 2011, the most expensive natural gas on the international market at that time was from Japan and Russia.\n\nIn response to Lithuania\u2019s decision at the end of 2014 to import U.S. LNG, Gazprom offered a 23% discount on pipeline gas supplies. This was evidence that the arrival of U.S. natural gas in the European market is lowering prices, particularly given that Russia does not want to give up its market share. Russia has also recently discounted supplies to Ukraine in an attempt to make its gas exports competitive now that Kyiv can import gas from the West.\n\nThe U.S.'s stated goal in entering the EU energy market is to provide Europeans with alternative energy supplies.\n\nIn a speech in Warsaw on July 6, U.S. President Donald Trump said: \u201cWe are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a Warsaw press conference ahead of the G20 summit meeting, Trump stated: \"Let me be clear about one crucial point. The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You don't want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation.\"", "lang": "en"}
