It\u2019s certainly been featured in almost every major newspaper this week after the figures apparently came to light when a Minister in the Department for Education provided the information to a fellow MP.\n\nBut the fact that a third of teachers leave state schools five years after qualifying isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s been very close to that for the last 15 years.\n\nInformation on how many teachers remain in state schools in England each year after they have qualified is published annually and goes as far back as 1996.\n\nAlthough the number of teachers qualifying has been generally increasing since figures began in 1996, the drop-off rate after this period has remained roughly similar. There have been changes in when the data is collected, so the comparison over time isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nThe figures also don\u2019t tell us anything about what happened to these teachers. We know they weren\u2019t working in state schools, but they may have moved into private education or they may have given up the profession altogether. Even more simply it may also mean that the teachers have moved to work in state schools which are outside of England, but still within the UK.\n\nThey might also come back to work in state schools in England again later in their career. The figures don\u2019t tell us what proportion of teachers do this, but they do tell us that they still count teachers who don\u2019t have \u201ccontinuous service\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
