This makes up just a mere 7.84% of the allegedly stolen 3,500 metric tons.\n\nTotal gold in the country even increased after the alleged shipment in December 2014, albeit very minimally. The Philippines had 194.9 tons of gold in the third quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, it jumped to 195.3 tons.\n\nThe purported value of the shipped gold is also way off the official gold reserves value reported by the BSP. Based on data from the central bank, the highest value of gold recorded in the Philippines since 2000 was $10.4 billion in 2012. This is just 7.34% of the alleged stolen value of $141 billion.\n\nThe value of the country's total gold reserves did drop from end-2014 to end-2015, but the difference was only $780.7 million. The country's gold was only valued at $7.5 billion in 2014, and it decreased to $6.7 billion in 2015.\n\nThere was also a claim that the gold bars shipped to Thailand were part of the Marcoses' ill-gotten wealth, which may explain why the figures don't match the official data from the central bank. But that has also been previously debunked. (Read: HOAX: Marcos gold bars, jewelry \u2018taken by Aquinos,\u2019 opposition) \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
