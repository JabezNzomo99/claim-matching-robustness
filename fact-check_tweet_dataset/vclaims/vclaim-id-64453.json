Dianne Feinstein once said, \u201cAll vets are mentally ill in some way and government should prevent them from owning firearms.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Feinstein ever made the comment. A Feinstein spokesperson denied the senator ever said it.\n\nThe claim that Feinstein once disparaged U.S. military veterans by saying they are all \u201cmentally ill in some way\u201d has circulated the internet since at least 2013. It recently resurfaced in a widely shared Facebook post that insists, \u201cShe really said it on Thursday in a meeting in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any record of her making the comment in a search of resources like her Senate website and the congressional record. It appears nowhere on her social media, and media outlets have not attributed the quote to her.\n\nTom Mentzer, a spokesman for Feinstein, told The Associated Press in 2018 that the quote was false.

While in a committee markup of the bill, Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn proposed an amendment that would allow military veterans to be exempt from the ban, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn response, Feinstein expressed concern about such an exemption, saying, \u201cThe problem with expanding this is that, you know, with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it\u2019s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this,\u201d according to video of the hearing.\n\nShe added that she would be \u201chappy to sit down with you again and see if we can work something out but I think we have to \u2013 if you\u2019re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally, don\u2019t have access to this kind of weapon.\u201d\n\nVideo of the committee hearing shows Feinstein is raising concerns about the mental health of some veterans, not all. At no point during the debate does she suggest that all veterans suffer from mental illness or that they should be prohibited from owning all types of firearms.\n\nThe false quote has been debunked previously by several fact-checking websites, including Factcheck.org, Snopes and PolitiFact.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s office did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
