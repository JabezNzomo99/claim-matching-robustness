{"title": "Fake news about Amritsar train driver's suicide circulates on social media", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2018-10-22T11:56:20+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39444", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/fake-news-about-amritsar-train-drivers-suicide-circulates-on-social-media/", "vclaim": "A photo and video of a man who seems to have committed suicide by hanging himself from a bridge is viral on social media with a caption, \u201cAmritsar Accident k train driver ne suicide kar lia #RIP\u201d. The claim suggests that that the man in the viral photo is the train driver involved in the Amritsar tragedy.\n\nMany social media users on Facebook and Twitter are sharing pictures and videos of the same incident with identical claims.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News spoke to SHO Gurwinder Singh of Chattiwind police station, where a case of suicide near Tarn Tarn area has been reported. Singh said, \u201cThis suicide is no way related to the train tragedy. This man was in depression from last four months.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn article published by Dainik Jagran on October 22, 2018, stated, \u201cIn fact, the body hanging from a trap near Bohdu village was of a resident from Bhikhwind, Tarn Tarn named Paramjeet. It is said that Paramjeet was mentally ill and possibly for this reason he has committed suicide. Police is investigating the case.\u201d It may be noted that an earlier report from Dainik Jagran has referred the same person as Harpal Sah. While we still lack clarity on the name of the person whose photos are circulating on social media, based on our conversation with the police and media reports, it can be stated with certainty that the said person is NOT the driver of the ill-fated train involved in the Amritsar tragedy.\n\nMoreover, the letter which is being shared along with the claim that DMU driver (Arvind Kumar) has committed suicide is the statement given by him to the police and NOT a suicide note.\n\nIn all cases of recent tragedies, misinformation on social media has been a constant issue. Recently, during Kerala floods, Alt News exposed multiple cases of mis/disinformation. Earlier, Alt News exposed how attempts were made to communalise the Amritsar train tragedy by claiming that the name of the train driver was Imtiaz Ali. Now, a suicide unrelated to the Amritsar train tragedy is being passed off as the suicide by the driver of the ill-fated train. We wish to emphasise yet again \u2013 in times of emotional upheaval in the society, such as the one due to a natural disaster or a tragedy, be extremely circumspect about sharing provocative information on social media.", "lang": "en"}
