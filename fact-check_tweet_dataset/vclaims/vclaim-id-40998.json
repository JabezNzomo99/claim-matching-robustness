The claim is false; quinine in tonic water is too diluted to have any effect, and there are no drugs proven to cure the disease.\n\n\u201cQuinine found in Tonic water along with 50-100mg of zinc daily will kill COVID-19,\u201d according to various Facebook and Twitter posts.\n\nBrandon Brown, a professor at University of California, Riverside\u2019s Center for Healthy Communities, said quinine in tonic water would not work as a cure for the disease.\n\n\u201cYou would have to drink over 10 times more tonic than humans drink water per day to approach a similar effect of the drug. It\u2019s just not possible,\u201d he told AFP in an email, noting that humans drink about two liters of water a day on average.\n\nIt \u201cseems like a made up home remedy for a medicine that is currently under clinical trials,\u201d he said of the posts circulating online.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts the amount of quinine contained in commercial beverages to 83 parts per million -- roughly equivalent to 83 milligrams per liter.\n\nA capsule of prescribed quinine contains 324 milligrams of the drug, and the FDA recommends 648 mg every eight hours for treating malaria.\n\nQuinine, along with its synthetic relatives chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are chemical compounds normally used as anti-malarial drugs. They are not proven to work as treatments for COVID-19, nor approved by the FDA as such.\n\n\u201cThere are no FDA-approved therapeutics (drugs) to treat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses,\u201d Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesman, told AFP by email.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, some doctors in the United States began to trial hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the virus. One California doctor treated patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and zinc. However, there is currently no clinically proven evidence the treatments work.\n\n\u201cIt may or may not work, similar to us taking a multivitamin to treat the symptoms,\u201d Brown said, adding that studies show excessive levels of zinc, commonly used as an immune system supplement, can be detrimental to one\u2019s health.\n\nAccording to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the tolerable upper intake level of zinc for adults is 40 mg per day.\n\nThe recommendation to combine tonic water with zinc to protect against COVID-19 appears to have been promoted by Eric Nepute, a chiropractor from Missouri with 133,000 Facebook followers, who urged people to take \u201c3 to 4 ounces a day of Schweppes\u201d and \u201c50 to 100 mg of zinc.\u201d The video was visible on Facebook until April 16, but appears to have since been deleted.\n\nNepute later denied ever suggesting the treatment, calling it \u201cidiotic\u201d in another video.\n\nKatie Gilroy, a spokeswoman for Keurig Dr Pepper, the company that sells tonic water brands such as Schweppes or Canada Dry, said of its beverages: \u201cThe quinine is added for flavoring only, and we do not make any medical or health claims around these products.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 330 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.", "lang": "en"}
