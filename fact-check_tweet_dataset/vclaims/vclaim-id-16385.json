Some users of that social media site flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story is actually a mash-up of two stories that have nothing to do with a company named \u201cCelebrities for Trump.\u201d It takes content from two entertainment websites: toofab, which wrote about a skit involving Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2016, and Gossip Cop, which debunked a rumor that Aniston would sell clothes on the Home Shopping Network.\n\nThere is nothing in the bogus story about Aniston\u2019s fictional pro-Trump company beyond the made-up quote in the headline.\n\nBusinesses and organizations that form in the state of California, where Aniston lives and where Hollywood is located, must register with the office of the California secretary of state. A search of registered corporations and limited liability companies under the name \u201cCelebrities for Trump\u201d produced no results.\n\nAlso, Aniston gave $33,400 in 2016 to the Hillary Victory Fund, which was a joint fundraising committee for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and several state Democratic parties, according to records kept by the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAnd she posed for a picture with Clinton and jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer in August 2016 that was posted to Meyer\u2019s Instagram account with the caption, \u201cWe\u2019re with her,\u201d a nod to Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cI\u2019m With Her.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s history of Democratic donations goes back further than 2016, too. She gave $28,500 to help get Barack Obama and other Democrats elected in 2008, according to FEC records.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nBranch, Kate. \u201cJennifer Aniston on Bringing the #FreeTheNipple Movement to the Masses First.\u201d Vogue. 10 Aug 2017.\n\n\u201cACTRESS JENNIFER ANISTON: \u2018ME AND ALL THE TRUMP SUPPORTER CELEBRITIES DECIDE TO MAKE A COMPANY NAMED \u201cCELEBRITIES FOR TRUMP\u201d, WHICH FIGHT AGAINST ALL ANTI TRUMP CELEBRITIES, I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS OUR SUPPORT\u2019.
