Moreover, the allegations of money laundering that triggered the freezing of the accounts were made public four days prior to the nuclear agreement announcement by the parties.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the Putin claim may contain a \u201ckernel of truth,\u201d as one expert put it, though a leading U.S. negotiator flat out disputes Putin\u2019s version of events.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at what was happening in 2005: The U.S., Russia, China, Japan and the two Koreas were involved in \u201csix party talks,\u201d aimed at curtailing North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. That was a diplomatic effort.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department, a law enforcement arm of the U.S. government, was investigating financial dealings surrounding North Korea.\n\nU.S. Special Envoy to the six party talks from 2003 - 2006, Ambassador Joseph Detrani tells Polygraph.info Macau authorities froze North Korea-related accounts at Banco Delta Asia, a Macau-based bank, not Washington, after the U.S. Treasury Department threatened sanctions against the bank.\n\nOn September 15, 2005, U.S. Treasury had accused the bank of being a \u201cwilling pawn\u201d in a North Korean scheme to launder money from illegal drugs and counterfeiting. The U.S said the North Korean government was using the laundered money to procure parts for its nuclear weapons program.The announcement triggered a run on the bank, prompting Macau authorities to take over the bank and freeze $25 million in North Korean accounts. A number of foreign banks followed suit, while many stopped or avoided dealing with North Korean entities. David Asher, who oversaw U.S. financial efforts in this matter at the time, said that the freeze was intended \u201cto kill the chicken to scare the monkey.\u201d\n\nFour days after the Treasury warning, the six parties involved in the diplomatic talks announced in a joint statement a preliminary deal pledging economic and security benefits to North Korea in return for its de-nuclearization.\n\nAnd so Detrani calls the Russian president\u2019s claim on December 14, \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nIn November 2005, the issue became a sticking point at the six-party negotiations. North Korea eventually boycotted the next round of talks for more than a year after the November discussions, with the parties failing to resolve the matter for months thereafter.\n\nAccording to Detrani, the action to freeze North Korean funds made it difficult for U.S. negotiators to explain the situation to Pyongyang, as the law enforcement track and the diplomatic track within the U.S. government proceeded separately on seemingly linked issues.\n\nDaryl Kimball, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association, says Putin\u2019s statement has \u201ca kernel of truth\u201d but is \u201cnot a balanced assessment.\u201d He says, both parties missed opportunities to reach a compromise and both also took actions undermining the 2005 deal.\n\nThe long history of negotiations raises suspicion that North Korea never intended to stop its nuclear program and, on the other hand, some politicians in U.S. opposed talks. In the 1990\u2019s, domestic \u201chard-liners\u201d sought to derail the talks by freezing North Korean currency accounts, according to Leon V. Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council and a contributor to 38 North project. Meanwhile, \u201chard-line\u201d domestic opponents questioned the usefulness of negotiations with North Korea.\n\nWhile the \u201cfreeze\u201d did not end the talks, there was speculation that the delay allowed the North to stall, develop, and then test a nuclear device.\n\nWith the matter of frozen accounts still unresolved, and in what was a major milestone in its long-running nuclear weapons development efforts, North Korea test-fired seven missiles in July 2006 and detonated a nuclear device underground in October, triggering a UN Security Council resolution that imposed limited economic sanctions on Pyongyang.\n\nThe bank released the funds in April 2007 as talks with the North progressed. Still, the North test-fired a long-range missile in 2009 and then declared the six-party talks over, as they allegedly did not accord North Korea equal status. Pyongyang expressed interest in returning to the talks only in 2010 after being accused of sinking a South Korean ship.\n\nThe six parties have since sought to revive the talks, but tensions have only spiked amid accusations, threats, and actions seen as provocative by all sides. Meanwhile, the North Korean nuclear and missile program has progressed significantly.\n\nBruce Bennett, a senior security expert with RAND, argues the 2005 action the freezing of the accounts was justified. \u201cThe Russians are not describing this situation reasonably,\u201d he told Polygraph.inc. \u201cIn 2005, it was believed that North Korea was printing tens of millions of dollars of U.S. currency each year -- the U.S. would have been irresponsible not to try to stop that,\u201d he says.\n\nAlthough the bank unblocked the accounts as talks progressed, North Korea \u201chad no intention of stopping its nuclear weapons program,\u201d says Bennett. North Korea stated as much \u201cover and over again\u201d and has pursued a \u201ccovert nuclear weapons program.\u201d\n\nIn July 2017, multiple news reports indicate the U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea is on the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to U.S. soil sometime in the next year. Detrani, the U.S. envoy to the talks more than a decade ago, says that one could make a case that, all along, North Korea was seeking a way to acquire nuclear weapons without overtly violating agreements.\n\nIf the history of diplomacy is any guide, Kimball assures, the parties should now find it more imperative to \u201cseize fleeting opportunities for diplomatic engagement.\u201d This, he says, is key \u201cto reduce the risk of war and increase communications rather than bargain for concessions that may be the most desirable for one side but impossible to give for the other.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
