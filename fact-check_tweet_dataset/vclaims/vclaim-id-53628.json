The images show a bleeding man and woman and burning homes.\n\nA few more Facebook users posted the images with the same claim.\n\nImage of the injured man and woman\n\nAlt News found that the images are unrelated to the Telinipara clashes. With the help of Google reverse image search, we found that the first two images of a bleeding man and woman were tweeted by Twitter handle Voice of Pakistan Minority on May 11. \u201cGulab and his wife were attacked by neighbourhood goons in Rahimyar khan, Punjab,\u201d said the tweet. It also alleged that Gulab\u2019s wife was sexually assaulted in public.\n\nOn May 12, Dubai-based Gulf News reported, \u201cBlood running down Gulab\u2019s face and his wife equally injured and her clothes torn, screamed and begged for help after being attacked in Pakistan allegedly because they come from a Hindu background.\u201d\n\nMoreover, we found a tweet by Pakistan\u2019s Punjab police which said that the couple was injured in a clash over a land dispute between them and a Muslim family. The medical reports of the injured are awaited after which further legal action will be taken, according to the tweet.\n\nThe image of the burning house was posted by Facebook page Pakistani Hindu Refugee on May 11. It claimed that around 21 Hindu homes were burnt in Tharparkar district in Pakistan\u2019s Sindh region. \u201cThe source says that some people, including children, are burnt and in critical condition. This is the condition of Pakistani Hindu in Pakistan.\u201d reads the post.\n\nWhile Alt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the images of the burning houses, the photographs of the injured couple are from Pakistan. Therefore, unrelated images of an alleged attack on Hindu minorities in Pakistan were passed off as visuals of clashes between two communities in Telinipara, West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
