Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer \u201cde-confliction zone\u201d on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria\u2019s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country\u2019s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan\u2019s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT \u2013 formerly the Free Syrian Army \u2013 to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University\u2019s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s allegations are false.\n\n\u201cI can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not \u2018control\u2019 any actors there directly,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cFrom my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp\u201d\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u2019s claim is \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,\u201d the source said. \u201cMany people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.\u201d\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u2019s claim \u201cis patently false,\u201d and that \u201cthe United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.\u201d\n\n\u201cRukban is another example of the Assad regime\u2019s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is \u201cworking in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.\u201d\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n\u201cAlthough Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cThis is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.\u201d\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: \u201cThe United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
