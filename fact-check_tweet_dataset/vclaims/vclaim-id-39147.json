Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak continues to spread, so have false claims that companies knew about the new coronavirus before the outbreak.\n\n\u201cThis is a can of Lysol from 2016 that was used in a corporate training film,\u201d claims one such post. \u201cYou can see that it states that this product prevents the spread of Human Coronavirus. That\u2019s odd because we were told on January 5, 2020 that this is a \u2018new virus\u2019 from China.\u201d\n\nThe pictured \u201cHuman Coronavirus\u201d label, however, isn\u2019t a specific reference to the novel 2019 coronavirus. The post appears to confuse the generic \u201chuman coronavirus\u201d term with the novel 2019 virus that had not been previously identified in humans prior to it emerging in China in December.\n\nPer the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Human coronaviruses, of which there are seven that can infect people, were first identified in the 60s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nCleaning brands, including Lysol, can put the pictured label on certain products because they have previously proven effective against other strains of coronavirus \u2013 not because they knew about the virus before the outbreak started.
