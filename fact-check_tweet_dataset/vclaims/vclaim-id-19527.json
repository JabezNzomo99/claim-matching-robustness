Some of the posts state it shows a bakery in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad; others state it shows a bakery in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. Both claims are false; the video actually shows a bakery in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nThe one minute, 37 second video was published to Facebook here on July 22, 2019. It has been viewed more than 2,000 times.\n\nIt shows a bearded man accosting staff in a bakery, angrily showing them baked goods in a box, then shouting in Urdu and sending other products flying across the counter. Urdu is the national language of Pakistan, as detailed on this government website.\n\nPista House is a popular bakery and Indian sweet shop in Hyderabad, a city in southern India.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same clip was also viewed hundreds of times elsewhere on Facebook with similar claims that the incident took place at Hyderabad\u2019s Pista House bakery, for example here and here.\n\nOther Facebook posts \u2013 for example here and here \u2013 combined the same video with a claim that it showed Moti Bakery in Ahmedabad, a city in western India.\n\nBoth claims are false; the video was actually filmed at Treats Bakery in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi.\n\nExamining the video closely found the words 'Treats Bakery' written on the front of the counter and a \u2018Treats\u2019 logo on pink stickers on food packets.\n\nBelow are two screenshots from the video showing the bakery\u2019s name written on counter and food packets:\n\nKeyword searches on Google and Facebook for \u2018Treats Bakery\u2019 found this Facebook page for a bakery in Karachi.\n\nThe shop\u2019s logo on its Facebook page matches the logo seen in the misleading video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of a close-up screenshot of one of the pink logo stickers in the misleading video (L) and a screenshot of the logo on the bakery\u2019s Facebook page (R):\n\nFurther keyword searches for \u201cTreats Bakery Karachi\u201d found this video, published to YouTube on July 21, 2019, which features the same bearded customer standing with other men.\n\nThe video was published by local Indian news organisation Hyderabad Deccan News. Its title states: \u201cTreats Bakery, Karachi, Pakistan gave expired food Items to customers\u201d.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cTreats Bakery, Karachi, Pakistan gave expired food Items to customers. Case booked & Inspected by food safety officials. Few people's on Social Media trying to link Treat Bakery with Brand @Pista House Hyd. Please Note: Case will be booked if any fake news forwarded\u201d.\n\nThat video is embedded below:\n\nIn the video, a person in a black cap and grey shirt introduces himself in Urdu as local food safety officer of Sindh Food Authority, Mohammed Tehseen.\n\nHe says: \u201cWe received complaints through social media that a kid started vomiting after eating expired food. We reached the shop along with police officials within half an hour and took action. The complainant, as well as the bakery\u2019s owners, are with us and they will explain to you further.\u201d\n\nThe customer from the misleading Facebook posts, who appears alongside two other people, said to be the owners of the bakery, says: \u201cI am the father of the kid. A sudden incident took place yesterday. It was a misunderstanding. Actually, the kid had eaten something which stuck in his throat and he started vomiting. We later realised that it was the (tomato) ketchup and not blood. I don\u2019t have any problem as such, but I would like to appreciate the officials of the Sindh Food Authority for their timely action\u201d.\n\nTreats bakery owner Tahir Siddiqui told AFP by phone on August 7: \"Food authorities checked everything at the bakery and found nothing wrong.\"", "lang": "en"}
