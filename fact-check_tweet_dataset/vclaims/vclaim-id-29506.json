Obama administration officials and experts on U.S.-North Korea relations say that\u2019s not true, and Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were made in Seoul, South Korea, on June 30 just prior to what Trump described as a last-minute decision to meet Kim. Trump later took several steps across the border to shake hands with Kim, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea. Trump boasted that it was the kind of meeting Obama and his administration \u201cwere begging for \u2026 constantly\u201d but that Kim refused.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of stating the obvious, this is horse-sh*t,\u201d tweeted Susan Rice, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013 and as Obama\u2019s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017.\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s horseshit,\u201d added Gen. Michael Hayden, via Twitter. Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.\n\nBen Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, added his voice on Twitter as well: \u201cTrump is lying. I was there for all 8 years. Obama never sought a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Foreign policy isn\u2019t reality television it\u2019s reality.\u201d\n\nRhodes told CNN that Obama \u201cnever even considered\u201d seeking a meeting with Kim. \u201cThere\u2019s no mystery here: It\u2019s just a lie with no supporting evidence and no basis in anything. It\u2019s not even an exaggeration, it\u2019s just not true.\u201d\n\nAnd on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for most of Obama\u2019s presidency, said he was puzzled by Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cIn all the deliberations that I have participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with the \u2014 Chairman Kim,\u201d Clapper said.\n\nWe reached out to the Trump press office, but it did not provide any further information.\n\nIt\u2019s true that during a debate in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Obama famously said that he would be willing to meet with leaders in North Korea and other enemy nations without any preconditions.\n\nAnd during his inaugural address, Obama again hinted at a willingness to meet with the leaders of rogue nations.\n\nBut once he took office, there\u2019s no evidence that Obama ever made an effort to seek a face-to-face meeting with then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, or later with his son, Kim Jong Un.\n\nJust a few months into Obama\u2019s presidency, North Korea attempted to launch a satellite over Japan in April 2009, and then tested a second nuclear device in May, Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told us via email. \u201cThe Obama administration took a very circumspect approach to Pyongyang after that,\u201d Pollack, who is also editor of the Nonproliferation Review, said.\n\n\n\nEarly on, the Obama administration adopted a policy that came to be known as \u201cstrategic patience\u201d with North Korea. It was a phrase coined by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2009, as the U.S. attempted to get North Korea to return to the Six Party Talks, a series of negotiations involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. with the aim of getting North Korea to denuclearize.\n\nClinton, Dec. 10, 2009: It does remain to be seen whether and when the North Koreans will return to the Six-Party Talks. But the bottom line is that these were exploratory talks, not negotiations. They were intended to do exactly what they did: reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the Six-Party process, to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; and to discuss with the North Koreans their reactions to what we are asking them to do in order to move forward. I think that for a preliminary meeting it was quite positive. The approach that our Administration is taking is of strategic patience in close coordination with our Six-Party allies, and I think that making it clear to the North Koreans what we had expected and how we were moving forward is exactly what was called for.\n\nIn late February 2012, the U.S. entered a tentative \u201cunderstanding\u201d with North Korea known as the \u201cLeap Day Deal,\u201d in which North Korea agreed to a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, and to allow inspection of some of its enrichment facilities in exchange for U.S. food aid.\n\nThe deal collapsed several weeks later after North Korea announced plans for a satellite launch, which the U.S. believed to be a cover for missile testing, Pollack said. \u201cThen, in February 2013, North Korea tested its third nuclear device on the eve of the State of the Union,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s what Obama said in that State of the Union Address in 2013: \u201cAmerica will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when the [North Koreans], coaxed by the Chinese, signaled that they were willing to talk, the U.S. declined, insisting on even tougher conditions than in February 2012,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cAnd that was where things remained through the end of the administration.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Pollack said, Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cpure fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama showed no interest in meeting with either Kim Jong Il or Kim Jong Un,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cEspecially after the collapse of the Feb 2012 \u2018Leap Day Deal\u2019 and the third nuclear test about a year later, Obama showed hardly any interest in negotiating with Pyongyang at all. The entire notion of \u2018strategic patience\u2019 meant ignoring the issue to the extent possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim that Obama begged for a meeting with Kim,\u201d Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, told us via email. \u201cThe Obama administration was open to negotiations with North Korea, but they set onerous preconditions for talks. Requiring that North Korea take significant steps toward denuclearization prior to diplomatic engagement is a far cry from \u2018begging\u2019 for a meeting.\u201d\n\nDavenport noted that in July 2016, the Obama administration personally sanctioned Kim for human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture.\n\n\u201cThat is not a step a leader takes if they are desperate for dialogue.\u201d Davenport said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in October 2018 Trump made a very different claim about the Obama administration, saying that \u201csomebody in their administration\u201d told him \u201cwe haven\u2019t thought about\u201d meeting with North Korea.\n\nMichael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told us via email that Trump\u2019s claim about Obama repeatedly seeking a face-to-face meeting with Kim, but that Kim rejected him, is \u201cmore wrong than right \u2014 but there is something interesting about it nonetheless.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama offered early in his administration, including in his inaugural address, to meet with rogue-state leaders,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cBut then North Korea under [Kim Jong Un] starting testing nukes and acting in a very hard-line way. After that, I don\u2019t believe the Obama administration pushed hard for face-to-face head-of-state meetings. So on that point, my recollection is that Trump is not right.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon added, \u201cI do think that Trump and Kim have a certain chemistry, and I am hopeful that Trump\u2019s risk-taking and unconventional approach to North Korea diplomacy has a chance to work.\u201d\n\nWe take no position on whether Trump has developed a chemistry with the North Korean leader, or whether the face-to-face meetings were a good idea. But there is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cPresident Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him\u201d or that \u201cthe Obama administration was begging for a meeting.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t say what may have been discussed between the nations behind closed doors, but several Obama administration officials who would have been privy to those discussions said Trump is wrong, as did several experts on U.S. -North Korea relations. And the president offered no evidence to back up his claim.", "lang": "en"}
