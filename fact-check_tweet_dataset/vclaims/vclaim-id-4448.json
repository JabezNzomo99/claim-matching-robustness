However, the Russian news agency\u2019s version of the quote is incomplete and taken out of context: it leaves out an important part of the Minister\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper quoted Wallace as saying: \u201cBased on the evidence we had at the time of the Skripal attack, the knowledge they [Russia] had developed Novichok, they had explored assassination programs in the past, they had motive, form and stated policy, we would still assert to a very high assurance that the Russian state was behind the original attack.\u201d\n\nRIA Novosti\u2019s version of the quote leaves out the references to assassination programs, motives, etc., without the use of ellipses.\n\nMore importantly, the RIA Novosti article omits that Wallace implicated Russia in the attack, and demanded an explanation from the Russian government to clear up the matter.\n\n\u201cThe Russian state could put this \u2018wrong\u2019 right,\u201d the security minister said on BBC radio, according to the New York Times. \u201cThey could tell us what happened, what they did and fill in some of the significant gaps that we are trying to pursue.\u201d\n\nWallace specifically relates this new incident to the Skripal case.He is quoted as saying \u201cthe working assumption\u201d is that the new victims were poisoned as \u201cthe consequence of the previous attack,\u201d though he holds out the possibility of some other cause.\n\nRussia continues to deny involvement. The Kremlin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said: \"I know nothing about any appeal [from the UK being conveyed to Russia over the incident].\" He added that the British government has never presented credible evidence of Moscow\u2019s ties to the Skripal\u2019s poisoning.\n\nMoscow\u2019s own versions of the incident in Salisbury have been thoroughly examined and proven false.\n\nThe Western news media has already noted that \u201cRussia\u2019s spin operation has gone into overdrive\u201d on the new poisoning. The Daily Beast points to quotes from a Kremlin spokesman, denying Russian involvement, and the deputy speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house of the parliament, accusing Britain of trying to spoil soccer fans positive reactions to the World Cup tournament.\n\nBen Nimmo of the Atlantic Council\u2019s DFRLab tweeted that Russian embassies are \u201calready dismissing, distorting and distracting.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
