Ramos\u2019s term.\n\nLaurio\u2019s inaccurate post could have reached more than 401,000 people. It came a few days after Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said at a press briefing that Duterte wanted Build, Build, Build projects in the provinces \"implemented faster.\"\n\nThe story's biggest traffic generators from social media are the Facebook pages PinoyAko Blog, Thinking Class of the Philippines and SenTrillanes Power. PinoyAko Blog was created in January 2017.\n\nUPDATE: Jover Laurio, author of Pinoy Ako Blog, has taken down her post and apologized for the error.
