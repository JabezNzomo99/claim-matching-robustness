The party hasn\u2019t said it plans to borrow this much anyway, and as Jeremy Corbyn said this week \u201cour programme is not complete\u201d.\n\nMrs May appears to be referring to Labour\u2019s recent plans for investment spending, although we\u2019ve seen similar claims to this several years ago as well. The Shadow Chancellor announced last summer:\n\n\u201cToday I am making a firm pledge: on coming to power, Labour will set up a National Investment Bank, and a network of regional banks whose aim is to help mobilise \u00a3500 billion into the economy and transform Britain.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all intended to be government borrowing. It\u2019s made up of \u00a3250 billion of government investment spending and \u00a3100 billion of funding for a national investment bank. The bank would raise another \u00a3150 billion from the private sector. That\u2019s similar to how the European Investment Bank works.\n\nThe \u00a3250 billion in government-funded investment spending is also spread out over a decade, so it\u2019s more like \u00a325 billion a year.\n\nBy comparison, the current government borrowed about \u00a352 billion in total last year and spent \u00a380 billion in investment.\n\nSo it would be a significant increase in government investment, even if we don't know exactly what proportion of the funding would be spent.\n\nBorrowing to invest isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing either. And as the Independent\u2019s Ben Chu points out, the government itself says there are \u00a3483 billion worth of investment projects in the pipeline and plans over \u00a3100 billion in investment spending by the end of the decade.", "lang": "en"}
