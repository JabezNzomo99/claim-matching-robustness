The New York Times transcript of Biden\u2019s interview has no instances of the presidential candidate saying \u201ccorn dog.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times Editorial Board recently published \u201cThe Choice,\u201d an interactive interview series featuring nine Democratic presidential candidates, including Biden. It aims at helping readers decide who should be the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts shared screen grabs that appear to be from the transcript of Biden\u2019s interview for the project. The posts credit Biden with saying this during the interview:\n\nBy the way, and that\u2019s what some of these Bernie people don\u2019t get. You have to get the center too. It\u2019s, I was eating a corn dog the other day, this is like a corn dog, with some mustard. When you get to the middle, it\u2019s hard and tough, and dry [CHUCKLES] but you have to eat that too. You have to eat that to finish it. But it\u2019s hard.\n\nBut a quick keyword search of The New York Times transcript turns up no mention of the words \u201ccorn dog\u201d or \u201cBernie people.\u201d (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Making A Racist Remark)\n\nThe image seems to have originated on Twitter, where user @Julian_Epp apparently tweeted the fabricated excerpt as a joke. His tweet has garnered more than 16,700 retweets and 90,900 likes since Jan. 17.\n\nShortly after his tweet went viral \u2013 and showed up on Facebook \u2013 @Julian_Epp tweeted a screen grab of a Snopes article fact-checking it.\n\nThe New York Times Editorial Board endorsed Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee.", "lang": "en"}
