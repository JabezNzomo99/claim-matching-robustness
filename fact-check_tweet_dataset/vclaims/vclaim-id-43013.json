Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: 40 out of 62 AAP MLAs in Delhi are accused of rape and other crimes against women. Fact: In the ADR Report, it can be read that only one AAP MLA is accused of rape. There are a total of 13 MLAs (including the one with the rape case) who have declared cases related to crimes against women. Of those 13 MLAs, two MLAs belong to BJP. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe \u2018Association for Democratic Reforms\u2019 (ADR) has recently released a report \u2013 \u2018Delhi Assembly Election 2020 \u2013 Analysis of Criminal Background, Financial, Education, Gender and other details of MLAs\u2019. In the report, it can be read that \u201813 MLAs have declared cases related to crimes against women. Out of these 13 MLAs, 1 MLA has declared cases related to rape (IPC Section-376)\u2019. The same thing was also posted on ADR\u2019s \u2018Myneta.info\u2019 Facebook page.\n\nThe details regarding those 13 MLAs and their crimes can be seen in the table below. It can be observed that there are two MLAs, who belong to BJP, among those 13 MLAs. So, it not true that 40 out of 62 AAP MLAs in Delhi are accused of rape and other crimes against women.\n\nTo sum it up, only one AAP MLA is accused of rape, not 40 out of 62 AAP MLAs. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
