According to a report by news agency PTI, police had received information that 100-150 people were offering namaz inside the masjid despite the orders issued under CrPC section 144 banning assembly of people in the view of the epidemic. A team led by ACP Dharmadhikari had reached the mosque and asked the devotees to vacate the place. Later, an FIR was filed against the trustees of the Masjid by JJ Marg police.\n\nA second video posted on the same day shows the police asking people to vacate the mosque.\n\nThe video was also shared by Twitter user Viral Sanghavi on April 8 with the claim that it was shot that same day.\n\nIn conclusion, a one-month-old video shot outside a mosque in Maharashtra\u2019s Mumbai was shared with the false claim that members of the Muslim community in Ahmedabad\u2019s Jamalpur are openly flouting the lockdown rules during the nationwide lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
