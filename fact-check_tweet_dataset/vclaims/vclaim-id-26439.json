Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of girl seen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars. Fact: The girl is holding a tray with Bangladeshi Currency notes. Also, a newspaper report mentions her to be a Bangladeshi girl. So, the claim that she was seen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars stands FALSE.\n\nIn the photo, the child holds a tray with some currency notes. When they are carefully observed, it can be found that it is not Indian Currency. On closer observation, it is found to be Bangladeshi Currency. Bangladesh Currency notes have an image of \u2018Bangabandhu\u2019 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on them. The image on the notes held by the girl is of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nWhen the photo in the post is cropped and subjected to Google reverse image search technique, it was found in an article published by \u2018Ajmer Comilla\u2019 on July 13, 2019. The article was published based on a Facebook post put by a user \u2018Asif Akbar\u2019. As per the article, the girl was kidnapped nearly two years ago from Bagerhat city in Bangladesh. It was also mentioned in the article that the child was seen begging at multiple places in Dhaka.\n\nThe above findings lead us to the conclusion that the girl seen in the image is a Bangladeshi girl and she is not seen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
