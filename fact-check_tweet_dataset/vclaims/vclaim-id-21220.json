Counting the total number of first and second votes he got, not just those that were used in the deciding total, he got around 20,000 more than leave did.\n\nI know how you voted last (last) summer\n\nDespite being just a month apart, the two votes were very different.\n\nThe EU vote was a yes/no referendum, while the mayoral election used the supplementary vote system. Voters could choose a first and second preference, then if no candidate got more than half of the first preference votes, the two most popular candidates went through to the second round. Then, second preference votes (where the first vote was not for one of the two most popular candidates) were added to their totals in order to decide who will be elected.\n\nWho or what got more votes?\n\nCounting both first and valid second votes in the mayoral election, Sadiq Khan received 200,000 fewer votes in London than leaving the European Union did.\n\nSadiq Khan got 1.3 million first and valid second preference votes (Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith came second with around 995,000) in the mayoral elections in May 2016. A month later, 1.5 million people in Greater London voted to leave the EU. 2.3 million voted to remain.\n\nSadiq Khan got 57% of the total first and valid second votes for the two main candidates, and Zac Goldsmith got 43%. In the referendum, 60% of votes in London were to remain in the EU, while 40% were for leave.\n\nBut if you count the number of first and second votes that Sadiq Khan got in total, not just those that contributed to his final win, he got around 1.5 million, and 20,000 more votes than leave did.\n\nThe type of voting system used wasn\u2019t the only difference between the two votes. The number of registered voters for each election was slightly different. The Electoral Commission says around 5.7 million people were registered to vote in the mayoral elections, while the electorate in London for the referendum was about 5.4 million.\n\nSome people were eligible to vote in the mayoral election but not the referendum. EU citizens resident in Greater London could vote in the mayoral (and General Assembly) election, but not in the EU referendum, unless they were from Malta, Cyprus (which are also Commonwealth countries) or Ireland.\n\nThe turnout for the mayoral election in London was much lower, at 46%, than the referendum, when it was 70%.", "lang": "en"}
