The TransCanada ad claimed that the proposed pipeline, which if approved will carry heavy crude oil from Canada\u2019s Alberta province to the Gulf Coast, would reduce the U.S. reliance on foreign energy\u2014when in fact the oil is Canadian.\n\nThe southern leg of the pipeline recently opened, but all eyes are on the State Department, which must decide whether to issue a permit for the 1,179-mile northern leg that would carry predominantly heavy oil from Canada\u2019s oil sands, cross the border in Montana and run to the small town of Steele City, Neb. (This map has the details.) The oil would then be processed in refineries on the Gulf Coast, which depending on market conditions, could be transported overseas.\n\nThe NextGen ad leaves the impression that crude oil in the pipeline simply would traverse the United States as a sort of way station\u2014that foreign countries such as China want \u201cto ship oil through America\u2019s heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs.\u201d It then claims that \u201cunder oath, TransCanada won\u2019t commit to selling us one single barrel.\u201d Suddenly there\u2019s an image of TransCanada executive Alexander Pourbaix and a headline of a quote: \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThe list of Chinese investments in the ad, totaling $30 billion, might seem impressive, but it requires context. Investment in Canadian oil sands have averaged $20 to $27 billion a year for the past decade\u2014and a big chunk of the Chinese investment in Canadian energy has little to do with the oil sands.\n\nEven so, the Canadian government recently issued guidelines that analysts say will make it less likely that any other state-owned companies will be permitted to invest in Canadian oil sands. The new rules make it especially suspicious that the ad literally turns a Canadian flag into a Chinese one.\n\nIn other words, for all the jingoistic images, China at the moment is actually a small player in this game. The Globe and Mail chart shows that Royal Dutch Shell currently has three times as much production in the oils sands as Nexen. Perhaps the ad should have turned Canadian flag into the Dutch flag?\n\nMike Casey, a spokesman for NextGen, argued that the current production statistics shed little light on the potential production once oil starts going through the pipeline. He noted that the current report on Alberta oil sand projects shows Chinese companies have a number of projects that are approved but have not even started construction.\n\nCasey clarified that the ad is saying that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the potential exports will be refined products, but he said that crude oil exports are also possible. The State Department has dismissed crude-oil exports as not economically feasible because of transportation costs but Casey says that state-owned companies \u201coften act without regard to economic factors.\u201d\n\nBut the ad turns the question that Pourbaix was asked on its head, as he was not asked to promise to sell at least one single barrel. Here\u2019s the context: Pourbaix had explained that the refiners sometimes export refined products such as diesel, and then will import \u201cincremental volumes\u201d of refined products. So a lawmaker asked him to ensure that any volume exported was met with an equal volume of imported products, so there was no net difference.\n\nThe clip demonstrates that the working assumption during the exchange was that millions of barrels would be sold to the United States. Pourbaix merely was asked to make sure that exports and imports were equalized, not whether a single barrel would be sold.\n\nCasey said that such ads are \u201cmore compressed\u201d but the ad was a \u201cfair representation of the exchange.\u201d Pourbaix should have volunteered the commitment, even if he was not asked, Casey said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re calling them with the ad: If you say with such certainty that this is going to boost American energy security, then you surely can say that the oil will stay in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker takes no position on whether the Keystone pipeline would be good or bad, but this ad does not even meet the minimal standards for such political attack ads. It relies on speculation, not facts, to make insinuations and assertions not justified by the reality.\n\nChinese state investment in the Canadian oil sands is an interesting development, but not worthy of the jingoistic treatment given here. While depending on market conditions some refined products may be exported, there is no evidence that every single barrel of oil would simply pass through the pipeline on the way to overseas shores. The twisting of Pourbaix\u2019s remarks is especially disturbing, even by the standards of attack ads.", "lang": "en"}
