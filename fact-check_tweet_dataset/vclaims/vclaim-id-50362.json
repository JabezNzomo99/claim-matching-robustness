They HAVE to test you for the virus in order to donate blood. Tell your friends! Tell your family!!!!!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve already looked into claims that coronavirus testing costs $3,200. You can read more about it here but we rated them Mostly False. This claim, that blood donation centers have to test donors for coronavirus, won\u2019t fare as well.\n\nThe American Red Cross, which runs blood drives around the country, told PolitiFact that this isn\u2019t true.\n\n\"There is no test to screen blood donations for the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses,\" the organization said in an email. \"It\u2019s important to emphasize that there are no data or evidence that this coronavirus can be transmitted by blood transfusions and there have been no reported cases of transfusion transmission for any respiratory virus including this coronavirus.\"\n\nBut the Red Cross is urging healthy, eligible Americans to donate blood to help avoid potential shortages caused by the coronavirus. It\u2019s also asking people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or come into contact with a person who has or is suspected to have the disease to postpone making a donation for 28 days.\n\nKate Fry, chief executive officer of America\u2019s Blood Centers, told the Associated Press that the network of nonprofit blood centers \"do a whole range of testing on blood donations as required by the FDA, but screening or testing is not happening.\"\n\nThe account that tweeted the information in the Facebook post has since deleted it, writing: \"I don\u2019t want to contribute to hysteria or medical misinformation.\" But the screenshot lives on. So tell your friends! Tell your family!!!!! We rate this Facebook post False.", "lang": "en"}
