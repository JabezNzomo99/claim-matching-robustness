After the results of the assembly elections were announced with the Congress party emerging the victor in Rajasthan, a video has circulated on social media with the claim that the Pakistani flag was waved at the party\u2019s rally following the win.\n\nThe video has been circulated on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The above post is from the Facebook page Politics Solitics and has been shared over 11700 times apart from being viewed in excess of 235,000 times. It has also been shared by numerous individuals.\n\nNOT THE FLAG OF PAKISTAN\n\nAlt News has done numerous articles debunking the narrative about the waving of the Pakistani flag. A closer look at the flag in the video makes it clear that it is not the flag of Pakistan.\n\nThe flag seen on the left in the above picture was the one waved at the rally, whereas the flag on the right is the national flag of Pakistan. There are clear, visible differences in the pattern of the two flags.\n\nMoreover, Rajasthan police has clarified via Twitter that the narrative accompanying the video on social media is fake.\n\nAlt News found that the video of the incident was posted live on Facebook by a user. In the background, the same music can be heard as in the viral video, and a van with the words \u2018New Nirmal DJ Sound\u2019 could be seen. Phone numbers were also mentioned. In the picture below, the screenshot on the left has been taken from this video posted on YouTube at 33 seconds, whereas the picture on the right has been taken from this live video at 00:14.\n\nAlt News called this number to confirm if the van had indeed been used at the Congress rally. Hanuman Prasad Nirmal, the owner of the van said, \u201cThere were 3-4 types of flags which were waved at the rally, belonging to different groups and denominations. There was also a saffron flag and a Jai Bhim flag. Some young men who were part of the rally took out the green flags from a nearby mosque. There was no flag of Pakistan there. Many people were shooting live videos at that time\u201d (translated). The screenshot posted below was been taken from this live video.\n\nA similar narrative was seen during the Karnataka assembly election when it was claimed that the Pakistani flag was waved at a Congress rally, and also on other instances such as the recent false claim that it was hoisted in Kolkata in celebration of the newly elected mayor.", "lang": "en"}
