A reverse image search of few frames throws up a August 27, 2017 video which cites it to the Indore Public School in Indore.\n\nIn the original audio students can be heard taking a pledge in Hindi for a Swachh Bharat (Clean India).\n\nThe audio of the original video has been swapped with the audio in Tamil, which is a pledge to not vote for the BJP.\n\nBOOM contacted Indore Public School, an official from the school confirmed that the video received on WhatsApp was fake and said that \"We do not support any political party, the actual video is on our website which was on a pledge on Swachh Bharat and it is not related to any political party.\"\n\nThe school had posted the original video on August 29, 2017, about two weeks after independence day on its Facebook page with the caption, \"New India Pledge\".", "lang": "en"}
