The purported quote suggests Philippine migrant workers abroad should \u201cstop complaining\u201d about increased health insurance contributions and \u201cjust obey\u201d. The claim is false; the graphic has been doctored from an earlier tweet posted by ABS-CBN; in response to the misleading posts, the Philippine broadcaster described the manipulated graphic as \u201cfake\".\n\nThe graphic, which includes a logo for ABS-CBN, purportedly quoting Philippine President Duterte was published here on Facebook on May 3, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe quote overlaid on the graphic, written in a mix of Tagalog and English, reads: \"The recent increase in the contribution rate of Philhealth is JUST and FAIR. You OFWs especially my supporters, do not ever complain, just obey. If you do not want to obey, come back to the Philippines so you pay less. / PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE / On the implemented increase of rate of contribution for PhilHealth coverage / May 2, 2020\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \u201cJust OBEY YOU DDS OFWs\u201d.\n\nPhilHealth is the name of the national health insurance program in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cDDS\u201d and \u201cOFW\u201d are acronyms for \u201cdiehard Duterte supporters\u201d and \u201cOverseas Filipino Workers\u201d, a term used to refer to Filipino migrant workers abroad.\n\nThe posts were published shortly after PhilHealth announced here on April 22, 2020 that mandatory health insurance contributions from migrant workers overseas would increase to 3% of their monthly salary. The announcement was met with much criticism from migrant groups, labour unions and politicians, as well as this online petition calling for a recall of the order.\n\nThe graphic was also shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. \u201cABS-CBN News did not publish a graphic on this supposed \u2018statement\u2019 of President Rodrigo Duterte,\u201d the news outlet said in this tweet published on its official Twitter account on May 3, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the ABS-CBN tweet, which shows the graphic in the misleading posts overlaid with a \u201cFAKE\u201d stamp:\n\nAFP located the original ABS-CBN graphic here on its Twitter page, which quotes Duterte saying in a mix of English and Tagalog: \u201cTo my brothers and sisters, especially those who have more in life, maybe you can help in extending financial assistance. If you don't really need it and you know that there is someone who is hungry, just help.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original ABS-CBN graphic:\n\nThe Philippine Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) also refuted the claim here on its Facebook page on May 3, 2020, labelling the graphic \u201cFAKE NEWS\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe Philippine government has since announced a suspension of mandatory PhilHealth contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this statement issued on the PCOO website on May 4, 2020, the presidential palace says Duterte has ruled \u201cpayment for PhilHealth premiums voluntary for OFWs\u201d, so that migrant workers \u201cno longer have to worry\u201d about paying contributions \"at this time of health crisis brought by the coronavirus disease 2019\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
