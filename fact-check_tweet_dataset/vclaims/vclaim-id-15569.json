King, who is currently on death row at the Sokoto prison flooded major streets across Nigeria as the presidential candidate of the National Action Council (NAC).\n\nThe convicted clergy man was said to be a candidate for the presidency of Nigeria in the 2019 election under the platform of the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (ABDA). Later in 2019, King\u2019s campaign posters were seen bearing the logo of another political party, the National Action Council (NAC).\n\nIt would be recalled that King, who was the General Overseer of the Christian Praying Assembly (CPA) was arraigned on September 26 2006 on a six count charge of attempted murder and murder. He was sentenced to death by hanging in 2007 by Justice Joseph Olubunmi Oyewole, of a Lagos high court after being tried for the murder of a church member Ann Uzoh.\n\nThe judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal Lagos Division and by the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile in prison, Rev. King\u2019s supporters flooded the public space with his campaign posters making Nigerians believe the convicted clergy man was running for the seat of the President of Nigeria.\n\nThe pidgin arm of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on 14th August, 2018 reported that the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA) through one of its executives, Pastor Daniel, said \u2018Rev. Dr King is the best choice in the presidential election in Nigeria.\u2019\n\nAt the peak of the presidential campaign, Rev. King\u2019s campaigners took to both the social and traditional media insisting the convicted clergy man was a genuine presidential candidate.\n\nThe \u2018New Telegraph\u2019 of 31st January, 2019 had a window caption on its front page: \u2018Drama as party Insists Rev. King on Death row is Presidential Candidate\u2019. Other main stream media like the \u2018Peoples Daily\u2019 and \u2018Leadership\u2019 had similar stories published on January 31 and February 2, 2019 respectively. The Voice of Nigeria published the same story on 1st February, 2019 on its website.\n\nReacting to the development, a factional leader of the National Action Council (NAC), the party King was alleged to be flying its banner, Olapade Agoro, denied endorsing the convicted cleric as the presidential candidate of the party. He did this in a post on the NAC website on 5th February, 2019.\n\nDubawa contacted a good number of persons involved in the claim. First was some of the members of the National Executive Committee of the National Action Council (NAC) made up of the National Secretary, Remi Ayanlade, the deputy National Legal Adviser, Johnson Omede and a host of other NAC members. All of them disclosed that the Independent National Electoral commission (INEC) didn\u2019t recognise Rev. King as the Presidential Candidate of NAC.\n\nDubawa approached Alhaji Ibrahim Ali who claimed he was the Director General of Rev. King\u2019s Presidential Campaign. Alhaji Ali told Dubawa that Rev. King was not recognised by the election umpire, INEC.\n\nWhat are the qualifications for the office of the President of Nigeria?\n\nSection 131 of the constitution states that a person may be qualified for election to the office of President if:\n\u2022 None he is a citizen of Nigeria by birth;\n\u2022 None he has attained the age of forty years;\n\u2022 None he is a member of a political party and is sponsored by that political party;\n\u2022 None he has been educated up to at least School Certificate level or its equivalent.\n\nA person who meets the above requirements is disqualified from holding the office of the President, according to section 137 if:\n\u2022 None he is under a sentence of death imposed by any competent court of law or tribunal in Nigeria or a sentence of imprisonment or fine for any offence involving dishonesty or fraud (by whatever name called) or for any other offence, imposed on them by any court or tribunal or substituted by a competent authority for any other sentence imposed on him by such a court or tribunal.\n\nThe provisions of Section 131 and 137 of Nigeria\u2019s constitution disqualify Rev. King from being a candidate in any election, talk less of the presidential election. He is not only a prisoner; he is on the death row.\n\nTotally false. Reverend King was not a presidential candidate in the last presidential election, and by the provisions of our constitution, could never have been a candidate!", "lang": "en"}
