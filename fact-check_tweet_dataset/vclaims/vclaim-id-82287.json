I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe part that\u2019s difficult is, is what do you do with millions of people in this country who are here illegally? What do you do about it? And I think that the couple of things we\u2019re not going to do \u2014 we\u2019re not going to award citizenship to people or give them a benefit they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. And we\u2019re also not going to round up and deport 12 million people. So the problem with finding a solution between those two different positions is people are not willing to even talk about it until they believe the laws are going to be enforced.\u201d\n\nQ: \u201cIn your book, you propose a piecemeal approach starting with more border security and ending with permanent residency. Are you dropping the idea of citizenship for those who came here illegally?\u201d A: \u201cOnce you have permanent residency, which is a green card, existing law allows you to apply for citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you have a green card, under existing law, in three to five years, depending on whether you got it through marriage or work, you would be able to apply for citizenship. Now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to have 12 million people who are forever in this country who feel American but are permanently barred from becoming citizens. Other people think that should be the price of having violated our laws in the first place. We can debate that. But we have to deal with that issue realistically, and we can\u2019t until illegal immigration is under control first.\u201d\n\nAs always with these issues, there are complexities in the weeds. Rubio, in his comments, makes it sound relatively easy to obtain legal residency \u2014 a green card\u2014 after the 10-year wait is completed. But there is a cap on the number of green cards that are issued \u2014 625,000 a year \u2014 and there also are country and category caps. As a result, there is a waiting list of 4.4 million people outside the United States seeking green cards.\n\nThe Senate bill supported by Rubio actually addressed this problem, in an obscure provision (Section 2302) that was informally known by Senate aides as the \u201cShamWow visa.\u201d (The ShamWow towel supposedly soaks up an enormous amount of liquid.) But it\u2019s unclear if Rubio would support such a provision now, especially because in the CBS interview he reiterated that there would not be \u201ca special process\u201d for applying for legal residency.\n\nConant added: \u201cAs recently as the National Review Summit on Friday, Marco was arguing that we should want people who are going to be here for the rest of their lives to become Americans. He has said it would not be wise to have millions of people permanently in this country who could never become citizens.\u201d\n\nDepending on one\u2019s perspective in the debate, Rubio is either trying to have it both ways or is simply being a bit obtuse. Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of the pro-immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice, said that Rubio has been \u201cdeliberately vague\u201d on what he supports, and that it would be difficult for undocumented immigrants to get green cards unless special provisions were enacted. She added: \u201cI don\u2019t see him as an advocate for a path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nBut Alex Nowrasteh of the libertarian Cato Institute said: \u201cSenator Rubio has consistently, if not clearly, supported a path to citizenship for most unauthorized immigrants.\u201d In his view, \u201cRubio\u2019s strategic and policy changes do not mean he opposes a path to citizenship. Rubio has merely reordered his reform priorities.\u201d He agreed, however, that Rubio has not been especially clear about his position.\n\nIn straining to suggest Rubio\u2019s stance is the same as other Republicans, Clinton goes too far. Rubio has consistently said he supports a path to citizenship. Clinton would have a better case if she specifically said Rubio needs to provide more clarity on how quickly his plan would grant immigrants that citizenship \u2014 especially if he no longer supports creating a new visa category that would smooth the path to a green card. After all, that\u2019s a critical step on the way to citizenship.\n\nWe wavered between One and Two Pinocchios, but ultimately tipped toward Two. Rubio has taken a relatively lonely position in the GOP on immigration, and it\u2019s not quite fair to suggest his position on citizenship has been inconsistent. (Update: If Rubio\u2019s campaign had admitted he no longer supported the ShamWow provision at the time this fact check was written, we would tipped toward One Pinocchio.)", "lang": "en"}
