Spokespeople say the international agency makes recommendations but governments have to make their own decisions.\n\u2022 None The health department has cited the WHO guidelines, but the degree to which the country is following them remains unclear. \n\n\n\n\n\nwas eased in April 2020. It was replaced with a\n\n, where regulations are lifted or reimplemented as the risk of transmission changes.\n\nWhile welcomed by some,\n\nsaw the lockdown relaxation as coming too soon.\n\nOne of them was Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, a member of parliament for the\n\non 30 June that South Africa was easing its national lockdown \u201cdespite [the World Health Organization] unequivocally declaring that [South Africa] was not ready\u201d. A similar statement had been made by the EFF in a\n\n, or WHO, declare South Africa was not ready to lift its lockdown? And did it say so \u201cunequivocally\u201d?\n\nNo evidence of WHO statement\n\nAfrica Check could not find any statements from the WHO saying that South Africa was \u201cnot ready\u201d to ease its lockdown. Ndlozi did not respond to requests for evidence supporting his claim.\n\nultiple spokespeople for the WHO said that they were not aware of any statement like this being issued.\n\nThe organisation did, however,\n\nguidelines for \u201ctransitioning to and maintaining a steady state\u201d of low-level or no transmission of Covid-19 on 14 April.\n\nThese included, for example, that transmission be \u201ccontrolled\u201d, public health services be \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201cworkplace preventive measures\u201d be in place.\n\nonline by eNCA with a banner saying that South Africa did not meet WHO criteria to ease the lockdown. The news channel later deleted the video and\n\nit without the banner, saying it had been \u201cincorrectly titled\u201d.\n\nThe WHO did release a\n\nurging \u201ccaution as countries in Africa ease lockdowns\u201d on 28 May.\n\nIt noted concerns that \u201cCovid-19 cases could start increasing rapidly\u201d if lockdown measures were relaxed too quickly. The statement mentioned South Africa, saying that the time taken for the number of cases to double had remained stable since the lockdown measures started being relaxed.\n\n\u201cEnding a lockdown is not an event, but a process, and it\u2019s important to have a clear view of local conditions so informed decisions can be made about how to relax these measures,\u201d said\n\nBut the final decision of when and how to lift lockdowns lies with governments,\n\n, communications officer for the WHO regional office for Africa, told Africa Check.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t get involved in the decision of whether a government should lock down or not. Our role is to provide the best possible evidence and recommendation to countries. Then they have to make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nThese decisions, he said, should be based on countries\u2019 \u201clocal context, the epidemiological situation and the health system\u2019s capacity\u201d.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, referred to the \u201csound guidelines\u201d from the WHO in an\n\nFour days later, during a\n\nsuggested the rate of new infections had to slow before the lockdown could be lifted \u201cin line with World Health Organization guidelines\u201d.\n\nincluded the guidelines for easing public health measures and indicators used to monitor them.\n\nFor example, the \u201cweekly rate of change in the number of positive cases per district\u201d was presented as an indicator for the WHO\u2019s guideline that \u201cevidence should show that the Covid-19 transmission is controlled\u201d.\n\nBut the presentation did not say if the guideline was being met or the rate that would need to be achieved in order to do so.\n\nAfrica Check asked the health department if it considered South Africa to meet the guidelines. At the time of publication we had not received a response.\n\nConclusion: WHO has not declared South Africa unready to lift lockdown\n\nMbuyiseni Ndlozi, a member of parliament for the EFF, claimed the WHO \u201cunequivocally\u201d said South Africa was not ready to ease its national Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nWe could find no evidence of the WHO making this statement. The organisation told Africa Check that it is not involved in how and when governments lift restrictions. It aims to give authorities the best evidence available to guide their decisions.\n\nThe WHO has however urged African countries to exercise caution when lifting lockdowns. We rate the claim incorrect.\n\nExact details of how to measure these are not provided.on the transition guidelines in an interview with news channel eNCA on 20 May.\u201cThese are global guidelines that countries have to use or apply according to their local contexts, and local situations,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
