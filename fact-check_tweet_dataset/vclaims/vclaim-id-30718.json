Two Canadian agencies have told us those claims are wrong.\n\nSuggestions have been circulating on social media that a \u201cChinese spy team\u201d sent the deadly coronavirus to Wuhan, China \u2014 the epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 from a Canadian research lab.\n\nHowever, Eric Morrissette, a spokesman for the Public Health Agency of Canada, told us by email, \u201cthis is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media.\u201d\n\nThe false claim appears to have originated on a Texas money manager\u2019s Twitter account. On Jan. 25, Kyle Bass tweeted: \u201cA husband and wife Chinese spy team were recently removed from a Level 4 Infectious Disease facility in Canada for sending pathogens to the Wuhan facility. The husband specialized in coronavirus research.\u201d\n\nBass included a link to a CBC News story from July that did not support the claims he made in his tweet. He did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe next day, ZeroHedge, a website that has published misinformation before, posted a story with this headline: \u201cDid China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It?\u201d\n\nA screenshot of Bass\u2019s tweet has also been turned into a meme that is circulating on Facebook.\n\nAs we said, Bass\u2019s tweet includes a link to a July story by CBC News, Canada\u2019s publicly owned news service, that doesn\u2019t support his claim.\n\nCBC News reported in July that \u201ca researcher with ties to China\u201d had been escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. That lab is overseen by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Morrissette, the agency spokesman, told us that, \u201cfor privacy reasons,\u201d the agency wouldn\u2019t comment further than to confirm that the tweet was spreading misinformation.\n\nAccording to the CBC story, Dr. Xiangguo Qiu was escorted from the lab amid an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police into a possible \u201cpolicy breach.\u201d\n\nThe RCMP and the health agency have said repeatedly that there is no threat to public safety.\n\nThat story never mentioned Wuhan or the shipment of \u201cpathogens.\u201d\n\nA later CBC story, though, cited government travel documents that show Qiu was invited to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. That story, published in October, also says that she visited the \u201cChinese Academy of Science, Tsinghua University, the Chinese Medical Academy of Science and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology.\u201d And that she \u201cspoke at several conferences, including some organized by the World Health Organization, the Chinese Society of Virology and International Symposium on Emerging Viral Disease.\u201d It also notes that collaboration among scientists is common.\n\nThat CBC story also says nothing of the coronavirus or the shipment of \u201cpathogens.\u201d\n\nA third CBC story in August reported that the Winnipeg lab had sent two viruses \u2014 Ebola and Henipah \u2014 to Beijing on March 31. It didn\u2019t connect Qiu, specifically, to that shipment, but it referred to the investigation, saying, \u201cwhile the Public Health Agency of Canada says all federal policies were followed, there are questions about whether that shipment is part of an ongoing RCMP investigation.\u201d\n\nBut Cpl. Caroline Duval, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told us by email, \u201cThere is no connection between the outbreak in China and any RCMP investigation.\u201d\n\nSo, it appears that the tweet was based on some mix \u2014 and misrepresentation \u2014 of those news reports from 2019.\n\nBut, the fact is, Qiu wasn\u2019t \u201cremoved\u201d from the Canadian lab \u201cfor sending pathogens to the Wuhan facility,\u201d as the tweet says.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
