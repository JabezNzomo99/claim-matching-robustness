Jeb Bush may or may not run for president in 2016, but he was certainly active in the 2014 elections. Not only did he campaign for other candidates, but he was doing fundraising for his Foundation for Excellence in Education.\n\nAn focused on the economy, a top concern for voters.\n\n\"Americans could always count on hard work leading to higher incomes and improved lives. The American dream was real and within reach,\" Bush said in the letter. \"But today, among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world.\"\n\nBush goes on to say fixing an ailing education system is key to turning things around for children and the country.\n\nThere\u2019s no question times have been tough the last decade or so, but is the American dream really that unattainable? We decided to work really hard to improve our lives by finding out the answer.\n\nFirst of all, we should point out that while social mobility and economic mobility are technically two different things, Bush is looking at them under the same umbrella -- a person\u2019s ability to better their circumstances as measured by income. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ll look at them, too.\n\nHis foundation didn\u2019t have to dig deep to find experts who claimed the United States is lagging behind its global peers. They sent and reports they said informed the claim, so we examined those.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to sugarcoat it for you, folks, because there\u2019s plenty of evidence Bush\u2019s assertion is on the money (so to speak).\n\nA compared earning potential across generations among the United States, the United Kingdom and Nordic countries. It determined that American men raised in the bottom fifth of family incomes had a 42 percent chance of staying there, considerably higher than the other countries (Britain was next at 30 percent). Only 8 percent rose to the top fifth in the U.S., the lowest in the study. In countries like Finland, Denmark and Sweden, that number is closer to 15 percent, almost twice as much as in America.\n\nUniversity of Ottawa economist Miles Corak in about generational income mobility -- that is, whether you will make more or less money depending on how much your parents made. Again, the United States came up last.\n\n\"The United States, the United Kingdom, and to a slightly lesser extent France, stand out as being the least mobile societies, with 40 to 50 percent of fathers\u2019 earnings advantage being passed on to sons,\" Corak wrote. \"At the other extreme are Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Canada with about 15 to 20 percent of earnings advantage passed across generations, and in an intermediate position Germany and Sweden with about 30 percent.\"\n\nThere is some debate about whether generational income mobility is a proper measure of mobility, especially because social structures and salary trends vary from country to country, but it does look as if the States aren\u2019t as mobile as they once were.\n\nA found that only 6 percent of American children born at the bottom of the income ladder moved to the top. Almost half of kids born in the bottom fifth of family income didn\u2019t move up, while 39 percent in the top fifth stayed at the top. A third of kids moved up in brackets, sure, but another third moved down.\n\nThe Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found , widening the field a bit: 62 percent growing up in the top fifth stayed in the top two fifths, while 65 percent raised in the bottom fifth stayed in the bottom two fifths. These numbers showed things have gotten worse in recent years for Americans trying to move up in the world.\n\nEssentially, if you were born to a richer family, you had a good chance of staying there. If you were born into a poorer family, good luck. That trend is much more defined in America than it is in other countries.\n\nNow let\u2019s remember Bush wrote \"among the developed nations.\" All the things we\u2019ve looked at so far have stuck to European countries and Canada.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay, because University of Wisconsin economist Timothy Smeeding told us we can say plenty more countries beat us, too.\n\nHe pointed us to the Great Gatsby Curve, a concept championed in 2012 by former chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger , an economist at Princeton. The curve, named after the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel about class-hopping romantic Jay Gatsby, used data from Canadian economist Corak to determine mobility in terms of \"intergenerational income elasticity\" against several nations\u2019 inequality by income distribution, called the Gini coefficient.\n\nThe curve usually includes 23 countries, most of which are Western, and shows the United States lags behind other developed countries like Italy, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand. Countries considered even less mobile than America include China, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.\n\n\"Amongst the rich countries, Bush is right,\" Smeeding told PolitiFact Florida. \"There are no rich countries, save tiny Singapore, whom lie to the right of the USA.\"\n\nWith that data in mind, it\u2019s hard to find fault with Bush\u2019s argument, according to Isabel Sawhill, co-director of the Center on Children and Families and the Budgeting for National Priorities Project at Brookings.\n\n\"It's a bit over the top but consistent with much of the evidence,\" she said.\n\nBush said \"among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world.\"\n\nHis Foundation for Excellence in Education sent us a few stories backing up the claim on a broad level. We found even more data suggesting that yes, America does lag behind most every developed country in terms of being able to move from the bottom rungs of the income ladder to the top.\n\nExperts we talked to said it was a fair claim, although we must note there is some disagreement on how mobility is measured and minor differences among studies.", "lang": "en"}
