We wrote as far back as 2009 that Obama couldn\u2019t make that promise to everyone.\n\nTrump, Feb. 11: You can keep your doctor, remember that, 28 times. That didn\u2019t happen; turned out to be a lie. Hey, where are the fact-checkers? You know some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact-checkers. Twenty-eight times. You can keep your doctor, that didn\u2019t turn out to be what he said.\n\nIn our August 2009 story, headlined \u201cKeep Your Own Insurance? Not Everyone,\u201d we wrote that under the bills being debated at the time some employers might have to change insurance plans to meet benefit requirements and others could drop coverage and pay a penalty instead. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3 million people with insurance through their employers would not be offered coverage.\n\nWe cited that report and explained in detail how the different versions of health care legislation could affect the ability of some to keep the same insurance plan. Obama had made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2009, town hall event in Grand Junction, Colorado, as he tried to garner public support for his health care overhaul plan. He told the crowd: \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan. Nobody is going to force you to leave your health care plan. If you like your doctor, you keep seeing your doctor.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the claim in a 2009 press conference, Obama said he meant \u201cthe government is not going to make you change plans under health reform.\u201d But, we noted, that\u2019s not exactly the claim he continued to make.\n\nObama repeated his talking point over the years, and we repeatedly wrote about it. His claim made our list of health care whoppers in 2010, the \u201cWhoppers of 2012, Early Edition\u201d and a round-up of \u201cObamacare Myths\u201d in September 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, reality caught up with Obama\u2019s claim when many Americans who bought coverage on the individual market began getting letters from their insurance companies, saying they\u2019d have to buy a new policy because of the ACA\u2019s minimum benefit requirements. We wrote about that, too.\n\nThe fact is, we held Obama to the same standard that we hold Trump.", "lang": "en"}
