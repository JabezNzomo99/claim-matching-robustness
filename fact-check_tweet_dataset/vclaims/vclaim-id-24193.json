{"title": "Trump: 17 Repeats in 17 Hours", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2019-05-09T18:22:20+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-24193", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2019/05/trump-17-repeats-in-17-hours/", "vclaim": "Over the course of 17 hours, President Donald Trump repeated 17 false and misleading claims that we have written about since he became president.\n\nTrump began with an evening rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, on May 8, that lasted more than an hour, and followed it up a day later with an impromptu afternoon press conference at the White House.\n\nHere are the repeated claims that the president made, from when the rally started at about 8 p.m. on May 8 to the end of the press conference at 12:49 p.m. on May 9.\n\nAbortion: Trump said, \u201cAnd then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that? The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.\u201d That mischaracterizes Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s comments.\n\nNortham, who is a physician, said third-trimester abortion is \u201cdone in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable. \u2026 The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d A spokesperson for Northam said his comments were \u201cfocused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\u201d See \u201cFactChecking the State of the Union.\u201d\n\nPreexisting Conditions: Trump said, \u201cWe will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. The Republican Party will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t mention the fact that his administration has sided with plaintiffs in a lawsuit that aims to have the Affordable Care Act declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe Department of Justice said in a June 2018 letter that it believed two provisions of the ACA would have to be eliminated if the lawsuit succeeded: those guaranteeing that people can\u2019t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors, including health status. But this year, the DOJ backed full repeal of the law in the suit. Also, the ACA\u2019s preexisting condition protections are more comprehensive than those offered in 2017 Republican health care bills. See \u201cTrump Misleads on Preexisting Conditions\u201d and \u201cThe Preexisting Conditions Debate Isn\u2019t Over.\u201d\n\nVeteran\u2019s Choice: Trump said, \u201cAnd for the veterans we passed V.A. choice, right? \u2026 They\u2019ve been trying to get it passed for 44 years. We got it passed.\u201d The Veteran\u2019s Choice Program was created in 2014 by bipartisan legislation that passed with overwhelming majorities in Congress under then-President Barack Obama. It allows veterans facing long wait times to seek care outside the V.A. system. See \u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018Greatest Idea\u2019 for a 2014 Law.\u201d\n\nV.A. Accountability: \u201cWe also passed \u2014 46 years they\u2019ve been trying \u2014 V.A. accountability, because under the V.A. you couldn\u2019t fire anybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything. We had no way of firing these people.\u201d It\u2019s not true that the Department of Veterans Affairs couldn\u2019t fire employees for cause until Trump signed the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act in June 2017. That law aims to make it easier to remove employees, but the VA fired more than 2,000 employees each year going back to 2006 for discipline and performance reasons before Trump took office, according to data the department reported to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nEmployment: Trump said, \u201cMore people are working today in the United States, almost 160 million, than have ever worked in the United States before.\u201d It\u2019s true that there\u2019s a record 151.1 million people employed in the United States. But the employment number has rarely deviated from its upward trend for as long as such figures have been tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThere have been exceptions to employment growth, such as during recessions. But in the post-Great Recession period, the U.S. has been setting new records every month since May 2014. See \u201cTrump\u2019s Pointless Job Boast.\u201d\n\nEstate Tax: Trump said, \u201cTo keep your family farms and ranches and small businesses in the family \u2014 they don\u2019t talk about this \u2013 we eliminated the unfair estate tax, or death tax.\u201d The president is referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the new tax law did not eliminate the estate tax.\n\nUnder the old law, estate assets valued at more than $5.49 million (nearly $11 million for couples) were subject to the estate tax in the 2017 tax year, according to the IRS. The new law doubled the estate tax exemption to $11.18 million ($22.4 million for couples) in the 2018 tax year. That provision expires at the end of 2025. See \u201cTrump\u2019s Estate Tax Spin.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico: Trump said of hurricane aid, \u201cPuerto Rico got $91 billion. I understand they don\u2019t like me. It\u2019s the most money we\u2019ve given to anybody. We\u2019ve never given $91 billion to a state. We gave it to Puerto Rico. $91 billion.\u201d Puerto Rico has not received $91 billion. Puerto Rico received $12.6 billion in disaster relief payments since 2017, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The federal government has allocated $42.3 billion, and has obligated about half of it via binding agreements, but just a portion of that has been distributed in Puerto Rico so far.\n\nThe $91 billion figure is an estimate that includes future costs \u201cover the life of the disaster,\u201d which can stretch decades, according to a senior administration official. That estimate is subject to change, and any new appropriations must be approved by Congress. See \u201cTrump Misleads on Aid to Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nSecond Amendment: Trump said, \u201cLast month, I announced that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade treaty\u201d because \u201cwe will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment and your rights under the Second Amendment.\u201d That\u2019s not what the ATT does.\n\nThe treaty \u2014 which the U.S. signed in 2013, but never ratified \u2014 acknowledges \u201cthe sovereign right\u201d of any participating country \u201cto regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system.\u201d The treaty requires parties to establish standards for regulating the international trade of weapons such as battle tanks, warships, missiles and small arms. Also, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the treaty \u201cdoes not affect sales or trade in weapons among private citizens within a country.\u201d See \u201cTrump\u2019s Deceptive Arms Trade Treaty Argument.\u201d\n\nGreen New Deal: Trump said, \u201cNow, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy known as the Green New Deal.\u201d The actual cost of the proposal is unknown. Trump is rounding up the high-end estimate from the American Action Forum, a self-described \u201ccenter-right policy institute,\u201d which said the nonbinding resolution outlining ways to address climate change could cost from $51 trillion to $93 trillion between 2020 and 2029. The estimated costs only include outlays, and don\u2019t factor in economic benefits or other effects. But experts we consulted told us the Green New Deal is currently too vague to try to estimate its cost. It would have to be turned into legislation before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or anyone else, could properly score its economic effect. See \u201cHow Much Will the \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 Cost?\u201d\n\nTrade Deficit with Mexico: Trump said, \u201cMexico made $100 billion on average over the last 10 years, 100 billion.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect. According to Census Bureau data, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico was $78 billion in 2018, up from $69 billion in 2017. Over the last 10 years, it has averaged $57.7 billion \u2013 about half of what Trump claimed. The U.S. has not had a $100 billion deficit in goods and services with Mexico, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data, going back to 1986. See \u201cFacts on Trade\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s Habit of Inflating Trade Deficits.\u201d\n\nTrade Deficit with China: Trump said, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re the piggy bank that everybody steals from, including China. We\u2019ve been paying China $500 billion a year for many, many years.\u201d The U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was a record $378.7 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (table 3). Over the last 10 years, it has averaged $302.1 billion. See \u201cTrump\u2019s Habit of Inflating Trade Deficits.\u201d\n\nTrade Deficit Overall: Trump also said this about the U.S. trade deficit with all countries: \u201cWe\u2019ve been losing, for years, close to $800 billion \u2014 not million \u2014 $800 million is a lot, but we\u2019ve been losing 800 billion dollars on trade. Eight hundred billion dollars. We\u2019re going to stop that. And we\u2019ve already started.\u201d The overall goods-and-services deficit was $622.1 billion in 2018 \u2014 the highest it has been since 2008, according to BEA data.\n\nSo, the trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion \u2014 let alone \u201cfor many, many years.\u201d And the deficit isn\u2019t $800 billion with all countries. However, as a candidate and now president, Trump has been exaggerating the figures for years. See \u201cTrump\u2019s Habit of Inflating Trade Deficits.\u201d\n\nTariffs: Trump said if trade talks fail with China, he will impose higher tariffs on China \u2014 but he went on to falsely claim that the U.S. has never collected tariffs on Chinese goods. \u201cOur alternative is an excellent one. It\u2019s an alternative I\u2019ve spoken about for years. We\u2019ll take in well over $100 billion a year [in tariffs]. We never took in 10 cents from China. Not 10 cents.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has collected billions in tariffs on Chinese imports for years. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties. Prior to Trump becoming president, the U.S. collected $122.6 billion in customs duties from 2007 to 2016, or $12.3 billion a year on average, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb. Last year, the U.S. collected nearly $23 billion \u2014 an increase that reflects the higher tariffs imposed on China by the Trump administration. See \u201cTrump Wrong on China Trade, Again.\u201d\n\nTransparency in Special Counsel Investigation: Trump said, \u201cThere was nobody that was in the history of our country more transparent than me. I said give them every document, give them every person. \u2026 I gave them White House counsel, I gave them other lawyers \u2013 anybody you want you can talk to.\u201d Trump neglects to mention that he declined to be interviewed by the special counsel and would only answer written questions.\n\nThe special counsel tried to interview Trump for more than a year, found his written answers to be inadequate and considered a subpoena, according to the special counsel\u2019s report. See \u201cBarr\u2019s Testimony, In Context.\u201c\n\nMueller\u2019s Supposed \u2018Conflicts\u2019: Trump said that special counsel Robert Mueller had \u201ctremendous conflicts,\u201d including a desire to be the FBI director. \u201cHe wanted to become the FBI director. We chose Director [Christopher] Wray instead and told him, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not what happened. Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon told investigators that the White House invited Mueller to \u201coffer a perspective on the institution of the FBI.\u201d Mueller \u201cdid not come in looking for the job,\u201d Bannon said.\n\nTrump also said Mueller had a \u201cbusiness dispute\u201d with him. But correspondence between the Mueller family and officials at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, revealed in the Mueller report, show a routine departure from the club. See \u201cDebunking Mueller\u2019s \u2018Conflicts.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore \u2018Conflicts\u2019 Exaggerations: Trump also said, \u201cOne of the people [on Mueller\u2019s team] worked on the Clinton Foundation \u2013 as just about the top person at the Clinton Foundation.\u201d Prosecutor Jeannie Rhee served as outside counsel on behalf of the Clinton Foundation on one case. She wasn\u2019t even a foundation employee, let alone \u201cjust about the top person\u201d there. See \u201cTrump\u2019s Exaggerated \u2018Conflicts of Interest\u2019 Claims.\u201d\n\nNATO: Trump said, \u201cWe pay for \u2014 anywhere from 70 to 100 percent of NATO. So we protect NATO. We protect European countries.\u201d That\u2019s a distortion. Under its current agreement, the U.S. is expected to pay just over 22 percent of NATO\u2019s commonly funded \u201cprincipal budgets,\u201d NATO says. Trump\u2019s claim, however, is based on how much the U.S. spends on its own defense compared with what other alliance members spend on their own defense. The U.S. share of total defense spending by all alliance members in 2018 was an estimated 66 percent, according to inflation-adjusted figures from NATO.
