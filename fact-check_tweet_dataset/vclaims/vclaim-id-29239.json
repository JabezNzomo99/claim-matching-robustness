The claim is false: the video was posted online more than two years ago and has no connection to the 2019 polls.\n\nThe misleading video can be seen here where it has been viewed 536 times since it was posted on Facebook on March 4.\n\nThe 1-minute, 35-second clip shows Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, greeting local officials who are distributing bags filled with staple foods -- rice, cooking oil, sugar and tea -- to residents of Bogor, near Jakarta.\n\nWidodo is also seen shaking hands with some local people.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video. Jokowi is wearing a white shirt:\n\nThe post\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cThe president hands out staple foods in his capacity as an incumbent candidate. Those who received the gifts may be able to eat all of this food within five days, but after that, they\u2019ll be fooled for the next five years. Do you really want that? A president\u2019s duty isn\u2019t to hand out food\u2026but to ensure that the price of staple foods remains affordable... Do you understand?\u201d\n\nAFP ran keyframes from the video obtained using verification tool InVid through a Google Reverse Image and Yandex search.\n\nThe results of the Yandex search can be seen here.\n\nThe misleading video has been taken from this June 28, 2016 report by Indonesian media outlet Tribunnews.\n\nBelow is the video report on the official Tribunnews YouTube channel, which has more than 500,000 subscribers:\n\nThe report is headlined \u201cIn a small alleyway, President Jokowi distributes Islamic New Year gifts to residents of Pulo Geulis village\u201d.\n\nThe Tribun video was posted online June 28, 2016, more than two years before Widodo announced his re-election bid in August 2018.", "lang": "en"}
