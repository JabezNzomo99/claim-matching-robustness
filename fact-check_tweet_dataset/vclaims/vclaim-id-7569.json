In an exchange with Chelsea Clinton, Ms. Barr falsely accused Mr. Soros, 87, of being a Nazi \u201cwho turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Ms. Barr accused Mr. Soros of wanting to \u201coverthrow\u201d the United States by backing candidates for district attorney \u201cwho will ignore U.S. law & favor \u2018feelings.\u2019\u201d Ms. Barr also retweeted a user who asserted that Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist activists are Soros-sponsored front groups. The user referred to Mr. Soros as the \u201cterrorist in chief.\u201d The assertions about Mr. Soros that appeared throughout Ms. Barr\u2019s timeline are baseless. Even the conservative National Review, while critical of Mr. Soros, has called the Nazi smear a \u201cslander.\u201d In a statement in response to her tweet, a spokesman for Mr. Soros called her claims insulting. \u201cGeorge Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13 year old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive Holocaust,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIt continued, \u201cHe did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people. He did not confiscate anybody\u2019s property. Such false allegations are insulting to the victims of the Holocaust, to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth. They are an affront to Mr. Soros and his family, who against the odds managed to survive one of the darkest moments in our history.\u201d\n\nThe widely debunked claim, spread by the likes of Dinesh D\u2019Souza, Alex Jones and Glenn Beck, relies on a selective misreading of what Mr. Soros said in a years-old \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In it, the interviewer, Steve Kroft, suggests that Mr. Soros participated in the confiscation of property from other Jews. But in the interview, Mr. Soros says that he had only witnessed the confiscation. \u201cI was only a spectator, the property was being taken away,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\u201d In a piece published by The New York Daily News on Tuesday, Mr. Soros\u2019s son Alexander called the claim that his father collaborated with the Nazis \u201codious.\u201d Mr. Soros, who has given $18 billion to his Open Society Foundations to promote democracy and human rights around the world, is no stranger to such claims. He has long been the target of often anti-Semitic smears accusing him of orchestrating nefarious plots, sometimes on a global scale. Mr. Soros has been depicted in cartoons as a literal puppetmaster and is frequently described by those on the far-right as a \u201cglobalist,\u201d a word often inflected with racist and anti-Semitic sentiment.", "lang": "en"}
