But he pointed to the NICS Improvements Act of 2007, which gave financial incentives to states for improving their reporting to the database. The NRA supported that legislation, he said, because incentives are fine. \u201cBut when the federal government says, \u2018You will become my minion\u2019 \u2026 that is not permissible, and is incredibly unhealthy and dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nUpdate: Halbrook takes issue with this fact-check in a blog post, disputing that the NRA argued to strike down the entire Brady Act, including the NICS, in its brief to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe NRA made no such argument,\u201d Halbrook writes. As he notes, the NRA\u2019s brief in the Printz case did not mention the NICS. But it did argue that the entire Brady Act should be struck down \u2014 \u201cthe whole statute must be voided\u201d \u2014 because the part of the law it was challenging was not \u201cseverable\u201d from the rest of the Brady Act.\n\nBut now, the NRA and Loesch are concerned that the NICS is not getting all the records it needs. The irony is that the NICS might be getting those records \u2014 or getting more of them, at least \u2014 had the NRA not worked to undermine the Brady law in the early 1990s. Getting those records might be easier today if not for the legal precedent the NRA helped create in the Printz case in 1997. (Loesch also uses outdated figures and portrays the NICS database as spottier than it is.)", "lang": "en"}
