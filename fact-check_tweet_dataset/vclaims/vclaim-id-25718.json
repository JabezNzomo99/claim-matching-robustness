Sindh is a state in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the police uniform in the video does not match the uniform worn by Jammu And Kashmir police as can be seen in the tweet below.\n\nUsing these clues that the video could be from Sindh, we searched on Twitter with the keywords 'Sindh 'police' 'video' 'women' and found a tweet by Sindh Police on May 11, 2019.\n\nWe found several tweets claiming policemen spotted in the video are Sindh Police\n\nIn a bizarre twist the Sindh police claimed in a series of tweets in May 2019,that the video was staged. BOOM could not independently verify if the video was staged or not.\n\nThe tweet read, \"Few Days back a video was made viral on Social media in which People in police uniform were shown torturing women while raiding a house.This video proved fake and it was designed to malign Sindh Police in general and Jamshoro Police in particular\"\n\nDawn News reported on May 12, 2019, that four policemen and a civilian were arrested for uploading the fake video which showed women being tortured by uniformed men in Jamshoro.\n\nJamshoro SSP Tauqir Mohammad Naeem had told the media in a press conference that an investigation into the matter found that four of the uniformed suspects turned out to be policemen and the other four impersonators, reported Dawn News.\n\nAccording to Dawn's story, two days before the videos were uploaded, a clash between traders of the area and a criminal gang occurred wherein police were called by the traders.\n\n\"The SSP said that the arrests provoked the gang mainly operating in Nawabshah and Naushahro Feroze for several years and it resorted to retaliate by defaming the Bhan Syedabad police through the videos,\" Dawn reported.\n\nHowever, news reports about the incident did not explain the involvement of the four policemen in the viral video.", "lang": "en"}
