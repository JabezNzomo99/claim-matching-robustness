Some of the men are in masks and a number of beds can be seen lined up in the room.\n\nBJP MLA in Maharashtra Nitesh Rane had tweeted the video on June 10, claiming that it was shot at the badminton court of the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) in Mumbai. A portion of NSCI was converted into a quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients.\n\nBut while some Facebook users have claimed that the video is from Mumbai, others say it is from Chennai. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is not from Mumbai or Chennai, but from a quarantine centre in Agartala, Tripura.\n\nWith the help of keyword search, we found that several news websites have reported about the viral video.\n\nAccording to several news websites of Northeast India such as \u201cINSIDENE\u201d and \u201c thenortheasttoday\u201d, the viral dance video is from the Hapania Care Centre, a quarantine centre in Agartala, Tripura, where asymptomatic coronavirus patients are kept in isolation.\n\nThe video has raised several questions on the conditions of quarantine centres and their monitoring as patients here are seen flouting social distancing norms. Tripura has seen a spike in coronavirus cases, with infections having crossed the 1,000-mark.", "lang": "en"}
