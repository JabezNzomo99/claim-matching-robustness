It came in the middle of an attack on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell. The White House declined to answer our questions intended to clarify the president\u2019s words, so we consulted with experts in an effort to deconstruct his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cNumber two, a positive note, we\u2019re doing very well on trade, we\u2019re doing very well \u2014 our companies are very strong. Don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re still up from when I came in, 38 percent or something. You know, it\u2019s a tremendous \u2014 it\u2019s not like we\u2019re up \u2014 and we\u2019re much stronger.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s phrase \u2014 \u201cup from when I came in, 38 percent or something\u201d \u2014 appears to be a reference to the stock market. If so, it\u2019s wrong. At the time of the interview, the Dow Jones industrial average was 25 percent higher than Jan. 20, 2017, when he took the oath of office; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up about 18 percent. Trump tends to date things from the election, in effect wiping out the last three months of Barack Obama\u2019s term. But even that would not explain his use of 38 percent.\n\nWhile Trump says \u201cwe\u2019re doing very well on trade,\u201d the U.S. trade deficit has increased about 9 percent over the same period in 2017, according to the Commerce Department. We\u2019ve explained before that this is not an especially important metric \u2014 but it is to Trump, who harps on it. He even prematurely claimed victory in reducing the trade deficit earlier this year when he misread some economic numbers.\n\nBank liquidity around the world has improved, according to a new report by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system. The loan-to-deposit ratio \u2014 a key measure for liquidity \u2014 for U.S. banks has nudged higher during Trump\u2019s presidency, according to Fed data, so it\u2019s a stretch to say \u201cmuch more liquid.\u201d (Note: the higher the ratio, the lower the liquidity.)\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to $50 billion appears to be about the Fed\u2019s unwinding of its program known as quantitative easing (QE) \u2014 large-scale purchases of assets by central banks. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities as part of a low-interest policy that effectively brought interest rates to zero.\n\nNow that the economy has recovered and is doing well, the Fed is trying to unwind its positions, mainly by letting bonds mature without reinvesting them. In effect, the money disappears, which Trump appears to be talking about when he says the Fed is \u201cknocking out liquidity.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the plan, the Fed said it would gradually increase the amount of holdings it shed, including up to $50 billion a month in the fourth quarter of 2018. But that was the maximum \u2014 the Fed had not actually reached the $50 billion mark. In October, for instance, the Fed\u2019s holdings of Treasury securities fell by $23.8 billion.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to unwind QE is actually a vote of confidence in the economy because it is tapping on the growth brakes to avoid an overheated economy. It\u2019s worth noting that when Trump ran for president, he accused the Fed of keeping interest rates artificially low and predicted stocks would crash when interest rates rose. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\nJared Bernstein, an economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, said that ordinarily when the unemployment rate is so low, there should be little or no budget deficit, rather than the 4 percent of the gross domestic product under Trump. \u201cIn that regard, he\u2019s contributed to both of the problems he\u2019s whining about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debt\u2019s higher because he deficit-finances everything (Democrats are implicated too here on spending), and his stimulus at close-to-full employment has the Fed worrying more about overheating.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Obama didn\u2019t do that. And just so you understand, I\u2019m playing a normalization economy, whereas he\u2019s playing a free economy. It\u2019s easy to make money when you\u2019re paying no interest. It\u2019s easy to make money when you\u2019re not doing any pay-downs, so you can\u2019t \u2014 and despite that, the numbers we have are phenomenal numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like \u2014 once again \u2014 he cannot distinguish between the U.S. government and a family business. If you run a family business with lots of debt \u2014 the Trump Organization for example \u2014 it\u2019s a lot easier to turn a profit if interest rates are near zero,\u201d Blinder said. \u201cA super-charitable interpretation might be that, if super-low interest rates give the economy faster GDP growth, then that will help hold down the budget deficit. But, of course, GDP growth has been faster in the Trump administration so far, and the deficit has been far larger.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
