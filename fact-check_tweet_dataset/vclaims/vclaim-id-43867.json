The photos show rescuers in masks and covered in ash while holding dogs and chickens.\n\nMelecio Valero's post had the caption: \u201cKUDOS TO THESE BRAVE AND KINDHEARTED PEOPLE! Thank you for saving them! God bless your heart po and please don\u2019t forget to continually pray for the people who are greatly affected.\u201d\n\nBeauty Products Online Philippines, which posted a few minutes after Melecio Valero, captioned its post: \"Salute to those people who rescued the innocent animals. Thank you for not forgetting them.\"\n\nThe facts: All except one of the posted photos of people rescuing animals were taken in Guatemala in 2018, after the eruption of Volcan de Fuego.\n\nReverse image search shows 5 of the 6 photos shared by the Facebook pages originally appeared in various news reports on the 2018 Volcan de Fuego eruption. Among the news outlets that published the photos almost two years ago were ABC News, Reuters, Independent.ie, Telegraph, and Al Jazeera.\n\nOut of the 6 photos posted by these pages, only one was taken in the Philippines after Taal Volcano erupted. It\u2019s the photo of a masked woman holding her pet dog in Talisay, Batangas.\n\nAlthough the pages did not mention Taal in their captions, they shared their posts a day after Taal Volcano erupted on January 12, causing readers to believe it was taken in the Philippines.\n\nBoth Facebook pages were also sharing a number of Taal-related posts as of January 15. By Rappler's count, Melecio Valero shared at least 35 posts about Taal Volcano eruption, and Beauty Products Online Philippines shared at least 18 posts. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
