This is false; a spokesman for the US Marshals Service said 39 youngsters were found in different locations in seven states, including Georgia.\n\n\u201cHow is finding 39 missing children in a double wide trailer in Georgia NOT the biggest news story in America?\u201d reads an August 28, 2020 Facebook post shared more than one million times.\n\n\u201cCan someone - anyone - explain to me why finding 39 missing KIDS in a double wide trailer in Georgia not the biggest news story on the planet ??\u201d reads another post shared 34,000 times.\n\nThe claim was also shared on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here and on Instagram here.\n\nSome posts, for example here, here and here, spread the claim using the hashtag #SaveTheChildren.\n\nSupporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory -- which alleges that powerful Democrats and Hollywood figures engage in child sex trafficking and abuse -- have hijacked the hashtag to stoke fears on social media about sexual predators.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has done nothing to tamp down the theory, and said of Q supporters: \u201cthey like me very much.\u201d\n\nThe US Marshals Service announced on August 27 that 39 children were indeed found over two weeks as part of \u201cOperation Not Forgotten.\"\n\nHowever, spokesman Dave Oney told AFP by email that the children were found in multiple locations, not in a double-wide trailer.\n\nThe children were mostly found in Georgia -- where all 39 were reported missing, according to Oney -- but in 15 different counties, not one trailer. Others were found in South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Florida, Kentucky and Michigan.\n\nHe said that 15 of the children were identified as victims of trafficking, while \u201c13 of the 39 children were located during the operation and determined to be with a proper custodian.\u201d\n\nThe rest of them were victims of parental kidnappings, or runaways from foster or adoptive homes or from juvenile justice custody, he said.\n\n\u201cThese missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions,\u201d the US Marshals press release said.\n\nOney sent AFP a chart outlining the counties and states where each of the children were found during the operation, available below.\n\nDespite claims that mainstream media failed to cover the story, the results of \u201cOperation Not Forgotten\u201d were reported on or before the date of the posts by Fox News here as well as local media here, here and here, and subsequently by CBS and CNN.\n\nOney said \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of misinformation\u201d circulating about child trafficking and encouraged people \u201cto do their due diligence.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
