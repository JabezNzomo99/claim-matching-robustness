It becomes difficult for the virus to function properly once the lungs' membranes become inflamed.\n\nApart from affecting the lungs, the virus may also cause nausea, diarrhoea or indigestion, if it infects cells in the gastrointestinal system.\n\nIn the most severe cases, COVID-19 may lead to organ failure and death.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading national public health institute of the United States, the Clinical Presentation of COVID-19 follows the path given below:\n\nThe incubation period for COVID-19 is considered to be extending to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset differ in different people, however, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following:\n\u2022 None Anorexia (40\u201384%): Anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by abnormally low body weight.\n\nOlder adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.\n\nAsymptomatic - Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who never develop symptoms.\n\nThe largest cohort of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical:\n\u2022 None Mild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider, given below is how the infection progresses in typical patients.\n\nDay 1: Patients may have a fever. In addition to this, they may also experience fatigue, muscle pain, or a dry cough. In some diarrhoea or nausea, one to two days before has also been reported.\n\nDay 5: Patients may have difficulty in breathing.\n\nDay 7: According to a study in Wuhan day 7 on an average, is usually when patients are admitted to a hospital.\n\nDay 8: Patients with severe infection develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the lungs.\n\nDay 10: Patients with worsening symptoms are likely to be admitted to the ICU around this time. Abdominal pain and appetite loss are seen in these patients. The fatality rate at this stage hovers around 2%.\n\nDay 17: Recovering patients are usually discharged from the hospital after two-and-a-half weeks on an average.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: COVID-19 Prescription From Medanta, Gurugram Goes Viral With False Claims", "lang": "en"}
