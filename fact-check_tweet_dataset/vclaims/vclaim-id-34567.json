This was also pointed out by Twitter user Riaz Ahmed. According to a report in Oneindia published on October 30, 2017, a beheaded dead body of a young woman was found in the village of Bhavpur in Auraiya\u2019s Kotwali area. The body, with the head and hands chopped-off, was discovered by villagers who alleged rape.\n\nAn earlier report by Newstrack states that the incident took place on October 29, 2017. The case was also reported by Punjab Kersari\n\nAlt News contacted Saharanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar who clarified that false claims are circulating on social media suggesting that the photographs depict a recent incident in the city. Saharanpur police also debunked the misinformation in a tweet.\n\nWe were unable to locate any follow-up reports on the case thus specific particulars of the case could not be established. However, as the photographs have been available on the internet since 2017, they cannot represent a recent incident.\n\nImages of a beheaded corpse of a woman, allegedly raped, found in a farm in UP\u2019s Auraiya in 2017 have been shared as a recent case that took place in Saharanpur. Since the gang-rape and murder of a veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, social media has been brimming with misinformation around rape crimes.", "lang": "en"}
