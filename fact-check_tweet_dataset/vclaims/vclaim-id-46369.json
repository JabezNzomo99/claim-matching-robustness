He rose to stardom after 2013 hit \u2018Kai Po Che!\u2019 and since then he has starred in several movies including the biopic on former Indian cricket team captain MS Dhoni. People from all walks of life offered condolences on social media \u2014 fans, actors, journalists and politicians.\n\nIn this backdrop, a screenshot that appears to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet paying last respects to Rajput has gone viral on social media where Gandhi has apparently addressed the actor as a \u2018cricketer\u2019.\n\nAs per the viral screenshot, Gandhi tweeted, \u201cI am sorry to hear about the passing of #SushantSinghRajput. A young & talented Cricketer, gone too soon. My condolences to his family, friends & fans across the world.\u201d\n\nSeveral users on Twitter and Facebook , believing the screenshot to be authentic, have attacked Gandhi and questioned his general knowledge.\n\nTwitter user @darshtiti (archive link) tweeted the viral image and wrote, \u201cYou all should train your Pappu in general knowledge.\u201d Similarly, @BLDY_HYPOCRITES (archive link) posted the picture and said, \u201c@RahulGandhi is ridiculous\u2026. An individual who cnt get his info right & calls Sushant Singh Rajput a \u201cYoung & Talented Cricketer\u201d.\n\nIn order to authenticate the viral image, Alt News visited Gandhi\u2019s Twitter profile and found the tweet where he had extended condolences to Rajput and his family. He wrote, \u201cI am sorry to hear about the passing of #SushantSinghRajput. A young & talented actor, gone too soon. My condolences to his family, friends & fans across the world.\u201d\n\nAlt News compared the screenshot with the tweet posted by Gandhi. Both the tweets are identical word for word, with the exception that the viral screenshot addressed Rajput as a cricketer, with a capital C, while Gandhi\u2019s tweet addressed him an actor. Furthermore, the time stamp of both tweets is also the same.\n\nThus the viral image is morphed. This was yet another attempt to portray Rahul Gandhi in poor light. Alt News has debunked multiple accounts of misinformation about Gandhi in the past including a morphed tweet where he is shown suggesting odd/ even method for reopening schools.", "lang": "en"}
