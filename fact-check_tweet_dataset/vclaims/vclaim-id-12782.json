The article quoting unnamed government sources said select few within the government and Reserve Bank of India were privy to the plan to initiate the step of demonetisation.\n\nThe Economic Times' article attributes the metaphor 'a new Lee Kuan Yew is born in India' to an unnamed official within the Narendra Modi government.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from ET's story. Click here to view an archived version.\n\n\"Taking a political call of an economic move of this magnitude, government insiders feel, has brought \u201cnew respect\u201c for the PM. A highly-placed government functionary even sought to equate him with Singapore's legend Lee Kuan Yew. \u201cFrom making up his mind to rolling it out yesterday (Tuesday), a new Lee Kuan Yew is born in India. It will be reflected in the legacy of this Prime Minister,\u201c he said.\"\n\nThe image of a split face of the two leaders also appears to have been created by the newspaper as the image includes a photo credit to 'Arindam', at the bottom right.\n\nThe newspaper changed the headline of the story later to 'Bombshell to recall Rs 500 & Rs 1,000 notes spelt out by PM Modi in March: Govt source' However, an archived version of its home page showing the original headline can be viewed here.\n\nOn the same day (November 10, 2016) Singapore-based website The Independent's headline 'Modi does a Lee Kuan Yew to stamp out corruption in India' was reported by a few Indian media outlets such as Zee News .\n\nIt was also mentioned by moneycontrol.com in 2017.\n\nHowever, The Independent appears to have republished the unnamed Indian government official's quote about 'A new Lee Kuan Yew is born in India' without crediting The Economic Times. While The Independent's story is only six paragraphs long, The Economic Times' story is a detailed piece quoting government insiders on demonetisation.\n\nThe Singaporean website is not related to the British newspaper of the same name.\n\nSeparately, a correction made by The Huffington Post India in 2016 throws light on the confusion in India about the reportage on demonetisation in the Singaporean media.\n\n\"Correction: Earlier, the headline and the copy said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making headlines in Singapore for his demonetization move. That information is incorrect. We regret the error.\" - The Huffington Post.\n\nThe founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew is credited for transforming the tiny island from a colonial trading post to a hub of modernity, efficiency and an economic model for its Asian peers to emulate.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's admiration for Lee Kuan Yew is also well known. The prime minister had called him a 'lion among leaders' when he tweeted condoling Lee's demise in March 2015.", "lang": "en"}
