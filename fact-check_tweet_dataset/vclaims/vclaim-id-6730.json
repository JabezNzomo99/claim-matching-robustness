As Republicans craft a replacement for Obamacare, many have suggested that these ideas will be carried forward.\n\nYet we were surprised when we saw that, in response to a question about whether these provisions would be in the replacement, Rep. Marsha Blackburn told people in her district that these were actually \u201ctwo Republican provisions which made it into the [Obamacare] bill.\u201d\n\nThe ACA was crafted through many months of committee hearings and debates in 2009, in both the House and the Senate, and untangling who was responsible for what is a difficult chore. But we checked with a number of congressional aides and other experts who were involved in the process at the time and could find few, if any, Republican fingerprints on these two provisions in the legislative process.\n\nBarring insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting medical conditions had long been a holy grail of health-care reform. Chris Jennings, a health-care consultant who worked for both presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said the question of how to achieve this dates back to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.). That law required insurance companies to nullify preexisting-condition exclusions for people who had continuous coverage and were joining a group health plan at work. But it did not offer any protection if someone moved from a plan in the individual market to another plan, or from an employer plan to the individual market.\n\nJennings said the Clinton administration and Congress were able to \u201cenhance protections (in a bipartisan fashion) for people going from insurance market to insurance market but we could not eliminate the underwriting practice altogether because we could not require a health plan to insure a \u2018house on fire\u2019 patient unless we had near or close to universal coverage.\u201d Universal or near-universal coverage was the key, because then the pool of people in the insurance market would be broad enough that insurance companies could cover sicker people without increasing premiums.\n\nThe individual-mandate approach is what emerged in the bills crafted by Democrats in the House and the Senate. In the House, the Affordable Care Act for America Act (H.R. 3962) was introduced on Oct. 29, 2009, and then passed by the House on Nov. 7, 2009. In the Senate, Kennedy was a fierce proponent of ending the preexisting coverage ban. The final version of the ACA enacted the ban on barring coverage of preexisting conditions, aided by the creation of a temporary, national high-risk pool that served as a bridge from 2010 to 2014, when the Obamacare markets would be operational.\n\nBut the Republican alternative did not offer coverage for preexisting conditions. On Nov. 6, 2009, in an interview on C-SPAN, Blackburn was specifically asked about that criticism \u2014 and she touted instead an expansion of high-risk pools. \u201cThere is a way to do that, and address that, and bring people into those high-risk pools,\u201d she said. The Republican alternative to the House bill would have allocated $24 billion over 10 years to fund high-risk pools for people with chronic illnesses, but a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the proposal found it would have had a minimal impact on reducing the number of uninsured Americans.\n\nBefore the ACA, a number of states had a similar policy, but it was not as broad or consistently applied. So Democratic policymakers sought ways to add young adults to the insured rolls, as many lost coverage at the age of 19, when they graduated from high school or when they graduated from college.\n\nUpdate: Blackburn\u2019s staff suggested that Blackburn co-sponsored legislation in November, 2009, which included these provisions. But the bill never came to a vote \u2014 and records show Blackburn signed on as a co-sponsor in June, 2010, after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. There were a handful of other GOP bills with these sorts of provisions, which also did not go far, as well as some rhetorical support by some Republicans.\n\nThere is no evidence that either of these popular elements of the ACA \u201cwere Republican provisions,\u201d as Blackburn claims. In fact, Blackburn is on record as promoting the concept of federally funded \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d even on the eve of the House vote for the Democratic bill that included a robust provision to bar insurance companies from refusing to cover preexisting conditions. Similarly, the Obama White House and House Democrats were the prime movers of the under-26 provision.", "lang": "en"}
