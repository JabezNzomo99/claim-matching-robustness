James Inhofe misleadingly claimed that the statistics behind the globe\u2019s likely hottest years on record \u2014 2014, 2015 and 2016 \u2014 were \u201cmeaningless\u201d because the temperature increases were \u201cwell within the margin of error.\u201d Taking into account the margins of error, there\u2019s still a long-term warming trend.\n\nInhofe, a longtime skeptic of human-caused climate change, made his claim Jan. 3 on the Senate floor.\n\nSince Inhofe cites data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the British government, we\u2019ll concentrate on their analyses.\n\nAccording to NOAA, 2016 was the warmest year on record for the globe since record keeping began in 1880; 2015 ranked the second warmest year and 2014 the third warmest. There are uncertainties in those rankings, however.\n\nAs we explained in 2015 when then-President Obama proclaimed 2014 \u201cthe planet\u2019s warmest year on record,\u201d such a definitive claim is problematic. For instance, while NOAA found then that 2014 had the highest probability of being the warmest, there remained statistical odds that other years could have held that distinction. But as we explained, scientists are more concerned with long-term trends than any given year.\n\nAnd 2017 is on track to be another warm year. On Dec. 18, NOAA said 2017 could end up being the third warmest on record, based on data for January to November. NOAA spokesman Brady Philips told us the agency will release information on the year as a whole on Jan. 18.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 18: NOAA has confirmed 2017 was likely the third hottest year on record since record keeping began in 1880. On Jan. 18, the agency said 2017 was 0.84 C (1.51 F) warmer than the 20th century mean, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 0.15 C (0.27 F).\n\nNOAA ranks years by looking at how much their average temperatures differ from the 20th century average \u2014 what scientists call a temperature anomaly.\n\nBased on the agency\u2019s analysis, the average temperature for 2016 was 0.94 degrees Celsius (1.69 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 20th century average of 13.9 C (56.9 F). The margin of error for 2016 was plus-or-minus 0.15 C (0.27 F).\n\nNOAA explains that a margin of error takes into account the \u201cinherent level of uncertainty\u201d that comes with \u201c[e]valuating the temperature of the entire planet.\u201d\n\nThe agency adds that the reported temperature anomaly \u2014 0.94 C in the case of 2016 \u2014 \u201cis not an exact measurement; instead it is the central \u2014 and most likely \u2014 value within a range of possible values.\u201d\n\nFor example, that range, or margin of error, would be 0.79 C (1.42 F) to 1.09 C (1.96 F) for 2016. Scientists at NOAA are 95 percent certain the temperature anomaly for 2016, or for any given year, will fall within the margin of error.\n\nAs Inhofe notes, NOAA scientists found that the average temperature for 2015 was 0.04 C less than 2016\u2019s at 0.90 C (1.62 F) above the 20th century norm. The margin of error for 2015 was plus-or-minus 0.08 C (0.14 F), which means the range for 2015 is between 0.82 C (1.48 F) and 0.98 C (1.76 F).\n\nThe difference between 2015 and 2014, however, was wider. The average temperature for 2014 was 0.74 C (1.33 F) above the 20th century mean, or 0.16 C (0.29 F) less than 2015. The range for 2014 is between 0.59 C (1.06 F) and 0.89 C (1.60 F).\n\nSo the margins of error for these three years do overlap. When we requested evidence from Inhofe\u2019s office, spokeswoman Leacy Burke sent us links to articles that reiterate the senator\u2019s claim that the temperature increase in 2016 was within a margin of error \u2013 meaning, again, that while 2016 is most likely the warmest on record, other years that fall within that margin, including 2015 and 2014, could be the warmest. Still that doesn\u2019t mean the statistics are \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Over the long haul, data show an increasing trend, as the chart below shows.\n\n\u201cOverall, the global annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07\u00b0C (0.13\u00b0F) per decade since 1880 and at an average rate of 0.17\u00b0C (0.31\u00b0F) per decade since 1970,\u201d says NOAA.\n\nSimilar to NOAA, the U.K.\u2019s Met Office, the country\u2019s national weather service, reported that 2016 \u201cwas one of the warmest two years on record, nominally exceeding the record temperature of 2015.\u201d The agency also found that 2014 likely ranked the third warmest year.\n\nBoth NOAA and the Met Office note that human-caused global warming isn\u2019t the only force behind the record temperatures.\n\nPeter Stott, then the acting director of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: \u201cA particularly strong El Ni\u00f1o event contributed about 0.2C to the annual average for 2016, which was about 1.1C above the long term average from 1850 to 1900.\u201d El Ni\u00f1o is a naturally occurring interaction between the atmosphere and ocean that is linked to periodic warming.\n\nStott added, \u201cHowever, the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe Met Office\u2019s numbers differ slightly from NOAA\u2019s, in part, because the agency uses a different reference point.\n\nNOAA ranks years based on how much their average temperatures differ from the 20th century norm. The Met Office uses the temperature average between 1850 and 1900 or between 1961 and 1990.\n\nUsing that latter reference point, the Met Office found 2016\u2019s temperature anomaly to be 0.77 C, plus-or-minus 0.1 C, which was only 0.01 more than 2015\u2019s temperature anomaly.\n\nSo Inhofe is right that the British government\u2019s margins of error for 2016 and 2015 overlap.\n\nBut Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, explained in an email to us why it\u2019s important to look at the long-term trend \u2014 not just the difference between two years, as Inhofe did.\n\nNOAA also explains the difference between looking at single years versus the long-term trend: \u201cAs more and more data builds a long-term series, there is less and less influence of single \u2018outliers\u2019 on the overall trend, making the long-term trend even more certain than the individual points along it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if scientists found that the globe had just one year with an exceptionally high temperature average, they may not be convinced that global warming is occurring. But if data show that the planet has experienced a number of record warm years in a row, it suggests the warming trend is real.\n\nIn fact, NOAA says there\u2019s only a 0.0125 percent chance of seeing three outliers in a row \u2014 and the Earth has seen many more record warm years than three.\n\nNOAA writes that 2016 \u201cmarks the fifth time in the 21st century a new record high annual temperature has been set (along with 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2015) and also marks the 40th consecutive year (since 1977) that the annual temperature has been above the 20th century average.\u201d\n\nSo while Inhofe was right that the margins of error for temperature measurements in recent years overlap, that doesn\u2019t negate a long-term warming trend or render the temperature anomalies \u201cmeaningless.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
