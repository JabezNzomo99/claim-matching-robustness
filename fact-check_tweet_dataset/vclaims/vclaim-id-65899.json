The CDC recommends cloth face coverings, not surgical masks or respirators, for non-healthcare workers.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC said that cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than two years of age, anyone with breathing difficulties or is unconscious, incapacitated, or unable to remove the covering without help. However, the CDC did not say that the use of masks could cause hypoxia or hypercapnia.\n\nOther organizations also fact-checked these claims. Agence France-Presse (AFP) said the claims that prolonged face mask use can cause hypoxia and hypercapnia are false and unlikely, respectively. According to AFP, Kenyan infectious disease epidemiologist Mark Nanyingi said that people with chronic respiratory illnesses may exert unnecessary pressure on their lungs if they use masks, and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can suffer from hypoxia or hypercapnia if they wear face masks for prolonged hours.\n\nOne study entitled, \"Risks of N95 Face Mask Use in Subjects With COPD,\" found that among the 7 of 97 subjects who removed the N95 respirator during a 10-minute rest period and 6-minute walk test, many manifested symptoms of hypoxemia or hypercapnia. The paper said that other patients, like those with asthma or severe heart failure, should be included in future studies on the safety of N95 use.\n\n\"The CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2,\" the CDC said.\n\nWHO Philippines said that decision-makers should consider a risk-based approach to decide the settings and circumstances when non-medical masks may be used in the community. \"It is often difficult to keep adequate physical distance in the car or vehicle, and the use of a mask in that setting might prevent one from spreading COVID-19 or other respiratory infections to others. Masks should only be used as part of a comprehensive package of interventions,\" WHO said.", "lang": "en"}
