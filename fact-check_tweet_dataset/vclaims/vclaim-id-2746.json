And that means that they can pay themselves better, or they need to work fewer hours [...] This is a long standing challenge of the British economy\u2026\u201d\n\nOn average, UK workers were 26% less productive per hour than German workers in 2016.\n\nSo it took German workers around four hours to produce what UK workers did in five hours.\n\nWorkers in the UK work longer days on average than German workers. This pushes up the amount each UK worker produces in total. So overall, UK workers were 8.5% less productive than German workers in 2016.\n\nThe gap between the two countries was wider in 2015 when it took German workers less than four hours to produce what UK workers did in five hours.\n\nAnd, as Mr Clark says, most German workers earn more per hour than most UK workers (at least, they do according to figures from 2014).\n\n\u2018Productivity\u2019 isn\u2019t just about how hard people work. The OECD says it\u2019s about efficiency and innovation too. \u201dWorking smarter\u201d, rather than \u201cworking harder\u201d.\n\nPeople think it can be improved by investment in things like infrastructure, education, management and technology. For example, you\u2019d be more productive if your boss bought you a faster computer, even if you put the same amount of effort into your job.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no single answer on exactly how to solve the UK\u2019s \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, as the Bank of England put it, or exactly why it exists. It\u2019s likely to be multiple factors at play. We\u2019ve talked some of these issues in the past.", "lang": "en"}
