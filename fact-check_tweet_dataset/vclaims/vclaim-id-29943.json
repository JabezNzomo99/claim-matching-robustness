It would merely allow cases of threats or harassment against some state officials to be prosecuted in Richmond.\n\nViral headlines peddled by multiple websites have warned that a bill in Virginia\u2019s state legislature would make a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d out of criticizing the state\u2019s elected officials.\n\nActually, the bill in question doesn\u2019t create any new criminal offenses.\n\nA review of the proposed state legislation, House Bill 1627, shows that the bill would make changes to where certain crimes against public officials can be prosecuted, but it doesn\u2019t change the existing statutory offenses.\n\nThe bill proposes several amendments to the law that would make it so that cases of threats or harassment against certain state officials \u2014 or threats against some state-owned property \u2014 could be prosecuted in the state capital of Richmond, regardless of where such messages were sent or received. Under the current law, some of the statutes contain language that says such prosecutions can occur in locales where the communication was made or received.\n\u2022 Prosecutions under an existing statute regarding cases of \u201c[t]hreats of death or bodily injury\u201d (which in some cases is considered a felony) could be carried out in the city of Richmond, Virginia\u2019s capital \u2014 not just where the message was sent or received \u2014 if the threats are made against any of the following: \u201cthe Governor, Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor, Lieutenant Governor-elect, Attorney General, or Attorney General-elect, a member or employee of the General Assembly, a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia.\u201d\n\u2022 Charges under another statute \u2014 dealing with \u201c[h]arassment by computer,\u201d a class 1 misdemeanor \u2014 could also be handled in Richmond if the person harassed is one of the aforementioned officials.\n\u2022 Prosecutions under a section of the law on \u201c[u]nlawful use of telephones\u201d \u2014 which covers offenses such as harassment by phone \u2014 could be conducted in Richmond when it comes to cases involving the same officials.\n\u2022 The current statute pertaining to \u201c[t]hreatening the Governor or his immediate family\u201d would be modified so that prosecutions of such threats against the governor could be carried out in Richmond.\n\u2022 None Violations of another portion of the law, regarding \u201c[t]hreats to bomb or damage buildings or means of transportation,\u201d could also be handled in Richmond if the property is within the capitol district and state-owned.\n\nEugene Chigna, a legislative aide for the bill\u2019s sponsor, Democratic Delegate Jeff Bourne, told FactCheck.org that the bill stems from concerns about jurisdiction raised by the Virginia Capitol Police, which protects state officials and capitol properties. Some of the existing statutes explicitly state that such cases can prosecuted where the communication is made or received, which isn\u2019t always known.\n\n\u201cCapitol Police has no way of knowing where they were when [someone] received that threat,\u201d Chigna said in a phone interview.\n\nAsked about the legislation, Joe Macenka, a spokesman for Virginia\u2019s Capitol Police, said in an email: \u201cEvolving technology makes it increasingly difficult for investigators to establish where potential threats originate or are received, hampering the Division of Capitol Police in its duties to serve and protect all three branches of government.\u201d\n\nMacenka said the \u201clegislation creates no new offenses, but helps ensure that prosecution of alleged threats is always possible by establishing an alternative venue that can be used where venue otherwise cannot be clearly established.\u201d\n\nAndrew Block, an associate law professor at the University of Virginia and director of its State and Local Government Policy Clinic, reviewed the bill for us and came to the same conclusion.\n\nIn an email, Block said the \u201cstatutory changes merely clarify that Richmond is an additional jurisdiction where the case be prosecuted when the victim of the threat or harassment is one of a number of specifically enumerated state officials or employees. The proposed legislation does not create any new crimes.\u201d\n\nWebsites such as Big League Politics, Law Enforcement Today, 2nd Amendment Daily News, and others, told a different story.\n\n\u201cVirginia Democrats Push Legislation to Make Criticism of Government Officials a Criminal Offense,\u201d reads the Big League Politics headline, shared nearly 10,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Today story \u2014 titled \u201cVirginia politicians push bill to make criticizing state leaders criminal offense\u201d \u2014 was shared on Facebook almost 43,000 times and amassed more than 285,000 engagements.\n\nThe Big League Politics story goes on to claim that the \u201c[l]anguage in the bill explicitly criminalizes free speech, in what would constitute a blatant attack on the 1st Amendment of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt then repeats language from the legislation, but fails to note that the bill was citing the existing statute regarding harassment by computer. That statute reads: \u201cIf any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d\n\nApart from a negligible wording change of \u201cshall be guilty\u201d to \u201cis guilty,\u201d the proposed bill would make only the jurisdictional change we explained earlier \u2014 allowing for such harassment of some state officials and employees to be handled in Richmond.\n\nOther websites \u2014 including one called Reformation Charlotte \u2014 similarly misrepresented existing law as something new.\n\nThe misinformation\u2019s spread was aided by well-followed Facebook pages, including one for Republican state Sen. Amanda Chase, who posted an erroneous message that the bill is \u201ceffectively criminalizing dissent\u201d against state officials and later shared the Reformation Charlotte article. We reached out to Chase\u2019s office and did not hear back.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
