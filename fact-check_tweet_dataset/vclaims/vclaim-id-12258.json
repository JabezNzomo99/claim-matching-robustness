What would you do if you lost heat indefinitely as the act of a foreign power on the same day the temperature in your backyard matched the temperature in Antarctica?\u201d\n\nThe RIA Novosti article went on to describe Maddow as \u201cknown for her anti-Russian position,\u201d and concluding that her questions were baseless and merely a fraction of the U.S. media's \u201cambiguous statements demonizing Russia.\u201d\n\nRIA Novosti is wrong \u2013 the MSNBC host\u2019s concerns are based on U.S. government warnings.\n\nThe segment on Maddow\u2019s program is seven minutes long, reporting on the U.S. intelligence chiefs\u2019 report and testimony before Congress earlier in the week. Maddow begins not with Russia but China, quoting the intelligence report that says China could disrupt a natural gas supply \u201cfor days to weeks\u201d in the U.S.\n\nShe quotes the report saying Russia has the ability \u201cto execute cyber attacks\u2026such as disrupting an electrical distribution network for at least a few hours.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks is right to assert that Maddow is viewed as generally favoring the Democratic Party. However, in this segment she cited reporting by the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, a spin off a company founded by Rupert Murdoch, who also founded Fox News, the conservative U.S. cable channel. Maddow spent several minutes interviewing the the Journal's energy reporter.\n\nIn March 2018 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation alerted Americans that, \"Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors have targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including those of energy, nuclear, water and aviation.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the Russian hackers had the ability to shut down at will more than 50 U.S. nuclear power plants.\n\nAnd the U.S. could have reasonable basis for such concerns because cutting off entire nations from heating supplies in the midst of bitterly cold winters is not something unheard of when comes to Russia.\n\nIn Europe, where countries rely on Russian gas for up to 80 percent of their demands, Russia on multiple occasions over the years has cut off or significantly reduced gas supplies. In January 2009, for instance Russia\u2019s actions affected several countries from France to Turkey.\n\nRussia\u2019s abuse of gas agreements forced the European Union to launch an anti-trust investigation against the state giant Gazprom.\n\nSince we published this story late on February 1, a number of readers have brought to our attention even more recent interruptions of energy supplies. Ukraine has reportedly suffered mid-winter cyber-attacks against the nation's power grid, leaving millions without heat or electricity.\n\nAs the Wired publication described it \"...the blackouts weren\u2019t just isolated attacks. They were part of a digital blitzkrieg that has pummeled Ukraine for the past three years\u2014a sustained cyber -- assault unlike any the world has ever seen.\"", "lang": "en"}
