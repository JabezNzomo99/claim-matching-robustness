While travel authority is not required for travel within provinces, it is still required for those crossing the borders of provinces and regions.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 26, the joint task force led by Eleazar clarified that there is no lifting of the travel authority requirement in all parts of the country. (READ: Planning to leave your province or the metro under GCQ? What you should know)\n\n\u201cThe current disinformation on social media, referring to a \u2018social card,\u2019 did not come from the JTF COVID Shield and was already circulated a few months ago. But it is now being used again to make it appear that it is a new declaration from the JTF COVID Shield, purposely to confuse the public and eventually discredit the efforts being made by the national government to contain the spread of the coronavirus,\u201d Eleazar said in a statement.\n\nA reverse image search showed that the graphic was shared on Facebook as early as June 2, following President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s downgrading of quarantine measures in Metro Manila to GCQ for the first time. Duterte reverted Metro Manila to modified enhanced community quarantine from August 4 to 18 following health professionals\u2019 plea. He then placed Metro Manila back to GCQ until August 31.\n\nIn a radio interview with DZRH on August 19, Eleazar also clarified that only authorized persons are allowed to obtain travel authority passes. This can be obtained for free from police stations, but a medical clearance certificate is required.\n\n\u201cEven though many of our provinces are already under MGCQ, the remaining travel restriction is that you can\u2019t go out of your area \u2013 be it your province, Metro Manila, or our highly-urbanized cities \u2013 unless you are an essential worker or your travel is work-related. Other than that, you have to secure travel authority if you have to travel for emergency purposes or if you are a locally-stranded individual,\u201d Eleazar said in a mix of Filipino and English. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
