Not content with generations of antisemitism before and after the Holocaust, Europe\u2019s ruling class apparently thinks it\u2019s a good idea to push what is the equivalent of an in kind contribution to the boycott, divestment, and sanction movement.\u201d\n\nThe blogger Robert Spencer, who runs the Jihad Watch website, went further in his characterization of the episode, publishing a blog post with the headline, \u201cNazism Returns: European Union to Put Warning Labels on Jewish-Made Products.\u201d He joined the Washington Free Beacon in linking the episode to the Holocaust, writing \u201cEurope has gone down this road before. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d\n\nThe American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), a Christian conservative organization whose chief counsel is President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow, released a podcast episode whose title similarly claimed: \u201cEurope to Force Warning Labels on Jewish-Made Products.\u201d In an accompanying blog post, the ACLJ wrote:\n\n\u201cIn an extremely troubling move, Europe is poised to force warning labels on Jewish made products sold within Europe. Today on the broadcast, we discussed a decision out of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that, if upheld, would mandate that Jewish and Israeli products coming out of \u2018settlements\u2019 and \u2018Israeli colonies\u2019 have warning labels placed on them for coming from so-called disputed areas.\u201d\n\nA common thread throughout these reports was the claim that the EU was set to introduce a policy requiring products made by Jewish people in Israel to be labeled as such, if imported into the EU. That claim was false. Neither religious affiliation nor ethnic background had any relevance to advice given to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the summer of 2019, nor the matter being considered by the court.\n\nAs of mid-August, the ECJ had not issued a decision on the matter (contrary to the ACLJ\u2019s allusion to \u201ca decision out of the ECJ\u201d). Rather, one of the court\u2019s advocates general (formal advisors) discharged his duty by providing the ECJ a piece of non-binding guidance on the matter. In short, he advised that EU law required products made in Israeli-occupied territories and settlements to be labeled as such, in the interest of informing EU consumers.\n\nWe are neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the advocate general\u2019s conclusion, but in order to understand how he reached it, we must look at some important and occasionally somewhat complicated background information about EU policy towards both the Israeli-occupied territories and food labeling.\n\nThe EU, as a set of institutions, does not recognize the territories of the Golan Heights, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and the Gaza Strip as being a part of the state of Israel. This is based on several United Nations Security Council resolutions, which have deemed Israel\u2019s claim to those territories to be illegitimate under international law, and declared the construction of Israeli settlements in those territories to be in violation of international law. This article refers to those territories as the \u201cIsraeli-occupied territories\u201d or \u201coccupied territories,\u201d in the interest of clarity, not based on any subjective value judgement.\n\nThe EU has relatively strict regulations around how food must be labeled, including requiring that foodstuffs be accurately marked with their country of origin and \u201cplace of provenance,\u201d if failing to do so would deceive or mislead consumers, or deny them relevant contextual information. In that vein, the EU implemented Regulation No. 1169 in 2011.\n\nAmong other measures, Regulation 1169 stated that origin labels (or the absence thereof) must not deceive or mislead consumers, and that part of the overarching purpose of these labeling requirements was to protect the health of consumers but also to give them information about the origins of food, so that they could make consumer choices that took into account \u201ceconomic, environmental, social and ethical considerations.\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, the European Commission (effectively the EU\u2019s executive branch) pulled together those strands of EU policy in an \u201cinterpretative notice\u201d on \u201cindication of origin of goods from the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967.\u201d\n\nRoughly speaking, the 2015 notice stated that because the EU does not recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the occupied territories, foodstuffs that originate in those territories should not be labeled \u201cMade in Israel,\u201d since that would, in the commission\u2019s view, violate the principle that \u201cplace-of-provenance\u201d and \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labels must not mislead or deceive EU consumers.\n\nFurthermore, the 2015 notice stated that labels such as \u201cProduct from the West Bank\u201d would not be sufficient, because they would not tell the consumer whether the product had been made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, or by Palestinians there. The notice recommended that labels such as \u201cProduct from the West Bank (Israeli settlement)\u201d or \u201cProduct from the West Bank (Palestinian product)\u201d should be used, in order to provide consumers in the EU with the details and context they need in order to make \u201can informed transactional decision.\u201d\n\nBased in part on the European Commission\u2019s 2015 interpretative notice, France\u2019s Ministry of the Economy and Finances published its own notice in November 2016. That notice informed businesses in France that, based on existing EU law, products originating in the territories of Golan and the West Bank would have to be labeled as such, and further, products made in Israeli settlements there would have to carry even more specific labels.\n\nTwo organizations disputed that notice and asked France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (roughly equivalent to the Supreme Court) to annul it \u2014 the Organisation juive europ\u00e9enne (\u201cEuropean Jewish Organization\u201d) and Psagot, a company that operates a winery in the Psagot settlement in the West Bank. Both entities argued that the French government was acting beyond its powers by imposing the labeling requirements.\n\nFrance\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (\u201cCouncil of State\u201d) delayed making a decision on the notice, and instead sent the matter to the ECJ in June 2018, asking two questions:\n\n\u201cDoes EU law and in particular Regulation No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, where indication of the origin of a product falling within the scope of that regulation is mandatory, require, for a product from a territory occupied by Israel since 1967, indication of that territory and an indication that the product comes from an Israeli settlement if that is the case?\n\n\u201cIf not, do the provisions of the regulation, in particular those in Chapter VI thereof, allow a Member State to require those indications?\u201d\n\nThe ECJ received written submissions from Psagot, the Organisation juive europ\u00e9enne, the French government and the governments of Ireland, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and oral arguments were heard in April 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, ECJ Advocate General Gerard Hogan, a former Court of Appeal and High Court judge in Ireland, published an opinion on the two questions presented to the court. That opinion, which is not legally binding on the court, advised that:\n\u2022 EU law does require the \u201cIsraeli-occupied territories\u201d and \u201cIsraeli settlement\u201d labeling described in the question\n\u2022 EU law does not allow individual member states, on a nation-by-nation basis, to impose their own equivalent labeling requirements on products emerging from the Israeli-occupied territories and Israeli settlements\n\nOn June 13, Hogan laid out his reasoning in a detailed opinion that can be read in full here. In brief, he argued that:\n\u2022 Allowing consumers to make informed choices was an important component of existing EU law on food labeling, in particular Regulation 1169 of 2011\n\u2022 EU law stated that personal health was not the only important factor for a consumer in making informed decisions about food, and that \u201ceconomic, environmental, social and ethical considerations\u201d are often also relevant\n\u2022 EU law stated that food labeling relating to a product\u2019s \u201cplace of provenance\u201d should be mandatory if, without that label, a consumer would be deceived or misled about the product\n\u2022 Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied territories, and construction of settlements there, represented violations of international law, and were ethically objectionable to many people\n\u2022 Therefore, a consumer was liable to be deceived about a product from the Israeli-occupied territories, and in particular Israeli settlements, if that geographic information was not included in a label.\n\nThe crux of Hogan\u2019s argument can be summarized in the following section from his opinion:\n\nJust as many European consumers objected to the purchase of South African goods in the pre-1994 apartheid era, present day consumers may object on similar grounds to the purchase of goods from a particular country because, for example, it is not a democracy or because it pursues particular political or social policies which that consumer happens to find objectionable or even repugnant. In the context of the Israeli policies vis-\u00e0-vis the Occupied Territories and the settlements, there may be some consumers who object to the purchase of products emanating from the territories, precisely because of the fact that the occupation and the settlements clearly amount to a violation of international law. It is not, of course, the task of this Court to approve or to disapprove of such a choice on the part of the consumer: it is rather sufficient to say that a violation of international law constitutes the kind of ethical consideration which the Union legislature acknowledged as legitimate in the context of requiring country of origin information.\n\nOn the question of whether an individual EU member state could impose its own national requirements for mandatory \u201cplace of provenance\u201d labeling for food originating in the occupied territories, Hogan\u2019s reasoning was fairly straightforward. One article in Regulation 1169 of 2011, according to Hogan, allowed individual member states to impose such geographic labeling requirements, but only if there was an inextricable link between the place where a food product originates and the quality of the food product. Since this quality consideration didn\u2019t arise in the specific case of the occupied territories, that provision of EU law didn\u2019t apply.\n\nIf the ECJ eventually rules in accordance with Hogan\u2019s advice, the legal consequences would be somewhat complicated, but the practical consequences less so. Since Hogan\u2019s opinion held that, under EU law, individual EU member states could not require mandatory \u201cIsraeli-occupied territory\u201d or \u201cIsraeli settlement\u201d food labels, the French government\u2019s 2016 notice would likely be annulled by the French Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, just as those disputing it had requested.\n\nHowever, since Hogan\u2019s opinion also held that EU law did require such labels, those labels would ultimately end up pervading throughout the EU, including in France.\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s own personal opinion of it, Hogan\u2019s detailed analysis and advice to the ECJ was explicitly founded on the EU\u2019s long-standing policy regarding the legality of Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied territories, and the construction of Israeli settlements there, in combination with existing EU law regarding food labeling requirements.\n\nFar from recommending mandatory labeling of products as \u201cJewish\u201d or \u201cJewish-made,\u201d Hogan\u2019s opinion never once even mentioned Judaism, nor the religious affiliation or ethnic background of any producer of food in the occupied territories or Israeli settlements. Nor did the French government\u2019s 2016 notice (the subject of the dispute before the ECJ) make any such references, nor did the European Commission\u2019s 2015 interpretative notice make any such references.\n\nAs of Aug. 15, the ECJ had not ruled on this issue. However, if it does rule in accordance with Hogan\u2019s advice, it will be on the basis of what the law requires, not any religious or ethnic considerations. In the introduction to his opinion, Hogan emphasized that ECJ would view the issue as \u201ca purely legal matter,\u201d adding that \u201cnothing in either this opinion or in the ultimate judgment of the court should be construed as expressing a political or moral opinion.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the EU was about to require \u201cJewish-made\u201d labels for food products was a gross misrepresentation of the facts, and we therefore issue a rating of \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
