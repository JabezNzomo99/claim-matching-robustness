Texas gets 10 percent of its electricity from wind.\n\nHillary Clinton said in a May 15 speech in Kentucky that she will put her husband \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy \u2019cause he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d As we have written, the U.S. added nearly 21 million jobs during President Clinton\u2019s eight years in office, from January 1993 to January 2001, although he doesn\u2019t deserve all the credit.\n\nThree days before his economic role was announced, Bill Clinton was in Frankfort, Kentucky, where he talked in part about the economy.\n\nAt the 9:50-minute mark of his speech, Bill Clinton said median family income \u201cafter inflation is $4,000 lower than it was the last day I was in office 15 years ago.\u201d He\u2019s close on that; median family income was actually $3,109 less for all families in 2014 than what it was in 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau (table F-7).\n\nHe then went on to explain why the median family income has still not recovered.\n\nThe former president\u2019s office referred us to data from \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d a 2009 book by Harvard economics professors Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff. That book covered financial crises in 66 countries over eight centuries \u2014 \u201cfrom medieval currency debasements to today\u2019s subprime catastrophe.\u201d Clinton spokesman Angel Urena specifically directed us to figure 14.8, which, Urena said, shows \u201cthe average duration in years of Great Depression crises is shown to be at least 10 years.\u201d\n\nUrena is right about the average, but not \u201cevery single country\u201d took \u201cat least 10 years,\u201d as Clinton claimed. It took Japan four years, Italy six years, and Germany seven years to recover from the Great Depression, as measured by \u201cthe number of years for output per capita to return to its pre-crisis level\u201d in 1929, according to Reinhart and Rogoff. Plus, that particular data set is only for the Great Depression \u2014 not from 400 years ago.\n\nSeparately, Reinhart and Rogoff authored a 2014 paper in American Economic Review\u2018s Papers & Proceedings on recoveries from 100 economic crises from 1857 to 2013, again measured by how long it took countries to return to pre-crisis levels of real per capita gross domestic product. \u201cOn average it takes about eight years to reach the pre-crisis level of income; the median is about 6.5 years,\u201d Reinhart and Rogoff wrote. In the current crisis, in fact, the U.S. was one of only two countries to beat the average.\n\n\u201cFive to six years after the onset of the current crisis only Germany and the United States (out of 12 systemic crisis cases) have reached their 2007\u20132008 peaks in per capita income,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAs for the former president\u2019s 400-year time frame, Urena cited \u201cManias, Panics, and Crashes,\u201d which is a history of financial crises dating to the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1618. Urena did not refer us to any specific data or passages in the book to support Clinton\u2019s claim that \u201cevery single country\u201d has taken at least 10 years to recover. We were only told that it supports the former president\u2019s claim that there are \u201cgood records for 400 years.\u201d That may be, but the fifth and most recent edition of that book, which was coauthored by Charles P. Kindleberger and Robert Z. Aliber in 2005, said making past comparisons is difficult, because the \u201cdata collection is more comprehensive\u201d in recent decades. The book also says the \u201cperiod of financial distress may last weeks, months, even years, or it may be concentrated into a few days.\u201d\n\nWhat the former president has done is mix and match economic studies and data to create a talking point about 400 years of financial history that is not supported by the evidence.\n\nBill Clinton also made the point that renewable energy can help create new jobs in a coal state like Kentucky. Hillary Clinton has made the same point, although she has been criticized for the way she said it.\n\nAt a CNN town hall meeting in March, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right?\u201d She since has apologized for saying \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners\u201d out of business, explaining \u201cwhat I said was totally out of context from what I meant.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Bill Clinton used Texas as an example of how fossil-fuel states can create renewable energy jobs. \u201cThere are three states in America that get over a third of their electricity from wind,\u201d he said at the 15:31-minute mark. \u201cOne of them is Texas \u2014 the oil and natural gas leader of America.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. Only one state \u2014 Iowa \u2014 gets about a third of its electricity from wind. The top three states are: Iowa (31.3 percent), South Dakota (25.5 percent), and Kansas (23.9 percent), according the American Wind Energy Association.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Texas ranks No. 1 in wind energy capacity, but only about 10 percent of its electricity came from wind in 2015, the American Wind Energy Association says. That 10 percent figure is unchanged from 2014, according to the Energy Information Administration. Wind energy capacity is the maximum amount of electricity that could potentially be produced under certain conditions, not the amount actually produced, as the EIA explains.\n\nWhat was Clinton talking about?\n\nUrena, the former president\u2019s spokesman, told us \u201cPresident Clinton was referencing specific times during the year, not average power generation from wind for the entire year.\u201d He cited as an example a Scientific American blog item about \u201cone windy day in December\u201d when a sustained \u201cburst of wind propelled Texas to surpass its all-time record for wind energy production, with wind providing 45 percent of the state\u2019s total electricity needs \u2014 or 13.9 gigawatts of electric power \u2014 at its peak.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not what the former president said. Instead, he left the false impression that Texas gets a third of its electricity from wind.", "lang": "en"}
