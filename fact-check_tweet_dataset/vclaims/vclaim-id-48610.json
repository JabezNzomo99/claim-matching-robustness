But Trump has proposed global health budget cuts, including for programs that aim to prevent or respond to infectious diseases worldwide.\n\nThese statements were made in press conferences on March 20, 21 and 22.\n\nNews reports suggest China may have known about and concealed emerging information in the weeks after the novel coronavirus was detected. But Trump went too far when he said, \u201cI wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms from the first cases of the virus did not emerge until early December, at the earliest, and China alerted the World Health Organization of mysterious pneumonia cases on Dec. 31. By early January, at the latest, the U.S. government was aware of the virus.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Trump\u2019s right-hand man during the coronavirus crisis, said the president\u2019s statement \u201cdoesn\u2019t comport [with the facts], because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September.\u201d\n\nBut the president has since repeated the claim.\n\nIn a press conference on March 21, Trump was asked when he first learned that the new coronavirus was going to be a problem. Trump said it was right around the time he imposed travel restrictions on China, which were announced on Jan. 31 and went into effect two days later.\n\nTrump, March 21: Well, you know, when I learned, I started doing the closings. So, you know, probably around that time. We didn\u2019t learn much. I think you\u2019re going to ask a little bit about China responsibility. I do think that \u2014 again, I have great respect for China. I like China. I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. I wish they could have told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn\u2019t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could have told us earlier about it because we could have come up with a solution. Tony Fauci and all of the people \u2014 the talent that we have \u2014 would have loved to have had three or four months of additional time, if you knew that this was going to be happening. They didn\u2019t have that time. They read about in the newspapers like everybody else. China was very secretive, okay? Very, very secretive. And that\u2019s unfortunate. \u2026 But I wish they were able to \u2014 I wish they would have told us earlier, Steve, that they were having a problem. Because they were having a big problem and they knew it, and I wish they could have given us an advanced warning. Because we could have done \u2014 we could have had a lot of things \u2014 as an example, some of the things that we\u2019re talking about, where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two- or three-month difference in time, it would have been much better.\n\nIn an interview with Science magazine the following morning, Fauci said he told \u201cthe appropriate people\u201d on the White House staff that Trump\u2019s \u201cthree to four month\u201d timeline was off.\n\nJon Cohen, Science magazine, March 22: What about the travel restrictions? Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2 February, had a big impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China would have told us 3 to 4 months earlier and that they were \u201cvery secretive.\u201d [China did not immediately reveal the discovery of a new coronavirus in late December 2019, but by 10 January, Chinese researchers made the sequence of the virus public.] It just doesn\u2019t comport with facts. Fauci: I know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do? Cohen: Most everyone thinks that you\u2019re doing a remarkable job, but you\u2019re standing there as the representative of truth and facts, but things are being said that aren\u2019t true and aren\u2019t factual. Fauci: The way it happened is that after he made that statement [suggesting China could have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus 3 to 4 months earlier], I told the appropriate people, it doesn\u2019t comport, because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September. The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he\u2019s going to say, they will say, \u2018By the way, Mr. President, be careful about this and don\u2019t say that.\u2019 But I can\u2019t jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let\u2019s try and get it corrected for the next time.\n\nIt didn\u2019t get corrected the next time.\n\nIn a press conference later that day, Trump repeated the claim, saying, \u201cI wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.\u201d\n\nSo when did China know about the virus, and when did the U.S. find out? The answer to both questions is difficult to pinpoint. But let\u2019s start with China.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, symptoms from the first cluster of confirmed cases emerged between Dec. 8 and Jan. 2. A study on the novel coronavirus published in The Lancet reported, \u201cThe symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 31, the Chinese informed the World Health Organization\u2019s China office \u201cof a pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market.\u201d\n\nThe WHO says it then \u201cbegan monitoring the situation and requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the different diagnoses considered.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Washington Post, citing \u201cofficial statements, leaked accounts from Chinese medical professionals, newly released scientific data and interviews with public health officials and infectious disease experts,\u201d documented efforts by the Chinese government to tamp down information about the virus \u201cduring the critical period from mid-December to mid-January.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Post, \u201cMedical professionals who tried to sound an alarm were seized by police. Key state media omitted mention of the outbreak for weeks. \u201d\n\nBy Jan. 11, the Chinese had shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, which could then be used by other countries to develop diagnostic kits. Still, the Washington Post reported, \u201cKey information about who got sick and when was not released publicly until weeks later, scientists and researchers said.\u201d\n\nTrump said he didn\u2019t learn that the virus would be a problem until \u201cprobably around\u201d the time when he imposed travel restrictions on China. Those were announced on Jan. 31. But the government had growing concerns about the virus weeks before that.\n\nIn a press conference on March 20, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. was alerted to the problems in China \u201cby some discussions that Dr. [Robert] Redfield, the director of the CDC, had with Chinese colleagues on January 3rd. It\u2019s since been known that there may have been cases in December, not that we were alerted in December.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, \u201cU.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting.\u201d Those agencies warned that \u201cChinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.\u201d\n\nThe WHO confirmed the first case outside of China on Jan. 13 in Thailand and confirmed three days later that the virus had spread to Japan. At around that time, the WHO warned that there could be a wider outbreak and recommended \u201call countries to continue preparedness activities.\u201d\n\nIn a CNBC interview on Jan. 22, Trump said of the virus, \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, Trump tweeted, \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\u201c\n\nOn Jan. 30, the WHO declared a global public health emergency, and Trump imposed travel restrictions a day later.\n\nBut even into late February, Trump continued to downplay the potential spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u2019ve had very good luck,\u201d Trump said at a White House briefing on Feb. 26. \u201cAnd again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nAsked about his Jan. 24 tweet praising China for its \u201cefforts and transparency,\u201d Trump on March 21 said his comments about China\u2019s efforts were true.\n\n\u201cChina has worked very hard,\u201d Trump said, but he added that \u201cthey weren\u2019t transparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI just wish they could have told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that.\u201d\n\nTrump has a point about Chinese officials not being transparent with information about the new coronavirus. But suggesting China could have alerted the U.S. and the world three or four months earlier does not comport with the timeline of events.\n\nThe first cases were not identified until December. Although it is unclear when exactly China may have pegged the sickness to the novel coronavirus, it was a matter of weeks between when those first cases were discovered and when the world knew about the virus. Those were critical weeks, but they weren\u2019t months.\n\nAt a March 20 press conference at the White House, Trump said, \u201cWe enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers.\u201d But the assistance isn\u2019t available for everyone. The legislation providing the leave excludes larger companies employing nearly half of the nation\u2019s workforce.\n\nUnder a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump on March 18, workers are to receive paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave. But companies with 500 or more employees are not covered. In addition, the labor secretary can exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees and health care providers.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48% of American workers are employed by companies with 500 or more employees.\n\nThe legislation provides workers with two weeks of paid leave if they are sick or quarantined or taking care of sick relatives. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to those taking care of children whose schools are closed or whose child care facilities are unavailable. The bill also provides free coronavirus testing.\n\nMost larger companies offer their employees paid sick leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, but many provide fewer than the 14 days necessary for a coronavirus quarantine. The average number of paid sick days for private companies with 500 workers or more was eight after one year on the job and 10 after 20 years, based on March 2018 data.\n\nThis was not the only time the Trump administration has cited the paid leave without mentioning that many aren\u2019t eligible for it.\n\nFor example, on March 19, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Vice President Mike Pence said, \u201cLast night, as you heard, the president signed the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers, and food assistance for the needy, among a broad range of benefits.\u201d\n\nIn a press briefing on March 22, Trump was asked whether the proposed coronavirus economic stimulus bill would include financial assistance for countries to fight global pandemics. In response, the president said \u201cno,\u201d but noted that \u201cwe give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries\u201d to fight diseases. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said, \u2018No.\u2019 I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t proposed eliminating all funding to combat global diseases, but he has proposed reduced funding. His most recent budget proposal for fiscal year 2021, for instance, includes funding cuts for such programs.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Trump\u2019s most recent budget proposal requests less funding to fight diseases globally than what has been appropriated by Congress in previous years.\n\nFor example, Trump requested $3.76 billion for global HIV/AIDS programs, which is $1.59 billion less than what Congress approved in fiscal 2020 and would be the lowest amount of funding since 2007.\n\nThe president also requested $283.2 million for tuberculosis programs, or $37.6 million less than what Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2020, and $905.2 million for malaria programs, which would be a reduction of $93.9 million from the funding for the current fiscal cycle.\n\nPlus, Trump proposed cutting U.S. funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a publicly and privately funded international organization, by $902 million \u2014 from the $1.56 billion appropriated in FY 2020 to $658 million proposed in the president\u2019s FY 2021 budget.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget would also reduce funding for neglected tropical diseases to $75 million, down more than $27 million from the enacted amount of $102.5 million for 2020. The World Health Organization says NTDs \u201care a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions in 149 countries and affect more than one billion people, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year.\u201d\n\nAnd, KFF says, compared with 2020, Trump\u2019s budget request seeks almost $119 million less in 2021 for \u201cother\u201d services, which \u201cincludes funding for WHO and PAHO [Pan American Health Organization]; global parasitic diseases at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]; the Fogarty International Center at NIH [National Institutes of Health]; as well as the Emergency Reserve Fund, which was created in the FY17 Omnibus bill to respond to contagious infectious disease outbreaks, and would be made available if there is an \u2018emerging health threat that poses severe threats to human health.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, according to KFF\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s request of $557 million for global health security \u2014 which would be an $11 million increase from 2020 \u2014 is the only global health program area that would see an increase under Trump\u2019s desired budget for fiscal 2021. With its global health security initiatives, including its work as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, the U.S. aims to help other countries prepare to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats worldwide.\n\nOverall, though, \u201cThe FY 2021 President\u2019s budget request proposes to reduce global health funding to $7.7 billion, its lowest level since FY 2008,\u201d KFF said. And Trump has consistently sought cuts to the global health budget since he has been in office, KFF has found.\n\nIn addition to programs to fight diseases, the global health category also includes efforts to improve global nutrition and family planning and reproductive health.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained before, a president\u2019s budget request is more a symbolic statement of priorities than anything Congress would enact. A March 2019 Congressional Research Service report details how Congress has repeatedly appropriated more money for certain global health programs than Trump has requested in his budgets.\n\nBut the president\u2019s claim that he doesn\u2019t think he has said \u201cno\u201d to providing funds to other countries to fight diseases ignores his budget proposals.", "lang": "en"}
