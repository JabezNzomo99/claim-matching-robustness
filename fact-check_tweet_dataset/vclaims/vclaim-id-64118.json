Several media organisations covered the inauguration ceremony. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s Office uploaded a video of the event on YouTube where, at 16 seconds, PM Modi can be seen offering flowers on the statue of Gandhi.\n\nFurthermore, the picture viral on social media carries a photo of Spiderman and @libtardu written on the right. It was created as a satirical post by the handle.", "lang": "en"}
