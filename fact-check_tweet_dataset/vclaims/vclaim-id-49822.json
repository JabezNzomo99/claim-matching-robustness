A local social worker from the area, Dilip Mishra, confirmed that the road was in a poor condition in May 2017. He also informed that repair work on the road was completed by July. In June 2017, The Times of India had published a report which carried the same image.\n\nAn image of a road in Bihar filled with potholes was shared with the false claim that this is the current condition in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency in Kerala\u2019s Wayanad.
