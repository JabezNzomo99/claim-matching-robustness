Below is how to claim and get yours credit Instantly as I have just did now https://bit.ly/free---funds Note : You can only claim and get credited once and it's also limited so get your now Instantly, \" reads the message. \n\n The message comes with a link that apparently can be used to 'instantly claim' the promised amount.\n\nGovernment is giving a relief fund of \u20b95,000 as a limited time offer. The message comes with this link: https://bit.ly/free---funds which redirects to this website. Despite visiting the website several times throughout the day the message on the first page did not change. \"Left 1936 FREE Lockdown packages,\" the website displayed. The number remained constant which is questionable.\n\nOn confirming that one is a citizen of India, the website asks, \"How much can sustain you throughout the lockdown?\" On choosing any of the available options (2000, 5000 and 10000) the website asks, \"What will you use your free Rs 5,000 for?\" The options provided for this question are: Food, Internet or Clothing. On choosing any of the three option, one is redirected to a page which asks to share the message with 10 other WhatsApp Group.\n\nNo matter how many times one visits the website, the name of the 'beneficiaries' and timestamp in the comments always reads 'just now' for all and '2 mins ago' for one comment. This remains constant.\n\n\n\nFurther, the number of likes and comments remain constant at '204,208 and '173,330' respectively. The link of the website contains the word 'ramaphosafoundations' Cyril Ramaphosa Foundation is based in South Africa and is headed by the current president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa. Considering the message claims to be a government scheme it does not show any elements of a usual government website. The URL does not have a gov.in or nic.in domain, which all government-run websites always have. According to the norm, all government websites have the designated ministry's title written under the national emblem. The fraud website lacks that. Therefore the website is clearly for the purpose of fooling people into sharing the false message.
