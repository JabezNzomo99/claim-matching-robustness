Eating citrus fruits or peppers may help too but they are not a substitute for a medical vaccine. Of these home-remedies, Dr Ray says, \u201cThese are difficult to prove through scientific methodology and hard rigour, and from the lens of modern medicine are vague claims if not thoroughly researched.\u201d But while it may be difficult, it\u2019s not impossible to prove the claims of herbal or alternative medicine through modern scientific analysis.\n\nThe WHO did content that garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, but \u201cthere is no evidence that it can protect people from the current nCov outbreak.\u201d\n\nAll in all, these claims are just that - claims without proof of effectiveness. And in a time when fears about the novel coronavirus are spreading fast, Dr Ray says that it is important to remember that solid proof is needed before verifying a medical claim. So for now, take the routine precautions and steer clear of unresearched claims and fake news!", "lang": "en"}
