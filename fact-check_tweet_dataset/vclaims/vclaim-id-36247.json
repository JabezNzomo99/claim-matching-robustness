Although Hitler\u2019s work is subject to the vagaries of translation (since Hitler wrote in German), the above passage does appear as worded in Chapter 11 of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in at least one English-language translation:\n\nBy the creation of a press whose content is adapted to the intellectual horizon of the least educated people, the political and trade-union organization finally obtains the agitational institution by which the lowest strata of the nation are made ripe for the most reckless acts. Its function is not to lead people out of the swamp of a base mentality to a higher stage, but to cater to their lowest instincts. Since the masses are as mentally lazy as they are sometimes presumptuous, this is a business as speculative as it is profitable. It is this press, above all, which wages a positively fanatical and slanderous struggle, tearing down everything which can be regarded as a support of national independence, cultural elevation, and the economic independence of the nation. Above all, it hammers away at the characters of all those who will not bow down to the Jewish presumption to dominate, or whose ability and genius in themselves seem a danger to the Jew. For to be hated by the Jew it is not necessary to combat him; no, it suffices if he suspects that someone might even conceive the idea of combating him some time or that on the strength of his superior genius he is an augmenter of the power and greatness of a nationality hostile to the Jew.\n\nOther translations provide slightly different wording, but the gist is the same:\n\nTo what extent the two statements presented above resemble each other is something of a subjective issue, but many critics, such as civil rights lawyer Burt Neuborne, have drawn parallels between Trump\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s attacks on the mainstream press:\n\n[Hitler and Trump] unceasingly attack objective truth. \u201cBoth Trump and Hitler maintained a relentless assault on the very idea of objective truth,\u201d [Neuborne says]. \u201cEach began the assault by seeking to delegitimize the mainstream press. Hitler quickly coined the epithet L\u00fcgenpresse (literally \u2018lying press\u2019) to denigrate the mainstream press. Trump uses a paraphrase of Hitler\u2019s lying press epithet \u2014 \u2018fake news\u2019 \u2014 cribbed, no doubt, from one of Hitler\u2019s speeches. For Trump, the mainstream press is a \u2018lying press\u2019 that publishes \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d Hitler attacked his opponents as spreading false information to undermine his positions, Neuborne says, just as Trump has attacked \u201celites\u201d for disseminating false news \u2026 They relentlessly attack mainstream media. Trump\u2019s assaults on the media echo Hitler\u2019s, Neuborne says, noting that he \u201crepeatedly attacks the \u2018failing New York Times,\u2019 leads crowds in chanting \u2018CNN sucks,\u2019 [and] is personally hostile to most reporters.\u201d He cites the White House\u2019s refusal to fly the flag at half-mast after the murder of five journalists in Annapolis in June 2018, Trump\u2019s efforts to punish CNN by blocking a merger of its corporate parent, and trying to revoke federal Postal Service contracts held by Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
