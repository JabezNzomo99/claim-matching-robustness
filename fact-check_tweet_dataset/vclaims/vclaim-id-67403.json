Chris Christie said was leaving to better support his family. The comptroller's salary was $140,000. Corfield commended the comptroller's accomplishments, adding that the position's salary is a \"comfortable\" one for a family of four in the Garden State.\n\nCorfield then called out Christie -- \"the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, stagnant job growth\" and a low minimum wage \u2013 as pompous, for suggesting that Boxer may have been struggling on such a salary.\n\nFor this fact check, though, we\u2019re looking only at the claims about New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate and job growth.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists unemployment rates for the nation, each state, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico on its website.\n\nWe looked at unemployment rates from November \u2013 the most recent data available \u2013 to see how New Jersey ranked against Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s rate was the highest among that group, at 7.8 percent. Here are the others:\n\nConnecticut, 7.6 percent; Delaware, 6.5 percent; New York, 7.4 percent; and Pennsylvania, 7.3 percent.\n\n The nation\u2019s unemployment rate for November was 7 percent.\n\nSo Corfield is correct that New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate is the highest in the region.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that eight states had unemployment rates higher than New Jersey: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island and Tennessee. Arizona\u2019s rate was the same as New Jersey\u2019s. Also, the states are evenly split between Democratic and Republican leadership.\n\nNow let\u2019s turn to the claim about \"stagnant\" job growth. Here, Corfield is off base.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate barely moved downward for the first half of Christie\u2019s first term in office, but experts have told us that the governor doesn\u2019t bare all the blame. The after-effects of the recession had a lot to do with it, too.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Christie took office in January 2010.\n\n\n\n Although New Jersey\u2019s job growth hasn\u2019t been a race to the top of the economic growth heap, the state has gained new private-sector jobs, particularly in the past year, putting it \"in the middle of the pack\" among other states in terms of job growth, Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca told us in November.\n\nSeneca\u2019s analysis found that the state gained 60,300 private-sector jobs from August 2012 to August 2013. In addition, New Jersey\u2019s job growth rate of 1.8 percent for that time period exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had job growth rates of 0.9 percent, Seneca said.\n\nSeneca told us that much of the state\u2019s job growth during the period he analyzed was in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Seneca and the BLS have told us it\u2019s best to measure year-over-year job data that has been seasonally adjusted in order to get the most accurate picture of job growth within a 12-month span.\n\n Using that methodology, New Jersey has increased its number of private-sector jobs by 130,700 from November 2012 to November 2013.\n\nThere have been some job losses in recent months, but on the whole, the state is gaining private-sector jobs.\n\nCorfield said she used the same BLS data as us to determine New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate, and looked at an analysis on www.governing.com that showed the Garden State excels in giving tax incentives but lags in job growth. She also pointed us to a Wall Street Journal article that address New Jersey\u2019s slow job growth.\n\n Further, Corfield said that while she was out campaigning for an Assembly seat, she spoke with many unhappy and unemployed constituents who \"are having a tough time finding a job.\"\n\nCorfield claimed in a recent column that Christie is \"the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, (and) stagnant job growth.\"\n\nShe\u2019s right that the unemployment rate is the highest in this region, but wrong on whether New Jersey\u2019s job growth has been sluggish.\n\nBLS data shows clearly that while the Garden State\u2019s unemployment rate is the highest among its neighboring states, it\u2019s not the worst in the country. And it\u2019s also clear from BLS data that private-sector jobs are growing in New Jersey.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
