The claim is false; the video has been doctored from 2018 footage of Yudhoyono supporting a candidate in a provincial election.\n\nThe video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here where it has been viewed more than 380,000 times and shared nearly 12,000 times since it was posted February 20, 2019.\n\n\u201cReady to vote for number one,\u201d the caption of the post says.\n\nWidodo is ballot number 1 in Indonesia\u2019s April elections. His challenger Prabowo Subianto is ballot number 2.\n\nThe announcement by Indonesia\u2019s General Elections Commission (KPU) on the ballot numbers for the upcoming polls can be seen here on its official website.\n\nYudhoyono, who is popularly known as SBY, allegedly makes a statement of support for Widodo from 0:06 of the video.\n\nAt 0:08, he is seen raising his right index finger as he says \u201cI fully support the candidate pair number one\u201d.\n\nRaising one finger is widely seen as a gesture of support for Widodo. Here is a report by local news site Detik.com on people declaring their support for the incumbent president by posing with a one-finger salute.\n\nWith Yudhoyono\u2019s voice continuing as the audio track, the video then cuts to footage showing Widodo.\n\nFirst, Widodo is seen greeting people and then he is shown walking with his vice-presidential running mate Ma\u2019ruf Amin, a senior Muslim cleric.\n\nYudhoyono\u2019s full speech in the video translates in English to: \u201cI fully support the candidate pair number one, because this is the best pair and the most capable in leading for the next five years. I\u2019m happy with the pair\u2019s commitments to lead fairly. Having heard that the pair had received some negative treatment, I want to tell you to remain strong. God will surely protect the pair and the people will defend it.\u201d\n\nThe video\u2019s final segment displays a poster with the faces of Widodo, Amin and Yudhoyono; the logo of Democratic Party, which Yudhoyono leads and text that translates as \u201csupports number one.\u201d\n\nUsing digital verification tool InVid, AFP found that the footage in the video had been doctored.\n\nThe original footage can be seen in this June 24, 2018 Facebook post by the Democratic Party showing Yudhoyono endorsing a ticket in a local gubernatorial poll in North Sumatra province.\n\nThe original video's translated caption says: \u201cThe North Sumatra gubernatorial election to be held on June 27, 2018: Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) calls on the people to vote for the candidate number 1 in the race, Edy Rahmayadi-Musa Rajekshah (Eramas).\u201d\n\nEramas is a portmanteau of the two then-candidates' names.\n\nIn the video, Yudhoyono says: \u201cI fully support the candidate pair number one, the Eramas, because this is the best pair and the most capable in leading and developing North Sumatra for the next five years.\u201d\n\nIn the misleading video, the phrases \u201cthe Eramas\u201d and \u201cdeveloping North Sumatra\u201d have been edited out from Yudhoyono's speech.\n\nUsing reverse image searches, AFP traced the other footage of Widodo used in the misleading video back to media reports on a Muslim prayer held at Indonesia\u2019s state palace.\n\nAt 0:17 in the misleading footage, Widodo is seen walking alongside his running mate Amin, followed by some men in white.\n\nThe scene is similar to this Kompas TV, this Detik.com and this Global TV report on the prayer session, which took place in August 2018.\n\nBelow is a comparison of screenshots from the misleading footage and the media reports on the prayer session:\n\nIn both the misleading footage and the media reports on the prayer meeting, the same key features can be seen -- Widodo wearing a white shirt, black jacket and hat, and Amin wearing all white, including a white scarf draped across his shoulders, and a black belt around his waist. Men in black and white hats can be seen behind them, along with black curtains hanging at the side of the frames.\n\nYudhoyono -- who led Indonesia from 2004 to 2014 -- is actually a high-profile supporter of Widodo challenger Subianto and his Democratic Party is part of a political coalition endorsing the presidential hopeful's candidacy. Here is a report by The Jakarta Post on the political partnership.", "lang": "en"}
