While Sosa said his official cause of death is still pending, his wife told the New York Post that preliminary results show he died of \u201cseptic shock\u201d \u2014 which occurs when sepsis leads to dangerously low blood pressure. Sepsis, caused by the body\u2019s response to an infection, can be life-threatening if left unchecked. But an \u201calternative news\u201d story posted Nov. 27 on a website called Collective Evolution exploits Peralta\u2019s death, and his advocacy, by suggesting his death resulted from the flu vaccine. The author includes an important caveat: \u201c[T]here is no way for me to know for sure whether the flu shot was the cause of, or was a contributing factor in Jose Peralta\u2019s death.\u201d But the article makes misleading and speculative statements that all but draw an unsupported connection between Peralta\u2019s flu shot and his death. \u201cAfter Getting Flu Shot, New York State Senator Gets Sick For Two Weeks, Then Dies,\u201d the headline reads. The story goes on to cite a Nov. 22 New York Times article that quotes Sosa as saying Peralta had resisted going to a doctor despite not feeling well, but eventually went for an exam. \u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get him to talk about not feeling well,\u201d Sosa told the Times. \u201cHe just thought he was having symptoms related to getting the flu shot.\u201d But Sosa told us those remarks were not intended to convey any connection between the flu shot and Peralta\u2019s death. He called such an assertion \u201cscientific nonsense.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that some who get the flu shot may experience a low-grade fever, headaches and muscle aches. It notes that the \u201cmost common side effects from the influenza shot are soreness, redness, and tenderness or swelling where the shot was given. \u201c Sosa said that, by the time Peralta consulted a doctor at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst, he had other symptoms not expected from the flu shot \u2014 such as difficulty breathing. He was scheduled for an early December follow-up exam. \u201cI do not for a moment believe his death was caused by the flu shot,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cThe senator would be disappointed to find that conspiracy theorists are using his death to forward their agenda by misrepresenting the facts.\u201d Judith O\u2019Donnell, an epidemiologist and section chief of the infectious diseases division at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, said she had never heard of someone getting sepsis from the vaccine. \u201cI would say it\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. Sepsis could be triggered a number of ways. O\u2019Donnell said it could result from, say, bacterial pneumonia, or a urinary tract infection that spreads into the bloodstream. \u201cSeptic shock is caused by an overwhelming bacterial infection that generally starts somewhere, but the bacteria gets into the bloodstream,\u201d she said, leading to a chain of \u201cinflammatory events\u201d that could lead to organ failure. \u201cIf not treated, or treated too late, it can even lead to death.\u201d The alt-news story \u2014 which is laced with opinion \u2014 criticizes the media for ignoring \u201ca possible connection between vaccines and human illness, disease and death. \u2026 Especially in this case, as septic shock has been previously linked to the flu.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not the flu vaccine that has been linked to sepsis \u2014 it\u2019s the flu itself. \u201cA certain subsection of patients can develop sepsis\u201d from influenza, O\u2019Donnell said \u2014 typically if they are already at risk, such as elderly or very young people, or pregnant women, and have compromised immune systems. The dubious article concludes with the false claim that \u201cthe historical rise in the promotion and usage of vaccines correlates to the rise of disease and death from illnesses like the flu,\u201d which \u201cshould be enough for us to write off taking vaccines altogether.\u201d A 2017 CDC study \u2014 reviewing nearly 5,000 hospitalized flu patients from the 2013-2014 season \u2014 found that those who received the vaccine were between 52 and 79 percent less likely to die than those who had not received the vaccine. \u201cIn other words, an unvaccinated hospitalized flu patient was 2 to 5 times more likely to die than someone who had been vaccinated,\u201d the CDC said in a press release.\n\nLikewise, an article presented by the World Health Organization, citing a number of studies, says vaccines are \u201camong the most efficient tools for promoting individual and public health.\u201d Experts have long tried to squash the misconception that the flu shot can lead to the flu. \u201cI wish there was some way we could really put that myth to bed,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. The University of California Berkeley School of Public Health notes: \u201cInjectable vaccines can\u2019t cause the flu because they\u2019re made either with a version of the virus that has been inactivated, or \u2018killed,\u2019 or with only components of the virus.\u201d Those components \u201ctrigger your immune system to make antibodies,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, which help safeguard patients from getting the flu \u2014 or from getting seriously ill if they do. Health officials have urged patients to get vaccinated, in part to stave off complications from the flu that could be fatal (including sepsis). The CDC recommends that \u201ceveryone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season.\u201d Update, Jan. 15, 2019: Peralta had acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), according to autopsy results provided to the family, Sosa told FactCheck.org. Sosa said Peralta\u2019s wife and family were unaware that the late state senator had cancer; he had received a physical in June and \u201cnothing alarming came up.\u201d Those with cancer can be at higher risk of developing an infection and, therefore, sepsis, according to the CDC. Update, Jan. 17, 2019: The New York City Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told us that it determined that Peralta died from \u201ccomplications of acute promyelocytic leukemia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
