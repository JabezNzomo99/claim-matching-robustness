The Russia 1 segment was titled \u201c\u2018Puppet Master\u2019 and \u2018Agent\u2019 \u2014 How to Understand Lavrov\u2019s Meeting with Trump.\u201d As Davis explained in the Daily Beast story:\n\nOur attempts to reach Davis before publication were unsuccessful, however we independently confirmed her translation with Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles who focuses on Russia. Treisman said that the title of the segment on Russian television did indeed translate to \u201cpuppet master\u201d and \u201cagent,\u201d though he noted that the terms were in quotation marks, which suggests possible irony.\n\nDavis reported that Russian media were \u201cgloating\u201d over an image, tweeted by Trump, of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov standing behind the president seated in the Oval Office in a meeting granted to the Russian envoy. Davis noted that meeting occurred even as \u201cUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is still waiting for that critical White House meeting with the American president: the famous \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for Zelensky announcing an investigation that would smear Democratic challenger Joe Biden. As yet, Zelensky hasn\u2019t done that, and as yet, no meeting has been set.\u201d\n\nDavis further reported that \u201c[Russian] President Vladimir Putin\u2019s propaganda brigades enjoy watching the heightened divisions in the United States, and how it hurts relations between the U.S. and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe TV segment aired amid impeachment proceedings against Trump, who is accused of attempting to extort Zelensky by withholding crucial military aid while Ukraine is at war with Russia, in exchange for Zelensky producing damaging information on Biden, Trump\u2019s potential electoral rival. Zelensky has also been requesting a meeting with Trump at the White House to, as the Washington Post reports, \u201csolidify his position as Ukraine\u2019s new leader and demonstrate the United States\u2019 ongoing support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
