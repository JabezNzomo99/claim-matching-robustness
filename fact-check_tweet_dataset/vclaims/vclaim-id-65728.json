Let\u2019s check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Jawaharlal Nehru said that he was an Englishman by education, an Internationalist by views, a Muslim by culture, and a Hindu only by accident of birth. Fact: The statement was not made by Nehru. N. B. Khare, a Hindu Mahasabha leader, first made these comments claiming that Nehru made these comments in his autobiography. But no such statement was found in Nehru\u2019s autobiography. The \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 has also issued a correction that they have wrongly attributed the quote to Nehru. They also mentioned that it was an allegation made by Khare. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords, it was found that Gaurav Pandhi, a Congress leader, had tweeted regarding the same photo of the \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 newspaper on 24 November 2018. In his tweet, he asked the \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 to issue an apology for wrongly attributing the quote to Nehru. On 25 November 2018, he tweeted the photos of a \u2018Correction\u2019 published by \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 with respect to the quote. In the correction, \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 mentioned \u2013 \u2018The quote was erroneously attributed to Jawaharlal Nehru on the \u2018360\u2019 page published on Nov 19. It was an allegation made by Hindu Mahasabha leader N.B. Khare in 1959. We deeply regret the error\u2019\n\nFACTLY has found that these words first made their appearance in an article titled \u2013 \u2018The Angry Aristocrat\u2019 (which is a part of a compilation called \u2013 \u2018A Study of Nehru\u2019), written by a Hindu Mahasabha leader N. B. Khare in 1959. In the article, he claimed that Nehru made these comments explaining himself in his autobiography. But, when searched for the quote and other relevant keywords in \u2018An Autobiography\u2019 by Nehru, nothing relevant to the mentioned quote was found. So, there is no evidence to show that it is Nehru\u2019s quote.\n\nAlso, Shashi Tharoor, a Congress leader, in his book \u2018Nehru: The Invention of India\u2019, mentioned the quote and said that the false allegations were made by N. B. Khare on Nehru to insult him, but in fact, it was a tribute.\n\nTo sum it up, the quote (\u2018I am Englishman by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu merely by accident of birth\u2019), which is being falsely attributed to Nehru, is actually an allegation made by N. B. Khare on Nehru in his article \u2018The Angry Aristocrat\u2019 in 1959.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
