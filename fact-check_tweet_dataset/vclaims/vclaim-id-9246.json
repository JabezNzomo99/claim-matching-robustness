That investigation, led by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, detailed damning accusations of systemic, state-sponsored doping in Russia\n\nRussia is indeed among the top contributors of funds to WADA, which receives half of its financing from governments of the world and half from the Olympic Movement. It was among the top six government contributors to WADA in 2016, paying $772,326 into the Montreal-based organization\u2019s $26-million budget \u2013 the same amount as Germany and the U.K. Moscow contributed similar amounts to WADA in previous years as well. The United States, Japan, and Canada are the largest contributors, with payments in 2016 of $2.05 million, $1.5 million, and $1.03 million, respectively. The required contributions by governments are determined differently in the five Olympic regions.\n\nThe blanket ban (with one exemption) on Russia\u2019s track-and-field athletes from competing in Rio and tightened anti-doping requirements for its athletes in other disciplines have stirred outrage among Russian officials and fans, who say clean athletes are being punished for the misdeeds of a few bad actors.\n\nMutko was quoted by as saying on August 18 that he sees \u201cno point\u201d in continuing to make payments to WADA unless the organization reverses its November 2015 decision to declare the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) noncompliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. In his interview with Life.ru, Fetisov appeared to criticize Mutko, saying he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat this minister has stirred up\u2026. Confrontation in this situation will lead us down the wrong path.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
