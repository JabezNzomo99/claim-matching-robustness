Some have left their phone numbers and messages, \u2018help please\u2019 and \u2018share\u2019.\n\nThe ad was published by \u2018Sifunisana Imisebenzi\u2019, a Facebook page with more than 24,000 likes which regularly posts about job vacancies.\n\nHowever, the advert is fake. A spokeswoman for KFC in South Africa, Taki Simeli, said it was nothing to do with the brand.\n\n\u201cKFC can confirm that this is not an authentic KFC poster. Job seekers are advised to follow the correct and legitimate recruitment process at KFC,\u201d she told AFP via email.\n\nA similar post published on the same Facebook page, \u2018Sifunisana Imisebenzi\u2019 on November 7, 2019 claims Coca-Cola is \u2018looking for Students and Unemployed people for December jobs\u2019.\n\nAgain, hundreds of people have commented on the post with the name of their province in order to receive an application form.\n\nA keyword search on Facebook reveals that the advert has also been shared here on the \u2018SA Job Seekers\u2019 page, which has more than 90,000 likes.\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola told AFP via email that the advert was fake.\n\n\u201cThis is not our advert,\u201d said Motshidisi Mokwena, Head of Reputation and Regulatory Affairs for Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa.\n\nThe links featured on the fake ads bring Facebook users to pages here and here on a site called newtechideas.online. According to domain verification tool WhoIs, the website\u2019s IP address is in Mumbai, India.\n\nYou can find details of opportunities to work at KFC and Coca-Cola in South Africa on their websites.\n\nAFP has previously debunked fake job ads including a Facebook post claiming the Kenyan government was heading a huge recruitment campaign and that Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, was recruiting thousands of people to work at an oil refinery in Nigeria.", "lang": "en"}
