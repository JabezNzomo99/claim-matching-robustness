We found that the story offers no evidence to tie the former Haitian official, Klaus Eberwein, to criticisms of the Clinton Foundation and largely repeats information from a fake news story last year.\n\nIn July, the Miami Herald reported that Eberwein, a former Haitian government official, was found dead in a South Florida motel room. Eberwein, who had worked as an Uber driver in South Florida, had fallen on hard times.\n\nEberwein served as director general of the government\u2019s economic development agency, Fonds d\u2019assistance \u00e9conomique et social (FAES), from May 2012 until February 2015 when he was replaced. The Herald reported that Eberwein had faced allegations of fraud and corruption on how FAES administered funds.\n\nEberwein shot himself in the head the day he was supposed to appear before the Haitian Senate\u2019s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds, the money Haiti receives from Venezuela\u2019s discounted oil program.\n\nThe Herald story made no mention of the Clinton Foundation or the Clintons. But a couple of days later, YourNewsWire, a website that posts fake news, made a series of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements tying Eberwein to criticism of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nYour News Wire wrote that Eberwein was \"widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.\"\n\n\"The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,\" YourNewsWire quoted Eberwein as saying at a Clinton Foundation protest.\n\nBut the website offered no evidence that Eberwein planned to testify against the Clinton Foundation or made any such statements.\n\nUS Political News used many portions of the YourNewsWire article and then added some additional information, including a clip of actual statements by another former Haitian official about the Clintons.\n\nUS Political News included a video of the former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, at a 2016 Donald Trump campaign event in Little Haiti in South Florida. Sansaricq criticized the record of the Clintons in Haiti.\n\nThe Clintons have a long and complicated history with Haiti, but there is no evidence that Eberwein was \"getting ready to ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption.\" He was getting ready to testify about something unrelated: money Haiti received from a Venezuela oil program.\n\nFinally, the timeline of the fake story makes no sense: Eberwein committed suicide in July 2017 while the January 2018 headline says he was getting ready to testify \"next week.\"\n\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
