The Trump administration has said a man accused of a terrorist attack in New York in October 2017 came to the United States through the diversity visa lottery program. (Here\u2019s more information about that U.S. program.)\n\nBitcoingrower.life muddles its own information by referencing both the United States and Canada in its post.\n\nThe post about a Canadian diversity immigration visa lottery is bogus.
