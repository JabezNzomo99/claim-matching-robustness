At least that\u2019s how it appeared.\n\nPhotographs and videos of a \u201ctown crier\u201d announcing the birth of a new prince were shared by outlets such as Metro, the Associated Press and Sky News. CBS News even published the birth announcer\u2019s photograph and identified him as the \u201cofficial\u201d town crier:\n\nCBS made a similar statement during their morning broadcast, when anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell dubbed the crier\u2019s announcement the \u201cofficial proclamation\u201d:\n\nCBS News deleted its \u201cofficial royal baby proclamation\u201d tweet but you can\u2019t delete live TV pic.twitter.com/hYwwOXu4x8 How about that for a birth announcement. That\u2019s the way they do it there. That\u2019s what you call the official proclamation outside St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, the birth of Prince William and Duchess Kate\u2019s new baby born earlier this morning. It is a boy weighing in at 8 pounds 7 ounces.\n\nThe problem is that the man in question is not Buckingham Palace\u2019s official town crier, nor was he asked to make any sort of proclamation regarding the latest addition to the royal family.\n\nThe man featured in these photographs is Tony Appleton, an octogenarian and self-proclaimed \u201croyalist crier,\u201d who has taken it upon himself to announce, as loudly as he can, important news about the royal family. Although Prince William and Kate Middleton have never asked him to do so, Appleton has been making such announcements since 2013, when he showed up uninvited to announce the arrival of Prince George, as noted in contemporaneous news accounts: \u201cAppleton, who is 81, has shown up uninvited to every major royal announcement since 2013, when he declaimed the news of Prince George\u2019s birth from the steps of the Lindo wing at St Mary\u2019s hospital, London. That earned him appearances on front pages across the globe, not to mention US news networks such as ABC, Fox and CNN.\u201d\n\nAppleton has served as town crier for the nearby city of Romford, but he does not represent the royal family. Appleton admitted as much in 2013, when news outlets were similarly confused by his presence:\n\nAppleton is in fact a crier, but in Romford, a commuter town just east of London, and in Bury St. Edmunds, a market town in southeastern England \u2014 not Buckingham Palace. In interview, he said Wednesday that he simply showed up in costume after getting a tipoff from a British journalist that the Duchess of Cambridge, better known as Prince William\u2019s wife Kate, had given birth. \u201cI\u2019m a royalist. I love the royal family,\u201d he said by telephone from Romford, but he acknowledged he had no official royal role. \u201cI came unannounced.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop him from playing a bizarre cameo role on leading U.S. newscasts in the media frenzy surrounding the baby\u2019s birth, nor did it prevent confused American journalists from identifying him as a bona fide mouthpiece for Buckingham Palace. \u201cThe royal crier delivering the royal news,\u201d was how CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper described the scene. On Fox News, Stuart Varney told viewers that Appleton was \u201cthe town crier making the official announcement in a very loud voice, all in his full regalia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
