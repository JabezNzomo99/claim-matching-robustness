It actually shows Biden shopping in November 2012 for children\u2019s books for a reading program started by his wife.\n\nA Facebook user posted a video on March 13 allegedly showing Biden looking at books in the \u201cBrain Exercises for Dementia\u201d section. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Say \u2018People Who Have Never Died Before Are Now Dying From Corona Virus\u2019?)\n\nSimilar videos have been circulating on other social media platforms: @conservativehypehouse, who posted it on TikTok, said \u201cYes, this is Joe Biden looking at books about dimentia (sic),\u201d while YouTube user Mavakaga noted he\u2019d been \u201ccaught\u201d doing so.\n\nBut the claim in all of these posts doesn\u2019t hold up. The sign with the words \u201cBrain Exercises for Dementia\u201d had been superimposed into a video of Biden doing holiday shopped at a Costco in November 2012. The original video, which comes from CBS News, has no sign of any kind in the segment where Biden is perusing through children\u2019s books.\n\nC-SPAN also covered Biden\u2019s appearance at the grand opening of that Costco. In that video, Biden tells someone who is off-screen that he is \u201cbuying a bunch of books for the Book Buddies back in Delaware.\u201d Book Buddies, a program that provides books to low-income children, was started by his wife Jill, according to the Los Angeles Times.", "lang": "en"}
