It was from a parody account.\n\nThe Twitter handle of the parody account is @x_xinhua, but the verified account goes around with the handle @XHNews.\n\nThe verified account has over 12 million followers while the parody account, however, has only around 4,500 followers.\n\n\n\nThe official account is followed by several other blue-ticked accounts such as, the Spokesperson's Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (@MFA_China) and the Mission of China (@ChinaEUMission) which is the mission of the People's Republic of China to the European Union.\n\nIt is evident, then, the tweet that sparked the sentiments of Indians was a mere prank from a fake account.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Video Of Gargoyle Attacking Italian Church Is Fake", "lang": "en"}
