Curiel, who is presiding over two of three lawsuits against Trump and Trump University, was born in Indiana to parents who emigrated from Mexico. But the presumptive Republican presidential nominee continues to rail against the judge for biased, negative and unfair rulings.\n\nWhether Curiel is biased is a matter of opinion, not one we can fact-check. But we took a look at what exactly a summary judgment is, and whether the judge\u2019s decision was anything out of the ordinary, as Trump suggests. As usual, Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nBoth cases before Curiel are class-action lawsuits from former students, claiming fraud and demanding their money back. One lawsuit was filed in 2010 by students in California, Florida and New York, and the other in 2013 by a plaintiff who alleged he was misled and upsold to pay for a $35,000 upgrade.\n\nTrump is named as a defendant in both lawsuits and has filed for a motion for summary judgment in both. Last year, Curiel ruled on the motion in the 2010 lawsuit. The motion in the 2013 lawsuit is pending a court hearing next month, as noted in this explainer by the Popehat blog.\n\nFor example, a judge may grant it if someone is suing a defendant who has immunity from that specific lawsuit. Or a judge may grant it if someone was bringing an asbestos lawsuit against a manufacturer \u2014 but the manufacturer wasn\u2019t making any products during the time that person claims they were injured.\n\n\u201cIn any kind of complex factual case, it\u2019s very hard to get summary judgment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe [Supreme] Court has made it clear that only in certain, limited cases will summary judgment be granted.\u2026 We have a Constitution that requires civil cases to be submitted to a jury if there\u2019s enough fact and dispute \u2014 and that\u2019s a pretty important right to most people.\u201d\n\nFurther, out of the total number of federal cases during that time, summary judgments were granted in part or in full for less than 15 percent of all cases. In cases where there was such a motion, summary judgments were fully granted less than 40 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cThese findings offer solid evidence that summary judgment is a weak filter designed to resolve only the most lopsided of cases where no reasonable jury could find for the other side,\u201d said David Freeman Engstrom, Stanford University law professor and expert in civil procedure. \u201cUnless the case is a slam dunk for one side or the other, summary judgment is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s own defense team said that Curiel \u201cis doing his job\u201d and that it had no plans to file a motion for the judge to be recused. Lead defense attorney Daniel Petrocelli told reporters after a May 6 pre-trial hearing in San Diego that Curiel was doing a \u201cgood job of trying to balance out competing interests\u201d by pushing the trial date to the end of November so that the case does not interfere with Trump\u2019s campaign, Yahoo News reported. (Side note: We debunked Trump supporters\u2019 false, repeated claim that Curiel is affiliated with a pro-immigrant group.)\n\nFor other claims, Curiel dismissed Trump\u2019s request for a summary judgment because he found a genuine factual dispute. For example, the former students claimed that Trump and Trump University used deceptive practices and misrepresentation in advertisements, thereby violating consumer protection and business laws in California, Florida and New York. One of the \u201ccore\u201d misrepresentations Trump made, they claimed, was that they would be taught by real estate experts who were \u201chand-selected\u201d by Trump.\n\nOnce again, Trump greatly stretches the facts to the point of Four-Pinocchio inaccuracy. We can\u2019t fact-check whether Curiel has a bias against Trump; that\u2019s Trump\u2019s opinion. But what is clear is that Curiel made a straightforward legal judgment as to whether two sides agreed or disagreed on facts, and whether those should be presented to a jury.\n\nFurther, Trump says the case should have been ended with a summary judgment, but fewer than 10 percent of federal court cases in key districts between 1975 and 2000 were resolved that way. Judges make this decision for narrow circumstances, to filter out cases that should not be taken to a jury. Trump also overlooks that Curiel, in his November 2015 ruling, did grant him partial summary judgment.", "lang": "en"}
