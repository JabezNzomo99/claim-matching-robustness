One involves education funds and the other involves housing funds.\n\nThe YourNewsWire story eventually explains that the officials being charged aren\u2019t in San Juan and that the alleged malfeasance predates the hurricane. It tries to tie Cruz to the indictments by saying these officials were members of \u201cher own party.\u201d\n\nEven though the headline distorts the facts, the story has been shared on social media pages with a combined following of more than 2 million users and has been copied by at least two other dubious websites.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nGillibrand, Kirsten.
