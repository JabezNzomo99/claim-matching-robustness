The story was flagged by Facebook users as potentially false. It is.\n\nJefferson County, which includes the city of Birmingham, voted overwhelmingly in favor of Democrat Doug Jones. Of the 219,541 people who voted in the county, 68 percent voted for Jones and 30 percent voted for Republican Roy Moore, according to the unofficial numbers from the secretary of state.\n\nThe made-up story ran under a headline that said, \u201cBREAKING: Black People In Birmingham Caught Voting Multiple Times With Fake IDs,\u201d and suggested that the outcome of the election was in question. It\u2019s not.\n\nThe Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s office hasn\u2019t received reports of voter fraud of any significant scale, said Communications Director John Bennett, and it has heard of nothing that would sway the outcome of the election.\n\nThe false story began by claiming: \u201cThe FEC has announced that it may have to recommend invalidating more than 60K votes from the Birmingham area to the Alabama Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nBut the Federal Election Commission enforces federal campaign finance law; it does not have jurisdiction over voting irregularities in statewide elections. The Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s office does oversee elections in Alabama, but it has received no reports of widespread voter fraud in Birmingham, Bennett told us.\n\nThe made-up story later uses a quote it claims was posted on the conservative news site Breitbart, but the quote didn\u2019t actually appear on that site. And the link provided goes to a picture of donkey poop.\n\nThe story originated on a website called Reagan Was Right, which describes itself as satirical and includes a disclaimer that says: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nBut the story was picked up and posted by several other sites that have no such disclaimer.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 28: Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill reiterated in a Dec. 28 interview that there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the election results. He told CNN that his office has received \u201cwell more than 100\u201d reports of voter fraud and has \u201cadjudicated more than 60 of those.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cDoug Jones elected Alabama Senator; Roy Moore won\u2019t concede: What we know today.\u201d AL.com. 13 Dec 2017.\n\nMcCrummen, Stephanie and Reinhard, Beth. \u201cWoman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32.\u201d Washington Post. 9 Nov 2017.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Black People In Birmingham Caught Voting Multiple Times With Fake IDs.\u201d Reagan Was Right. 13 Dec 2017.", "lang": "en"}
