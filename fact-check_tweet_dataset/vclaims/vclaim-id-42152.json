No, that's not true: Law enforcement and school officials said there is no indcation the fight was related to politics. Although the child's mother claimed in social media posts that her son was beaten by several Black students because he wore a red Trump \"Make America Great Again\" hat, investigators called that \"misinformation.\" Five juveniles have been charged with first-degree battery misdemeanor charges. One social media poster declared it was part of a civil war in the United States and called for White parents to resist.\n\nThe claim originated with a November 21, 2019 tweet from the boy's mother, but it became a viral story when she shared a video clip of the attack that had been recorded by another student. A video (archived here) posted on December 13, 2019. claimed the attack signaled a civil war in America. Posted with the title \"WHITE KID VIOLENTLY ATTACKED ON SCHOOL BUS FOR SUPPORTING TRUMP! | HOSPITALIZED | CIVIL WAR!\" It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe \"Silent Weapons\" YouTube account, which posted the civil war claim describes itself this way:\n\nThe video's narrator exhorts viewers to \"wake up\" and believe the country is in a civil war with Trump supporters and opponents facing off:\n\nThe prosecutors in the deep state are not going to protect your children. It's just a fact. We are in the civil war, people. I need you to wake up. I need you to take the blinders off and understand that the war is here. I need you to do that. Because in your mind, you're thinking that this is like Hollywood where there's a whole side fighting off and facing off against another side. The civil war, the way it works in 2020 is that there are going to be different pockets that are going to erupt and explode. There are going to be different sections. It won't be like you see in the movies, guys. You've got to wake up to see this for what it is. White kids who support President Trump are being victimized an attacked simply because of their race. If Black kids across the country were attacked like this, there would be an uproar from the media.\n\nTrump supporters who do not rise up in resistance could lose their children, he said.\n\nAlthough the narrator does at one point say he is not suggesting violence, he is claiming that Trump supporters will suffer the same fate as the Jews in Germany under Hitler:\n\nThere is no question that the 14-year-old boy was beaten by several students on the Hamilton County, Florida, school bus on November 21, 2019. He is white and the attackers all appeared to be black. The mother posted a tweet that evening making the claim that her son was victimized because he wore a Trump hat to school:\n\nThree weeks later, after the investigation determined it was not a hate crime or politically related, the mother posted a short clip of the attack:\n\nContrary to the mother's claim, Hamilton County School Superintendent Rex L. Mitchell posted on statement on his district's Facebook page denying the attack was politically-motivated. He said school investigators had reviewed the full video from bus security cameras and not just the short video recorded on a student's phone:\n\nThe sheriff also posted a statement to clear up what he said was \"some misinformation\" about the attack:\n\nHamilton County Sheriff's Office would like to make an announcement in response to the video that is being posted of the battery on the school bus:\n\nIt seems that some misinformation has been passed along with the video.\n\nWe at the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office are as disturbed about this video as you are.\n\nAn investigation has been conducted and Hamilton County Sheriff's Office has filed charges on five juveniles for First Degree misdemeanor battery. We discussed charges with the State Attorney's Office and they stated that this incident does not meet criteria for a hate crime.\n\nAny questions should be referred to the State Attorney's Office.\n\nWhile the violence against the teen is shocking, it is sadly something that has been happening for many years -- kids fighting on the school bus. What is different now is there are people who are eager to claim these fights are the equivalent of the Nazi extermination of Jews or the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter.", "lang": "en"}
