Ezekwesili\u2019s claim is therefore correct.\n\nremoves the effect on inflation on the value of an economy\u2019s output.

Crude petroleum and natural gas accounted for nearly all (98%) of this contribution, but are not regulated by the ministry of mines and steel.\n\nin Nigeria told Africa Check that the country\u2019s mining sector essentially referred to the extraction of solid minerals, and didn\u2019t include the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s mining sector is not big because there are no majors [big companies],\u201d he said. \u201cIt is made up mostly of artisanal and small-scale miners, hence its little contribution to GDP.\u201d\n\nThe statistics agency\u2019s data shows solid mineral mining contributed 0.2% to GDP in the three months.\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal budget had topped out at \u201caround $30 billion\u201d.

In 2014, the\n\nof N4.965 trillion was $31.04 billion at the then\n\nof N160 to the dollar.\n\nThe candidate claimed that less than 30% of the federal budget goes to capital expenditure.\n\nBut in the budgets of 2017 and 2018, the allocation to capital expenditure was\n\nOne of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s promises during his campaign for the 2015 elections was to \u201cvigorously pursue the expansion of electricity generation and distribution of up to\n\nin four to eight years\u201d.\n\nIn 2003 then-president Olusegun Obasanjo, during the inaugural speech for his second term, pledged to produce 10,000 MW.
