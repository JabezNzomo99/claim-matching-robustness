This is false; the missile was edited into the original video, and a filter was added to give the illusion of thermal or infrared imaging.\n\n\u201cBeirut was a missile attack, not a accident,\u201d says an August 6, 2020 post by a user who claims to work for the United States military.\n\nVersions of posts showing the video have been shared at least 40,000 times in the United States and more than 20,000 times in Canada. It has been shared on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram and versions have been shared in French and Arabic.\n\nThe video shows large plumes of smoke rising above the port of Beirut and, around six seconds later, appears to show a missile striking the port, leading to a large explosion.\n\nFor many social media users who shared the video, it is clear evidence that the explosion in Beirut on August 4th, which killed at least 160 people and injured thousands, was a result of a missile strike.\n\nSome users correctly describe the video as a \u201cnegative\u201d version, a filter that makes the lightest areas of the video darkest and vice versa, while others wrongly call it \u201cinfrared\u201d or \u201cthermal\u201d imaging.\n\nMichel Aoun, the Lebanese President has said that either \u201cnegligence\u201d or a \u201cmissile or bomb\u201d triggered the explosion of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate -- a highly explosive substance -- stored at the port, but the exact circumstances of the blast remain unclear.\n\nThe explosion has led to protests by demonstrators who say the disaster could not have happened without the corruption and incompetence that have come to define Lebanon's ruling class.\n\nUsing InVid-WeVerify to get a frame-by-frame breakdown of the video, AFP was able to conduct a reverse image search.\n\nThe first version of this video can be found on CNN Arabic\u2019s website, dated August 4th, 2020 with the headline \u201cLebanon .. A huge explosion near Beirut harbor leaves injuries, severe damage and chaos in the center of the capital.\u201d\n\nThe same clip as the one shared on social media appears 11 seconds into the CNN video, though no missile is visible and no negative filter has been applied.\n\nSlowing the video down also shows that the alleged missile disappears, roughly seven second into the video, before hitting its target.\n\nOther videos of the blast, taken by multiple people and from multiple angles, do not show any missile or bomb prior to the explosion.\n\nTwitter users created their own versions of doctored videos, adding missiles, to show how easily videos can be modified.\n\nThis user added a fake missile onto another video, also with a negative filter, of the blast.\n\nA similar doctored video alleging a missile was the cause of the Beirut explosion spread on social media and was fact-checked by AFP in Portugese here.\n\nOther false and misleading claims about the Beirut blast, including that it was a nuclear explosion, have been debunked by AFP and can be seen here.", "lang": "en"}
