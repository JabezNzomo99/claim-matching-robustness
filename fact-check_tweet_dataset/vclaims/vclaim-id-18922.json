No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Taters Gonna Tate on August 1, 2019 titled \"'If Pork Isn't Banned, We'll Have To Leave America' -Muslamian Council\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe prominent Muslammic-American relations group, \"Islamia Coexistence Embassy\", has been bemoaning the American diet for years, claiming that it is \"in direct confrontation with their desires.\" ICE feels that the United States should adapt to their wishes by promoting a nationwide ban on the slaughter and consumption of pork products. \"Americans are filthy pigs. And yet they eat pigs. That's cannibalism and cannibalism is against god.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under a category named \"Muslammicy Bacony Goodness Satire, Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" and of course there is no \"Islamia Coexistence Embassy\" (the name was likely made up to have the same acronym as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, namely \"ICE\"). The words \"Islamia\", \"Musslamic\" and \"Muslamia\" are made up too. And the picture of the spokesperson seems to be from India as it features in this gallery with a caption that reads \"Photos of men in turbans taken at the Dera Radha Soami Colony in Beas, Punjab, India in December 1989.\":\n\nThe story seems to echo an old hoax story that has a \"muslim figure\" making similar claims:\n\nThe site that posted the new pork story is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a BBC video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
