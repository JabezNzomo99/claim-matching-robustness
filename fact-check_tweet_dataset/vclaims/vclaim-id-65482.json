AFP Fact Check found the content has also circulated elsewhere over the years and has been attributed to other world leaders, including former apartheid president PW Botha whose 1985 \u201cRubicon\u201d speech seems to have been the basis for various versions of the hoax.\n\nThe posts generally begin in the same way, with an introduction in uppercase letters that reads: \u201cTRUMP HAS SPOKEN AGAIN. JUST THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP\u2019S SPEECH ON \u2018RISE UP AFRICANS\u2019.\u201d\n\nArchived examples can be seen here, here and here.\n\nThe \u201cspeech\u201d contains offensive comments about Africans and claims the continent is \u201con the verge of collapse\u201d, with Trump\u2019s name included at the end.\n\nData from CrowdTangle, a social media analysis tool, shows how this version of the claim has seen more reposts with each spike in activity since August 2019 when it seemed first to gain traction. This November 2019 post, for example, has been shared more than 12,000 times.\n\nBy searching selected paragraphs, AFP Fact Check found a previous version, beginning with another introduction in uppercase letters that reads: \u201cDONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH ON WHY HE HATES AFRICANS & ARABS\u201d.\n\nMost of these posts -- like this one shared more than 6,200 times -- were published in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe content of the two texts is strikingly similar, although the earlier version is longer, opens differently and disparages Arabs as well as blacks. Again, Trump is identified as the author at the end.\n\nNone of the hundreds of posts say where or when either of the \u201cspeeches\u201d was supposedly delivered or published.\n\nAFP Fact Check searched an online archive of Trump\u2019s tweets and could find no mention of the \u201cspeeches\u201d or extracts from them.\n\nThe older claim, which targets Arabs as well, was also shown to be false by two US fact-checking organisations here and here in 2015 when social media first began linking Trump actively to the text.\n\nFurther evidence against the claim can be found in 2014, when a spate of posts, like these here and here, passed off the same \u201cblacks and Arabs speech\u201d as the work of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was the same year that Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in Gaza.\n\nA closer reading reveals that certain words, names and locations were changed or added to give it an Israeli context.\n\nAFP Fact Check found an online reference to an email from 2009 that was circulating in South Africa and claiming to share a reprinted speech given by former apartheid president PW Botha in 1985 in the coastal city of Durban. The email further claimed, without specifying a date, that this speech was published in the country\u2019s flagship weekend newspaper, the Sunday Times.\n\nThe wording of the text in that email (since reproduced in Facebook posts here and here) bears an almost perfect resemblance to the claim doing the rounds on Facebook more than a decade later in Trump\u2019s name.\n\nBut neither claim is true -- Botha\u2019s actual speech, known as the Rubicon address, is different. While it certainly caused shockwaves at the time for keeping South Africa on the apartheid trajectory, it was not the one found in the hoax email.\n\nSecondly, the fabrication was never published in the Sunday Times. The newspaper has issued denials at least twice over the years, according to an exchange of correspondence between editors and the country\u2019s Press Ombudsman.\n\nThe first of these occasions saw a printed denial in the paper\u2019s Hogarth column in 2004. The second denial, on the advice of the ombudsman\u2019s office, was published online in 2010 after the hoax had begun resurfacing and the title was asked to put up a fresh denial on its website.\n\nThe evidence, therefore, shows that this earliest fabrication was more than likely the precursor to all the other versions of the claim.", "lang": "en"}
