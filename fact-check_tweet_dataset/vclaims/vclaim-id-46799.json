Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Image of ABVP men in Assam protesting against CAA and NRC by holding a flexi with the text \u2018We don\u2019t support NRC and CAA\u2019. Fact: The image in the post is a photoshopped one. In the original image, Ahmedabad ABVP men are holding the flexi with the text \u2018We support CAA\u2019. So, the ABVP men in the image were actually holding a pro-CAA flexi. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, a link of \u2018Ahmedabad Mirror\u2019 was obtained in the search results. The article had a similar image but the ABVP men in that image were holding a banner with the text- \u2018We support CAA\u2019. From the article, it was found that ABVP members of Ahmedabad have gathered at Sabarmati Ashram to support Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). So, the claim made in the post is false.\n\nTo conclude, a photoshopped image is being falsely shared as \u2018Assam ABVP Protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
