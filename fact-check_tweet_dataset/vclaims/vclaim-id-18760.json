It is best to disregard it.\n\nFour days ago, Sahara Reporters published a story with the headline \u201cBuhari\u2019s Katsina Among Bottom Five As Abia, Anambra, Edo Emerge Best Performing States In 2019 West African Examinations Council\u201d. The story goes on to list the best performing states in the annual exams; an claims that WAEC released the ranking.\n\n\u201cThe chart, as released by the examination board, ranked the performances of all 36 states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in the country\u201c, the newspaper says.\n\nSocial media platforms ran amuck with the story with established handles making jest of the claim, assuaging the results to alleged absence of the President\u2019s WAEC certificate. Others retorted how the worst performing states have more special centres\u2026\n\nOur findings revealed that the exact list was also reported by Daily post in 2018 and it is still being circulated in 2019. Media outlets like the Punch newspaper also reported the story as far back as 2016.\n\nNot only that, WAEC denies the veracity of these claims through its official twitter handle and urges people to disregard the list.\n\nAlthough, it seems Godwin Obaseki of Edo state is clearly elated over news. The Vanguard publication on August 16 remarks that the Governor commended the efforts of all stakeholders in the education sector.\n\n\u201cOur state retained the third position it occupied in the 2018 ranking and that shows we sustained the tempo, but we can do better by raising the bar and we are determined to do better in subsequent rankings,\u201d he remarked.\n\nHe further asserts that his administration has commenced the review of the result and is re-strategizing to lead the pack of best performing states in subsequent national examinations.\n\nWhile it is good that the news spurred the Edo State governor to improve the state\u2019s educational sector, the news is still FALSE and should not be promoted as true.\n\nThe West African Examinations Council did not release any list of \u201cbest performing states\u201d ranking. It is safe therefore to conclude that since this purported list did not emanate from WAEC and makes mention of \u201cBuhari\u2019s Katsina\u201d, it must have been published by persons deliberately misinforming the public so as to undermine the current government. Consequently, it is best to disregard it.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
