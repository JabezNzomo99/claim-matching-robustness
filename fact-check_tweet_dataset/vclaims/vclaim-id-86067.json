A central figure is Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser who was fired on Feb. 13, 2017, in the opening weeks of the administration after he supposedly misled Vice President Pence about his conversation with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. (The whole story can be seen in our compelling video above.)\n\nFlynn\u2019s plea agreement states that he made \u201cmaterially false statements and omissions\u201d during the FBI interview, specifically that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from responding to sanctions imposed by outgoing president Barack Obama because of Russian interference in the U.S. election. He also falsely described another conversation with Kislyak, saying he asked only how Russia would vote on a resolution critical of Israel, when in fact he asked Russia to vote against or delay the resolution.\n\nIn a letter dated May 11 to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) quoted from notes taken by a \u201ccareer, nonpartisan law enforcement officer\u201d who attended a March 15, 2017, briefing by Comey. The agent quoted Comey as saying the FBI agents \u201csaw nothing that led them to believe [he was] lying.\u201d Grassley also quoted from committee staff notes that \u201cagents saw no change in his demeanor or tone that would say he was being untruthful.\u201d\n\nThe majority report of the House Intelligence Committee includes a finding that FBI agents \u201cdid not detect any deception during Flynn\u2019s interview.\u201d As evidence, the report quotes Comey from a private briefing on March 2, 2017: \u201cthe agents \u2026 discerned no physical indications of deception. They didn\u2019t see any change in posture, in tone, in inflection, in eye contact. They saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them.\u201d\n\nThe majority report also quoted from a briefing given by Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Dec. 19, 2017, after Flynn pleaded guilty: The \u201cconundrum that we faced on their return from the interview is that although [the agents] didn\u2019t detect deception in the statements that he made in the interview \u2026 the statements were inconsistent with our understanding of the conversation that he had actually had with the ambassador.\u201d McCabe added, \u201cThe two people who interviewed [Flynn] didn\u2019t think he was lying, [which] was not [a] great beginning of a false statement case.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cminority views\u201d offered by Democrats did not challenge whether these quotes were correct or whether they were taken out of context. (A spokesman for the Democrats says the quotes are accurate.) The document simply notes the majority finding \u201cignores both that Flynn himself admitted in his plea to deceiving FBI agents, and that by the time of his interview with the FBI on January 24, 2017, at least one other official was aware that Vice President-elect Pence had told the same lie on television.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlynn initially told investigators sanctions were not discussed. But FBI agents challenged him, asking if he was certain that was his answer. He said he didn\u2019t remember,\u201d the CNN report said. \u201cThe FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers. Although Flynn didn\u2019t remember all of what he talked about, they don\u2019t believe he was intentionally misleading them, the officials say.\u201d\n\nComey claims that he did not tell Congress that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe he was lying to them. But notes of a Senate briefing and a transcript of a House briefing clearly indicate that Comey made statements along those lines, telling the Senate the agents \u201csaw nothing that led them to believe [he was] lying\u201d and the House that \u201cthey saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them.\u201d Press accounts at the time also indicate that the FBI thought it had no case against Flynn.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that Comey\u2019s quotes to the House and Senate were that the agents reported that Flynn\u2019s body language did not indicate he was lying, but that\u2019s not the same thing as saying the agents did not think he was lying. Comey speaks carefully, but this may be parsing his words too closely.", "lang": "en"}
