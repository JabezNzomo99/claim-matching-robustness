But the former first daughter oversimplified two components in her answer and failed to capture the nuances. We fact-checked how much of Hillary Clinton\u2019s college affordability plan offers \u201cdebt-free\u201d and \u201ctuition-free\u201d colleges.\n\nThe New College Compact is Hillary Clinton\u2019s $350 billion, 10-year plan that comprises several ways to relieve debt and to charge low to no tuition for those who need it the most. Her plan stops short of promising debt-free colleges, and offers targeted opportunities for low to no tuition for low-income families.\n\nThe New College Compact proposes an incentive program for states. States would be rewarded with federal money by guaranteeing \u201cno-loan\u201d tuition at four-year public colleges and universities and limited costs for other expenses. States would get more money if they enroll more low- and middle-income students, and work with schools to reduce living expenses.\n\nThere are aspects in Clinton\u2019s plan that could help students outside of the public school or loan system. Clinton proposes \u201csignificantly\u201d cutting the interest rate on student loans for those borrowing to attend private colleges or to pay for living expenses. Clinton and Sanders both want Congress to allow students and parents to refinance federal student loans at lower interest rates. Clinton\u2019s proposal also allows income-based modification for some private borrowers.\n\nChelsea Clinton was referring to a provision that targets low- and and lower-middle-income families, according to the Clinton campaign. This component allows families to contribute to tuition based on their income. Students from some low- and lower-middle-income families would be able to attend a four-year public college without paying tuition. But the student would have to work 10 hours per week.\n\n\u201cI want to make college affordable for our young people. We\u2019re going to do this with debt-free tuition. I have a somewhat different approach than my esteemed opponent, Senator Sanders, who says he wants it free for everybody,\u201d Clinton said at a rally in Phoenix on March 21, 2016. \u201cI am not going to ask you to pay to send Donald Trump\u2019s youngest child free to college or university. No. Instead, I\u2019m going to focus on who needs the help: middle-class families, working families, striving and struggling poor families. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we get the support we need from states.\u201d\n\n[Update: On March 31, 2016, Bill Clinton also misrepresented an aspect of Hillary Clinton\u2019s college proposal. He said during a speech: \u201cShe proposes debt-free education for people that go to public colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and other private small schools that have modest tuitions, high graduation rates, deal with first and second generation Americans of all kinds, by asking people to pay higher taxes to pay for all the tuition, plus the expenses, of people who are in lower incomes.\u201d\n\nThe plan includes a $25 billion fund to \u201cprovide support to private nonprofit schools that serve low- and middle-income students and help them build the skills they need, of which private HBCUs are a prime example.\u201d States will receive federal grants for providing \u201csupport\u201d for private non-profit colleges \u201cthat keep costs low and provide value.\u201d It is not clear what exactly \u201csupport\u201d means, and staff for Hillary and Bill Clinton did not provide an explanation. But the former president goes too far saying this is \u201cdebt-free\u201d education.]\n\nThe plan does offer opportunities for students attending private school to lower their debt \u2013 i.e., cutting student loan interest rates. But the no-loan, or debt-free, component only applies to those attending four-year public colleges and universities. The Clinton plan does not offer free tuition \u2014 that\u2019s the Sanders plan \u2014 but it does allow some low- to lower-middle-income families to qualify for no to low tuition, depending on what they are able to pay without borrowing money. The student also would work 10 hours a week.\n\nIt\u2019s not often we see Chelsea Clinton publicly giving detailed policy answers on behalf of her mother on the campaign trail. In this case, she bungled her talking points and oversimplified components of her mother\u2019s plan \u2014 ultimately misleading voters. We suggest she brush up on her talking points carefully the next time there is a question-and-answer session with voters. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but will spare her a Pinocchio since she was speaking extemporaneously during a question-and-answer session.", "lang": "en"}
