After months of denying the possibility of a run, Christie had recently indicated that he\u2019s reconsidering his stance on a GOP primary bid.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley tried to throw cold water on Christie\u2019s record since he took office in January 2010.\n\n \n\n \"When it comes to being effective at creating jobs, improving schools and expanding opportunity, (Christie\u2019s) record in New Jersey has not been a record of governing for effectiveness,\" O\u2019Malley said. \"His bond rating has been downgraded by two of the bond rating agencies. His unemployment in New Jersey is one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent. Last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs. And his schools, because of the choices he's made to cut education funding, have actually been declining in their national ranking. So that's not a record of leadership and governance and effectiveness.\"\n\n \n\n We decided to focus on the two jobs-related claims -- that \"New Jersey (has) one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent,\" and that \"last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs.\" We\u2019ll rate them in separate Truth-O-Meter items, taking up the first claim in this item.\n\n \n\n We turned to the most recent state-by-state data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official source for employment figures. This data covers August 2011.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley was correct that New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate in August was 9.4 percent. And he\u2019s correct that New Jersey fared worse than the nation as a whole (9.1 percent) and worse than the regional rate for the middle-Atlantic states (8.4 percent).\n\n \n\n But was it \"one of the higher unemployment rates in the country\"? That\u2019s a bit tougher call.\n\n \n\n New Jersey actually ranked 15th among the 50 states or 16th if you include the District of Columbia. Here\u2019s the list of states that ranked higher than New Jersey in unemployment:\n\n \n\n Nevada: 13.4 percent\n\n California: 12.1 percent\n\n Michigan: 11.2 percent\n\n South Carolina: 11.1 percent\n\n District of Columbia: 11.1 percent\n\n Florida: 10.7 percent\n\n Rhode Island 10.6 percent\n\n North Carolina: 10.4 percent\n\n Mississippi: 10.3 percent\n\n Georgia: 10.2 percent\n\n Alabama: 9.9 percent\n\n Illinois: 9.9 percent\n\n Tennessee: 9.7 percent\n\n Oregon: 9.6 percent\n\n Kentucky: 9.5 percent\n\n New Jersey: 9.4 percent\n\n \n\n So does New Jersey have \"one of the higher unemployment rates in the country\"? It\u2019s higher than about two-thirds of the states, but it\u2019s lower than about one-third.\n\n \n\n The figures show that New Jersey is \"in the bottom third of all states in terms of employment,\" said Elisabeth Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which O\u2019Malley chairs. \"Perhaps it would have been more accurate to say that Gov. Christie's New Jersey has one of the \u2018highest\u2019 unemployment rates in the nation.\"\n\n \n\n We\u2019ll also note an underlying flaw in claims like these. O\u2019Malley tries to pin the blame for New Jersey\u2019s relatively weak job market on Christie, when in fact the jobs picture in any given state is influenced by a host of factors, from national and international trends to state policies inherited from a governor\u2019s predecessor. It\u2019s an especially dicey to pin blame on Christie, who has only been in office for a little over a year and a half.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley got the figure right (9.4 percent), and he has a point that New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate is higher than the national and regional averages. However, we think most people, if they heard O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim, would expect that a state with \"one of the higher unemployment rates in the country\" would rank higher than 15th out of 50 or 16th out of 51. Finally, O'Malley said, \"When it comes to being effective at creating jobs \u2026 (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness.\" Christie\u2019s responsibility for his state\u2019s difficult jobs picture is unclear. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
