Investigators told us they \u201cfound no evidence of foul play\u201d and that the deaths were ruled \u201caccidental.\u201d\n\nA tragic home explosion in New Jersey that left a husband and wife dead has become the subject of the latest viral conspiracy theory centered on Hillary and Bill Clinton, a political duo that has become a staple of disturbing tall tales.\n\nThe most recent conspiracy theory claims that one of the victims in the explosion, Carole Paladino, a retired school nurse, was \u201cdue to testify against Hillary Clinton\u201d as part of an FBI probe involving the Clinton Foundation and a pharmaceutical company that donated to the nonprofit organization.\n\nWithin a day of the July 7 explosion in the small town of Newfield, the elaborate story began spreading online. It appeared on the website whatdoesitmean.com under the byline \u201cSorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\u201d \u2014 a known purveyor of false news. The story has appeared on other websites and the conspiracy theory has circulated Facebook.\n\nWhatdoesitmean.com, and other sites that picked up its story, claimed that Paladino was a \u201cUS federal government witness who was due to testify this coming week before a grand jury in the expanding FBI probe into Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation,\u201d citing a \u201cForeign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nOthers, like puppetstringnews.com, spread the false claim about Paladino, citing a tweet that included a screenshot of a quote from an unidentified user in a public forum website who quoted from the story.\n\nThe story said Paladino\u2019s testimony would have focused on a \u201cnotorious American-based pharmaceutical company who gave money to the Clinton Foundation in a bid to cover up their drug price gouging crimes.\u201d It referenced a 2016 New York Post article about the pharmaceutical company, Mylan, and its donations to the Clinton Foundation. At the time, Mylan had come under scrutiny for dramatically increasing the price of EpiPen, a life-saving medication used to treat allergic reactions.\n\nBut what the sites propagating the conspiracy theory fail to mention is that Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, publicly rebuked the company over its price gouging.\n\n\u201cOver the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They\u2019re now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers,\u201d Clinton said in an August 2016 statement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous \u2014 and it\u2019s just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers,\u201d the statement continued, with Clinton saying it\u2019s \u201cwrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton Foundation website indicates Mylan has donated between $100,001 and $250,000. While that relationship is made to appear nefarious, Mylan has made contributions to other charitable groups. A 2017 report by the company said that its charitable foundation had \u201cmade grants totaling more than $10 million to more than 100 nonprofit organizations\u201d over the previous 16 years.\n\nThe company\u2019s political action committee also routinely contributes to those involved in politics. In 2016, and again this year, the company\u2019s PAC gave to both Democrats and Republicans running for Congress. In 2016, it gave twice as much to Republican candidates than Democratic candidates.\n\nThe insinuation that the explosion may not have been an accident also doesn\u2019t comport with what local authorities have said.\n\nThe Gloucester County Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u201chas found no evidence of foul play,\u201d it said in a press released provided to FactCheck.org by spokesman Bernie Weisenfeld. The manner of death for both was ruled \u201caccidental.\u201d\n\nThe Gloucester County Fire Marshal\u2019s Office found that the explosion was sparked by gas, though the origin is undetermined, county spokeswoman Debra Sellitto told us. There were \u201cmultiple ignition sources,\u201d she said in an email, and the investigation remains open.\n\nSome neighbors told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the couple had recently installed a new stove, though it\u2019s unclear if that was the cause.\n\nThose who knew Carole Paladino, 72, and her husband, John, 73, told us that they had no knowledge of them being involved in a case against the Clintons.\n\n\u201cI knew John personally and he never mentioned anything about this supposed conspiracy,\u201d Newfield Mayor Donald Sullivan told FactCheck.org in an email. Sullivan knew John from their work together at the DeMarco-Luisi Funeral Home in Vineland, and the mayor had recently appointed him to the town\u2019s Planning Board.\n\nAnd Judith Woop, who served as executive director of the New Jersey State School Nurses Association from 2013 until last month, said she knew Carole for years through their work for the professional group. Carole had volunteered as editor of the group\u2019s newsletter at one point and also served as its standards and practices chair. The association is nonpartisan, Woop noted.\n\n\u201cWe were involved in EpiPen legislation but just from the administration standpoint of giving EpiPen, delegating it,\u201d Woop said of the nurses\u2019 group. \u201cI can\u2019t see her involved in any pharmaceutical\u201d investigation.\n\nIn fact, Carole had participated in the creation of a 2008 New Jersey Department of Education document outlining training protocols for the emergency administration of epinephrine (the generic name of the medicine). But Woop said Carole, like other certified nurses in the association, likely offered her expertise and assistance to the state on other nursing-relating matters.\n\n\u201cShe was a most ethical, professional, generous, giving\u201d nurse, Woop said. Of the conspiracy theory, she added: \u201cFor people to spread stuff like that, it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nHalper, Daniel. \u201cCompany that price gouged EpiPen is Clinton Foundation donor.\u201d New York Post. 25 Aug 2016.\n\nMelamed, Samantha, et al. \u201cTwo dead in New Jersey house explosion: \u2018It was a huge ball of fire.\u2019\u201d The Philadelphia Inquirer. 7 Jul 2018.\n\nWoop, Judith.
