He also wasn\u2019t terminated at any point this year, as reports recycling the falsehood, and shared on Facebook, have stated.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can\u2019t Control His Hate For Donald Trump,\u201d reads the headline posted in recent days on donaldtrumpforusa.com and NewsTodayInUsaUpdate, a website powered by the blogging platform blogspot.com.\n\nThat false headline prompted applause in some circles on Facebook, including on the page of a group called DRAIN THE SWAMP.\n\n\u201cGREAT !! GET RID OF HIM ASAP!!!\u201d one user wrote.\n\nSome Fox News viewers have grown frustrated by Smith, whose reporting has at times been critical of President Trump and conservatives. But the cable channel has denied the persistent rumors of Smith being fired.\n\nFox News directed us to previous statements, including one in a February Associated Press report in which a network spokeswoman called Smith\u2019s supposed termination \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Fox News announced in March that Smith had signed a \u201cmultiyear deal\u201d to stay with the network. In a statement, Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch praised the anchor, who has been with the network for more than two decades.\n\n\u201cShepard Smith is an exemplary journalist whose skill in anchoring breaking news is unrivaled,\u201d Murdoch said in the announcement. \u201cHis powerful storytelling on both television and digital platforms has elevated our entire news gathering process.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can\u2019t Control His Hate For Donald Trump.\u201d Donaldtrumpforusa.com. 10 Jun 2018.\n\n\u201cFox News Channel says Shepard Smith has not been fired.\u201d Associated Press. 26 Feb 2018.", "lang": "en"}
