The high court has not released any decision ordering a stop to the network's operations.\n\nWith the headline \u201cBRAKING [sic] NEWS: SUPREME COURT INI-UTOS NA I-OVER ALL SHUTDOWN NA ANG ABSCBN?| JOSE CALIDA BUMWELTA NA (Breaking news: Supreme Court orders for an overall shutdown of ABS-CBN? Jose Calida hits back)!,\u201d the misleading video muddled a statement from Solicitor General Jose Calida quoted in a June 25 Philippine News Agency article.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court declared moot and dismissed the quo warranto petition filed in February by Calida against ABS-CBN Corp.,the solicitor general said in the article that the network \u201cshould remain off-air\u201d unless the high court grants an injunction against the National Telecommunications Commission\u2019s (NTC) cease and desist order on May 5 for ABS-CBN.\n\nABS-CBN halted its broadcast operations following the NTC order after its franchise expired last May 4. The order covers ABS-CBN\u2019s regional affiliates, including five AM and 18 FM radio stations, and 42 television stations. The cease and desist order came after NTC Commissioners sought the legal opinion of the Office of the Solicitor General.\n\nThe network filed a petition for a temporary restraining order against the NTC\u2019s directive, to allow them to continue broadcasting while their franchise renewal is still pending in Congress. ABS-CBN is still awaiting the SC\u2019s decision.\n\nThe misleading video now has almost 181,000 views. Its publication on News Citizen Phil could have reached 1.3 million online users, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nIts top three online traffic generators are Facebook groups ATTY. PERSIDA ACOSTA - PAO CHIEF FOR SENATOR MOVEMENT - SUPPORTERS GROUP!, SARA DUTERTE FOR PRESIDENT 2022 ELECTIONS and Mayor Inday Sara Duterte International Movement.\n\nYouTube channel Showbiz Fanaticz, where the video is uploaded, has over 195,000 subscribers since it was created on Nov. 9, 2017. This is not the first time VERA Files Fact Check has flagged a story from Showbiz Fanaticz.", "lang": "en"}
