I am FED up with our country bending over to the rest of the world to APPEASE everyone except AUSSIES.\u201d\n\nThe text is accompanied with an image showing a Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate eggs box next to a Turkish Delight eggs box.\n\nThe post has continued to circulate since 2017, drawing more than 116,000 shares and more than 800,000 views. It has also attracted more than 16,000 reactions and 3,500 comments.\n\nIn March 2016, UK tabloid newspaper The Daily Star published an article titled, \u201cChocolate makers ban \u2018Easter\u2019 from eggs to stop \u2018offending\u2019 other religions\u201d.\n\nThe article listed several UK products which did not include the word \u2018Easter\u2019 on the packaging including, Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk \u201cEgg Hunt Pack\u201d, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Aero\u2019s \u201cchocolate egg with bubbly bars\u201d, and Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cmilk chocolate egg\u201d brand.\n\nThe story included reaction from \u201creligious campaigners\u201d unhappy about the word being left off chocolate products during the Easter period. It was also picked up in Australia by Liberal MP Craig Kelly in March 2016 who wrote on his Facebook page, \u201cWHO TOOK THE \u201cEASTER\u201d OUT OF EASTER EGGS ? : Even our chocolate now has to be politically correct.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Mr Kelly wrote, \u201cProducts that for generations have been marketed as \u201cEaster Eggs\u201d by Cadbury, Lindt, Nestle, M & M\u2019s, Woolworths Home brand, and others \u2013 this year, the word \u201cEaster\u201d has mysteriously disappeared from their packaging.\u201d\n\nFormer senator Glenn Lazarus also shared a post about \u201cEaster\u201d missing on chocolate egg products saying he was \u201creally offended\u201d. He later deleted the post.\n\nPaul Chatfield, director of marketing for Cadbury, told AAP FactCheck in an email the claim the company had removed the word \u2018Easter\u2019 from its packaging and advertising was not true.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t removed the word \u2018Easter\u2019 from our products,\u201d Mr Chatfield said.\n\n\u201cEaster is communicated across our marketing and advertising campaigns, and both the word and theme feature on our packaging, website and social pages.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2019 Easter period, Cadbury Australia featured multiple Facebook posts involving their products and the word \u2018Easter\u2019, including an Adult Gift Box with the words \u201cHappy Easter\u201d on the box, a gift box and chocolate bunnies with Easter mentioned in the promotional material.\n\nCadbury also responded to a Facebook user\u2019s comment that the words \u201cHappy Easter\u201d did not appear on Cadbury Easter egg products, saying \u201cOur Easter products are sold at Easter time and Easter \u2013 the word and theme \u2013 features clearly on numerous products in numerous products in our range \u2026 We\u2019ve used Easter on our communications at this time of year for years, and will continue to do so in future.\u201d\n\nMr Chatfield told AAP FactCheck there are some Cadbury egg products that do not have \u2018Easter\u2019 displayed on their packaging such as the Mini Eggs range because there was not \u201croom on the pack for the word itself\u201d.\n\nHe said customers would easily be able to see the word \u2018Easter\u2019 on a shelf of Cadbury products in the supermarket.\n\n\u201cOur Easter products are clearly known as Easter products, due to the Easter-themed imagery on pack, the type of product they are, and the fact that they are only available at this special time of year.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. Cadbury said it had not removed the word \u2018Easter\u2019 from its \u201centire collection of Easter eggs\u201d. The company\u2019s director of marketing said the word \u2018Easter\u2019 and theme features on their Easter product packaging. The Cadbury Facebook page shows the word clearly visible on its Easter promotional material. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
