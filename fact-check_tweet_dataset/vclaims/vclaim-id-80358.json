The picture was taken and photoshopped by the fake news brigade changing the frame of Mahatma Gandhi in the background to Aurangzeb's.\n\nA Twitter handle @Atheist_Krishna who admits to photoshopping pictures for fun on his bio put this out on Twitter on December 4.\n\nBut for some sympathisers of BJP, this was enough to circulate without any qualification.\n\nThe official website of the Congress party has in its archives the pictures from that day making it clear that the frame was definitely dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi and not Aurangzeb. Posted below are the pictures from different angles.\n\nImage shared by Amarinder Singh Raja of the same occasion but shot from a different angle clearly shows that the frame in the room of the party office was of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nPutting It In Context: Narendra Modi compared Rahul Gandhi\u2019s nomination to Aurangzeb Raj, while speaking at a rally in Gujarat. This was in response to now sacked Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement trying to defend Gandhi's elevation to the party's top post.\n\n\u201cWhen Shah Jahan came in the place of Jahangir did any election happen? And when Aurangzeb came in place of Shah Jahan did any election happen? It was known to everyone that the throne of the king will automatically go to the heir,\" Aiyar said according to a report by the Hindustan Times.\n\nThis was in reply to the Maharashtra Congress leader Shehzad Poonawalla\u2019s criticism on the party president election as he called it 'rigged' in favour of Rahul Gandhi.", "lang": "en"}
