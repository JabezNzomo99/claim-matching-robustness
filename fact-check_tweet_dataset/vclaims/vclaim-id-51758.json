This is false; the 46-year-old black man\u2019s death in police custody was ruled a homicide by a medical examiner.\n\nFloyd was a \u201cVIOLENT THUG\u201d who \u201coverdosed while resisting,\u201d an August 13, 2020 Facebook post says, comparing him to a boy named Cannon Hinnant, whom it describes as an \u201cINNOCENT CHILD\u201d who was \u201cexecuted by black man.\u201d\n\nFloyd was \u201cHONORED & PRAISED\u201d while Hinnant was \u201cIRRELEVANT,\u201d the post claims.\n\nSimilar claims appear on Facebook here and Instagram here.\n\nFloyd\u2019s final moments -- in which he pleaded for his life and said he could not breathe as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes -- were captured on video.\n\nHis death sparked widespread outrage and weeks of demonstrations in the United States and other countries against racial injustice and police brutality. It also led to calls for defunding the police and other law enforcement reforms, as well as soul-searching about racism in America.\n\nWhile an autopsy by the Hennepin County medical examiner\u2019s office did find drugs in Floyd\u2019s system, it concluded that the cause of his death was \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\u201d and that the manner of death was \u201chomicide.\u201d\n\nThe posts are part of a trend on social media of trying to equate reactions to the killing of Hinnant -- a five-year-old white child who was fatally shot on August 9 in North Carolina, allegedly by a black man -- with that of Floyd.\n\nBut the context of Floyd\u2019s death -- it was part of a pattern of deadly police encounters with African Americans -- and its result -- widespread protests and calls for change -- make the two cases very different.\n\nOther posts such as this one -- which misspells Hinnant\u2019s name -- allege that there was \u201cno media coverage\u201d of his death.\n\nThis is also false. Local media and the Associated Press quickly reported on the story, and it has since been covered by other national media.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked dozens of examples of false information related to Floyd and the protests that followed his death, which can be viewed in English here.", "lang": "en"}
