One report, published by the World Nuclear Association, an international organization representing the nuclear industry, compared 21 studies from government agencies, universities and industries. By this account, with a mean average of 733 tonnes of CO2 produced for every gigawatt hour, oil is the third biggest emitter, after Lignite, or brown coal, and regular coal.\n\nBecause oil is more often used as a fuel for vehicles than to produce electricity, another way to look at it is to compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production and combustion of Albertan oil with other types of oil. Even if results vary depending on the study, and even if oil sand extraction has become more energy efficient since the 1990s, Albertan oil is consistently found to be more polluting than other types of oil.\n\nThe think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace compared 75 types of global oils in order to produce its Oil-Climate Index, and found that oil sands crude generally produces 31 percent more greenhouse gases than conventional oil. Out of the 75, Canadian oil sands crude ranked first, second, and seventh respectively in terms of emissions.\n\nAt the lowest end of estimations, IHS Markis, an industry consultant not affiliated to any academic institutions, found \"transportation fuels produced solely from oil sands result in well-to-wheels life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions 5 to 15 percent higher than the average crude refined in the United States.\"\n\nWhat conclusion can be drawn ?\n\nNo studies suggest that oil sands crude from Alberta is the cleanest of all types of oil, let alone the cleanest type of energy in the world.", "lang": "en"}
