It also claims a 99.5 per cent \u201csurvival rate\u201d for the coronavirus.\n\nThe post features an image of a yellow map of Australia in the background with text that begins with, \u201cDear Australia\u201d before asking a series of questions including: \u201cA virus with a 99.5% survival rate that has killed fewer than the normal flu season?\u201d and \u201ca virus that the test can\u2019t identify separately from the flu?\u201d A caption further claims the test can\u2019t tell the difference COVID-19 and the common cold.\n\nThe August 5 post has received more than 300 shares and more than 21,000 views.\n\nThere are currently two tests used to diagnose COVID-19 in Australia: the reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test and the point-of-care antibody serology test. The claim about the ability of the tests to detect COVID-19 contradicts advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal Department of Health and two virology experts contacted by AAP FactCheck.\n\nThe Facebook post also repeats a previously debunked claim about the \u201csurvival rate\u201d of COVID-19.\n\nThe PCR test, one of the two tests used to diagnose COVID-19 in Australia, swabs the back of the throat and up the nose to detect SARS-CoV-2, the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Point-of-care serology tests are conducted outside of laboratories to analyse a person\u2019s body fluids using mobile devices to provide real-time results, according to NSW Health. This method can detect COVID-19 antibodies through a blood or finger prick test.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that real-time PCR tests are \u201cthe primary method of diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection\u201d.\n\nThe PCR test is \u201cspecific to SARS-COV-2 and will reliably detect SARS-COV-2 (ribonucleic acid) RNA whether the virus is viable or not\u201d, the spokesperson said.\n\nDr Ian Mackay, a virologist and adjunct associate professor with the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck PCR tests are \u201cextremely effective at very sensitively and specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe tests detect the viral sequences we expect them to and not other viruses,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the claim the tests can\u2019t identify COVID-19 from the flu and common cold, Professor Bill Rawlinson, a senior medical virologist at the University of NSW, told AAP FactCheck this assertion was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19-specific serology and PCR tests will not detect flu and common cold viruses unless you use the flu PCR and flu serology or rhinovirus serology and rhinovirus PCR,\u201d Prof Rawlinson said.\n\n\u201cThe SARS-Coronavirus-2 antibody tests are specific for SARS-Coronavirus-2 and don\u2019t detect the other antibodies to the other coronaviruses.\u201d\n\nThe claim that PCR tests inaccurately detect COVID-19 has previously been debunked by AAP FactCheck.\n\nThe post also claims the survival rate for COVID-19 is 99.5 per cent, however it is unclear how the figure was calculated or its source.\n\nAAP FactCheck previously checked a similar claim on the supposed COVID-19 survival rates for other countries and found they were calculated to show the deaths as a proportion of that country\u2019s population.\n\nProfessor Robyn Lucas, head of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, previously said this method was misleading as it is \u201cusing the whole population, rather than the number who have diagnosed infection\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo this is not really \u2018survival\u2019 \u2013 to survive a disease you have to have the disease in the first place,\u201d she told AAP FactCheck.\n\nProf Lucas said if a \u201csurvival rate\u201d for COVID-19 was to be calculated, it would be by dividing the number of people who survived infection by the number who have had the illness.\n\n\u201cBut even then there will be variability based on the definition of the group that has had the illness. Is it the number diagnosed with the illness, the number hospitalised with the illness, or the number who probably have the illness (i.e. including those we think are asymptomatic)?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDepending on which group is used, you will get vastly different results.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. PCR and serology tests used to diagnose COVID-19 are specific only to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The post does not show the \u201csurvival rate\u201d for COVID-19. An epidemiologist advises that the percentage of a population that has not died from COVID-19 is not a \u201csurvival rate\u201d and calculation of a survival rate would vary depending on what definition of illness is used. False \u2013 The primary claims in the post are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
