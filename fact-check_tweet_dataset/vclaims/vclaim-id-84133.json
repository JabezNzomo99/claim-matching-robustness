The youngest victims are 14, 15 and 17 years old and the oldest is 59.\n\nSeveral cases involve the use of large rubber bullets (known in France as LBDs). Their use has been criticised by political parties and civil liberties groups.\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said on April, 4, 2019 that French security services would investigate 209 cases of suspected police violence against yellow vest demonstrators.\n\nAuthorities have defended the police action during the months of unrest, which have seen thousands of demonstrators fill the streets of cities throughout France.\n\nCastaner said 1,628 police and gendarmes have also been injured, some seriously, by protesters.\n\nFourteen of the injured have been given medical certificates, seen by AFP, confirming they have lost their sight and/or their eye. Two others are expected to go blind. For at least one person, the injury is less visible as the eye is still there.\n\nPatrice, 49, who has filed legal action, sees his injury as a \u201cspringboard to start the fight against so-called non-lethal weapons\u201d. Others live at home in the dark \u201clike moles\u201d. \u201cI would rather have been sentenced to 10 years in jail,\u201d said Alexandre. One person told AFP they had attempted suicide.\n\nHere are their stories:\n\nCoordination by Guillaume Daudin, Sami Acef, Remi Banet and Francois d'Astier.
