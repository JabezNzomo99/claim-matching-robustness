That paper, titled \u201c\u2018What About Building 7?\u2019 A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories\u201d made a series of qualitative observations based on 2,174 collected comments, as follows:\n\nWe found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters. Conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were. Conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories. Conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma. Conventionalist arguments tended to have a more hostile tone.\n\nNatural News derived their assertion that \u201cconspiracists\u201d are \u201cmore sane\u201d from combining the latter observation about tone with their own severely flawed understanding of sampling biases:\n\nThe researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventional ones. \u201cOf the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist,\u201d the researchers That means the pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters represent a small, beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned.\n\nThat inherently flawed interpretation relied on the somewhat terrifying assumption that the views expressed in the comments section of news articles about the September 11th terrorist attacks were a representative cross-section of the population as a whole, a rather harrowing notion. In fact, it should be unsurprising that the majority of the comments collected by the researchers were pro-conspiracy theory, as that is explicitly the kind of comment the researchers searched for:\n\nThe study did not even capture a representative sample of the comments left on news stories about 9/11, much less the views of the broader population about 9/11. Therefore, the study cannot be used to make the claim that \u201cpro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom.\u201d\n\nWith regard to the tone of comments, it is unclear where Natural News got the idea that the hostile tone of a comment responding to a 9/11 conspiracy indicates a lack of sanity, but the study at no point makes any claim about comparative sanity levels.\n\nThe study did conclude, however, that \u201cconspiracism is rooted in several higher-order beliefs such as an abiding mistrust of authority, the conviction that nothing is quite as it seems, and the belief that most of what we are told is a lie.\u201d The study also noted that their results aligned with previous observations \u201cthat conspiracy theories rely heavily on \u2018errant data\u2019 rather than on crafting coherent alternative explanations.\u201d\n\nIf a hostile tone betrays a lack of sanity, then Natural News \u2014 an outlet whose operator created an entire website named \u201cHoggwatch\u201d dedicated to harassing Parkland school shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogg \u2014 must be in desperate need of some rationality.", "lang": "en"}
