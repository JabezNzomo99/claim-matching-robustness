The claims are not based on scientific evidence, experts say, and the paper was withdrawn after its publisher found \u201cmanipulation of the peer review\u201d process.\n\n\u201cNIH Admits 5G Can Actually Create Coronavirus Within Human Cells,\u201d social media posts and blog articles say, based on a study first published on July 16, 2020 by scientific publisher Biolife. It was later added to the catalog of the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website, Pubmed.gov, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n5G is the next generation of super-fast mobile network technology that will power self-driving cars, smart-home technology, streaming and other services.\n\nThe claim circulated on Instagram -- here, here, and here; Facebook -- here, here and here; and via blog posts, here and here.\n\nIn some cases, like on this website and Infowars -- whose founder Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist, was banned from Facebook in 2019 and is known for calling the 9/11 attacks an inside job and describing the Sandy Hook school massacre as a hoax -- articles were later updated to claim that the study had been censored after it was withdrawn from both PubMed\u2019s and Biolife\u2019s websites.\n\nThe study the posts are based on,\u201c5G Technology and induction of coronavirus in skin cells,\u201d is labeled as \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d but is also marked as an \u201ceditorial\u201d on the first page of the text.\n\nAFP talked to scientists who agreed on the lack of evidence behind the claim and commented on the \u201cpredatory\u201d nature of the journal that published the article, displaying obscure submission practices and a lack of transparency about what they pay for a publication.\n\nThe study claims that \"5G millimeter waves could be absorbed by dermatological cells acting like antennas and play the main role in producing coronaviruses in biological cells.\"\n\n\u201cFrom a physics point of view, 5G does not make much of a difference in terms of the millimeter waves\u201d than 4G, Mahadevappa Mahesh, professor of Radiology and Cardiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Chief Physicist for the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, told AFP by phone.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also says on its website that \u201cviruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks.\u201d\n\nMahesh added that the equations shown in the study did \u201cnot make any sense,\u201d an opinion also shared by Elisabeth Bik, a scientific consultant who specializes in researching scientific malpractice.\n\nBik wrote a full analysis of the now-retracted paper on her blog, Science Integrity Digest.\n\n\u201cI recognized some of the authors' names, and I already had a suspicion that it was going to be a sort of fantastic claim with no evidence at all behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you make a very interesting hypothesis, like \u2018the earth is flat\u2019, you need to come up with proof, and they (the authors) didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nTheir theory \u201cis almost like saying that it (5G) generates new life (...) And why would it specifically form a coronavirus? They don\u2019t answer that,\u201d she added.\n\nThe study also confuses the disease with the virus, throughout the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not technically correct to say it creates \u2018COVID-19,\u2019\u201d as this refers to the disease and not the virus \u201clike with AIDS and HIV.\u201d\n\nAFP fact-checked similar claims related to 5G and the COVID-19 outbreak here and here.\n\nThe validation process the study went through before being accepted by the Journal of Biological Regulators & Homeostatic Agents, described as a \u201cpeer-reviewed journal published every two months,\u201d remains unclear.\n\nPubMed confirmed to AFP in a statement by email that the article was originally on their website because their citations come from MEDLINE -- a bibliographic database including \u201cindexed journals, journals or manuscripts deposited in PubMed Central, and NCBI Bookshelf.\u201d The citations for articles from the Journal of Biological Regulators & Homeostatic Agents \u201care available through PubMed because the journal is currently indexed in MEDLINE.\u201d\n\nBik also reiterated that PubMed was not directly responsible for the content published by this particular journal. \u201cBut after that journal published this paper, they (PubMed) hopefully will realize that it\u2019s either a gullible journal or a journal that cannot be trusted anymore from this point on,\u201d Bik said. \u201cThey might want to reassess the inclusion of this particular journal in their index.\u201d\n\nInstead of NIH \u201cadmitting\u201d that \u201c5G creates coronavirus in human cells,\u201d as the claims state, the content was automatically referenced on the site, and later withdrawn, after the publisher conducted an \u201cinvestigation\u201d which showed \u201csubstantial evidence of manipulation of the peer review.\u201d\n\nContacted by AFP, the editor-in-chief of Biolife, Pio Conti, refused to further elaborate on the paper\u2019s validation process and subsequent retraction.", "lang": "en"}
