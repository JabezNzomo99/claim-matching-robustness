It is noteworthy that she had taken down her tweet and issued a clarification before this report was published.\n\nOn Facebook, a few more people shared the screengrab and took potshots at Indian media.\n\nThe bulletin comes across as a satirical creation just by the first read. The bottom-most line in the image makes it evident that it\u2019s not a screengrab of broadcast but a joke on the falling journalistic standards in broadcast news.\n\nSuch screenshots are created from a meme-generator website. This website allows you to populate a template of a meme with a headline, ticker and an image of your choice. This particular meme was created on the meme-generator website \u2018Break Your Own News\u2019. Only the logo of ABP News was added to the template.\n\nAfter his initial tweet, Singh posted another where he said, \u201cEven if it\u2019s photoshopped, it (shows) what\u2019s happening right now\u201d.\n\nChaturvedi also clarified, \u201cBeen told the ABP news SS is fake. Deleting it. Apologies\u201d.\n\nThis is not the first instance when netizens fell for an image that was created on such meme-generator websites. Earlier, a similar screengrab that read, \u201cBreaking News: Weed kills coronavirus\u201d, had gone viral. Several people had shared it believing it to be true. Using the template now viral, an image was shared in the month of March, where it was falsely claimed, \u201cVladimir Putin has Dropped 800 tigers and Lions all over the Country to push people to stay Home\u201d. It was also used to spread misinformation about the accused bishop in the Kerala nun rape case.", "lang": "en"}
