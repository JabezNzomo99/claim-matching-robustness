Since the news broke out, the issue has been massively communalised on social media and by a number of mainstream media outlets. In the latest attempt, a video of a man inside a police van, spitting on a cop, has been shared by numerous individuals online. Alt News has received fact-check requests for the video on its official mobile application where the claim suggests that the man was an attendee at the meet organised at Nizamuddin Markaz.\n\nThe same has also found its way to Facebook where it has been uploaded with the following text in Hindi \u2013 \u201c\u091c\u093f\u0928\u0915\u094b \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f \u0935\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u094b\u0902 \u092b\u0930\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0942\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u0964 \u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0925\u0942\u0915 \u0915\u093e \u092a\u0930\u093f\u091a\u092f \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0964 \u092f\u0947 \u0915\u0932 \u092d\u0940 \u0925\u0942\u0915 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u0906\u091c \u092d\u0940 (Those who wanted proof, here it is. The action of angles. Peacefully spitting. They were spitting yesterday, they are also spitting today.)\u201d Below is a post by Facebook user Meghraj Choudhary. It has garnered over 1 lakh views and 6,500 shares.\n\nFrom a Facebook page \u2018Salo Ab tm dost ko SIKHaOge\u2019, the clip has received 450 shares. The clip is also circulating on Twitter. It has received 2,000 retweets from the handle @Being_Ridhima. The video is floating in the backdrop of CRPO Northern Railway claiming that people from Tablighi Jamaat were unruly at quarantine centres and spat on medical workers.\n\nThe people who attended the congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz were taken to hospitals and quarantine centres in buses. The vehicle in the video looks like a police van. Furthermore, there are no health workers in the van and nobody is wearing protective masks. A keyword search on YouTube \u2013 \u2018man spits police van\u2019 \u2013 led us to a report by Times of India. According to the report, \u201cAn undertrial allegedly attacked and spit on a few members of the Mumbai police escort party on Saturday. Reportedly, he was upset with the policemen for not allowing him to have home-cooked food brought by his family.\u201d An undertrial is a person who awaits trial for a crime. The incident was reported by Mumbai Mirroron February 29, 2020, and the accused was identified as Mohammad Sohal Shaukat Ali. His family members had got him food at the court which the police disallowed him from consuming. In the video, Ali can be seen arguing and abusing the cops of Mumbai\u2019s Thane police. Therefore, the video is unrelated to Tablighi Jamaat meet and has been shared to falsely portray that the man was an attendee spitting at cops to spread coronavirus infection. Earlier, a video of a Sufi ritual was falsely viral as intentional mass sneezing inside Bagle Wali masjid. We have debunked another video that shows Bohra Muslims practising the custom of licking utensils to not waste leftover food. This too was falsely shared as the Muslim community spreading the disease.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is over 2,300 and close to 70 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 9.5 lakh confirmed cases and over 48,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.
