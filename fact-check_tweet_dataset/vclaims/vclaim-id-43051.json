Rolanda Hollis introduced a bill (HB 238) in the Alabama Legislature that \u201cwould require a man to undergo a vasectomy within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.\u201d\n\nAs noted by The Associated Press, Hollis was \u201cfed up with her colleagues\u2019 attempts to outlaw abortion\u201d and introduced the bill to send \u201cthe message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies\u201d:\n\nAlabama lawmakers [in 2019] approved a ban on abortion unless the woman\u2019s life was in danger. A federal judge blocked the law from taking effect while a legal challenge plays out in court. \u201cYear after year the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman\u2019s body and her reproductive rights. We should view this as the same outrageous overstep in authority,\u201d the Birmingham lawmaker wrote in a statement texted to The Associated Press. Hollis said that doctors, and not legislators, are the ones to be consulted over surgery, medications and making the \u201cincredibly difficult decisions\u201d related to personal reproductive rights. Alabama was one of several states that [in 2019] attempted to enact new abortion restrictions in the hopes of getting the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.", "lang": "en"}
