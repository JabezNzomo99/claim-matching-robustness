Andrew Cuomo made the over-the-top claim that if the Trump administration \u201chad done its job, the virus wouldn\u2019t come\u201d to New York. Cuomo pointed to a study that suggested government officials could have better mitigated the spread of the coronavirus in New York City, but it didn\u2019t say they could have stopped it.\n\nCuomo made his comments in a July 16 CNN interview after anchor Kate Bolduan asked him about criticism from CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper of a poster Cuomo released depicting New York\u2019s fight against the coronavirus as a successful climb up and down a mountain. The poster, which Cuomo sketched and can be purchased for $11.50, is a whimsical homage of sorts to early 1900s poster art.\n\nTapper, in a July 14 Twitter thread, mentioned the poster in criticizing the \u201ccrowing\u201d from Cuomo\u2019s administration over the state\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cNY state has lost more than 32,000 lives to COVID-19,\u201d Tapper wrote. \u201cSo while it\u2019s great that the numbers have gone down, it\u2019s perplexing to see crowing. \u2026 No other state has lost as many lives, not even close.\u201d\n\nThe poster doesn\u2019t mention that. Bolduan asked Cuomo: \u201cDo you think the poster was a mistake in the midst of all this?\u201d\n\nThe governor responded by referring to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he and Bolduan had discussed. The study found that genome sequencing of positive coronavirus cases in New York City mostly resembled sequences in Europe, but the U.S. government\u2019s travel restrictions on Europe were implemented too late to mitigate the introduction of the virus. Those restrictions were implemented on March 13; by March 15, the CDC report says, \u201ccommunity transmission was widespread in New York City.\u201d\n\nThe governor got it right when he said earlier in the interview that the CDC \u201csays the virus came from Europe and the travel ban was too late.\u201d That\u2019s the main takeaway from the report. But the CDC didn\u2019t say that \u201cTrump is to blame for the virus coming to New York\u201d or that the federal government could have stopped the virus from coming to New York, as Cuomo suggests.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before \u2014 in looking at Trump\u2019s unsupported claims that his restrictions on travel from China have saved \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives \u2014 the research on international travel limitations shows they can delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.\n\nWe asked the governor\u2019s press office for clarification on his remarks and what he believed the Trump administration could have done to stop the virus from coming to New York. We haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nWhat the CDC Said\n\nThe CDC report, released on July 16, used specimens collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from March 1 through 20 at six hospital emergency rooms from patients with influenza-like symptoms who had tested negative for influenza. Of the 544 specimens, the CDC found 36 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC then used genetic sequencing and found the positive specimens in New York City mostly resembled the genetic sequences of the virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\u201cUsing genetic sequencing, CDC determined that the sequences of most SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive specimens resembled those circulating in Europe, suggesting probable introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe, from other U.S. locations, and local introductions from within New York,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese findings demonstrate that partnering with health care facilities and developing the systems needed for rapid implementation of sentinel surveillance, coupled with capacity for genetic sequencing before an outbreak, can help inform timely containment and mitigation strategies.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that the earliest specimens, from March 2, weren\u2019t connected to genome sequences from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019. This was \u201cunanticipated,\u201d the report said, because most of the emergency departments that collected the specimens were in ZIP codes with a high percentage of Chinese speakers.\n\nThe study suggests the virus spreading in New York City in March largely wasn\u2019t affected by the federal government\u2019s restrictions on travel to and from China, which were implemented on Feb. 2. Those restrictions said that non-U.S. citizens were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, but there were exceptions for citizens, permanent residents and the immediate family members of both.\n\nWhile such travel policies \u201care an important mitigation strategy,\u201d the CDC said, the subsequent restrictions on travel from Europe \u2014 imposed on March 13, with the same exceptions \u2014 came too late. \u201c[B]y the time the European restrictions were implemented, importation and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had already occurred in NYC.\u201d\n\nFive days earlier, on March 8, the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had announced sustained community transmission of the virus. That week, there were 1,917 confirmed cases in the city, and the CDC\u2019s report estimated there were another 1,170 undetected cases.\n\nAnd by March 15, just two days after the travel restrictions on Europe went into effect, \u201ccommunity transmission was widespread in New York City,\u201d the report said.\n\nLimited testing availability and strict criteria harmed the ability to detect cases and slow the spread, the report further said.\n\n\u201cExpanding the testing criteria at the beginning of the outbreak to include persons with any travel exposure and with [influenza-like symptoms] without an alternative diagnosis would have increased the number of cases detected through passive surveillance,\u201d the CDC said. \u201cLimited testing capability and strict testing criteria led to many COVID-19 cases going undetected, slowed DOHMH\u2019s capacity to use surveillance to make timely public health decisions, and ultimately contributed to sustained community transmission.\u201d\n\nThe report does have at least six limitations, it said \u2014 most notably, the small number of patients, which \u201cled to large uncertainty in estimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the number of undetected COVID-19 cases in the target population.\u201d\n\nBut the findings show the travel policies don\u2019t appear to have made much of an impact \u2014 if any \u2014 on the virus\u2019 arrival in New York City. And testing limitations further contributed to the spread of the virus. The CDC, however, doesn\u2019t say, as Cuomo claimed, that \u201cTrump is to blame for the virus coming to New York,\u201d or that a different strategy could have stopped the virus from coming.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that banning travelers from China did not keep the virus out of the US, it is unrealistic to think that it would have been possible to implement expanded travel bans to try and stop the virus,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us in an email. \u201cIt is very difficult to know in real time where in the world the virus is and this makes it near impossible to create a list of countries from which to ban travel. So far, all evidence suggests that no country has been successful in using travel bans to prevent the virus from entering its borders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, we found previously that studies of this pandemic as well as past research have shown travel restrictions can slow a virus\u2019 spread but not stop it.\n\nSaad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us in April when we looked into this issue that previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the policies have to be very strict to have an effect. Travel restrictions \u201ccan have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,\u201d Omer said. But, \u201ceven then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. travel restrictions were limited, of course, and so was testing for the virus generally.\n\nInitially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a severe acute lower respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed.\n\nNuzzo told us previously that in February, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren\u2019t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. \u201cwould likely not have picked it up\u201d if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t using these other countries as criteria for testing,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the U.S. wasn\u2019t using travel from European countries as criteria for testing, either. But it\u2019s worth noting, there weren\u2019t many confirmed cases in Europe in late February.\n\nA report by European researchers said that on Feb. 21 there were just 47 confirmed cases in nine European countries (not including another nine cases in the United Kingdom). Nearly two weeks later, on March 5, the number had grown significantly, to 4,250 cases, and 113 deaths, among 38 countries in the World Health Organization\u2019s European region.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s July report indicates that expanded testing \u2014 \u201cto include persons with any travel exposure\u201d and flu-like symptoms \u2014 could have aided public health officials in their decision-making and potentially reduced the community transmission.\n\nWe asked Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse whether the Trump administration could have done anything to stop the virus from coming to New York. He agreed that it\u2019s unlikely any policy could have stopped the introduction of the virus entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that New York, a crossroads of the world, would be at high risk, and we don\u2019t know which of the several introductions took root and which fizzled out,\u201d Morse said in an email. \u201cWith the type of genomic work described in the paper, it becomes more possible to make these distinctions now. Since we\u2019re not yet very good at foretelling the future, I think the data are very informative to us scientists, but the main goal should still be to stop spread and establishment of an infection as soon as we possibly can. Period.\u201d\n\nMorse said Cuomo and New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard A. Zucker \u201cdeserve the great credit they\u2019ve gotten for taking this seriously and usually acting accordingly, and communicating appropriately.\u201d But he also said he has been \u201cstunned and disheartened by the total lack of seriousness and urgency with which most western countries have treated this outbreak.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were numerous missed opportunities for the pandemic to be slowed or possibly even stopped,\u201d he said. Travel restrictions targeting Wuhan \u201cmight have had some value if carried out well\u201d and \u201c[v]ery early on.\u201d But once people infected with the virus had traveled to other places around the world, \u201csuch focused measures were no longer feasible.\u201d\n\nA testing and tracing policy is \u201cmore effective the earlier you can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWith more infections, and additional dispersion, the complexity of the work increases astronomically, and it\u2019s not really sustainable. \u2026 I would suggest, based on the current situation, we wouldn\u2019t be any better off now if the virus (even with all we know about it and all our tools) arrived today, instead of early 2020, and doubt we\u2019d be any more effective at stopping it.\u201d\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s clear from the CDC report that the U.S. travel restrictions did little to mitigate infections traced to Europe from spreading in New York City, and the report notes that limitations in testing ability \u201ccontributed to sustained community transmission.\u201d But Cuomo goes too far in claiming that the CDC said \u201cTrump is to blame for the virus coming to New York.\u201d The report did not say the virus could have been stopped from coming to New York entirely.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
