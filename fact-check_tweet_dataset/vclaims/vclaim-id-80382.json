The project will now be be implemented by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways through National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) under the EPC mode where the government bears the entire cost of the construction and pays the contractor.\n\nThe project is likely to take seven years to complete.", "lang": "en"}
