In the recent border clashes between India and China at the Galwan valley on 15 June 2020, twenty Indian soldiers had lost their lives. However, FACTLY has found the photo to be on the internet at least since 2016. The photo is found in the blog articles of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand that discussed rigorous training exercises in the military. FACTLY could not ascertain the exact context of the photo, but it is definitely not related to the recent faceoff with the Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Ladakh.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
