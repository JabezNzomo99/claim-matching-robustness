They were totally unfounded and amounted to a serious intervention in Hong Kong's affairs.\"\n\nThe UK and U.S. condemned the arrest of 15 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on April 18. They are charged with joining mass anti-government protests that lasted nearly six months in 2019.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the prosecutions violated the principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration: \u201cBeijing and its representatives in Hong Kong continue to take actions inconsistent with commitments made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration that include transparency, the rule of law, and guarantees that Hong Kong will continue to \u2018enjoy a high degree of autonomy\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration is the United Nations-backed treaty which laid the grounds for transition of power from the British Hong Kong government to the Hong Kong government and the foundations of the structure that has become known as \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d Under the treaty, which entered into force at midnight on June 30/July 1, 1997, China commits to refrain from imposing reforms on Hong Kong\u2019s social and economic systems and lifestyle, which, according to the document, \u201cwill remain unchanged for 50 years\u201d \u2013 that is, until 2047.\n\nHowever, the British and Chinese view the treaty differently.\n\nChina has said that the treaty with the UK over Hong Kong was a historical document that no longer had practical significance.\n\nHowever, Britain (backed by the U.N.) insists the treaty is legally binding and \u201ccontinues to remain in force \u2026 as valid today as it did when it was signed over thirty years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reject the Chinese Government\u2019s assertion that the joint declaration is an \u2018historic document\u2019, by which they mean that it is no longer valid, and that our rights and obligations under that treaty have ended. Our clear view is that the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984 obliges the Chinese Government to uphold Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, and its rights and freedoms, and we call on the Chinese Government to do so,\u201d said U.K. then-Minister for Europe and the Americas Alan Duncan during parliamentary debate in July 2019.\n\nBritain\u2019s Foreign Office said the recent arrests could \u201cinflame tensions\u201d and that the right to protest was \u201cfundamental to Hong Kong\u2019s way of life.\u201d\n\nReuters reported that among those arrested were leading Hong Kong opposition figures, including Democratic Party founder Martin Lee and media tycoon Jimmy Lai. The news agency described the move as a \u201cbiggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement\u201d since last year\u2019s protests.\n\nAccording the South China Morning Post, the Commissioner\u2019s Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong issued statements urging the British and U.S. governments to \"stop meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs,\" calling them China\u2019s internal matters. It also accused the UK Foreign Office of trying to \u201cwhitewash, condone and exonerate the anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAll 15 people arrested in Hong Kong on April 18 have been charged with joining the anti-government protests that began in March 2019 after Hong Kong\u2019s Security Bureau proposed amendments to extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. The protesters feared the law would allow China to prosecute Hong Kong political opponents.\n\nWhile the protests began peacefully, they turned more violent after the police fired rubber bullets and used a tear gas. Half a million people gathered on the streets of Hong Kong by June. The extradition bill was withdrawn in September, but the clashes between police and protesters continued.", "lang": "en"}
