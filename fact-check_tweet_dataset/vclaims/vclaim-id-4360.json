The story\u2019s wording remains identical across multiple websites, although some only include select phrases.\n\nMost of the story\u2019s content was taken from an October 2015 People magazine article about Bullock, who was promoting a new movie at the time. As of June 2018, copies of the story still included a line from the People article saying that Bullock held a press conference \u201cfor her new film, Our Brand Is Crisis, in Los Angeles last Friday.\u201d\n\nThat film, in which she plays a political consultant, was released about three years ago.\n\nIn addition to lifting sections from the People article, the unknown author added fabricated quotes from the actress.\n\nFor example, the story also claims Bullock said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like our current President, you can leave our country and never come back, especially you Hillary.\u201d\n\nWe found no record of her making that statement or other comments that would indicate she is a Trump supporter and hostile toward his critics, such as Hillary Clinton. A publicist for Bullock, Cheryl Maisel, also told us via email that \u201cMs. Bullock NEVER made [those] statements\u201d attributed to her in the viral story.\n\nThe People article even suggested that Bullock might not vote for Trump in the 2016 election because she didn\u2019t support comments he made about Mexican Americans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that at all,\u201d the magazine quoted her saying. \u201cThat was not a statement that I can get behind. I don\u2019t agree with that statement.\u201d\n\nHowever, IndieWire reported in October 2015 that Bullock did say at another event promoting \u201cOur Brand Is Crisis\u201d that she appreciates that Trump says what he is thinking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that he says it, so you know who you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSecretly, I don\u2019t want anyone to be advised, because I want to see who everyone truly is. The thing that makes him so engaging on television is the thing that, you know, might have gotten him derailed,\u201d IndieWire quoted Bullock saying. \u201cHe just says whatever he wants to say, so I\u2019m sure the strategist would say, \u2018You gotta put a plug in it at some point. Even if you feel that way, don\u2019t say it.'\u201d\n\nDuring the same panel discussion, Bullock claimed to not have any partisan leaning.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s Democratic or Republican, moderate or independent, I don\u2019t care \u2014 give me the best person to take care of our country and those who are already here,\u201d she said, according to IndieWire. \u201cThat\u2019s the person I want.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say whether that was Trump, Clinton or another candidate.\n\nUpdate, June 29: We updated this story with a comment from Bullock\u2019s publicist.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cJUST IN: Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: \u2018If you Don\u2019t Like Our President You can Leave And\u2026 .\u201d Americainfront.com. 27 Nov 2017.\n\n\u201cActress Sandra Bullock: \u2018Donald Trump Is Doing Everything To Improve Our Nation, If You Don\u2019t Like Him Just\u2026 .\u2019\u201d Whatpeopleneedtoknow.com. 13 Jun 2018.\n\nKimble, Lindsay. \u201cSandra Bullock Says Her Political Views Are Informed by What\u2019s Best For Her Son.\u201d People. 17 Oct 2015.", "lang": "en"}
