The claim is false; the image does not show the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s private residence in Bani Gala, a suburb of Islamabad; it shows an estate in the US which belonged to late shoe designer Vince Camuto.\n\nMultiple posts, for example this one published to Facebook on May 28, 2019, and shared more than 100 times since, contains an image showing a huge mansion labelled in English as \u201cImran Khan's house in Bani Gala\u201d.\n\nBani Gala is a neighbourhood in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, where Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s private residence is situated.\n\nHere is Khan\u2019s verified Twitter account; his house in Bani Gala is located here on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe image also includes text in Urdu that translates as: \u201cPakistan is the only country in the world where those who donate money live in a 2 marla house, while the one who takes donations lives in 400 kanal palace.\u201d\n\nMarla is a traditional unit of land; 2 marla is around 50 square metres. Kanal is also a unit of area; 400 kanal is around 202,000 square metres.\n\n\u201cThe one who takes donations\u201d is a reference to Khan, who used charitable donations to build two cancer hospitals in the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Peshawar in memory of his mother, who died of cancer.\n\nHere is the website of the Imran Khan Cancer Appeal and here is a report in Pakistani newspaper The News International, dated May 12, 2019, about a fundraising drive to provide free treatment to patients.\n\nThis Facebook post also contains the house photo without Urdu text on top with a caption which reads: \u201cImran Khan House - Bani Gala - worth 5 billion.\u201d The same photo and claim have also been posted on Twitter, for example in this post retweeted more than 400 times.\n\nThe house in the image, however, is not located in Pakistan.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found that the property is located in The Hamptons, a wealthy part of Long Island in the US state of New York, and belonged to late shoe designer Vince Camuto.\n\nHere is a screenshot of this photo gallery of the property published on the website of Forbes magazine, which contains the same photo used in the misleading Facebook post and tweet:\n\n\"The late shoe designer Vince Camuto's Water Mill, N.Y., estate is hitting the market at $72 million,\" says the description of the photo in the Forbes report.\n\nThe photo is dated 2013 and credited to \"AERIAL AESTHETICS &/OR BRUNO R. SCHRECK\".\n\nHere is another report on the property published by CNBC on May 31, 2017, which also contains video and photos that match the image in the misleading Facebook posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of photos of the mansion in Forbes photo gallery (L) and in the misleading Facebook post (R):\n\nBelow is a Google Earth screenshot of Khan\u2019s villa, showing significantly less landscaping and a pool which is located much farther away from the house than on the Hamptons estate:\n\nShown below is this AFP file photo of Khan\u2019s house dated January 8, 2015, a handout image distributed to press by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.\n\nIt shows Khan and his now ex-wife Reham Khan after their wedding in 2015. Enough of the house can be seen to show it is a different building than the one in the misleading posts:\n\nThe caption of the AFP photograph says: \u201cIn this handout photograph released by the Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party on January 8, 2015, Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan (L) and new wife Reham Khan pose for a photograph during their wedding ceremony at his house in Islamabad.\n\n\u201cPakistani opposition leader Imran Khan wed a TV journalist in a simple ceremony at his Islamabad home January 8, ending years of speculation surrounding the former playboy cricketer widely considered his country's most eligible man.
