Speaking at a rally at Pratapgarh on May 4, 2019, Modi said, \u201cYour father may have been declared Mr. Clean by his courtiers. But he died as Bhrashtachari No.1 (Corrupt No. 1),\u201d addressing the sentence to Congress President Rahul Gandhi.\n\nBOOM reached out to Matondkar via a text message.\n\nWhile BOOM couldn't find any news report attributing the viral quote to Urmila Matondkar, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on May 6, 2019 called the prime minister mentally unstable for his 'bhrastachari' jibe at Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nBaghel had described Modi's comment on Rajiv Gandhi highly condemnable and said that the 'PM has lost his mental balance and needs medication'. Read the story here.\n\n\u201cThe PM\u2019s remark on Rajiv ji is highly condemnable. No one can even imagine that a person of the stature of prime minister would make such a derogatory remark about a person who is not alive and was a respectable political figure. It shows the PM has lost his mental balance and needs medication,\u201d Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times.", "lang": "en"}
