The subjects of marriage and weddings are a common target of such ruminations, as they\u2019re associated with many centuries-old rituals that are arcane to modern audiences.\n\nOne such example is a popular meme that seemingly explains why marriage engagements traditionally begin with the one initiating the proposal\u2019s offering up a ring from a kneeling position:\n\nOn this subject, however, this particular meme is just a bit of humor. One searches in vain to find any references in Norse languages or mythology that links the phrase \u2018took an arrow in the knee\u2019 to the concept of marriage, or that ties any form of injury to the tradition of getting down upon bended knee to propose to a prospective spouse.\n\nThe phrase \u201cI took an arrow in the knee\u201d is actually of fairly recent vintage, a line popularized by the role-playing video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, as noted by the Know Your Meme web site:\n\nIn The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the town guard non-player characters (NPCs) have several stock lines they will repeat when the player walks near them, including a bewildered statement about \u201ccurved swords\u201d, a patronizing statement about \u201csweetroll\u201d theft, and the melancholy reminiscing of the past \u201cI used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee.\u201d The repetition of this stock line throughout the game led the players to reference it in gaming forums and imageboards.\n\nWhere did the tradition of getting down upon\u2019s one knee to propose marriage come from, then? No definitive historical explanation exists, but as many sources have posited, the practice is likely related to customs involving kneeling as a demonstrative act of both supplication and respect, two aspects that a spouse-to-be would likely do well to exhibit to a potential mate:\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, chivalry was not yet dead and formal courtship was the medieval version of modern-day dating. Kneeling was also the protocol for many ceremonial rituals and rites of passage, including those of the romantic kind. Medieval artwork and literature shows knights genuflecting before their feudal lord as a sign of honor and respect, or kneeling in front of a noblewoman to express their eternal servitude and admiration in a show of \u201ccourtly love.\u201d But medieval rituals aren\u2019t the only possible explanation; religion may play a role as well. Many faiths, like Christianity and Islam, have their worshippers kneel in prayer to express their devoted service and everlasting respect for their God. Today, kneeling has connotations of complete submission, giving yourself to the mercy of the other person who has the power to do whatever the heck they like. So when we propose in this way, we\u2019re showing that we truly trust our partner, and that we\u2019re completely committed to intertwining our life with theirs. It\u2019s also a respectful thing, which is nice, and shows that we\u2019re willing to break down our walls (as kneeling is placing yourself in a vulnerable position with all power to the person standing) and be truly intimate.\n\nIn short, offering a ring upon bended knee to propose marriage is a symbolic manner of expressing a fervent desire for a positive response, and of demonstrating that your beloved is deserving of your honor, respect, and love \u2014 not because of an old arrow injury.", "lang": "en"}
