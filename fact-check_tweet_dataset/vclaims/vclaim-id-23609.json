A video with a similar claim has spread like wildfire on social media.\n\nThe video shows a boy being beaten by his friends. A cake was also seen in the video. It is being claimed that the boy who is seen being beaten up in the video is the birthday boy and in the name of birthday bumps, he was thrashed by his friends so badly that he suffered injuries and died.\n\n'Birthday bumps' are a kind of birthday wishes in which the person celebrating his/her birthday is held by their arms and legs and are given kicks.\n\nMany people including Virender Sehwag, news channel TV9 Telugu shared this video. It has been claimed that the boy passed away.\n\nThe video has been shared in thousands and netizens have started reacting on boy\u2019s death.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found in the investigation that the death claim is wrong. India Today spoke directly to the boy and he is absolutely fine.\n\nOn Virender Sehwag\u2019s tweet, a Twitter user Raghuraj Singh commented that this is fake news.\n\nRaghuraj wrote that the boy, beaten up in the video, is the student of his college and he is absolutely fine. After this, Virender Sehwag deleted his tweet.\n\nIn order to know the truth of this video, we started searching for the same Raghuraj, who commented on Sehwag\u2019s tweet.\n\nFrom the Facebook profile of Raghuraj, we came to know that he studies in a college located in the capital of Kyrgyzstan - Bishkek. We tried to contact him but he didn\u2019t reply to our messages.\n\nOn Raghuraj's Facebook profile, we found a group photo, in which Raghuraj, with his college mates, was present. One of them was a person named Deepak Aanjna. We reached out to Deepak Aanjna and talked to him.\n\nDeepak Aanjna confirmed that the boy who was being beaten up in the video is his college mate but the news of his death is merely a rumour. With the help of Deepak, we spoke with the boy in the video.\n\nHe told us that this incident happened in December 2018 when he was celebrating his birthday and his friends gave him birthday bumps.\n\nThe boy is in stress since the video went viral. The college authority is also investigating this matter. On his request to not make his identity public, India Today is not disclosing the name of the boy and his college.\n\nThe boy is himself telling the people on social media that the news of his death is false.\n\nThere is no doubt that such type of celebrations could be very dangerous to any person.", "lang": "en"}
