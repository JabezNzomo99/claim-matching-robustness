Clapper Jr., who was director of national intelligence during the Obama years, said on CNN. \u201cIn all the deliberations that I participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with Chairman Kim. That\u2019s news to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrossing into North Korea, that is something you would imagine the president would do after we got all the nukes out of North Korea and we signed a peace treaty,\u201d Cha said on MSNBC. \u201cThe one thing that\u2019s different this time \u2014 it\u2019s not the lifting of sanctions; we\u2019ve done that before \u2014 the one thing that\u2019s different this time is this bromance, this effort to try to really gain Kim Jong Un\u2019s trust. Dictators generally don\u2019t trust anybody, so I\u2019m not really quite certain whether this bromance diplomacy is really going to lead to a denuclearization agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the Pentagon when Kim Jong Un came to power. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate at all,\u201d Bash said. \u201cIn fact, in the three summits \u2014 in Singapore, in Hanoi and now at the DMZ \u2014 the president has put Kim Jong Un on the world stage. He\u2019s delivered a major propaganda victory. And again, my concern is: If it\u2019s harmless, okay. It could be harmful if they don\u2019t actually deliver results.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen senior government officials traveled to North Korea to retrieve imprisoned Americans . . . we would have been open to them being received by Kim Jong Un,\u201d Russel said. As a former president, Bill Clinton traveled to North Korea in 2010 to retrieve hostages and was received by Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader at the time, Russel said. Jimmy Carter was received by Kim Il Sung during his visit in 1994, he added.\n\n\u201cBut never did the Obama administration propose or request a meeting with Kim Jong Un,\u201d Russel said. \u201cWe understood that it would have had tremendous value for the North Korean leader, but would have had value for the United States and the world only if the substantive groundwork had been laid through tough-minded and sustained nuclear negotiations.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
