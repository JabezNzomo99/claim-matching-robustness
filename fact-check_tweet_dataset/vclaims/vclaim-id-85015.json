According to the message, the actor is justifying the death of those who were killed in the communal violence that erupted in Kasganj, U.P on Republic day. The quote attributed to him says, \u201cIt was Jumma (friday) on 26th January. Had Hindus not taken tiranga march through muslim majority area of Kasganj and raised provocative slogans like Vande Mataram they couldn\u2019t have been killed\u201d.\n\nThus according to this quote, Akhtar is justifying the death of the Hindu victim in the clash at Kasganj. He also apparently calls \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 a provocative slogan.\n\nGaurav Pradhan, who tweeted about this, is a repeat offender. He has been caught spreading fake news in the past as well. He is among those who are followed on twitter by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Pradhan tweeted the image with the stamp of Postcard News on it. Postcard News is a leading purveyor of fake news with the objective of inciting communal hatred, and has been exposed on earlier occasions by Alt News.\n\nThe said quote is viral on twitter and on facebook, and is being shared in number of pages and groups where Akhtar is described as a \u2018jihadi\u2019.\n\nAkhtar came out with a clarification, tweeting that he had never said what is being attributed to him by nefarious elements on social media and urged his fans and followers to be cautious about what and what not to believe on social media.\n\nGaurav Pradhan deleted his tweet after Akhtar\u2019s clarification. However, instead of an unqualified apology, Pradhan sought to justify his act, indulging in whataboutery.\n\nThe far-right ecosystem on social media is known to spread mischievous and misleading information time and again, despite being exposed repeatedly. The incessant nature of their campaign is directed at keeping communal tension high, seeking to divide communities through provocative content. Farhan Akhtar is only the latest victim of this malicious propaganda.", "lang": "en"}
