Aiming to call attention to what he viewed as unnecessary business closures and stay-at-home orders in the U.S. during the pandemic, he took to Twitter to highlight the rate at which people were dying from COVID-19 in New York City \u2014 the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak \u2014 compared to other major cities globally, specifically Tokyo. On April 25, 2020, he tweeted:\n\nHis assertion accurately makes the point that Japan is not under compulsory lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. Rather, it is under a state of emergency, which empowers officials to request that residents stay home and businesses close. But \u2014since the country\u2019s post-World War II constitution bars officials from enforcing Wuhan-style shutdowns in the name of protecting residents\u2019 civil liberties \u2014 government leaders cannot punish citizens if they don\u2019t follow the recommendations on social distancing.\n\nThe day following the viral tweet, McAfee again authored claims that were similar in nature \u2014 posts that compared New York City\u2019s pace of death to the average rate of large cities worldwide including Delhi and Mexico City \u2014 aiming to raise suspicion among his followers of the U.S. governments\u2019 rationale for, as he put it, \u201cshutting down and destroying the economies of the world.\u201d Even Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in on the campaign, tweeting:\n\nMcAfee made several claims in his tweets, but we are focusing on whether New York\u2019s death rate was truly 250 times \u201chigher\u201d than Tokyo\u2019s as of April 25, 2020, and whether that pace increased over the following week.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note at the start that this is a thorny comparison for a couple reasons: The cities\u2019 populations vary depending on what geographic areas you consider, the regions\u2019 processes for COVID-19 testing are different, and it\u2019s unknown to what extent those testing practices influence government-compiled death tolls.\n\nOn May 1, Snopes reached out to McAfee to ask how he reached the calculation in the above-displayed tweet, and he answered with a phone call, emails, and direct messages on Twitter. One correspondence read:\n\nTo calculate the rate at which the novel coronavirus is killing in New York City, McAfee said he considered the metro\u2019s population to be 8 million. (2018 census data show 8,398,748 New York residents.) But for Tokyo\u2019s population, he said he used a population size of 23 million \u2014 a number that apparently includes not only people living within the city\u2019s official boundaries (about 9.2 million) but also residents in surrounding jurisdictions.\n\nThat\u2019s a step where the calculating gets murky. Like McAfee, the United Nations also measures Tokyo\u2019s population as the sum of the entire metro area. But the U.N. documented more than 37 million residents as of 2018, not 23 million.\n\nFrom that point, McAfee said he divided his estimates for the cities\u2019 populations by their total of COVID-19 deaths, respectively, and then compared the two death rates.\n\nWhile repeating that step for Snopes on May 1, he used about 13,000 for the number of deaths in New York City and about 97 deaths in Tokyo, totaling one COVID-19 death per 615 people in New York City and one death per roughly 237,000 people in Tokyo. Using that math by McAfee, as of May 1, New York City\u2019s rate of death was about 385 times higher than Tokyo.\n\nBut to check his work, we first analyzed the New York City Health Department (NYC Health) criteria for counting fatalities. In March, when the department tallied the city\u2019s first handful of deaths, it only considered fatalities of people who had tested positive for COVID-19 via a laboratory-sponsored test. That meant that, initially, patients who died at home and didn\u2019t seek medical treatment were not included in the statistics. But in mid-April, the health department changed its system and also began tracking fatalities of people who had showed symptoms of COVID-19 but were never tested for it.\n\nAs of April 25, the day of McAfee\u2019s viral tweet, NYC Health reported 17,393 deaths total, including both types of fatalities: people who had officially tested positive and those who medical examiners had determined \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or the equivalent as their cause of death. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government documented less than 120 deaths.\n\nUsing those numbers and population estimates via the U.S. census and United Nations, NYC\u2019s rate of COVID-19 deaths was almost 640 times greater than Tokyo\u2019s as of April 25.\n\nBut, for several reasons, people should not take the government-compiled death tolls at face value. For one, the pace at which all local jurisdictions, whether in the U.S. or not, report deaths varies. Medical examiners can take days or weeks to process death certificates and compile that information for public records. Referring to the worldwide COVID-19 casualty count, Tim Riffe, a demographer at Germany\u2019s Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, told The New York Times:\n\nAdditionally, cities and countries have different criteria for administering COVID-19 tests, and residents in some locations have greater access to the testing compared to others. In Japan, officials have decided against widespread testing for COVID-19, \u201cinstead focusing on targeting clusters of infection when they appear in an effort to snuff out any further spread,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAs of May 5, Tokyo had tested roughly 12,500 people for COVID-19 and about 4,700 of them were positive, according to the city\u2019s government, which is publishing its updates via an interactive web page. (For perspective, about 901,000 New York residents had been tested within roughly the same window.) In addition to excluding potential patients who are returning to the country via cruises or charter flights, the Tokyo statistics do not include people who showed mild-to-moderate symptoms \u2014 a shortness of breath, coughing or fever \u2014 and might have tested positive for COVID-19 if they had a test.\n\nProfessor Kenji Shibuya, who leads King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institution of Population Health, told BBC that from a physician\u2019s viewpoint, Japan\u2019s approach to testing makes sense: \u201cForget about mild cases, focus on cases with major symptoms and save lives. Focus testing on those who have symptoms.\u201d\n\nBut it also means the total number of infections in the country, including in Tokyo, are likely far greater than what public health officials are reporting and do not lend themselves to an apples-to-apples comparison with other cities, such as New York City.\n\nWhat\u2019s undetermined is to what extent the differences in testing for COVID-19 between Tokyo and New York impact their death tolls. In other words, it\u2019s unclear how many people in each city have been fatally infected with the novel coronavirus yet do not appear in government-certified mortality statistics, whether because they didn\u2019t seek medical help or didn\u2019t receive a COVID-19 test.\n\nIn the interview with Snopes, McAfee agreed: No one quite knows the exact number of infections in both places, and so accurately calculating the rate of disease is impossible. But he argued that tabulating the rate of COVID-19 deaths is a different story, since he believes government officials, especially in Japan, are tracking and publicly releasing every COVID-19 death. He said:\n\nWhether or not it \u201ccannot happen\u201d (as McAfee claims) that COVID-19 patients in Tokyo have died without being included in the public death toll, the disparity between the death rate per population in Tokyo versus New York is large enough that it\u2019s unlikely any corrections to the basic data could negate it entirely. The nagging question is why the disparity exists and what it really tells us. McAfee leaps to the suggestion that there is \u201csomething fishy here,\u201d implying nefarious reasons for the disparity, but a serious analysis would require more and better data, and consideration within the wider context of drastically varying COVID-19 mortality rates across all major regions.", "lang": "en"}
