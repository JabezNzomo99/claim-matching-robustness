There\u2019s no record of a \u201cFederal Election Integrity Program\u201d ever existing.\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a measure that affords some non-citizens the right to vote in school board elections in 2018, reported the Los Angeles Times. In response, some social media users posted images with misleading claims about the measure, suggesting that California should lose its voting rights and congressional representatives as a penalty.\n\n\u201cNow that California is registering non-citizens to vote and has refused to Cooperate with the Federal Election Integrity Program, all votes from California should be nullified and Federal Representatives from the State be removed from Congress for the benefit of all the states,\u201d claims one such post.\n\nThat local ordinance, however, only allows non-citizens who are of legal voting age and are the parent, guardian or caregiver of a child living in the city to vote in school board elections, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections. It does not permit them to vote in any other elections.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that California refuses to comply with the \u201cFederal Election Integrity Program\u201d doesn\u2019t hold up either \u2013 the program does not appear to exist.
