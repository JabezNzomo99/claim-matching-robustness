She is an anchor baby, mother is from India, father is Jamaican, and neither were American citizens at time of her birth.\n\n That means the Presidency would fall on Speaker of the house. Recently Nancy Pelosi stated that she was next in line to become President. THAT in itself is reason to vote her out in November.\n\n Democrats have worked the whole scenario out and I believe that is why they chose Kamala Harris. Voter fraud is in the works to get Nancy Pelosi as President.\n\n Cast your votes carefully in November, TRUMP as our President, or USA will become a third world country,\u201d the post read.\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the posts and found the claim to be false.\n\nAs a part of our investigation, we checked the pre-requisites for becoming a Presidential candidate in the US.\n\nOn the official US Govt website, we found the following:\n\u2022 At least 35 years old and\n\u2022 A U.S. resident (permanently lives in the U.S.) for at least 14 years\n\nWe then found that according to the \u201814th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Civil Rights (1868)\u2019, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nWe then checked and found that Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, US.\n\nAccording to the 14th Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause, she is a natural-born American citizen and hence is very much eligible to be the President of the United States.\n\nHence, the claim being made in the viral post is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
