If not that, what is the core of the law?\"\n\nFor this fact-check, we will take a stab at quantifying the steps the law set out to do so we can determine if, as Will said, most of the law has been waived or suspended.\n\nThere have been a number of modest administrative changes, including giving people an extra week to sign-up for coverage to begin in January and giving insurance companies an extra month at the end of next year to set premiums.\n\nThere have also been some significant alterations.\n\nThis summer, Obama delayed by a year a requirement that all companies with 50 or more employees provide their workers health care coverage.\n\nAnd in the fall, when a wave of cancellation notices appeared in the mailboxes of Americans who bought coverage directly from insurance companies, Obama gave states the option to let people stay on those plans through next year -- even though the plans did not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn some ways, the move this week was a way to supplement that relief for people who wanted more options.\n\nOf all the changes, the most recent one seems likely to touch the most lives. Obama said his staff estimated that about might want a high-deductible, catastrophic plan. We have seen credible estimates that about 4 million people saw their plans canceled but some have now found replacement coverage. In reality, we won\u2019t know the full scope of this policy shift for several months.\n\nThe next-biggest impact stems from the delay in the employer mandate. Analysts with the RAND Corporation, a respected, independent research group, recently estimated that about would have coverage as a result.\n\nWhile these figures are only estimates, they show that the changes -- while perhaps significant -- affect only a small portion of people in the health insurance market.\n\nAbout 365,000 people purchased insurance through the federal marketplace and another 800,000 were found eligible for Medicaid, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obama said another 500,000 people had signed up for health insurance in December.\n\nOther parts of the law are affecting many more Americans.\n\nThe law added about to their parent\u2019s health care plans. A requirement that insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of every premium dollar on actual health care affected the health care policies of about 77 million people in 2012, . That resulted in about $3.4 billion in rebates, coverage adjustments or policy enhancements.\n\nStarting in 2011, the became more generous. More than 35 million people participate in that program.\n\nLooking at the individual mandate, the , a Washington academic policy group, estimated that it would hit about 18 million people. That dwarfs the 500,000 the administration believes will take advantage of the catastrophic coverage option.\n\nWith all the talk about problems with the health care law, it\u2019s easy to forget just how many corners of health insurance policy the law affects.\n\nWill seemed guilty of that on Fox News Sunday when he said most of the law has been waived or suspended. Obama has made at least two major course corrections in the law. He delayed the employer mandate by one year and allowed individuals dealing with canceled plans to buy insurance that fails to meet minimum standards under the law.\n\nOne way to put these changes into context is to look at the number of people they affect. While precise data are missing, the combined impact could be in the range of 1 million Americans.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, 3.1 million young adults have gained access to coverage through the law, another 18 million people are subject to the individual mandate and millions more have benefited from requirements that health insurance companies spend premiums on care.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
