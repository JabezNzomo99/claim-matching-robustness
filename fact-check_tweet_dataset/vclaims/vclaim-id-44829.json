The claim is misleading; Sri Lankan health experts say the patient's recovery is insufficient evidence that the country has eradicated the virus, as the \u201cpossibility for other infected patients\u201d remains; they also urged the public to continue following government recommendations for prevention.\n\nThe image was shared here on Facebook on February 2, 2020.\n\nThe Sinhala-language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cSri Lanka becomes the first country in the world to completely eradicate the coronavirus!\n\n\u201cDoctors inform the virus has been completely removed from the Chinese woman who was infected. / Our gratitude to the doctors and nurses who were dedicated to this.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed at least 425 and infected more than 20,000 people in China as of February 4, 2020, as stated in this AFP report. Scientists believe it originated at a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in early December 2019, and has since spread to at least 24 countries worldwide.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nSri Lanka confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on January 27, 2020 -- a Chinese woman from Hubei province. According to this latest situation report by Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Health, dated February 3, 2020, one confirmed novel coronavirus patient had \"now fully recovered\" but remained under the care of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and twenty other suspected cases were \"under surveillance\".\n\nA similar misleading claim was shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; Sri Lankan health experts say the coronavirus patient's recovery is insufficient evidence that Sri Lanka has eradicated the virus as the \u201cpossibility for other infected patients\u201d remains due to the incubation period. Experts urged the public to continue to follow government recommendations for prevention.\n\nA registrar at Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau, Dr. Ashan Pathirana told AFP during a telephone conversation on January 3, 2020 that it would be a \u201ca grave misrepresentation of facts\u201d to claim Sri Lanka has become the world\u2019s first country to eradicate the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to say with certainty that Sri Lanka has eradicated novel coronavirus because there is a possibility for other infected patients to be reported in the coming days, considering the natural history of this infection,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that symptoms of the novel coronavirus may appear as long as eight days after exposure.\n\n\u201cTherefore we urge the public to refrain from taking the situation lightly and ensure they follow all precautions issued by the Ministry of Health to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission, until otherwise told,\u201d he added.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued this fact sheet of guidelines following the outbreak of novel coronavirus in the country.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the government release:", "lang": "en"}
