In June last year Victoria had 7666 prisoners, a seven per cent increase from 2017 - the second largest rise behind NSW, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The state also has Australia\u2019s third largest adult prisoner population at 18 per cent and 50 per cent (3846 prisoners) of Victoria\u2019s inmates have previously been imprisoned under sentence. [2]\n\nFor prison spending Victoria is above the national average of $109,821 and the fourth-most expensive prison system in the OECD, according to the Institute for Public Affairs. Victoria spends $131,400 per prisoner each year with only Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands spending more on each inmate, data from 2015 showed. [3]\n\nA shortage of public housing has become a national policy issue. Last year a report by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute found decades of inadequate investment has left Australia a shortfall of 433,000 social houses and units with 36,000 needed yearly over the next two decades to meet the future need. [4]\n\nA Productivity Commission report in 2018 found the Victorian government spent an annual $82 per person on social housing, less than half the national average. As of June 2018 there were 82,500 people on the state's public housing list, which was growing by 500 names each month. The report from the Victorian parliament's Legal and Social Issues Committee report noted that more than 60 per cent of the state's public housing was more than 30 years old, with around 20 per cent of stock more than 50 years old. [5] [6]\n\nIn 2019-20 state budget the Andrews Labor government allocated $1.8 billion extra funds to build and upgrade Victoria\u2019s prison facilities, a commitment that Mr Pallas announced in his budget speech on May 27. In the same speech, Mr Pallas also committed $209 million more to build 1000 new public housing properties. [7]\n\nBased on these numbers, the Victorian government has announced 8.6 times more fresh funding for prisons than public housing.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Ms Ratnam\u2019s claim the Victorian budget includes 10 times more new spending for prisons than public housing is mostly true, however she has rounded the figure of 8.6 up to 10 rather than nine.", "lang": "en"}
