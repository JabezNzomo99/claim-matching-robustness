On the other hand, another friend accepted that she disseminated fake news when the facts were presented to her and immediately issued a correction on the misleading post. In both the cases, evidence was provided along with fact-checked stories, but the two people reacted differently. Let\u2019s explore the reason behind this difference.\n\nIn the current times, when things are so \u201cunpredictable and negative,\u201d people tend to get dissuaded with all kinds of information, Havovi Hyderabadwalla, clinical and forensic psychologist and co-founder at Mind Mandala told The Quint. \u201cWe sort of get addicted to the negative media. So, even if I am being told that I am wrong, you kind of get dissuaded because of the content,\u201d Hyderabadwalla said. A New Yorker article published in 2017 mentioned that Stanford researchers noted even after the evidence \u201cfor their beliefs have been totally refuted, people fail to make appropriate revisions in those beliefs.\u201d COVID-19 Misinformation Is Keeping Fact-Checkers on Their Toes Now, let\u2019s look at why people do not alter their beliefs even after being exposed to evidences. Dr Kamna Chibber, clinical psychologist and head of mental health, department of mental health and behavioural science, Fortis La Femme, said that it depends on how strongly one believes or has an opinion on that particular piece of information. \u201cSo, when somebody comes with a very strong belief system and a pre-existing thought process, then, of course, it is very hard for them to just accept that the information they have been believing is completely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u2018When a Belief is Called Out, Some Take it as a Personalised Attack\u2019 Further, while speaking to The Quint, Dr Kamna explained that for people who have held on to some belief for a long time, it starts becoming a part of their own sense of self. \u201cWhen something gets very closely associated with your own sense of self, and when another person disputes it, it almost feels as though it is a very personalised attack, and people are not necessarily able to segregate that,\u201d she added. Describing the consequences of what people see as a personalised attack, she said that then they find it harder to let go of it and hold on to it even more strongly, \u201cbecome defensive and offensive to protect their viewpoints.\u201d How Much Do Fact-Checks Actually Help? The Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organisation based in Washington, conducted a research by surveying nearly 500 Americans and classified the people under different categories:\n\u2022 Informed: People who were confident about a particular fact\n\u2022 Uninformed: People who know that they do not have the complete facts\n\u2022 Misinformed: People who are confident that they knows the facts but are actually mistaken\n\u2022 Ambiguously informed: People who admitted that they were only guessing and were not sure about the facts The study observed that the \u201cinformed\u201d ones were the most likely to be \u201cinformed\u201d even after going through a fact-check, while the \u201cmisinformed\u201d ones were \u201cthe least helped by reading a fact-check.\u201d Further, the study mentioned that the \u201cmisinformed\u201d people, even after reading a fact check, \u201care still more likely than not to choose the incorrect answer about the fact in question.\u201d While all the other categories were less likely to go for an incorrect response. \u2018Cathy Rolanova\u2019 \u2013 The Many Lies of a Self-Proclaimed OSINT Expert\n\nMisinformation vs Disinformation: How Likely Are You to Comply? As the coronavirus outbreak gripped the world in early 2020, there was an upsurge in misinformation pertaining to its origin, causes, possible cures and effects, that kept the fact-checkers on their toes. Regarding the impact of virality of the content, Havovi Hyderabadwalla said, \u201cIf a person has received an image or a video from ten different people, maybe their own opinion is that ten people cannot be wrong. But they don\u2019t realise that, in current times, ten people can be wrong because information is being spread really really fast.\u201d A Harvard study asked citizens of the US, UK, Netherlands and Germany to tell the extent to which they experienced misinformation or disinformation regarding COVID-19. Misinformation is when people share information without knowing what they are sharing is inaccurate, while disinformation is sharing misleading content intentionally.\n\n\u201cThose who experienced misinformation were willing to seek further information and to comply with official guidelines. Individuals perceiving more disinformation \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 were less willing to seek additional information and reported lower willingness to comply with official guidelines,\u201d the study noted. Commenting on the results of this study, Dr Kamna said, \u201cThis makes sense because your intent will come from a belief system. When you already have a pre-existing thought process and then you are intentionally putting forth certain information because you believe it will lead to certain behaviour on the part of others around you, and you are doing this in a very conscious and intentional way, of course , your resistance for modifying it, is going to be very very high.\u201d\n\nHigh Trust Factor Leads to More Misinformation on WhatsApp In this year\u2019s edition of 'Global Fact 7' conference organised by the International Fact-Checking Network, Edwin Tallam, PhD candidate, Moi University mentioned that \u201cclose working relationships\u201d are seen on WhatsApp. While elaborating on his research on \u2018Elements influencing trust in online news consumption in Kenya,\u2019 he said, \u201cWhen it comes to WhatsApp, it means that young people in this context have the contacts and put out a close working relationship with the contacts and because of that, when it comes to sharing information, they tend to trust information shared by, maybe, very close friends within their WhatsApp groups and even directly through WhatsApp messaging application as compared to information received through other public platforms.\u201d Commenting on Edwin\u2019s study, Dimitra Dimitrakopoulou, visiting assistant professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said that the findings also demonstrate that people trust each other more than they trust media and social institutions. Meanwhile, corroborating with the findings, Ritvvij Parrikh, Knight fellow with the International Centre for Journalists, in his own research on \u2018Understanding cognition and how it makes misinformation persuasive in WhatsApp,\u2019 co-authored by Nidhi Nair and Shubham Dwivedi, found that the trust of the sender in the recipient gets transferred to the message. \u201cEvery time a message comes and the recipient of the message trusts the sender, the message is seen as more trustworthy,\u201d he said. He further mentioned that cognition happens in stages and if a message is considered persuasive, it does not trigger doubt in the mind of the recipient.", "lang": "en"}
