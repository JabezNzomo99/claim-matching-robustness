Subsequently, on October 29th, Zamfara is currently absent from said records.\n\nOn Monday, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state said that the United States of America removed Zamfara from the list of terrorist states, a week prior.\n\nHe added that he would not hesitate to \u201ctake drastic action\u201d against any person or group who \u201ctries to undermine the security arrangements\u201d- put in place by his government.\n\nOur findings led to a December 2017 advisory from the U.S. Embassy Consulate. The statement advised against travel to certain high-risk states in Nigeria \u2013 Zamfara included. The report surmised this to the unpredictable nature of Boko Haram as well as poor transportation infrastructure within said states.\n\nSubsequently, on October 29th, the United States of America (USA) via its official website gave some travel advice to its citizens to avoid certain areas and states of Nigeria. This was due to the high level of insecurity in those areas. Zamfara which was present in the previous listing remained absent in this succeeding record.\n\nIn the same vein, further search showed that the United Kingdom had also issued the same travel warning to its citizens. This was done through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on September 11th.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
