But the stories make no references to dates, so it\u2019s easy for websites to keep reposting them to exploit racial tension.\n\nThe hoax was first published by two different websites, each with its own version.\n\nA website called Now 8 News ran a story with the headline, \u201cLos Angeles Police: 12 White Female Bodies in Garage Freezer Tagged, \u2018Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the now defunct Empire Herald website set the scene in Chicago and used a different body count its story headlined, \u201cMan Arrested After Police Find 19 White Female Bodies In Freezers With \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 Carved Into Skin.\u201d\n\nLater, the killings were reimagined to have happened in Greenville, North Carolina, according to a version posted in August 2017 on a website called Tweeterest USA.\n\nAnd the Chicago version of the story is now making the rounds on Facebook after it was published Dec. 31 on thefirstamerica.com.\n\nSeveral users of the social media site have flagged it as being potentially false. It is.\n\nBut others were less skeptical. A comment posted under a version of the story that ran on a site called Bored Star said: \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is wrong with these sick bastards! Black, white, whatever color! We all matter!! You black people think your better??? Well you are very very ignorant & and sick, very sick!!!!!\u201d Another commenter asked, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t this on CNN?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t reported by CNN, or any other reputable news organization, because the story was completely fabricated.\n\nBuried at the bottom of the Empire Herald\u2019s \u201cterms of service\u201d page was a short notice that said: \u201cMuch of the content contain [sic] on our website is consider [sic] satirical in nature unless otherwise specified.\u201d\n\nIn fact, one of the only details given in its story is the name of an officer at the alleged crime scene. But there is no \u201cLt. Kyle Jennings\u201d on the police force, Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Patrick McGinnis told FactCheck.org.\n\nThe pictures that ran with the story also are unrelated. One photo shows police at a residential crime scene from years ago, and another shows a rusty old freezer that has been used in online stories since at least 2009 in several languages.\n\nSimilarly, the Los Angeles version of the story that was published on Now 8 News also featured unrelated photos. One is the mugshot of Shandell Willingham, who was charged with rape in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2015. The other shows Los Angeles County officials removing a refrigerator containing a man\u2019s body from an illegal marijuana growing operation the same year.\n\nNow 8 News doesn\u2019t include any kind of disclaimer explaining that it isn\u2019t an actual news site, and its name is very close to that of the real CBS affiliate TV station in Las Vegas that goes by 8 News Now.\n\nUnlike the Empire Herald, which has ceased operating, Now 8 News is still publishing false stories. The phone number listed on its \u201ccontact us\u201d page doesn\u2019t work.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cMan Arrested After Police Find 19 White Female Bodies In Freezers With \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 Carved Into Skin.\u201d EmpireHerald.com. 22 Feb 2016.\n\n\u201cPOLICE FIND 19 WHITE FEMALE BODIES IN FREEZERS WITH \u2018BLACK LIVES MATTER\u2019 CARVED INTO SKIN.\u201d TheFirstAmerica.com. 31 Dec 2017.\n\nPfeffer, Allison. \u201cMother charged with trading sex with daughter, 11, for heroin.\u201d WKRC Cincinnati. 23 Mar 2015.", "lang": "en"}
