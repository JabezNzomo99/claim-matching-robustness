You better fix this s**t!\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Clinton making the statement in her publicly available emails or elsewhere. The quote may be a variation of a line from a 2016 article published by the website Victurus Libertas.\n\nVariations of the claim have been circulating on social media since at least 2016. This viral meme, which has been shared more than 2,800 times, alleges that Clinton sent a profanity-laced email presumably about her 2016 political rival Donald Trump to Brazile Oct. 17, 2016.\n\n\u201cIf that f**kin bastard wins, we\u2019re all going to hang from nooses!\u201d reads the purported email to Brazile. \u201cYou better fix this s**t!\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks released thousands of emails from Clinton, her campaign manager John Podesta and the DNC during the 2016 election cycle. Yet, while the leaked emails provide access to her communications, there is no record of Clinton ever sending or receiving an email containing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post.\n\nAn internet search revealed no credible media outlets linking the statement to Clinton either. (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Once Say She Wanted Trump To Run For Office?)\n\nThe alleged statement, previously debunked by Snopes, may be a variation of a quote that appeared in a 2016 article on Victurus Libertas, a website described by The New York Times as a \u201cconspiracy-minded news site that suggests, among other things, that the Titanic was deliberately sunk and that the queen of England is a reptilian alien.\u201d\n\nThis particular article claims that Clinton lost her temper with NBC employees after participating in a 2016 presidential candidate forum hosted by Matt Lauer, an anchor for the network at the time. At one point, she allegedly yelled, \u201cIf I lose, we all go down and that Fascist F**k will have us swinging from nooses!\u201d\n\nThe article credits Politico as the source of the quote, though the statement appears nowhere in the cited article. In fact, the Politico article doesn\u2019t mention Clinton losing her temper at all.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the statement in the Facebook post got linked to Brazile.", "lang": "en"}
