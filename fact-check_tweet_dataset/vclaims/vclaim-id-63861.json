The businessman and former presidential candidate tested positive for COVID-19 in late June, according to his Twitter account, and had been hospitalized for roughly four weeks for treatment at the time of his passing.\n\nThe image falsely alleges that Cain died from liver and colon cancer, despite a statement on his website and Twitter account saying he died from COVID-19 complications. (RELATED: Does The Swab For A COVID-19 Test Take A Sample From The Blood-Brain Barrier?)\n\n\u201cAlthough he was basically pretty healthy in recent years, he was still in a high-risk group because of his history with cancer,\u201d reads the statement on his website, in part. \u201cWe all prayed so hard every day. We knew the time would come when the Lord would call him home, but we really liked having him here with us, and we held out hope he\u2019d have a full recovery.\u201d\n\nCain was diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer in 2006 but recovered from it. Multiple media outlets reported that Cain\u2019s cause of death was COVID-19, and Dan Calabrese, the editor of Cain\u2019s website, confirmed that he died from the disease to the Washington Post.\n\nSome people have speculated Cain contracted the disease while attending President Donald Trump\u2019s June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In a July 31 article on Cain\u2019s website, Calabrese stated that it is \u201cnot impossible he contracted it at the Tulsa rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut most of us on his team tend to think it happened on one of the plane trips, or possibly during his stop in Las Vegas,\u201d Calabrese wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s for several reasons, one of which is simply the inherent (and to me at least, obvious) risk involved with being on an airplane these days.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
