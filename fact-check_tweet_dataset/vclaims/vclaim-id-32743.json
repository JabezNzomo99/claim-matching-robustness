The new marketing name is 'Frozen Desserts'.\n\nThe message further says that when you look up the word 'frozen desserts' it says hydrogenated oil which is dalda. So if a product says 'frozen dessert' it definitely means it is dalda.\n\nThe message further says that Amul is the only company that makes ice cream from milk and not vegetable fats.\n\nIs the claim true? FIT reached out to Hindustan Uniliver, the manufacturers of Kwality Walls in India, to get clarity.", "lang": "en"}
