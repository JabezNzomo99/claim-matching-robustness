According to Twitter, the video has been shown over 200,000 times.\n\nWe\u2019ve factchecked the four main claims he made in the video.\n\nThere are 134 million fewer miles travelled by bus in the UK than a decade ago\n\nThe number of miles travelled by buses in the UK decreased by 134 million between 2006/7 and 2016/17, according to data from the Department for Transport and Northern Ireland\u2019s Department for Infrastructure.\n\nThis was a drop of 8% to just over 1.5 billion miles.\n\nThis analysis was first done by the BBC\u2014you can see their full dataset here.\n\nFor England not including London, bus mileage decreased by 9% between 2005/6 and 2016/17. The Department for Transport said this was driven by a \u201cdecrease of 45.3% in local authority supported mileage, in particular in non-metropolitan areas\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, local authorities across the UK have faced reductions in their funding from central government in recent years, and this has led to reduced funding going towards certain services.\n\nLocal bus mileage can be one of two types of service, commercial or run on a supported basis, where local authorities subsidise routes that aren\u2019t commercially viable but are deemed socially necessary.\n\nYou can read more about cuts to subsidised bus services in this House of Commons briefing paper on the Bus Services Act 2017.\n\nThe National Travel Survey (NTS) breaks down the average number of trips taken per person per year, by age and main mode of transport.\n\nBetween 2010, when the Conservatives formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, and 2016, the number of London or local bus trips taken per person in England between 21 and 29 years old per year decreased from 89 to 54. This is a decrease of 40%.\n\nFor those between 17 and 20, the figure fell by 24% over the same period.\n\nThe survey has 16,000 participants per year, and uses interviews and self-completed travel diaries for its estimates.\n\nFull time male workers tend to earn less than those older than them until they reach the 40-49 age bracket, when they earn more than those a decade older than them. Women\u2019s earnings peak slightly earlier, in their 30s.\n\nA bigger proportion of \u2018gig workers\u2019 are between 16 and 30 than those who are regular employees or self-employed, according to research by Ipsos Mori and the RSA. The research doesn\u2019t tell us whether these people were in education at the time. The majority of gig workers are over 30.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about who is working in low-paid, flexible, and potentially \u2018insecure\u2019 work in our factcheck about the gig economy here.\n\nThe Living Costs and Food Survey sampled around 5,000 households across the UK, which the ONS uses to see how much families spend per week, and on what.\n\nThe average household where the person legally responsible (known as the HRP) was under 30, spent more of its weekly expenditure on transport services than the average across all households.\n\nThese transport services include rail, bus and other forms of public transport, but not vehicle purchase or running costs.\n\nBut that amount spent on public transport (\u00a319.90 per week) for households where the HRP was under 30 was less than for households where the HRP was between 30 to 49, or 50 to 64.\n\nLabour told us they calculated their \u00a31,000 figure using an average bus fare of \u00a31.94. Labour have not published the data behind this average fare.\n\nThe TAS partnership transport consultancy\u2019s survey on bus ticket prices found that the average single adult bus fare in 2017 was higher, at \u00a32.33. They used over 1,000 single adult fares from around England, Scotland and Wales to reach this figure. It\u2019s likely the amount spent by everyday users may be lower over the year if discounts for children and young people, and cheaper weekly or season tickets are considered.\n\nLabour told us they\u2019d done their calculation with the assumption that \u201csome under 25s will take the bus to and from school each day on weekdays \u2013 so ten journeys a week\u201d.\n\nAssuming ten journeys a week are taken 52 weeks a year, the fares add up to just over \u00a31,000.\n\nTheir claim says young people could save \u201cup to\u201d \u00a31,000 a year with this scheme, rather than that being an average saving.\n\nAccording to the National Travel Survey, in 2016, 17 to 20 year-olds took on average 101 bus trips, on London buses, other local buses and non-local buses, per year. Using Labour\u2019s \u00a31.94 average, a 17 to 20 year old taking that many bus journeys could save just under \u00a3200 a year.\n\nWith the incentive of free bus travel, young people may choose to take more buses or make buses travel their main mode of transport.", "lang": "en"}
