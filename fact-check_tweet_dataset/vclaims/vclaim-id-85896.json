This isn\u2019t the first time. A year ago, in the 2014 State of the Union, The Fact Checker handed out Pinocchios when the president claimed that the inspections allowed under the agreement were \u201cunprecedented.\u201d That\u2019s way too sweeping a statement.\n\nBefore the JPOA, Iran had about 200 kilograms of 20 percent enriched uranium in a form that could be quickly converted into weapons grade material. \u2026Today, Iran has no 20 percent enriched uranium. Zero, none. It has diluted or converted every ounce, suspended all uranium enrichment above 5 percent, removed the connections at Fordow [nuclear fuel plant] that allowed [Iran] to produce the 20 percent in the first place. Before the JPOA, Iran was making real progress, as you know, on the Arak reactor, which, had it become operational, and together with the reprocessing facility, would have provided Iran with a plutonium path to the bomb. Once fueled, the Arak facility would have been very challenging to deal with militarily. Today, Arak is frozen in place \u2014 no new components, no testing, no fuel. Before the JPOA, Iran had installed roughly 19,000 centrifuges\u2026Today, 9,000 of those centrifuges are not operational.\n\nMoreover, while there has been no installation of new centrifuges, \u201cit appears that the production of centrifuge components continues. Same with the Arak reactor. No new nuclear components have been installed, but it does not mean that the production of those came to halt.\u201d\n\nDavid Albright, who heads Institute for Science and International Security, said the president\u2019s language was \u201ca little bit odd.\u201d He said that the halt in Iran\u2019s program from 2003 to 2005 was a more substantial suspension of enrichment activities. (At the Senate hearing, Blinken acknowledged the United States and its negotiating partners had abandoned United Nations Security Council demands that Iran halt enrichment as it was clear \u201cIran was not going to give up as a practical matter some very limited forms of enrichment in the event of an agreement.\u201d)\n\nMoreover, Albright said it was not correct that the 3.5-percent enriched stock had been reduced; instead it has been converted from one form (\u201chexafluoride\u201d) to another (\u201coxide\u201d), a step that he said was taken largely for cosmetic (political) purposes. A significant portion of 20-percent enriched material has also been retained as scrap, rather than converted into fuel for a research reactor. A key aspect of the talks is to extend the \u201cbreak out\u201d period under which Iran could manufacture a nuclear weapon, but he said as a practical matter the conversion of 3.5 percent to oxide form would only add about two weeks to the break-out period, since Iran could reconvert it back into hexafluoride. (Here\u2019s his report on this issue; this paragraph was updated for clarity.)\n\n\u201cThe \u2018most dangerous\u2019 would be a better turn of phrase,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. \u201cI think the speechwriters are trying to explain something complicated in ordinary language \u2014 and maybe not quite sticking the landing.\u201d He noted that \u201cdilution, as the term implies, results in a net increase in material although it eliminates what you would call \u2018the most dangerous\u2019 material.\u201d Thus, in his view, it would be misleading to suggest the threat has gone up in this period because the amount of material has gone up. But he agreed the amount of nuclear material has increased.\n\nBelow is a chart, prepared by opponents of an agreement using Albright\u2019s and Heinonen\u2019s research, that illustrates Iran\u2019s build-up of nuclear material since 2009. Advocates of an agreement might argue the trend from 2009 to 2013 highlighted the need for negotiations, and both Albright and Heinonen say there are slight technical issues with the chart. (\u201cThis graph should say that material available (red) is UF6 [hexafluoride], which can be used as such for further enrichment, Heinonen said. \u201cThe rest (blue minus red), about 4 tons uranium in various chemical forms, can be reconverted to UF6. Iran has stated that it is not constructing such a facility. If converted, the number of \u2018bombs\u2019 would be higher\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
