Some netizens have claimed that Priyanka has already given up on 2019 elections.\n\nA Twitter user 'Chowkidar BALA' claimed that Priyanka is asking workers to prepare for 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections rather than the upcoming polls.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found these claims to be misleading.\n\nThe tweet posted by 'Chowkidar BALA' has been retweeted nearly 500 times and liked by more than 1,000 people.\n\nThis video is being circulated on Facebook as well. A Facebook page 'Presstitutes' has about six lakh followers.\n\nWe found that the video is from the Gauriganj constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. On Wednesday, Priyanka visited the house of former Congress MLA from Gauriganj, late Noor Mohammed, where she met his son Fateh Mohammed and other workers.\n\nIn the video, Priyanka can be seen talking to Congress workers about elections. During the discussion, Fateh Mohammed's relatives asked Priyanka for an Assembly ticket for him from Gauriganj seat.\n\nPriyanka then asked Fateh, \"Are you preparing for elections?\" She further added, \"Not this one, but 2022 elections.\"\n\nZee News reported about the news on Thursday (March 28).\n\nHere is the full transcript of the video:\n\nWhen we reached out to Fateh Mohammed, he said, \"The claim in the video is totally wrong. My cousin and other workers from Gauriganj asked Priyanka, seeking an Assembly ticket for me. That's why she emphasised on the preparations of UP Assembly elections of 2022. She even asked me to work diligently for the 2019 election too.\"\n\nFateh's father Noor Mohammed was an MLA from Gauriganj in 2002. After his death, Fateh was given the ticket which he lost and then never got the chance again.\n\nABP News also reported that the claim with the video is out of context.\n\nHence, the claims that Priyanka has given up on this election and focusing on the 2022 election are misleading.\n\nAlso see: YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE FOR 2019 ELECTIONS", "lang": "en"}
