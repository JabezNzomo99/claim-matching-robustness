The same polls that said that... Remain was going to win, and the same polls that said that the Conservatives were going to win a majority in the last general election?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to be precise about exactly what proportion of under 25s across the UK voted Remain or Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. However, 73% seems a reasonable estimate, based on the results of a number of polls that have been done.\n\nBecause age isn\u2019t recorded on ballot papers, we have no official figures on voting by age group, and so polling and survey data is the best source we have.\n\nThese polls generally agree that around 70-75% of voters under 25s voted Remain. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori put the figure at 75%, and YouGov put the figure at 71%. These polls were weighted after the vote to mirror the actual 48% to 52% split between Remain and Leave voters. This means they\u2019re likely to more reliably depict the vote split by age, than pre-referendum polls that didn\u2019t do this weighting.\n\nA poll by Lord Ashcroft, cited on last night\u2019s Question Time, put the figure for the under-25 Remain vote at 73%, and also showed the overall split at 48% to 52%. But it doesn\u2019t detail whether the data was similarly weighted to reflect the referendum result. We\u2019ve asked for more information on the poll.\n\nWhile most polls incorrectly forecast a victory for Remain (and based on polling results experts thought it likely that there would be a Conservative majority at the 2017 election), these polls weren\u2019t weighted after the fact. Therefore they\u2019re less likely to be reliable in estimating voting patterns.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the long-term British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey estimated that 72% of 18-24 year old voters, voted Remain.\n\nWhile the BSA survey interviewed far fewer people than the referendum polls, the survey\u2019s methodology makes it one of the best available sources. Professor John Curtice, President of the British Polling Council, says that survey like this one \u201care more successful in making contact with those who have little interest in politics.\u201d This means they may reach a more representative sample of people than other polls.", "lang": "en"}
