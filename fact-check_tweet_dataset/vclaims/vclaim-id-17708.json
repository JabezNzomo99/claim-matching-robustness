Nothing to do with journalism. Mayroon din one or two pero hindi as a rule (There are one or two cases but not as a rule),\" he added.\n\nHe said this after being asked for Malaca\u00f1ang's reaction to a report that the Philippines is among the worst places for journalists in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe report, published by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), gave the Philippines a ranking of 7.7 with the rank of 10 being the worst.\n\nThe IFJ report itself said 12 journalists have been killed in relation to their work since the beginning of the Duterte presidency.\n\nThe Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) and National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) reported that 9 Filipino journalists were killed in the course of their work, or when \u201csomebody didn\u2019t like the reports they were issuing, they were going after a sensitive area, or some of the powerful people around the location they were working in were displeased.\u201d\n\nThis was to disprove the notion that only corrupt journalists are killed, a notion Duterte himself has insisted on.
