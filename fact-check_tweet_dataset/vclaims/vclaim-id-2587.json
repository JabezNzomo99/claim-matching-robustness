For a short time last year the Democrat even headed a super PAC whose goal was to end all super PACs.\n\nBut the National Republican Congressional Committee said that hasn\u2019t stopped her from accepting contributions from those who gave to Super PACs.\n\n\"Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors,\" the NRCC wrote in a blog post.\n\nGetting big money out of politics has been a central theme of her campaign to represent the 19th Congressional District, located in New York State\u2019s Hudson Valley and Catskills regions, like it was when she ran for governor in 2014.\n\nSuper PACs are able to accept and spend unlimited amounts of money in elections.\n\nIs the National Republican Congressional Committee right? Has her campaign accepted money from super PAC donors?\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee names 16 people it says donated to Teachout\u2019s campaign and to super PACs. We found the donors in Teachout\u2019s campaign finance filings. Altogether, the 16 donors have given $67,300 to Teachout. That\u2019s about 2 percent of the $3.2 million she has raised, according to her latest filing.\n\nThe 16 Teachout contributors who gave money to super PACs contributed at least $61 million to super PACs. Two donated $10,000 or less to super PACs. In 2016, seven of the donors gave to super PACs. The other nine did not.\n\nAmong the 16 donors are billionaire George Soros and members of his family.\n\nTeachout has received backing from one super PAC: National Nurses United. It reported spending almost $47,000 in digital ad buys for the Democrat this year.\n\nTeachout's campaign says Faso has received more help from super PACs. New York Wins reported spending close to $1 million in ads and mailers against his primary opponent. The group has not reported spending anything against Teachout.\n\nAnother super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, spent more than $2.7 million against Teachout in mail and media placement since the June primary.\n\n\"You know I\u2019m running against John Faso, but we\u2019re really running against super PACs,\" Teachout said at a campaign event in August.\n\nIn a series of blog posts, the National Republican Congressional Committee said \"Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors.\"\n\nWe cross-checked 16 donors to Teachout\u2019s campaign with their donations to super PACs. We found all of them also donated to super PACs.\n\nWe rate this claim as True.", "lang": "en"}
