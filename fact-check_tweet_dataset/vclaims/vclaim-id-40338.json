A Kaiser Permanente spokesman called the story \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nTyson, the chairman and CEO of health care provider Kaiser Permanente, died unexpectedly in his sleep on Nov. 10.

The tweet dates back to October 2018.\n\n\u201cWhen the CEO of Kaiser dies in his sleep a few days after publicly taking a flu vaccine,\u201d reads the Facebook caption. \u201cAt age 60.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Tyson died after receiving a flu shot. An internet search shows no credible media outlets reporting that a flu vaccine played a role in his death. To date, neither Kaiser Permanente nor his family has disclosed the cause of his death.\n\nJohn Nelson, the vice president of communications for Kaiser Permanente, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the claim was false.\n\n\u201cHe passed away suddenly, leaving his family, friends and colleagues grieving,\u201d wrote Nelson in an email to the Caller. \u201cHis memory deserves better than a completely false story created by people who know nothing about him or the circumstances of his passing.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone six months of age and older get the annual flu vaccine.\n\nCommon side effects of the flu shot include low-grade fever, headaches, fatigue and soreness at the site of the injection, according to the CDC. Life-threatening allergic reactions and Guillain-Barre syndrome can occur after receiving the vaccine, but they are extremely uncommon and rarely fatal, according to Peter Hotez, the dean of Baylor College of Medicine\u2019s National School of Tropical Medicine.\n\n\u201cIt is exceedingly rare for someone to die of a reaction to a flu vaccine, far far less than those who die from not being vaccinated and dying from flu, which are thousands per year,\u201d said John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor Albert Wu in an email to the Caller.\n\nApproximately 45 percent of adults in the U.S. got the flu vaccine during the 2018-2019 season, according to the CDC. A study from the CDC found that flu vaccinations prevented an estimated 7.1 million flu illnesses and 8,000 flu-related deaths during the 2017-2018 season.\n\nTyson was a vocal advocate of vaccinating against the flu, having tweeted numerous times about its importance in protecting people from contracting the virus.", "lang": "en"}
