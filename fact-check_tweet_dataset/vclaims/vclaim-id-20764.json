He said arguably some of this change could be put down to Brexit\u2014this was widely misreported as the governor saying the change was entirely and definitely due to Brexit.\n\nThe data behind the Bank\u2019s calculations isn\u2019t publicly available, but it told us the figures it used and how the calculation was done, which we\u2019ll go into later. Using publicly available data we were able to roughly recreate the calculation, but not exactly.\n\nThe Bank of England looked at the difference between its projection for real average wage growth (made before the EU referendum) and how much wages actually grew by the first quarter of 2018.\n\nAccounting for inflation over that time, the Bank found that average weekly wages were 4% lower by the start of 2018 than projected. Applying that reduction to average annual salaries in 2016, the Bank concluded that average wages per worker were around \u00a3900 to \u00a31,000 lower than projected. This amount wasn\u2019t per household, as Mr Carney said.\n\nForecasts aren\u2019t exact predictions of the future, and we don\u2019t know what would have happened under different circumstances, for example if the UK had voted to remain in the EU. Without being able to see the exact data the Bank of England used and compare it with similar forecasts we can\u2019t say how much of the \u00a3900 is simply down to the fact it\u2019s comparing a forecast with reality.\n\nWe think that the evidence behind these sorts of figures should be published and open to public scrutiny, particularly given the high levels of front page media reporting.\n\nHow the \u00a3900 figure was calculated\n\nThe Bank of England told us the figure was calculated by comparing real wage growth from just after the EU referendum until the first three months of 2018, with projections it made for that period back in 2016 before the referendum took place.\n\nThe exact figures the Bank used to do the calculation aren\u2019t publically available and it hasn\u2019t published its analysis.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to exactly recreate the Bank\u2019s calculation with published data partly because it calculated the change cumulatively over seven quarters. Because most of the published data looks at annual change, only a rough approximation can be reached.\n\nThe Bank told us its unpublished data projected that Consumer Price Inflation (CPI\u2014a measure of inflation) would grow by 3%, and average weekly wages by 6.5% over the seven quarters it looked at.\n\nBased on this, it projected that real wage growth would be around 3.5% between mid-2016 and early 2018.\n\nThe Bank told us its data showed average weekly wages actually grew by 4% and CPI grew by around 4.75% over these seven quarters. Based on this, it says real wages actually shrank by 0.75%.\n\nThe Bank calculated that real wage growth was 4% lower than it had projected would be the case back in 2016. In 2016 median gross annual pay for employee jobs in the UK, was just over \u00a323,000\u20144% of this is \u00a3920, its estimate for how much less the average worker has in their pockets since the referendum.\n\nThis figure refers to individual workers, not households as Mr Carney said. If you use the Bank\u2019s figures to calculate the difference, then real wage growth was around 4.25% lower than predicted, which is closer to \u00a31,000.\n\nUsing publicly available data we were able to roughly approximate the figures that the Bank calculated, but we weren\u2019t able to replicate them exactly without seeing the Bank\u2019s data.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s own Statistical Code of Practice states that \u2018statistical methods and practices will be open to public scrutiny\u2019. It\u2019s disappointing that Mr Carney used figures that aren\u2019t publicly available in his appearance before the Treasury Select Committee, particularly given the high amount of media attention the claim received afterwards. The Bank did engage with us over a number of emails and telephone calls to explain their calculations, but figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from and how they\u2019re calculated.\n\nDid Mark Carney say it was all down to Brexit?\n\nSeveral media outlets reported that Dr Carney had put the \u00a3900 loss down to Brexit.\n\nAfter mentioning the \u00a3900 figure to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney explained what he thought was behind the change. He said: \u201cThe question is why and what drove that difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of it, and we can\u2019t be absolute about it, but some of it is arguably ascribed to Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Carney suggests the link with Brexit is uncertain. We\u2019ve looked in more detail at how much forecasts can change over time and how they eventually compare to reality here.", "lang": "en"}
