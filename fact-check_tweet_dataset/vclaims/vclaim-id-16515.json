RMIT ABC Fact Check runs the numbers.\n\nIn nominal terms, no other government has ever had seven women in cabinet, as Mr Morrison has since March.\n\nThe previous record was six, which was equalled by both Labor and Liberal prime ministers over the last few years.\n\nIn proportional terms, Mr Morrison's 30.4 per cent representation of women just edges out the previous record held by former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who achieved 30 per cent representation in the dying days of the last Labor government.\n\nMr Morrison then promoted Western Australian senator Linda Reynolds into cabinet in his role, bringing the total number of women in Cabinet to seven, including:\n\u2022 then minister for jobs and industrial relations, Kelly O'Dwyer\n\u2022 then minister for small and family business, skills and vocational education, Michaelia Cash\n\u2022 then minister for the environment, Melissa Price\n\nIn January, Ms O'Dwyer had announced her retirement from politics, but continued in her role until the election.\n\nAfter the election, Senator Payne and Ms Andrews continued in Cabinet in their roles, whilst Senator McKenzie, Senator Cash and Senator Reynolds were given new or adjusted portfolios, still in Cabinet.\n\nDespite insisting during the final leaders' debate that Ms Price would remain in her role post-election, the Prime Minister moved her to defence industry and demoted her from Cabinet.\n\nFormer health minister Sussan Ley, who was demoted in 2017 after an expenses scandal under former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, was brought back into Cabinet to replace Ms Price in environment.\n\nMr Morrison has promoted South Australian senator Anne Ruston to Cabinet in the families and social services portfolio, thus maintaining the number of women in Cabinet at seven:\n\nThe graph below shows that indeed, in terms of raw numbers, Mr Morrison's Cabinet has held the record for women in cabinet since early March.\n\nThe previous record of six was first held briefly by former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and subsequently matched by Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison.\n\nBut Mr Rudd did not just hold the nominal record, he also held the record on proportion.\n\nAfter returning to the prime ministership, he had six women in his cabinet of 20, or 30 per cent.\n\nMr Rudd has held that record through the term of the Coalition Government, until recently.\n\nWith seven women in a Cabinet of 23, Mr Morrison has barely scraped over the record, with a 30.4 per cent proportion of women in his Cabinet.\n\nThis means that no government of either stripe has ever exceeded more than one-third representation of women in cabinet.\n\u2022 Australian Parliament, The 45th Parliament Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia 2017", "lang": "en"}
