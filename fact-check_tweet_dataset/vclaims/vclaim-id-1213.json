The post has been shared more than 9,400 times here .\n\nAnother account, this time posing as Tesco UK, encouraged shares of the post to be in with chance of winning a 4K television as part of a birthday giveaway by the company. This post was later replaced with another one offering to give away up to 500 TVs to people who commented on and shared the post before July 18 ( here ). Between them, these posts have been shared some 12,000 times.\n\nNone of these posts or competitions are authentic. The accounts do not belong to the Currys and Tesco brands.\n\nBoth the impostor accounts appear to have written their first posts this month, and neither are verified by Facebook. The real accounts for Tesco and Currys can be found www.facebook.com/tesco/ and here.\n\nBoth companies confirmed the posts were fake.\n\nA Currys PC World spokesperson told Reuters: \u201cWe would like to reassure our customers that all our social media channels are continually monitored for fake accounts by our customer services teams and colleagues. All fake accounts are immediately reported to the appropriate social media platform to have the account closed down as soon as possible. We would encourage customers to only engage with our genuine, verified accounts which carry the \u2018blue tick\u2019 badge.\u201d\n\nA Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cThis was not a genuine Tesco Facebook page or offer. Customers can check whether a Tesco Facebook page is genuine by the blue verified tick next to our name.\u201d\n\nFalse. Neither Tesco nor Currys PC World have posted to Facebook about a television giveaway competition.\n\nRead more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
