The article opened:\n\nThe FEC has announced that it may have to recommend invalidating more than 60K votes from the Birmingham area to the Alabama Secretary of State. according to police logs, poll watchers and a watchdog group from the Heritage Foundation, dozens of people were caught voting multiple times with fake IDs and fake voter registrations. The problem came to light as one poll watcher witnessed the same two men, who were obviously twins, return to the polls wearing different hats to vote at least four times. When confronted, the two men pushed their way through the crowd and ran.\n\nIt also contained a racist quote falsely attributed to a Breitbart news interview with a poll worker (but with the actual link going to a picture of donkey excrement on some grass):\n\n\"We were a little bit suspicious of some of the people coming in, but they had what looked like valid IDs. We checked their pictures and signatures and they seemed to match, but let's be honest...it can be hard to tell them apart.\"\n\nThe fake link was removed from the version at Conservative Stamp.\n\nReagan Was Right carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nConservative Stamp had no such disclaimer besides a very general warning on their about page:\n\nAll the information on this website is published in good faith and for general information purpose only. ConservativeStamp does not make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information. Any action you take upon the information you find on this website (ConservativeStamp), is strictly at your own risk. ConservativeStamp will not be liable for any losses and/or damages in connection with the use of our website.\n\nThe owner and main writer of Reagan Was Right is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as asamericanasapplepie.org, ourlandofthefree.com and freedumjunkshun.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
