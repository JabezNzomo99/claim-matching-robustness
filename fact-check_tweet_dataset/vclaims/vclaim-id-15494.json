To see poverty first hand I will eat on the footpath and will sleep on it at night.'\n\nA Facebook user named Shiv Rajput shared the photshopped picture thinking it was true.\n\nThe image was also tweeted by Congress leader Nagma Morarji. The actor turned politician deleted her tweet after BOOM called out her tweet.\n\nThe image is visibly photoshopped with the lighting on Patra starkly brighter compared to the rest of the image.\n\nA reverse image search of the photo did not yield any results.\n\nWe also tried cropping the photo and searching for it separately. However, that also did not throw up any results.\n\nWe then changed the horizontal orientation of the picture and performed a reverse image search again.\n\nAn India.com article dated May 24, 2016, featured the original image.\n\nWe also found the original photo from which Patra's image was cropped out.\n\nSambit Patra who is set to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Puri, Odisha has been visiting his constituents as part of his election outreach.", "lang": "en"}
