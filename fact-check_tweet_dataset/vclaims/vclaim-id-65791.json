No, that's not true: Two autopsies -- one by a medical examiner, and a second private examination -- confirmed that Floyd is dead. Video recorded from various sources and angles showed Floyd suffering injuries that led to his death. Claims to the contrary by a Republican congressional candidate in Missouri offered no evidence.\n\nThe claims were made in a video (archived here) posted here on YouTube on June 3, 2020, under the title \"Dr Winnie Heartstrong claims George Floyd IS ALIVE and the video is FAKED. History is the conspiracy.\" The video opened:\n\nYouTube and Facebook have deleted the video from their platforms for violating community standards, but copies have been reappearing.\n\nHere is a screenshot of what it looked like:\n\nHeartstrong, originally from Minneapolis but running for the U.S. House in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, made her claims in a four-and-a-half-minute video recorded in a car as she wore a red \"Keep America Great\" hat. She said the \"thesis\" of her video was \"George Floyd is alive. Prove me wrong.\" Heartstrong, who recently changed her name from Nma Winnie Obike, earned a Ph.D. in communications from the University of Maryland in 2019. She said she was \"part of the MAGA movement,\" a reference to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\nIn the video, she implores black Americans to \"wake up and stop being so emotional [and] stop crying\" over Floyd, whom she suggested could have been a homeless man, drugged, then killed. She also claims that the autopsies could have been performed on the wrong person.\n\nHer first point was to question the very existence of George Floyd:\n\nThe claim that there are no photos of Floyd with his mother is disproven by this picture in Time magazine from June 4, 2020, showing a young George Floyd with his mother, Larcenia:\n\nYes, there is a Floyd's Barbershop in Minneapolis. In fact, there are two. They are part of the a national franchise that includes 125 Floyd's Barbershops around the United States. But they are not known as \"a hotspot, a gathering place for African Americans.\" In fact, the company was started by three white brothers from Denver as \"a rock n' roll-themed barbershop for men and women,\" according to the company website.\n\nHeartstrong's next claim in that the police officer seen in the video with his knee on Floyd's neck is a fake:\n\nShe did not explain why the conspirators who she alleged produced the fake video could not have used the same actor to pose for a mugshot. The two images do appear to be the same man:\n\nThe video host next made a series of claims to support her contention that the video was staged:\n\nEven in the video, you see behind the officer that the gas prices that are listed, those aren't coronavirus gas prices. Where I'm at gas prices are, you know, much cheaper than that. Ok, we see that the numbers on the police cars are changing. One car has one number, when the video changes angles it's a different number. So, what's happening here? We see that the officer's badge is all crooked and he's not even really matching his colleague. They don't have the same police badge. So what is really going on here? If the cabal was able to present a body double for the Kennedy assassinations, who's to say that George Floyd isn't 10 different people at this point.\n\nLet's address these points one by one.\n\nThere is a Speedway gas station across the street from the death scene and one camera -- a park police officer's bodycam does show a brief view of a sign that shows the gas price at 8:14 p.m. local time.\n\nThe sign is not clear, but the red numbers that display the price of a regular gallon of gas appears to show either $1.69 or $1.99. While no one answered the phone at this location, the clerk at a Speedway gas station three miles to the west told Lead Stories that the price at that store was $1.69 a gallon on May 25, 2020.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported in a story titled Gas prices slip below $1 a gallon at some Minnesota gas stations on April 1, 2020, that gas prices were even lower eight weeks earlier:\n\nIf you take a look at the same gas station on Google Street View and zoom in on the sign you can clearly see the green 99 cents price is actually for a cup of coffee:\n\nNext, the \"changing numbers\" on the police car: review of the footage simply shows multiple cars being present, each with a different number, as you can see in this video compilation from The New York Times that reconstructs which car arrives when:\n\nA crooked badge does not seem to be a clue of a conspiracy, just a sign the officer maybe is preoccupied with something other than his badge. All of the officers appear to be wearing similar badges. And would it be so out of the ordinary for a uniform badge to go a bit off-kilter after being involved in a struggle? The video does show Chauvin pulling Floyd out of the police car and wrestling him to the ground only seconds earlier.\n\nAs for a cabal killing President Kennedy and using body doubles, we will save that for another debunking day.\n\nThe Washington Post closely examined another video of the incident captured by a security camera across the street:\n\nThe fact is that Floyd, 46, is dead, murdered, according to prosecutors, during a May 25 arrest attempt, where officers, including fired Derek Chauvin, pin him to the ground for eight minutes and 46 seconds during a videoed incident that sparked national and global protests against police brutality. Of particular concern to protestors was the killing of blacks at the hands of police -- an occurrence that happens far more often against African Americans than against whites or other races or ethnicities.\n\nChauvin, on June 3, 2020, had his original third-degree murder charge elevated to second-degree murder in Floyd's death. Three other officers were also charged the same day, June 3, with abetting murder, according to reports everywhere in the media -- and according to official documents here and here.\n\nAs for Floyd and Chauvin, she says:\n\nShe ends the video, again with no evidence, by saying, \"George Floyd is alive, America. Prove me wrong.\"", "lang": "en"}
