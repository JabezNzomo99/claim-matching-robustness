The claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include manipulated placards about India's citizenship law; the original image has circulated in media reports about a police protest in November 2019 which called for legal action against lawyers accused of assaulting police officers.\n\nThe image was published in this Facebook post on December 20, 2019. It has been shared more than 1,100 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe placards in the image read: \u201cNo CAA, No NRC\u201d, \u201cBaton charging the innocents, we won\u2019t be able to do it so\u201d, \u201cWe oppose NRC & CAA\u201d.\n\n\u201cNRC\u201d is an acronym for the National Register of Citizens. It is a government record of all Indian citizens, currently only being logged in the state of Assam. The NRC came under scrutiny after the most recent release in August 2019 was found to have omitted some two million people who were deemed unable to prove their Indian citizenship. Critics claimed the move was particularly discriminatory against the state\u2019s Muslim population, as reported by AFP here on September 2, 2019.\n\n\u201cCAA\u201d is an acronym for the Citizenship Amendment Act, a new law passed in India on December 11, 2019. The law, which granted citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, has sparked violent protests nationwide, as reported by AFP here on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe caption in the misleading Facebook post translates in English to: \u201csalutations\u201d.\n\nThe same image was also shared here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the image has been doctored to include manipulated placards.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original photo published here by Indian English-language news website Scroll.in on November 5, 2019. The photo was credited to India\u2019s Press Trust of India news agency.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by Scroll.in:\n\nThe Hindi-language placards translate in English to: \u201cWho will listen, whom shall we speak to\u201d, \u201cToday is police, tomorrow who?\u201d\n\nThe image is captioned: \u201cPolice personnel in Delhi Protest\u201d.\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cOn Tuesday\u2026 thousands of police personnel protest against an assault on his colleagues by lawyers outside the Delhi Police Headquarters on the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe tensions had been building since November 2 after a dispute over a wrongly parked vehicle outside Tis Hazari Court Complex in Old Delhi snowballed into a clash that left 10 policemen and several lawyers injured, and 17 vehicles vandalised.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (L) and the photo published by Scroll.in (R):\n\nThe same photo was also published in this report by Indian English-language magazine India Today on November 5, 2019.\n\nThis report also states the gathering was a \u201cprotest against the recent manhandling of some cops by lawyers\u201d.\n\n\u201cNovember 5 was a rare day when police personnel in uniform took to the streets to protest and demand justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was organised to protest against the recent manhandling of some cops by lawyers - first at the Tis Hazari Court Complex on Saturday, and then at the Saket Court Complex on Monday.\u201d\n\nThe same protest was also covered in reports by English-language newspaper Economic times here, and English-language newspaper The Hindu here, both on November 5, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
