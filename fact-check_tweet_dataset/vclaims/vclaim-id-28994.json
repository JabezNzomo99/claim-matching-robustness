The caption accompanying the image suggests the measure is set pass in that chamber, but House Democrats have postponed consideration of the raise, facing backlash from politically vulnerable lawmakers.\n\nThe salary bump, if implemented, would increase the pay of rank-and-file lawmakers to $178,500, up 2.6% from the $174,000 they currently make. At least one poll suggests that most voters are strongly opposed to the idea.\n\nThough the Facebook post claims to show members of the House sleeping on the job, Snopes determined that these photos actually show Brazilian politicians. The pictures were taken during exceptional situations such as hunger strikes \u2013 depicted in the photo on the bottom right \u2013 and marathon sessions of voting and debate, like the 41-hour stretch pictured on the bottom left.\n\nBy performing a reverse image search on Google, a number of these photos can be found in contemporaneous reporting by Brazilian news outlets.\n\nSnopes reported that before circulating among American social media users, the collage was widely shared online in Brazil.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
