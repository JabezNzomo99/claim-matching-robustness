The photo actually shows Alexander Giannascoli, a 26-year-old musician, who said he had spilled beer on his pants.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke was in a punk rock group when he was younger, and there are photos to prove it. However, a picture of a musician that is circulating online with text criticizing O\u2019Rourke does not show the former Texas congressman.\n\nThe picture shows Alexander Giannascoli, a 26-year-old indie rock musician who goes by the name (Sandy) Alex G. Giannascoli confirmed that when we reached him by phone on Sept. 17, and he explained that the photo was taken backstage at a show in New York City in the summer of 2017. It shows him with shoulder-length hair and wearing a pale yellow button-down shirt and jeans that have a wet spot in the front and down one leg. (Other photos of his performances that summer show him wearing a similar outfit.)\n\n\u201cI spilled a beer on my pants,\u201d Giannascoli told us in a phone interview. \u201cI was joking around,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt obviously isn\u2019t that funny anymore.\u201d\n\nThe photo is now circulating online with captions like: \u201c\u2018Robert Francis\u2019 O\u2019Rourke in college. Drunk and pissing his pants. He wants to be your president in 2020!\u201d\n\nAnother version says: \u201cI\u2019M BETO ROBERT FRANCIS O\u2019ROURKE I\u2019M HERE FOR YOUR GUNS!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve written about an outlandish photo falsely identified as showing the El Paso, Texas native. In March, we wrote about a viral image of an activist in Greece that was being shared with the false claim that it showed O\u2019Rourke.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
