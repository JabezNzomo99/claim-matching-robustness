Here we put into context some of the statements that the president made in his defense:\n\u2022 Trump said that when he first spoke about Charlottesville on Aug. 12 \u2014 blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence \u2014 he didn\u2019t have the facts, saying \u201ca lot of the event didn\u2019t even happen yet, as we were speaking.\u201d The president spoke at 3:30 p.m., nearly two hours after a speeding car plowed into counterprotesters.\n\u2022 The president also said \u201cbefore I make a statement, I like to know the facts.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t always waited for \u201cthe facts\u201d after a tragedy. For example, he speculated that \u201cyet another terrorist attack\u201d was to blame for an EgyptAir plane that disappeared May 19, 2016. The cause is still unknown.\n\u2022 The president also said he did not know when he spoke on Aug. 12 that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke was at the rally. We don\u2019t know what the president knew. But we can say that about two hours before the president spoke, CNN aired an interview with Duke at the rally praising Trump, and Duke tweeted about Trump.\n\nTrump answered questions about the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville for the first time at a press conference on Aug. 15.\n\nAt the event, the president discussed his first response to the Charlottesville violence on Aug. 12. The president held a bill-signing ceremony at about 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 12 \u2014 about four hours after the Virginia governor declared a state of emergency and about two hours after a speeding car plowed into counterprotesters. That attack killed one person and injured many others.\n\nIn his Aug. 12 remarks, the president blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence in Charlottesville. \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,\u201d Trump said at the time. It wasn\u2019t until two days later that he condemned \u201cthe KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.\u201d\n\nAsked why he waited \u201cso long\u201d to publicly denounce white nationalists for the violence, Trump said that he was waiting for more information, claiming \u201ca lot of the event didn\u2019t even happen yet, as we were speaking.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to say that when he spoke about Charlottesville at the bill signing he didn\u2019t even know that Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, was at the rally. \u201cI didn\u2019t know David Duke was there,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see the facts.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the president knew at the time of his remarks, but we present here a timeline of events. We note a few things: Trump\u2019s bill-signing event was at 3:30 p.m. \u2014 about five hours after the violence first broke out, about four hours after the declaration of emergency, three hours after the state police started to make arrests, and nearly two hours after the car attack.\n\nThe driver of the car hadn\u2019t been identified when Trump spoke at the bill signing. But videos of the car attack were widely reported before Trump spoke, and witnesses described it as \u201cabsolutely intentional,\u201d as Fox News reported.\n\nAs for Duke, CNN aired an interview with the former Klan leader at about two hours before Trump spoke. In the interview, Duke called the rally a \u201cturning point,\u201d saying those at the rally were going to \u201cfulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\u201d Duke had also tweeted about the rally \u2014 including a pair of tweets criticizing Trump at about an hour-and-a-half before Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nJason Kessler, a Charlottesville resident, organized the rally. Kessler is the founder of Unity & Security For America, a group described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \u201ca nativist, white nationalist group.\u201d Richard Spencer, a leading white nationalist, was scheduled to speak at the rally.\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline of events on Aug. 12:\n\n7:39 a.m. \u2013 David Duke, the former Klan leader, tweets, \u201cToday will be a historic day, remembered as the moment everything changed. #Charlottesville #UniteTheRight\u201d\n\n8:30 a.m. \u2013 Demonstrators begin to gather. The Virginia State Police posts a photo at 8:40 a.m. on its Twitter account of men carrying weapons and wearing fatigues. \u201cParticipants for today\u2019s rally at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville begin to arrive. #cvilleaug12\u201d\n\n10:30 a.m. \u2013 First outbreak of violence.\n\n11 a.m. \u2013 CNN leads its 11 a.m. hour with footage of the clashes between the protesters and counterprotesters. White nationalists can be seen holding wooden shields, carrying weapons and wearing helmets.\n\n11:55 a.m. \u2013 Police start to make arrests. State police tweets at 11:55 a.m., \u201cArrests are being made following declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville. #cvilleaug12\u201d\n\n1:02 p.m. \u2013 Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for Virginia State Police, says in an interview with Fox News that \u201call sides\u201d had engaged in throwing bottles and other debris in what had been \u2014 as of that point \u2014 a violent, but non-fatal confrontation.\n\n1:19 p.m. \u2013 Trump tweets, \u201cWe ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\u201d\n\n1:31 p.m. \u2013 CNN airs an interview with Duke at the rally, which he said represents a \u201cturning point.\u201d The former Klan grand wizard said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That\u2019s what we believed in. That\u2019s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said we\u2019re going to take our country back. And that\u2019s what we gotta do.\u201d\n\n1:40 p.m. \u2013 A driver, later identified as James Alex Fields Jr., speeds down Fourth Street and into a crowd of counterprotesters who are marching in the street. Fields then throws the car in reverse and speeds away.\n\n2:01 p.m. \u2013 On Twitter, Duke criticizes Trump\u2019s tweet calling for everyone to \u201ccondemn all that hate stands for.\u201d Duke retweets Trump\u2019s post and writes, \u201cSo, after decades of White Americans being targeted for discriminated & anti-White hatred, we come together as a people, and you attack us?\u201d\n\n2:03 p.m. \u2013 Duke posts a second tweet to Trump. In it, Duke says, \u201cI would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists.\u201d\n\n2:14 p.m. \u2013 Virginia State Police posts a photo of the crash scene, saying \u201cseveral pedestrians\u201d were struck and that there were \u201cmultiple injuries.\u201d\n\n2:49 p.m. \u2013 Fox News posts a video of the car attack. The Fox News reporter says that witnesses described the attack as \u201cabsolutely intentional.\u201d\n\n3:30 p.m. \u2013 CNN reports it had \u201cnow confirmed from Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer that one person has died, in fact, today during the violent events in the city.\u201d\n\n3:33 p.m. \u2013 Trump speaks about Charlottesville at a bill-signing ceremony. He blames \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence.\n\n4:18 p.m. \u2013 Fox News tweets that the driver was in custody for \u201cintentional collaborated car attack in #charlottesville.\u201d\n\n5 p.m. \u2013 Shortly after 5 p.m., a Virginia State Police helicopter monitoring the rally crashes and two state troopers are killed.\n\nWe would also note that Trump hasn\u2019t always waited for \u201cthe facts\u201d before weighing in on a tragedy.\n\nFor example, Trump wasted little time in speculating that terrorism was to blame for the disappearance of an EgyptAir plane carrying 66 people over the Mediterranean in the early morning hours of May 19, 2016. \u201cLooks like yet another terrorist attack,\u201d Trump tweeted less than 12 hours after the plane went missing.\n\nThe cause of the crash still remains unknown. In May, French investigators contradicted earlier reports that traces of explosives were found on the bodies of victims. And in June, it was reported that French authorities were looking into the possibility that the crash may have been caused by an overheated mobile device in the cockpit.\n\nThe day after the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando on June, 12, 2016, Trump made a series of inaccurate statements related to the incident.\n\nIn an interview on CNN, Trump said \u201cmany people\u201d thought the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, \u201cwas a whack job,\u201d but they didn\u2019t report him. In fact, Mateen\u2019s co-workers in 2013 reported that he boasted of having terrorist ties, and the FBI investigated and interviewed him.\n\nIn the same interview, Trump specifically singled out Muslims for failing to cooperate with law enforcement. He said, \u201cFor some reason, the Muslim community does not report people like this.\u201d That was wrong, too.\n\nMohammed A. Malik, who had known Mateen since 2006, wrote in the Washington Post on June 20, 2016, that he contacted the FBI in 2014 after he learned that Mateen had been watching videotapes of \u201cAnwar al-Awlaki, the charismatic Yemen-based imam who helped radicalize several Muslims.\u201d Malik said he wrote his op-ed to refute Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cthe Muslim community does not report people like this.\u201d Malik writes, \u201cI\u2019m just tired of negative rhetoric and ignorant comments about my faith.\u201d\n\nA day after the Orlando shooting, Trump also repeated the baseless claim that \u201cmany people,\u201d including neighbors of the earlier San Bernardino shooters, saw \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d of the apartment, but did not report it to authorities because of concerns about racial profiling. There is still no evidence of that.", "lang": "en"}
