When combining all age groups, 28 percent of Americans said the government should ban this type of speech, while 67 percent said people should be able to offend minorities in public. \u201cTwo-thirds of Americans say this, compared with a median of 35 percent among the 38 nations we polled,\u201d wrote Jacob Poushter, a senior researcher at Pew.\n\n\u201cI think that the obvious implication of the poll is that 40 percent of Americans under the age of 35 say that the First Amendment right to say offensive things is dangerous enough to curtail it,\u201d Wegmann said. \u201cThe senator\u2019s point was to quickly cut to the chase that (a) some folks talk a lot about the psychological categories around speech, (b) this is messy (as free speech issues often are and as admitted by Zuckerberg when he said it was hard to define \u2018hate speech\u2019), and (c) this isn\u2019t a conversation that\u2019s just happening in Facebook but in a broader cultural context.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had to choose, do you think it is more important for colleges to [ROTATED: create a positive learning environment for all students by prohibiting certain speech or expression of viewpoints that are offensive or biased against certain groups of people, (or to) create an open learning environment where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints, even if it means allowing speech that is offensive or biased against certain groups of people]?\u201d Gallup asked.\n\nBut this debate about the bounds of free speech also seems to be influenced by political ideology. Many colleges are seen as liberal havens, so Republicans may feel they have more at stake in this debate. Looked at another way, Democrats may feel they have more at stake since they tend to get the greatest share of the minority vote. In the polls we reviewed, the percentage of Democrats favoring bans on hate speech or statements that offend minority groups was larger than the percentage of Republicans or independents.\n\nTo what extent is difficult to say. The three polls of young Americans that we looked at (from Pew in 2015, Gallup in 2016 and YouGov in 2017) all worded their questions differently and found varying levels of support for the idea of censoring hate speech or statements that offend minorities. At the low end, Gallup found 22 percent support among college students. At the high end, Pew landed on 40 percent among 18- to 34-year-olds.\n\nAsked about the differences between Pew\u2019s narrow question and Sasse\u2019s liberal reinterpretation, a spokesman said the senator was trying to make his point quickly. But sort-of hitting the target doesn\u2019t work when describing polls, which are intricate by nature. No one asked the Pew poll respondents about the First Amendment. No one asked whether it was dangerous. And no one should buy Sasse\u2019s 40 percent statistic about the \u201cdangerous\u201d First Amendment, for which we award Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
