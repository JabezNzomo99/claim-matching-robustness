They dehumanize the people they are sworn to protect and desensitize themselves in order to do that job.\u201d\n\nThis is a genuine quote from Cameron.\n\nThis quote comes from the 2010 book \u201cThe Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron\u201d by Rebecca Keegan. The full passage involves Cameron and collaborator Stan Winston discussing a story problem with the \u201cTerminator 2\u201d script. At the time, the T-100 was little more than a \u201cblob of goo\u201d and Winston urged Cameron to give the character a more recognizable form.\n\nHere\u2019s the excerpt from \u201cThe Futurist\u201d (emphasis ours):\n\nDuring the writing process, he was in his living room excitedly explaining the T-1000 to his friend and collaborator Stan Winston when Winston raised a concern. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the bad guy is,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI need a specific character, a specific image.\u201d To Winston, what Cameron was describing sounded like a blob of goo, not an iconic evildoer. \u201cFrom a story standpoint, I thought it was a problem,\u201d Winston later recalled in an interview for the picture-book history of his story, \u201cThe Winston Effect.\u201d Cameron respected Winston\u2019s instincts for creating memorable characters, and he started reconsidering how he would shape this one. Later that same night, the effects artist got a phone call from his friend. \u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe\u2019s a cop!\u201d The form the T-1000 would take for most of the movie was a Los Angeles police officer. This solved the storytelling dilemma Winston had raised and also gave Cameron an opportunity to underline a central theme in both of the Terminator movies \u2013 how people, especially those in violent jobs, like soldiers and cops, can become barbarized. \u201cThe Terminator films are not really about the human race getting killed of by future machines. They\u2019re about us losing touch with our own humanity and becoming machines, which allows us to kill and brutalize each other,\u201d he says. \u201cCops think all non-cops as less than they are, stupid, weak, and evil. They dehumanize the people they are sworn to protect and desensitize themselves in order to do that job.\u201d\n\nIn a sad twist of fate, this theme of dehumanization was illustrated in the real world a few months before the film\u2019s release in 1991 when police officers were filmed beating an unarmed Black man named Rodney King on the streets of Los Angeles. The incident, which sparked riots and mass protests, was filmed by amateur cameraman George Holliday. A few months before Holliday filmed the King beating, he captured some footage of the \u201cTerminator 2\u201d crew filming at the same location.", "lang": "en"}
