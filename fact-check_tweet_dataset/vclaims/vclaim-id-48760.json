It is also being claimed that \u2018Trump announced Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine next Sunday, and millions of doses are ready from it\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of a vaccine developed by US scientists for COVID-19. Fact: The photo shows a COVID-19 diagnostic test kit developed by Sugentech, a South Korean based company. It is not a vaccine. As on 23 March 2020, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Also, Trump announced FDA\u2019s approval of a Coronavirus \u2018test\u2019, not a vaccine, developed by a company \u2018Roche\u2019 to increase and accelerate the country\u2019s capacity to test for the virus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same image was found in a tweet posted by a journalist. In the tweet, it can be read that \u2018Korea finished developing the 10-minute Covid-19 diagnostic kit and is now ramping up production\u2019. So, it is not a vaccine.\n\nAlso, when searched with the name of the company (\u2018Sugentech\u2019), on its website, it can be found that the posted photo shows \u2018COVID-19 IgM/IgG\u2019, a diagnostic kit for COVID-19. Sugentech is a South Korea based company.\n\nOn the WHO website, it can be read that, as on 23 March 2020, \u2018there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation.\n\nPreviously, when a video was shared with a similar claim (\u2018Trump announced Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine next Sunday\u2019), FACTLY has debunked the claim and published an article, which can be read here. Trump announced FDA\u2019s approval of a Coronavirus \u2018test\u2019, not a vaccine, developed by a company \u2018Roche\u2019 to increase and accelerate the country\u2019s capacity to test for the virus.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of a COVID-19 diagnostic test kit falsely shared as COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
