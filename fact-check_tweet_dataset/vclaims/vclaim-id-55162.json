As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you\u2019re entirely to blame,\u201d the fictitious tweet, dated Nov. 23, 2009, reads. \u201cJohn McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.\u201d\n\nWe could find no evidence that Trump ever posted the tweet in question \u2014 or even any tweet mentioning \u201cpandemic,\u201d \u201cObama,\u201d or \u201cMcCain\u201d in 2009. McCain was the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 election.\n\nIn fact, Trump joined Twitter in March 2009 and he posted only 56 tweets that year, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. Ten years later, in 2019, he tweeted 7,781 times (including retweets).\n\nTrump has in recent months misleadingly compared the novel coronavirus pandemic with the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic, which killed an estimated 12,469 people in the U.S. between April 2009 and April 2010. On Twitter, he\u2019s called the Obama administration\u2019s handling of that pandemic a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d or \u201cdisaster\u201d more than once.\n\nThe bogus Trump tweet is circulating as the U.S. grapples with a rising death toll from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There have been more than 148,000 deaths related to COVID-19 reported in the U.S.\n\nThe fictitious post has circulated since at least April. One link to the image has been shared (including recently by a page that says its mission is to \u201ccall out the hypocrisy of the GOP\u201d) more than 26,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
