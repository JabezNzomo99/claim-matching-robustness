Mr Lidington is overstating the increase in doctors and understating the increase in nurses and midwives.\n\nThe best way to compare NHS staff numbers is to take the latest month, and see how that compares to the same month in previous years. That\u2019s because NHS staff numbers are seasonal \u2013 they tend to surge in the autumn when new people are recruited. Mr Lidington doesn\u2019t appear to have done that.\n\nMr Lidington\u2019s office pointed us to NHS England\u2019s workforce statistics as the source of his claim. It looks like he\u2019s comparing the figures for September 2016 with May 2010 \u2013 when the Conservatives first entered office. These figures match the ones he\u2019s quoted, but it\u2019s not a fair comparison.\n\nUsing the most recent figures Mr Lidington had access to, in September 2016 there were 9,000 more full-time equivalent doctors working for NHS hospitals and community health services in England than there were in the same month in 2010. If we just look at how many individuals are working as doctors, regardless of whether they are full or part-time, the figure is about the same.\n\nOver the same time the number of full-time equivalent nurses, health visitors and midwives increased by about 6,000. There are only about 2,600 more individual people working as nurses and midwives.", "lang": "en"}
