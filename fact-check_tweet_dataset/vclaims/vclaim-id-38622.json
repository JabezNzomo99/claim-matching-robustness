Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of a girl who was raped and murdered by Muslims inside AAP councillor Tahir Hussain\u2019s house during the recent Delhi riots. Fact: The girl in the photo is Jyoti Patidar, a 12th grade student from Parasuliyakalan village in Madhya Pradesh who died under suspicious circumstances at her residence on February 19. There is no relation between the girl in the photo and the recent Delhi riots. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the name of the girl shared in the post was searched on Google, an article published by \u2018Dainik Bhaskar\u2019 with the same photo was found in the search results. From the article, it is understood that Jyoti Patidar, a 12th-grade student from Parasuliyakalan village in Madhya Pradesh died under suspicious circumstances at her residence on February 19. It was first thought that the girl may have died because of a fire accident in the house or by committing suicide. However, her family members and relatives later complained to the police that she might have been raped and killed. More information about the incident can be read here, here and here.\n\n\n\nPeople have demanded the police to quickly investigate the case and arrest the accused by holding a protest rally. The video of this rally and the other related videos can be seen here, here and here. The request letter given to the police by ABVP in reference to the case was posted by someone on Facebook and can be seen here.\n\n\n\nThe video of the press meet held by the police in reference to this case can be seen here. Currently, the case is under investigation.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, a photo of a girl who died under suspicious circumstances in Madhya Pradesh is being wrongly shared in the context of recent Delhi riots as a girl who was raped and murdered by Muslims.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
