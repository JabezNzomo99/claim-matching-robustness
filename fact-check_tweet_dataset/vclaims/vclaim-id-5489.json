At current exchange rates this equals \u00a319.4bn.\n\nThe bulk of the money owed was through the Cohesion Policy, which funds investment in poorer EU regions (including some parts of the UK). These unpaid claims equalled 7% of the planned cohesion budget of \u00a3347m for 2007-13.\n\nPaying out against these past claims means that the EU will have less to money to invest in schemes that run from 2014-2020.\n\nWhy did this build up?\n\nThe volume of claims increased more sharply than expected from 2011 onwards, according to the European Commission.\n\nThe commission suggest the 2008 financial crisis, the 2011 Eurozone crisis and austerity measures by national governments all contributed to increasing the volume of claims.\n\nAt the same time, the ceilings which set the maximum quantity of payments were dropped in 2014.\n\nWhy could it be a problem?\n\nThe main side-effect is a reduction in the money available to fund the 2014-2020 programme.\n\nThe EU also has to pay some interest on late payments, and late payments damage the credibility of funding programmes.\n\nHow will it be paid back?\n\nThe majority of these payments are covered in the 2016 EU budget, so roughly 12.7% of them will be supported by the UK\u2019s regular contribution. \u00a32.4bn will have been supported by the UK.\n\nNo country will provide additional support outside their regular contribution to the EU budget. The price being paid is having less money to spend on current priorities.\n\nIn a conversation earlier today, we understood from the European Commission that it was seeking to reduce the level of these payments. That was reflected in this article when it was first published. They have subsequently clarified that the full amount will be paid.", "lang": "en"}
