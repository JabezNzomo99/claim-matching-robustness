Data from the Department of Defense (DOD) shows casualties \u2013 killed and wounded \u2013 for the conflicts were much higher.\n\nThe image, shared by the Prepare to Take America Back page, claims to show the number of American casualties suffered in some major U.S. conflicts: the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom.\n\nHowever, it appears to only count those killed in combat as casualties, despite the term \u201ccasualty\u201d having a broader definition. (RELATED: Did The Military Get Its Biggest Pay Raise In Almost 10 Years?)\n\n\u201cCasualties when used in military terms always means killed and wounded,\u201d Yale University history professor Mark Peterson told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. \u201cThe wounded in most cases can no longer fight, so are just as much a loss to the military effort as the killed. And the wounded usually bring long term social costs of care for and loss of productivity from the disabled.\u201d\n\nThe DOD defines a casualty as \u201cany person who is lost to the organization by having been declared dead, duty status \u2013 whereabouts unknown, missing, ill, or injured.\u201d Merriam-Webster offers a similar definition for the term.\n\nWhile the post\u2019s numbers do match up with the number of \u201cbattle deaths\u201d listed for each conflict on a Department of Veteran Affairs fact sheet, they only represent a fraction of the total casualties actually suffered. According to historical data from the DOD\u2019s Defense Casualty Analysis System, here are accurate casualty figures \u2013 deaths and wounded in action \u2013 for each conflict:\n\nIt is important to note that these figures do not include ill service members who would be considered casualties under the DOD\u2019s definition, so it\u2019s possible that the casualty figures for each conflict may actually be higher.
