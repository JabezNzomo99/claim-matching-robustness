So thoughtful, you know. We\u2019ve had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the president has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The article claimed that an \"unnamed MSM (mainstream media) news outlet in the United Kingdom is claiming they were recently involved in an interview with Queen Elizabeth II where she unexpectedly complimented U.S. President Donald Trump \u2026 The alleged insider said executives at the organization are \u2018fuming\u2019 because they couldn\u2019t salvage the piece due to her relentless praise of the POTUS.\"\n\nThat \"insider\" was an anonymous member of online forum 4Chan, who posted the account on June 4 (which has since been deleted) on the forum\u2019s \"politically incorrect\" board.\n\nThere is no evidence that the queen ever said this and the story contains no legitimate sources.\n\nThe statement attributed to her appears to have originated in an anonymous post on an online forum, and according to Buckingham Palace\u2019s media center, the queen does not give interviews nor does she speak publicly about political matters.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
