We\u2019ve previously debunked claims connecting her to such crimes, including one that she is on house arrest. Now an image of the celebrity comedian is being shared on social media with the suggestion that it supports these unfounded claims.\n\n\"Ellen you are going down,\" reads the text above a photo of her hugging a child. One post sharing the image says: \"Now I know Ellen don\u2019t got kids. The boat looks nice tho. Epstein island I suppose.\"\n\nIt uses the hashtag #PizzaGate, a reference to the false conspiracy theory that a Washington D.C. pizzeria was the front for a child sex-trafficking ring.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nDeGeneres\u2019 wife, the actress Portia de Rossi, posted the photo on Instagram on Jan. 3, 2016, when they were on vacation in Saint Barthelemy, celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve on DeGeneres\u2019 yacht. The caption says: \"Eva does Ed\u2019s hair #stbarths.\"\n\nEd is de Rossi\u2019s nickname for DeGeneres, who is wearing a pink bow in the picture. Eva is the couple\u2019s niece. In a 2015 episode of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" DeGeneres played a clip of Eva and their other niece Perry singing while riding in the car.\n\nOther photos de Rossi posted from the trip show the couple smiling for a selfie and DeGeneres riding on a watercraft with her mother.\n\nWhat these photos don\u2019t prove: that DeGeneres is connected to a baseless conspiracy theory about child sex-trafficking, or that she was on the island of the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
