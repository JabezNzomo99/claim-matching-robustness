(translated)\u201d. The tweet has now been deleted but its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe same video has also been tweeted by a Pakistani user with the claim that a madrasa student was beaten up in India for refusing to chant \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019.\n\nThe same has been circulated on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News found that the video represents an incident that took place in Meerut. But the claim circulated with it pertains to a different incident that occurred in Delhi.\n\nAlt News looked closely at the video in question, and found a signboard at 0:31 minutes which said, \u2018Sara Hotel Bar & Restaurant\u2019. Alt News searched for the same on Google, and found two of the top three results pertaining to Meerut, UP.\n\nOn the supposition that the incident took place in Meerut, Alt News searched with specific key words, and found a Business Standard article of August 26, 2019 titled, \u2018Mob thrashes man for allegedly molesting girl\u2019.\n\nAlt News also found a video report on the same incident, by Times of India. According to reports, the man seen in the video was thrashed for allegedly having molested a girl inside a moving bus. To confirm that the video does indeed pertain to this incident, Alt News contacted DSP Meerut, who confirmed that the said incident did take place in Meerut.\n\n\u201cSuch an incident did occur. A girl traveling in a bus complained of harassment against a boy seated next to her. The people who were seated inside the bus beat up the boy. The girl has lodged a formal complaint against the boy, who is in jail. An FIR has also been filed over the incident wherein the boy was thrashed, and we will take action against those we identify from the video.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is no communal angle. This is a case of molestation. Police has taken prompt action in this case.\u201d (translated).\n\nThe text accompanying the video claims that this incident took place in Delhi and that a madrasa teacher named Owais was beaten up and killed. It is true that such an incident did take place in Delhi. But the video shared along with it does not pertain to the incident, as shown in our fact-check above. According to a report by Hindustan Times, \u201cA 27-year-old madrasa teacher was beaten to death by at least two hawkers in north Delhi\u2019s Kotwali area on Monday after an argument over the price of a pair of headphones. Family members, however, alleged that the man was thrashed by a group of people. Police said they have arrested the two men and efforts to identify others are being made. The victim, Mohammad Ovais, was a resident of Shamli in Uttar Pradesh and taught in a madrasa in Greater Noida.\u201d The incident occurred on August 27, 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that while an incident did take place in Delhi wherein a madrasa teacher was beaten to death over a petty quarrel, the video circulated along with this claim is from Meerut, and pertains to an incident of alleged molestation, following which people beat up the accused.", "lang": "en"}
