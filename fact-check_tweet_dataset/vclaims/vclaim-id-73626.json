Mughal Garden at Rastrapati Bhawan will now be known as \"Dr Rajendra Prasad Garden\" I don't know who has named it Mughal Garden at first place. Thanks for naming the famous garden on the name of Dr Rajendra Prasad. \u2014 Sudhir Deshpande (@Donix2020) August 21, 2020 \n\n\n\nDr \ufeffRajendra Prasad was the first President of the Republic of India (1950\u201362). He was also a lawyer and journalist. Mughal gardens have been renamed to 'Dr. Rajendra Prasad Garden'. The claim is false. No such reports stating the name change were found. The official website of the Rashtrapati Bhavan still states the gardens as Mughal Gardens.\n\n\"The rumours have been viral for quite a while, maybe four or five days, but it is not true. There has not been any name change of the kind as yet,\" BOOMLive quoted an official at the Rashtrapati Bhavan as saying.
