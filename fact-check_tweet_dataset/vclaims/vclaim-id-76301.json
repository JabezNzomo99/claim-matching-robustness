Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the former secretary of state said:\n\n\"We bailed out\" Johnson Controls Inc. when \"we saved the auto industry\" and \"now they want to avoid paying taxes.\"\n\nThe world's leading maker of car batteries, and a manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment and controls, was not a direct recipient of the federal bailouts of the auto industry. But Johnson Controls did push for the funds. And as Clinton indicated, the company has said it will save $150 million per year in taxes by moving its headquarters to Ireland.\n\nSo we gave Clinton a Mostly True for her claim in the debate.\n\nBut her claim in the TV ad isn\u2019t as much on target.\n\nIn 2008, of course, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape as the recession took hold. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind.\n\n \n\n That December, President George W. Bush used $17.6 billion in TARP money to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. And in 2009, President Barack Obama continued the rescue of the two automakers that was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money, about $70 billion of which was repaid.\n\nBut Johnson Controls was in much better condition. It certainly would've taken a major financial hit had the automakers gone under. But it did not directly receive any bailout funds.\n\nIn a TV ad, Clinton said: \"When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like\" Johnson Controls \"begged taxpayers for a bailout, and they got one.\"\n\nThe company did push Congress to approve the 2008-\u201909 federal bailout of the auto makers. But it did not itself get a bailout.", "lang": "en"}
