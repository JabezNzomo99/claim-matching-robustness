Bush.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 2019, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an old and persistent rumor holding that the Islamic State (IS) leader had been released from a United States detention facility in 2009 under the Obama administration started to recirculate on social media:\n\nThis is not accurate. While al-Baghdadi was once held at a U.S. detention facility called Camp Bucca in Iraq, he was released in 2004, more than four years before Barack Obama took office.\n\nThe rumor that IS leader al-Baghdadi (who was born Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai) was released during the Obama administration first started to gain prominence in 2014 as the U.S. negotiated an exchange for soldier Bowe Bergdahl. As conservative pundits accused Obama of having a so-called terrorist \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policy, some pointed to al-Baghdadi\u2019s alleged 2009 release as an example.\n\nAmerica left Iraq as a state not able to stand on its own. And the head of this band of savages is a man named Abu al Baghdadi \u2013 the new Osama bin Laden \u2013 a man released by Obama in 2009 who started ISIS a year later. When Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers, saying \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New York.\u201d And as the nation of Iraq teeters on the brink of total destruction, there is no question that the march will inevitably continue toward the West and the United States.\n\nThe claim that al-Baghdadi said \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New York\u201d as he left Camp Bucca, as well as the claim that he was released in 2009 during the Obama administration, can both be traced back to a 2014 Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King.\n\nKing told The Daily Beast that he remembered al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2009 after seeing news reports about how he had become the leader of IS in 2014, and that he was a \u201clittle surprised\u201d by al-Baghdadi\u2019s rise in the terrorist ranks:\n\nAlthough King told The Daily Beast he remembered al-Baghdadi being released from Camp Bucca in 2009, the Defense Department disputed this account. According to a statement from the Pentagon, al-Baghdadi was captured in February 2004 and then released a few months later in December.\n\nA U.S. official also disputed King\u2019s account in a statement to ABC News. The official said that he wasn\u2019t sure exactly when al-Baghdadi had been released, but said that he had \u201cresumed his activities\u201d and had been \u201cactive with the group [ISIS]\u201d since 2006, two years before Obama took office.\n\nWhen pressed on this by ABC News, King said that he \u201ccould be mistaken\u201d about the timing of al-Baghdadi\u2019s release. While King said that the man who left Camp Bucca in 2009 saying \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New York\u201d was a \u201cdead ringer\u201d for al-Baghdadi, the U.S. colonel conceded that he didn\u2019t connect al-Baghdadi to the 2009 encounter until he saw photographs of the IS leader in 2014:\n\nSo the claim that al-Baghdadi was released in 2009 is largely based on a U.S. colonel\u2019s recollection of a five-year-old encounter after glimpsing a recent photograph of al-Baghdadi. The only other piece of \u201cevidence\u201d to support this claim comes from an alleged \u201cPentagon document\u201d cited by The Telegraph about a terrorist named \u201cAbu Duaa.\u201d\n\nWhile al-Baghdadi may have used the name \u201cAbu Duaa\u201d at one point, this is likely a nom de guerre, a fake name an individual assumes during war, that multiple members of IS used. The Telegraph quotes Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British special forces commander who helped U.S. efforts against al-Qaeda in Iraq, saying that \u201cwe either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times\u201d:\n\n\u201cAbu Duaa was connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of local civilians in Qaim\u201d, says a Pentagon document. \u201cHe would kidnap individuals or entire families, accuse them, pronounce sentence and then publicly execute them.\u201d Why such a ferocious individual was deemed fit for release in 2009 is not known. One possible explanation is that he was one of thousands of suspected insurgents granted amnesty as the US began its draw down in Iraq. Another, though, is that rather like Keyser S\u00f6ze, the enigmatic crimelord in the film The Usual Suspects, he may actually be several different people. \u201cWe either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times, he is like a wraith who keeps reappearing, and I am not sure where fact and fiction meet,\u201d said Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British special forces commander who helped US efforts against al-Qaeda in Iraq. \u201cThere are those who want to promote the idea that this man is invincible, when it may actually be several people using the same nom de guerre.\u201d\n\nThe evidence supporting the claim that al-Baghdadi was released from Camp Bucca in 2009 is flimsy at best. It is based on a single colonel\u2019s years-old recollection and a document mentioning a nom de guerre.\n\nThe official story is that al-Baghdadi was captured in February 2004, held at the Camp Bucca detention center, and then released a few months later in December.\n\nHere\u2019s a statement from the Pentagon about IS leader al-Baghdadi\u2019s detention and release from Camp Bucca in 2004:\n\nIn addition to the Pentagon\u2019s statement, Business Insider obtained al-Baghdadi\u2019s detainee records through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015. The official documents show that al-Baghdadi was captured on Feb. 4, 2004, and that the date of his release was Dec. 8.\n\nWe reached out to the Department of Defense for more information about al-Baghdadi\u2019s release and will update this article if more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
