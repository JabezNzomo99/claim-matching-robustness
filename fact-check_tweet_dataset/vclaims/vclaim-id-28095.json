And the U.S. agriculture secretary came to town and cast doubt on the future viability of any small dairy farms.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, says Wisconsinites should lay the blame at the feet of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a Dec. 2, 2019, tweet, Pocan said Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers \u2014 forcing more than 1600 dairy farms to close.\"\n\nTrade tensions are certainly having an impact, but is it reasonable to blame them \u2014 and Trump \u2014 for that many closures?\n\nDairy was in trouble long before Trump\n\nPocan\u2019s is roughly correct on the number of closures.\n\nWisconsin had 9,288 dairy farms on Feb. 1, 2017 \u2014 about two weeks after Trump was sworn in. By Dec. 1, 2019, that number dropped to 7,337, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That\u2019s a loss of 1,951 farms, even more than Pocan referenced.\n\nBut Wisconsin dairy farms closing is hardly a new trend.\n\nThe number of milking operations here has plummeted by more than half in the last 15 years, from 15,000 at the end of 2004 to about 7,300 as of December 2019.\n\nThat trend has indeed worsened under Trump, however.\n\nIn the 34 months since Trump\u2019s election Wisconsin has lost an average of 57 dairy farms per month. In the 34 months before that, the monthly average was 33 farms.\n\nPocan blamed the closures not only on Trump, but specifically on the president\u2019s trade wars.\n\nDefending the claim, Pocan spokesman Usamah Andrabi pointed to a category of Chinese dairy exports that dropped from mid-2018 to mid-2019 amid retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\"That being said, I think we can reasonably attribute the majority of these farm closures to the effects of China\u2019s tariffs/Trump\u2019s trade war,\" Andrabi said.\n\nPocan\u2019s claim \u2014 and his spokesman\u2019s defense \u2014 oversimplify an industry facing a complex set of economic pressures.\n\nLow milk prices, historic levels of oversupply and changing consumer demand were dealing devastating blows to dairy farmers long before Trump picked a fight with China.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel summarized the demand struggles this way as part of its Dairyland in Distress project, an exhaustive examination of the state\u2019s trademark industry.\n\nSales of milk as a beverage have fallen steadily since the 1970s, with fewer parents encouraging their children to drink milk than ever before. Soy milk and almond milk \u2014 which dairy farmers point out aren't real milk \u2014 and scores of sports drinks have flooded the beverage market.\n\nAnd although consumption of cheese, yogurt and butter have all increased, they've not always kept pace with runaway production. Today, for instance, U.S. commercial and government cheese stockpiles are at about 1 billion pounds \u2014 the highest level in a century.\n\nAt the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have shrunk in response to tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum. Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65 percent, according to industry figures, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10 percent.\n\nSo tariffs are a factor in limiting demand, but far from the only one.\n\nAnd supply is a major problem as well.\n\nAdvances in genetics and feed science mean the average cow today produces about four times more milk than it would have in the 1950s. This leads to a market saturation that both generates waste \u2014 some farmers are forced to dump milk down the drain for lack of a buyer \u2014 and contributes to reduced prices.\n\nMilk prices have nudged up in recent months but before that went through a yearslong downturn that often left prices below the break-even point for farms.\n\n\"There were four years of the depressed milk prices before the trade war started,\" Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition, told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"If you go back and you look, we've always had attrition going on.\"\n\nPocan said Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers\" that has forced more than 1,600 dairy farms to close.\n\nSetting aside the rhetorical overreach of calling it a trade war \"against\" state farmers, Pocan\u2019s finger-pointing is off the mark.\n\nWisconsin has lost that many dairy farms \u2014 slightly more even \u2014 since Trump took office. Trade wars certainly haven\u2019t helped, and accordingly farm closures have increased under Trump.\n\nBut it\u2019s not reasonable to attribute all the closures to Trump and trade tension when this trend dates back more than a decade. Milk prices, over-production and changing consumer demand have all played key roles in devastating the dairyland economy and shuttering Wisconsin farms.\n\nPocan\u2019s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That\u2019s what we call Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
