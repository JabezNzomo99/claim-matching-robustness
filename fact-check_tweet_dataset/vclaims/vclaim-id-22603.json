It has been shared over 75,000 times.\n\nIt is correct if you define \u201clargest democratic vote\u201d in a specific way.\n\nMore people (17,410,742) voted to leave the EU in 2016 than have voted for any other single electoral option in British political history.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not the largest vote in terms of the percentage of people who voted for a single option. Of those who voted, 52% of people voted to leave the EU in 2016, compared to 67% of people who voted to stay in the European Community in 1975, the 68% who voted against changing the electoral system in 2011, or the 55% who voted for the Conservative party at the 1931 general election.\n\nAnother way of interpreting \u201clargest democratic vote\u201d is the vote in which the most people participated. In this sense, the EU referendum was not quite the biggest vote in British political history.\n\n33,551,983 people cast a vote in the 2016 referendum\u2014which was 72% of all people registered to vote.\n\nSlightly more votes\u201433,614,074\u2014were cast in the 1992 general election, which was won by John Major\u2019s Conservative Party.\n\n78% of people registered to vote in 1992 did so, which is a higher turnout than in the 2016 referendum. Several other general elections in the twentieth century saw a higher turnout too.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about this topic here.", "lang": "en"}
