These messages are sent with the intention of deceiving the user and prompting them to act in a certain way. WhatsApp lists the following characteristics of a hoax message: (1) The message content includes instructions to forward the message. The viral forward does ask the user to forward it to other people. (2) The message claims you can avoid punishment, like account suspension, if you forward the message. In this case, the message says that the user's display picture could be misused by terrorists, hackers and ISIS. (3) The message content includes a reward or gift from WhatsApp or another person. (4) The sender claims to be affiliated with WhatsApp. In this case, the message is attributed to WhatsApp CEO and the commissioner of Delhi, to make it more credible.
