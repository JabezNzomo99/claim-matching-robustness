See video here\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is nearly three years old and the man seen dancing is not MLA Saryu Roy.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video had been shared by over 5,000 Facebook users. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nMany users on Facebook as well as Twitter have shared the video with the same claim.\n\nSome media houses have also used the video.\n\nAfter selecting a few key frames in the video, we did a reverse search which led us to some YouTube uploads of the very video. This video was uploaded on January 18, 2017. So clearly, it has nothing to do with the Jharkhand assembly election results declared on December 23. This video has been shared widely as \"Tau ka dance\" or \"Dadaji dancing\".\n\nWe also spoke to Saryu Roy himself. Fresh after the election victory, he said, \"I am not the man dancing in that video. I don't even know who is dancing in that video but would like to appreciate his sense of humor. The video has been released on the right time and right occasion!!\"\n\nThus, it is clear that the viral video is not of Saryu Roy. It is an old video. AFWA, however, could not independently find the identity of the person seen in the viral video.", "lang": "en"}
