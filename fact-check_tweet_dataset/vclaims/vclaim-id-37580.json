His administration has reportedly eyed other sources of funding.\n\nWe do know, however, that Trump\u2019s family has not made any announcement that it will be donating $1 billion for the wall through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nA headline spreading that falsehood recently appeared on a number of websites \u2014 including trump-feed.com, thedailywire.site and toptopic.club \u2014 and has circulated on social media, where some commenters cheered the supposed announcement.\n\nBut the story is actually the product of a publisher with a history of starting viral hoaxes. America\u2019s Last Line of Defense published the story on wearethellod.com Dec. 30.\n\nFor the past several years, that publisher, through a number of websites, has spread stories it deems satire, but that are often political in nature and frequently consumed and shared as news. We\u2019ve written about many of them.\n\nThe websites that copied the story about the supposed Trump family donation failed to label the story as satire, which might have still become clear to those reading beyond the headline. For example, the story quotes \u201cArt Tubolls\u201d \u2014 a fake name that often appears in Last Line of Defense stories \u2014 and assigns him the nonexistent title of \u201cDirector of Presidential Image and Propaganda.\u201d\n\nChristopher Blair, the man behind America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, has openly stated his intent to troll conservatives by tricking them into believing made-up stories.\n\nHis claims often gain traction online: One of the most viral falsehoods on Facebook last year, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis, was a Last Line of Defense story about Michael Jordan stepping down from Nike\u2019s board of directors in protest over controversial advertising. We debunked that one, too.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nSaslow, Eli. \u201c\u2018Nothing on this page is real\u2019: How lies become truth in online America.\u201d The Washington Post. 17 Nov 2018.", "lang": "en"}
