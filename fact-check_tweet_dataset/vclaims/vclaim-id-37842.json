It was retweeted nearly 9,000 times. It recently appeared on a number of Facebook pages including pro-Scottish independence group Yes 2, where it was shared more than 300 times.\n\nThe post claims that a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit means passports cannot be imported because there will be no trade deal between the EU and the UK. Since then a Brexit deal was agreed with the EU allowing an 11-month transition period for the two sides to negotiate a future relationship.\n\nThe UK cannot strike individual trade deals with EU member states because members negotiate as one trading bloc.\n\nIt is hoped that a basic deal for major issues such as trade and security will be agreed before the end of the period. But there is still a possibility the UK could get to the end of the transition on 31 December 2020 without a deal and end up on World Trade Organisation terms.\n\nThe UK government announced in December 2017 that new passports would be changing design after leaving the EU. The reference to the \u2018European Union\u2019 will be removed and the colour will change from burgundy to blue. Passports in the UK were blue from the 1920s until 1988, when a common format was introduced across the EU.\n\nThe new passport design was put out to tender by the Home Office, and EU procurement rules required them to consider bids from European companies.\n\nEU laws require the award of contracts by member states must not discriminate nationally. This will continue during the transition period and may well form some part of an EU-UK trade deal.\n\nThe contract to produce the passports was won by Gemalto, a French-Dutch company preferred over previous contract holder, De La Rue, which is based in the UK.\n\nGemalto has not confirmed where the passports will be produced, but its factory in Tczew, Poland, does produce \u201ccore electronic passport technology\u201d for the company. Unite the Union claimed Gemalto had \u201cnow outsourced the printing of UK passports to a Polish firm\u201d.\n\nBut can the passports be imported into the UK? The short answer is Yes.\n\nAfter 31 January 2020 the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but it will remain in the customs union and single market during the transition period. This means that trade with Europe will continue on the same basis as before until it ends.\n\nHad the UK left under a no deal Brexit without a trade agreement, passports would still have been imported. A \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit would not stop imports to the UK, it would mean imports could be more costly as they may be affected by new tariffs, taxes and administrative checks on both sides of the border.\n\nThe new blue passports are being made by a French-Dutch company, thanks to EU non-discrimination rules, and it is possible they are produced in Poland. However, whether the UK leaves the EU under \u2018no deal\u2019 or agrees a trade deal, it would not stop passports being imported into the UK from Europe.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
