Scott Walker travels the country in his not-quite-formal-presidential bid, Democrats in Wisconsin complain he\u2019s neglecting the state.\n\nThat criticism extends to the 2015-\u201917 state budget, which will soon be up for votes in the Assembly and Senate.\n\nDemocrats (and a few Republicans) have complained about a variety of matters in the budget, and said the package was poorly prepared. Such complaints were raised in a news release issued the day before work on the budget began in the Joint Finance Committee.\n\nThe Democrats on the committee complained that lawmakers were given a \"last minute error document\" that ran 110 pages.\n\n\"Drafting errors may happen, but I highly doubt that 110 pages and millions of dollars\u2019 worth of mistakes and unintended consequences are anything but the product of an extremely distracted Governor not putting his home state first,\" state Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) said in a news release issued by the Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee.\n\nDid Walker\u2019s budget have an unusual number of budget corrections that were cleaned up in the final hours?\n\nSuch last-minute correction documents are not new. They even have a formal bureaucratic name -- an \"errata report.\"\n\nLike past governors, Walker issued his budget in February of 2015. The document itself runs 1,800 pages, with most of it being highly technical in nature.\n\nThe errata report is a document that corrects mistakes identified between the time when the budget is announced and when the Legislature begins its work.\n\nIn April 2013, during the last state budget cycle, the Walker Administration sent lawmakers an errata report fixing about a dozen items and recommending eight amendments. A March 15, 2013 memo corrected 61 more items, all of which appeared to be very technical.\n\nIn Walker\u2019s first budget, for 2011-\u201913, similar memos corrected about 40 items.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s final budget included about 75 corrections in memos issued in March 2009.\n\n\"When you\u2019re dealing with an 1,800 page bill you\u2019re going to find a mistake or two,\" said Legislative Fiscal Bureau Director Bob Lang, who has been with the agency since 1971. \"I don\u2019t recall a budget where there weren\u2019t technical changes.\"\n\nDepartment of Administrator spokesman Cullen Werwie said much the same in an email: \"Nearly every budget has an errata to make minor and technical changes. This year is no different.\"\n\nCompared with recent budgets, the errata report from the Department of Administration for the 2015-\u201917, dated April 15, 2015, budget made more corrections -- about 110 by our count -- than those in the past several budgets.\n\nOn April 13, 2015, the Joint Finance Committee received a smaller document with 12 items that needed to be cleaned up.\n\nWhat about the portion of Taylor\u2019s claim that the changes involved millions of dollars?\n\nThe \"millions\" figure cited corresponds with the April 13 errata memo, which says the changes will decrease the state\u2019s general fund balance by $2.87 million.\n\nTaylor aide Maggie Gau noted that \"millions\" also applies to a figure that shows up on page 106 of the April 15 memo.\n\nWalker wanted to move the worker\u2019s compensation division from the Department of Workforce Development to the Officer of the Commissioner of Insurance. The original budget failed to include funding for the workers comp agency for the period leading up to that transition. That added $15.67 million in expense.\n\nPage 52 of the memo said there were another $4.8 million in expense related to \"supplies and services\" that were not accounted for in the move of the workers compensation division.\n\nThat\u2019s at least $20 million in cleaned up mistakes.\n\nOther corrections included in the errata memo were substantial policy changes. Among the corrections:\n\nWalker\u2019s original budget eliminated mention of the Wisconsin Idea as the foundation of the University of Wisconsin System. (Walker claimed at the time that it was a mistake, but records showed the budget drafting staff following directions issued by Walker\u2019s team.) The memo restored the Wisconsin Idea language.\n\nThe memo also created a new policy, and proposed capping UW System undergraduate tuition increases at no more than the annual increase in the consumer price index.\n\nTaylor said that Walker\u2019s proposed budget \"contained 110 pages and millions of dollars\u2019 worth of mistakes\" that were corrected with a follow-up document.\n\nTaylor is right on the number of the tweaks made in the budget and that they affected millions of dollars in the state budget. But such clean-up memos are a routine part of the budget process -- though there were a bit more this time than in the three previous state budgets.", "lang": "en"}
