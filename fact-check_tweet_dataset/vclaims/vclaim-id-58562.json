But that doesn\u2019t mean, as the ad implies, that $39 million of federal stimulus money was spent directly on the project.\n\n \n\n \"That\u2019s not the case at all,\" said Marilyn Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Administration, which oversees the capitol building.\n\n \n\n The Build America Bonds were created as part of the 2009 stimulus -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A U.S. Treasury Department summary notes that the federal government pays 35 percent of the interest costs on the bonds, and the state or local government issuing the bond pays the rest of the interest.\n\n \n\n The idea is to give states a lower interest rate and thereby boost infrastructure projects and the economy.\n\n \n\n The state sells the bond to investors, and it\u2019s the state -- not the federal government -- that pays back the principal on the bond, Jacobson said.\n\n \n\n The costs for the federal government to finance its share of the interest over the life of the bond -- which matures in 2030 -- would be a fraction of the $39 million cited in the ad.\n\n \n\n Jim MacMurray, vice president of finance at the Kansas Development Finance Authority, estimated the federal government\u2019s total cost of paying for its share of interest would come to $8.8 million over the life of the 20-year bond.\n\n \n\n There\u2019s another problem with the Crossroads claim -- the contention that this is simply a project to \"upgrade politicians\u2019 offices.\"\n\n \n\n It\u2019s true that office space renovations have been part of the project. But Jacobson said that\u2019s just one part of an overall restoration to completely overhaul the state capitol, which is more than 100 years old. Work includes replacing the leaky limestone exterior, installing new heating and air conditioning systems as well as getting rid of century-old electrical wiring, she said.\n\n \n\n \"Office space is a very small piece of the whole thing,\" Jacobson said.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The Crossroads ad says that $39 million in stimulus money went to \"office upgrades for politicians,\" a reference to the latest phase in renovating the Kansas state capitol building.\n\n \n\n First of all, the $39 million is not a direct payment for the renovation. That\u2019s the amount the state will repay along with most of the interest through a bond program started by the 2009 stimulus.\n\n \n\n The federal government pays for some interest costs, but those expenses are nowhere near $39 million.\n\n \n\n Although it\u2019s true that office upgrades are part of the project, new offices are just one part of a much bigger project to completely restore the building.\n\n \n\n We rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
