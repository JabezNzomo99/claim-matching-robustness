Theyre work boots, but lets be honest. They dont like to work Said Timberlands new appointment in a shocking reveal during a press conference. Timberlands former Ceo declined to comment stating that he doesnt want to say if he disagrees nor agrees with the new Ceos statement. Rappers such as Notorious B.I.G. mention the Timberland brand in many of his hit songs and black people are already thinking hes probably rolling in his grave after hearing that black people are actually wearing boots in the summer time.\n\nHowever, none of this was true, as Naha Daily\u2018s disclaimer identifies the site\u2019s content as \u201ccompletely fictional\u201d and \u201cbased off current events in urban culture and entertainment.\u201d Among the site\u2019s previous stories were articles headlined \u201cPolice Dog Wins Medal for Killing Ferguson Protester\u201d and \u201cCop Shoots 1Yr Old Black Baby After Mistaking Pacifier for Gun.\u201d\n\nThis fake news piece mirrored an older false rumor that Timberland is owned by the Ku Klux Klan.", "lang": "en"}
