In the aftermath of the fatal shooting, which took place at a protest in response to an incident involving a white police officer shooting a Black man named Jacob Blake several times in the back, social media was flooded with information about the identity of the shooter. One of the most viral claims was that Rittenhouse had once attended a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump:\n\nThis is a genuine still from a Trump rally held in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 30, and the encircled person appears to be Rittenhouse.\n\nBuzzFeed News was the first outlet to draw attention to this video.

Kyle Howard Rittenhouse\u2019s social media presence is filled with him posing with weapons, posting \u201cBlue Lives Matter,\u201d and supporting Trump for president. Footage from the Des Moines, Iowa, rally on Jan. 30 shows Rittenhouse feet away from the president, in the front row, to the left of the podium. He posted a TikTok video from the event.\n\nThe alleged Kenosha shooter appeared to have two TikTok accounts and a Facebook page. While these social media pages have since been deleted, screenshots show that Rittenhouse posted in support of conservative causes such as Blue Lives Matter. A brief TikTok bio on one account, for instance, contained the phrases \u201cTrump 2020\u201d and \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d:\n\nWhen White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who recently announced that she was stepping down from her position, was asked about Rittenhouse\u2019s attendance at a Trump Rally, she said:\n\nTrump 2020 campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh also released a statement, saying:", "lang": "en"}
