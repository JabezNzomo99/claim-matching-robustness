Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nWhen the photo was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a YouTube video with the same photo as thumbnail was found in the search results. \n\n\n\nThe title of the YouTube video is \u2013 \u2018A Rare Clip of Rajiv Gandhi in the Funeral Prayer of Bacha Khan \u2013 KP Digest\u2019 (Bacha Khan is another name of Abdul Ghaffar Khan). Visuals similar to the photo can be seen in the video. Even in a tweet by a Pakistani Politician, it can found that the photo is related to Abdul Ghaffar Khan\u2019s funeral. \n\n\n\nAlso, in a news article published by AP News in 1988, it can be read that Rajiv Gandhi \u2018travelled to Peshawar to pay tribute to Ghaffar Khan\u2019.\n\nIndira Gandhi\u2019s funeral photos and video can be seen here and here, which look very different from the posted photo.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi from Abdul Ghaffar Khan\u2019s funeral is being shared as a photo taken at Indira\u2019s funeral.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
