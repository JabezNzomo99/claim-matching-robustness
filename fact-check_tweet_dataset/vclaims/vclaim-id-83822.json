The masked man in the photo is actually a British national known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d who was killed in 2015.\n\nAn IS group executioner allegedly responsible for thousands of deaths is walking free in Canada after being pardoned by Trudeau, according to a meme shared several thousand times on social media.\n\nHowever, the man standing in the photo cannot be living in Canada, because he is dead.\n\nThe photo in the meme is a still frame of an official video published by an Islamic State group\u2019s propaganda agency, Al Hayat, in 2014. It depicts late American journalist and AFP contributor James Foley, moments before his death by beheading.\n\nFoley\u2019s executioner, standing on the right in the photo, was identified by the US Department of Defence as Mohammed Emwazi, a British national better known as \u201cJihadi John.\u201d\n\nEmwazi was first reported dead by US officials in November 2015. His death was later confirmed in the January 2016 issue of ISIS magazine Dabiq, AFP reported at the time.\n\nEmwazi did not leave the Islamic State group to move to Canada, and died near Raqqa, Syria, killed by a drone strike according to US officials, or shot in the back in battle according to the Islamic State group.\n\nThe issue of returning Canadian jihadists continues to raise concerns. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer accuses Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government of excessive leniency in the matter.\n\nGovernment officials such as minister of public safety Ralph Goodale insist that there are consequences for returning fighters, but also point to the difficulties raised by the burden of proof in the prosecution of crimes committed abroad, particularly in war theatres.\n\nThe government says there are an estimated 60 Canadian citizens who left Canada and returned after being involved in terrorist activities overseas. Four have been charged and two have been convicted so far, Goodale said on December 13, 2018.

He died in 2015 while still a member of the Islamic State group.", "lang": "en"}
