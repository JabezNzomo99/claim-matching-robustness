Chase Burnett, the bill\u2019s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16. \n\n \n\n The bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law.\n\n \n\n A press release warned of synthetic marijuana\u2019s dangers:\n\n \n\n \"As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,\" it said.\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what\u2019s this about violence, bodily harm and death?\n\n \n\n A Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor\u2019s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies.\n\n \n\n The form of synthetic marijuana that\u2019s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as \"Spice\" and \"K2.\" \n\n \n\n Georgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase\u2019s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions. \n\n \n\n There\u2019s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S.\n\n \n\n Federal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson Kan., newspaper in November 2009.\n\n \n\n All signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply.\n\n \n\n Workers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\n \n\n In 2010, they received 2,906 calls; in 2011, there were 6,959.\n\n \n\n About 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug.\n\n \n\n Existing data support Deal\u2019s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital\u2019s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011.\n\n \n\n Rapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug\u2019s most common effects, researchers have found. \n\n \n\n Media accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal.\n\n \n\n Whether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they\u2019re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug\u2019s lethality, but there have been \"scattered reports of deaths,\" said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey.\n\n \n\n A count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances.\n\n \n\n Consider Burnett\u2019s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled.\n\n \n\n Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths:\n\u2022 Two chemicals used in synthetic marijuana were found in the system of a man, 43, who died Sept. 8 in Cherokee County. The official cause of death was chronic high blood pressure.\n\u2022 Toxicology results are pending in the Feb. 20 death of a 26-year-old Clarke County man. Police found two packages of synthetic marijuana on his bathroom sink, one partially used.\n\nWe found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal\u2019s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there\u2019s cause for concern.\n\n \n\n For instance:\n\u2022 In September, a Bulloch County man told emergency dispatchers he and his girlfriend smoked Spice and it made him act \"crazy,\" a sheriff\u2019s report said. When deputies arrived, they found him holding his girlfriend, who was bloody and beaten. He said he attacked her.\n\u2022 In 2010, an 18-year-old Iowa man fatally shot himself after smoking the drug.\n\n\n\n To sum up:\n\n \n\n Evidence supports Deal\u2019s claim that use of the drug has \"dramatically increased,\" as has synthetic marijuana-related \"bodily harm.\" Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too.\n\n \n\n The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\n \n\n Deal\u2019s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
