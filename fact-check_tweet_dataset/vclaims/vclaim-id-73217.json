The posts are misleading; neither image was taken during the two governors' successive administrations.\n\nThe misleading post, which has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, for example here and here contains two photos: one of a relatively quiet street, the other of a street blocked by cars and scooters.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe top photo\u2019s Indonesian-language caption says: \u201cTanah Abang during the Ahok era\u201d.\n\n\u201cAhok\u201d is the nickname of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who served as governor of Jakarta from 2014 to 2017. A photo of him has been added on the left hand side of the street image.\n\nThe bottom photo\u2019s Indonesian caption says: \u201cTanah Abang during the 'Peribumi' era\u201d.\n\n\"Peribumi\" is likely a misspelling of the Indonesian word \"pribumi\", which means indigenous or native Indonesian. It is a reference to current Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, who used it in his inauguration speech on October 16, 2017. A photo of Baswedan has been added on the right hand side of the street image.\n\nAFP conducted a reverse image search of the photo purportedly showing the area during Anies Baswedan's administration and found was used in this article from Jakarta-based news outlet Media Indonesia published on May 16, 2017.\n\nBaswedan was sworn in as Jakarta governor on October 17, 2017.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe photo\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cStreet vendors operate on side roads of Jati Baru street, Tanah Abang region, Jakarta, Thursday, May 11\u201d.\n\nAFP conducted a reverse image search on the top photo purportedly showing the area during Purnama\u2019s administration and traced the photograph back to this August 13, 2013 image published on Merdeka.com which shows the Tanah Abang business area.\n\nPurnama was sworn in as Jakarta governor on November 19, 2014.\n\nAt the time the image was taken, the Jakarta governor was now-President Joko Widodo. Purnama was his deputy governor.\n\nA translation of the Indonesian headline reads: \u201cAhok says the situation in Blok G -- where new kiosks sold unlawfully by applicants -- resembles that in Marunda\"\n\nBlok G refers to the Blok G building in Tanah Abang market, which was constructed to house street vendors outside the market.\n\n\"Marunda\" refers to a low-cost apartment provided by the Jakarta city administration in the north of the capital.\n\nAFP has circled the photo used in the misleading Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
