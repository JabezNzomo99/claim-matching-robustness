No, that's not true: An image of the purported Trump tweet was created by an image generator app. Trump never tweeted the call for a civil war. The fake tweet may be a reaction to a real Trump tweet quoting someone else warning that Trump's impeachment would cause \"a Civil War like fracture\" in the United States.\n\nThe fake tweet meme (archived here) was posted on October 5, 2019 under the title \"DONALD TRUMP IS TOTALLY INSANE\". The fake tweet read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThere are several ways to know the tweet is fake. First, it is not on Trump's Twitter feed. Next, a examination of the image shows it is not a real tweet:\n\nThe image does not have a time stamp. and it also has an \"ImageQuote\" logo, revealing that it was created with an image quote app:\n\nThe fake tweet appeared soon after President Trump posted this tweet:\n\n....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\" Pastor Robert Jeffress,\n\nTrump was not suggesting the country needed a civil war. He was sharing a warning given days earlier by Rev. Robert Jeffress, the pastor of a large Baptist church in Dallas, Texas, during a TV appearance on FOX News. The Dallas Observer newspaper reported:\n\nResponding to a question about evangelical Christians' response to impeachment efforts in the U.S. House of Representatives, Jeffress said Democrats are only seeking to impeach Trump because he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\n\n\"That's the unpardonable sin for which the Democrats will never forgive him,\" Jeffress said. \"And I do want to make this prediction this morning: If the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I'm afraid it will cause a civil war-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\"", "lang": "en"}
