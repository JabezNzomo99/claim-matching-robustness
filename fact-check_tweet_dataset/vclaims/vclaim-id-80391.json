An Indian passport holder with an ECR stamp on his / her passport will have to obtain clearance from the office of Protector of Emigrants (POE), Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs to travel to certain countries for the purpose of employment.\n\nThese countries are known as ECR countries are as \u2013\n\nThe government insists on ECR when travelling to these countries as they do not have strict laws regulating the entry and employment of foreign nationals and also do not provide for proper grievance redressal to migrant workers.\n\nWho falls under the ECR category?\n\nECR status is given to people who have not cleared Class X exams.\n\nTheir passports are endorsed with an ECR stamp / seal / remark in the second or last page of the passport at the time of issue of passport.\n\nIf there is no specific mention / endorsement of ECR on the passport, it means that the passport holders fall under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) Category.\n\nWhat is the purpose of ECR?\n\nECR status aims at protection and welfare of Indians, specifically unskilled and uneducated labourers, who are are vulnerable to exploitation while working in a foreign country.\n\nEmigration clearance (EC) is a safety measure which ensures that they will not be duped overseas and is granted after verifying offered salary, working terms and conditions of employment contract.\n\nAccording to the Emigration Act 1983, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs is responsible for the emigration and return of the emigrants. Indian citizens who go to a foreign country with the purpose of employment are called emigrants. The Act mandates for emigrants under ECR category to get an emigration clearance and recruiters to register with the Protector of Emigrants.\n\nSince October 2007, ECR status passport holders do not require an emigration clearance to travel to these countries for purposes other than employment. Before that, they had to follow the ECR suspension (ECRS) system which involved getting an ECRS stamp for trips on tourist / visit visa. The abolition of ECRS put an end to the harassment and hassle ECR category passport holders had to go through while travelling abroad for purposes other than employment.\n\nHow many people have been granted Emigration Clearance?\n\nNumber of Indian workers who emigrated through Emigration Clearance to 18 notified Emigration Clearance Required (ECR) countries is as follows:\n\nBetween 2012 -2015, around 7.5 \u2013 8 lakh Indian citizens were given emigration clearance. This dipped to around 5 lakh passport holders in 2016.\n\nWhy has the government proposed orange passports for ECR category?\n\nThe official spokesperson of the Ministry of External affairs on January 12 informed that the government has decided to do away with the last page of the passport which contains ECR and other information such as name of the Father, Mother, Spouse, Address, and old passport number with date and place of issue of the passport holder.\n\nAs shown below, ECR is endorsed in passports of persons who are under the ECR category on the last page of the passport.\n\nThis decision to discard these details are based on the recommendations of a three member committee of the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Women and Child Development. The recommendations to not include name of the father makes it easier to process those passport applications where the mother / child do not want the father's name on the passport. It also makes it easy for adopted children and children with single parents.\n\nWith the removal of the last page, passport holders under ECR category will be issued orange passports while ECNR category will be issued blue passports.\n\nThough the spokesperson during the media briefing did not elaborate on the reasons for introducing orange passports for ECR category, it is assumed that this is to ease the immigration process and also to maintain the ECR category that provides protection to unskilled labourers.\n\nWhy is this move being criticized?\n\nThere are several people who feel that the introduction of orange passports for ECR category could lead to discrimination and stigmatization of unskilled labourers.\n\n\u201cThe government could argue that these passports are for the workers\u2019 protection, but to a worker it may not seem that way,\u201d said Sehjo Singh, a director at advocacy group ActionAid India to Reuters. Singh wants the government to explain the rationale behind the move.\n\n\"No way should this proposal go forward. This is creating two different types of citizens, one with education and one without, discriminating Indians based on educational qualifications,\" said Oomen Chandy, Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Kerala.\n\nThe Twitter handle of the Congress party was swift to put out a video, calling this a discriminatory move. Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that this will lead to unskilled workers being seen as second class citizens.\n\nCritics have also said that if the government's only motive was to help those not desiring to use their father's name, those details could have been omitted. Nothing stopped the govt from keeping the ECR details with the blue colour intact.\n\nAs of now, Indian passports are released only in 3 colours -\n\n3) Official passports with white cover for individuals representing Indian government\n\nWith the introduction of orange cover passports for ECR category, they will be distinguished from ordinary citizens.\n\nAnd if you thought that the colour of the passport does not matter, do read this Economist article from 2012 that explains the many meanings of a passport's colour and why countries have spent years debating which colour to adopt for their important travel document.", "lang": "en"}
