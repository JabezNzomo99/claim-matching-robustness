He claimed that Nehru was thrashed by people \u201calong J&K for failure on China war\u201d. Mehta is followed on Twitter by PM Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office. His post implied that the photograph was taken after the 1962 Indo-Sino war.\n\nSeveral other Twitter users who are followed by BJP leaders, including PM Modi have been circulating the image through the years. The oldest instance that Alt News found was from 2013.\n\nSeveral websites/blogs have also shared the same picture through the years.\n\nAlso circulated with an altered narrative\n\nEarlier this month, the same image was shared with an altered narrative suggesting that the former Prime Minister was arrested in 1946 when he attempted to enter Kashmir without a visa. The identical claim was also shared in August 2018 by an individual user on Facebook. It attracted 3,400 shares.\n\nSeveral other pages and users, including those who identify themselves as a part of \u201cIndia occupied Kashmir\u201d, circulated the photograph with the identical claim.\n\nPhotograph pertains to an unrelated incident from 1962\n\nAlt News cropped out the text from the image, reverse searched it on Google and found that it was published by Outlook Magazinein 2014. The photograph was captioned \u2013 \u201cBraced for the worst: Nehru is prevented from plunging into a riotous crowd in 1962, before the war\u201d. The picture was attributed to AP (Associated Press).\n\nWe searched for the image in the archives of AP with the keywords \u201cNehru 1962\u201d and found that it was indeed taken that year, however, the narrative used was false. AP described the image as \u2013 \u201cA security man grabbed Indian Prime Minister Nehru to keep him from plunging into a riotous crowd at a meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962. Later in the year, Communist China\u2019s attack on India plunged Nehru into new troubles.\u201d This implies that the photograph was taken before the Indo-Sino war in 1962.\n\nAs the image was captioned as \u2013 \u201cmeeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962\u201d, we looked for newspaper editions published at the time. While rummaging through January 1962 publications of The Indian Express on news.google.com/newspapers, we found an article that pertained to the incident.\n\nThe January 6, 1962 edition of The Indian Express has an article titled \u2013 \u201cOpen Session Adjourns Amidst Disorder. Crowd Rush To Dias, Many Swoon. Nehru Appeals In Vain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, on January 5, 1962, a stampede broke up the Congress plenary session as a \u201cseething mass of humanity\u201d was continually pressing forward to get a glimpse of Nehru. The article further mentions that Nehru, who has \u201chandled crowds all his life\u201d was only partially successful at controlling them. \u201cAt one stage, an angry Nehru, completely oblivious to his own safety, used his fists and hit out at security menand Congress leaders who prevented him from jumping into the crowd\u2026\u201d\n\nAnother publication The Florence Times, on January 8, 1962, had also reported the incident as \u2013 \u201cSecurity men hold back Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to prevent him from plunging into a disorderly crowd in Patna, India, Friday, in personal effort to restore order. A wild demonstration by Indian peasants broke up this meeting of Nehru\u2019s Congress Party and set 24 persons to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe articles and the Associated Press description of the image match, therefore, claims of Nehru being \u201cthrashed by a mob due to failure on China war\u201d are completely false.\n\nThe other narrative used to circulate the image \u2013 \u201cNehru was arrested while trying to illegally enter Kashmir without a passport\u201d \u2013 also stands untrue as we have conclusively established the origin of the photograph. In 1946, Nehru was indeed stopped from entering Kashmir to represent politician Sheikh Abdullah who started the \u2018Quit Kashmir Movement\u2019, advocating for self-rule in the state. The then Prime Minister of (the princely state of) Kashmir, Ram Chandra Kak, barred Nehru\u2019s entry into the state and put him in arrest. However, the viral picture does not pertain to this incident.\n\nImages of Jawaharlal Nehru have often circulated with false narratives on social media. As with the aforementioned case, a photograph of an incident unrelated to the claims being made was notoriously shared to malign the reputation of India\u2019s first Prime Minister. Earlier, an image of the former PM was falsely shared as him attending an RSS shakha meeting. At another instance, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya circulated a collage of Nehru\u2019s photographs to portray him as an immoral man canoodling with different women.", "lang": "en"}
