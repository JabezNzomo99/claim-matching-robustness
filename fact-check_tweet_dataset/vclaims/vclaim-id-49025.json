A spokesperson from South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) confirmed the claim is \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in late April a 500 billion rand ($26 billion) coronavirus stimulus package that includes 40 billion rand for unemployment benefits and 50 billion rand for social grants, according to Reuters. SASSA administers social grants to \u201chelp improve standards of living in society and are given to people who are vulnerable to poverty and in need of state support,\u201d according to the SASSA website.\n\nThe Facebook post alleges that white South Africans have been barred from receiving such government aid, despite skin color not being listed as a requirement.

That undated article makes a similar claim to the Facebook post and asks readers for donations.", "lang": "en"}
