In the announcement it said that at the moment those who are here on a work, study or family visa only pay a \u00a3400 surcharge to use the NHS.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the surcharge is currently \u00a3400, but claiming this is all that migrants pay into the NHS isn\u2019t correct because it ignores the fact that immigrants pay taxes which go towards paying for things like the NHS.\n\nHow does the surcharge system work?\n\nThe immigration health surcharge is currently paid by nationals of countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who are:\n\u2022 making a visa application to come and work, study or join family in the UK for more than six months, but not permanently,\n\u2022 living in the UK already and are making an immigration application to stay in the UK for any period of time, but not permanently.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to pay the surcharge in a number of other circumstances, for example if you\u2019re an asylum seeker, or have a family member who is an EU national.\n\nAt the moment, the surcharge costs \u00a3400 per year (with the exception of students or those coming to the UK on a youth mobility scheme for whom it costs \u00a3300).\n\nThe Conservative party has said it would increase this surcharge to \u00a3625 and extend it so that EU and EEA nationals also have to pay it when they come to the UK.\n\nThere are different rules for people who aren\u2019t \u2018ordinarily resident\u2019 in the UK and what they have to pay to use the NHS. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nSuggesting that non-EEA nationals only pay \u00a3400 towards the NHS at the moment isn\u2019t correct\n\nIncluded in the announcement, the Conservatives said that: \u201cUnder the current system, people on a work, study or family visa incur average NHS costs of \u00a3625 per year but only pay a \u00a3400 surcharge.\u201d\n\nLast month the government said that the cost of treating people who paid the surcharge was \u00a3480 each per year. The only other source we can find which refers to the cost of treating people who pay the surcharge as being \u00a3625 is from an article in the Mail on Sunday in October.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care confirmed to us that the Mail on Sunday\u2019s figure came from a leaked document and it wasn\u2019t able to comment further. We\u2019ve asked the Conservative party for more information about the figures it used.\n\nIt\u2019s also incorrect to suggest that people coming to live and work in the UK from overseas at the moment only pay the \u00a3400 international health surcharge to contribute to the NHS.\n\nLike people permanently living in the UK, those from overseas pay things like VAT, income tax, fuel duty, tobacco duty and any other regular taxes which go into the pot of money the government uses to pay for things like the NHS.\n\nThe Conservatives also said in the announcement that: \u201cThis measure will raise over \u00a3500m a year, which can be put towards NHS services.\u201d We\u2019ve asked them for more information about this claim too.", "lang": "en"}
