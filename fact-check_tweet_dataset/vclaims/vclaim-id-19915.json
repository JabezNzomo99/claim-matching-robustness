Johnathon, 42, believed that a tie went to the runner when Stefan Alberts, 31, told him that there is no tie, the umpire uses his judgment. That\u2019s when a full fisticuffs broke out and Alberts ended up on the ground beaten so badly with a 29\u2033 Louisville Slugger Aluminum that paramedics had no chance to save his life. Johnathon said he was within his rights to defend himself after Alberts took a swing but witnesses on site told reporters that Johnathon walked calmly to the dugout, grabbed a bat, walked up behind Alberts and bashed him over the head like he was Glen.\n\nThe story was fabricated. According to Biography.com, Nancy Pelosi has five children, including one son named Paul. She does not have a son named \u201cJohnathon.\u201d\n\nLast Line of Defense is a \u201csatirical\u201d web site that churns out fake news about American politics on a daily, if not hourly, basis. Other LLOD reports published in early 2017 falsely claimed that the body of a tortured, malnourished woman was found on the Clinton estate and that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had \u201cresigned in disgrace,\u201d etc.\n\nDISCLAIMER: America\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that uses the imagination of liberals to expose the extreme bigotry and hate and subsequent blind gullibility that festers in right-wing nutjobs.
