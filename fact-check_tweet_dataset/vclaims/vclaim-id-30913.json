The claim appears to have originated with a 2016 satire article.\n\nThe YouTube video features a Clearview TV News broadcast reporting that Skins, a restaurant in New York City, has received a license to serve human meat. It has more than 147,000 views to date.\n\n\u201cAs a species, we are at the top of the food chain, and the only meat left to tackle was other humans,\u201d the video quotes Michelin star chef Mario Dorcy as saying. \u201cWe battled long and hard to be able to serve human meat in our restaurant, and the government finally conceded that we were in the right.\u201d\n\nClearview TV retracted its report Dec. 3 upon discovering it was \u201cfiction,\u201d but social media users have continued to share the video, portraying it as a real news story.

There is no record of a New York City restaurant operating under the name Skin, and the chef\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been mentioned in the Michelin Guide\u2019s coverage of chefs and restaurants.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration told the Daily Caller it considers the sale of \u201chuman meat\u201d to be illegal. Most states also have laws that prohibit people from obtaining and consuming human flesh, according to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School.", "lang": "en"}
