And These Cowards Say They Will Conquer The World? These Moron Mujahids Are The Most Cowards Creatures On Earth,They Can Only Torture Helpless Humans. They Cant Face Real Men\u201d tweeted a social media user Singh Singh(@HatindersinghR) on June 26, 2018, with an attached video. The tweet claims that a woman\u2019s hair was chopped off because she refused to wear a burqa.\n\nThe above tweet has been retweeted more than 1800 times and \u2018liked\u2019 more than 1300 times. It may be noted that the audio in this clip is unclear. Another tweet from Akhil Agrwal(\u091a\u093e\u092f \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e) (@akhil_agrwal) was retweeted more than 750 times and has been liked more than 600 times. It was also shared on Facebook.\n\nWhere is the video from?\n\nGoogling the phrase as seen in the video, \u201cman cuts off woman\u2019s hair\u201d throws a list of articles, in which a Daily Pakistan article shows a frame of the video. The article refers to a Facebook post which has now been deleted. According to the article, this is allegedly a video of a husband who is cutting her wife\u2019s hair for cheating on him with his nephew. It further states, \u201cThe shocking episode, according to the post, took place in Guarapuava, Brazil and the woman, who got her hairs cut, was cheating on her husband with her nephew. They are gypsies. The husband\u2019s name is Fabr\u00edcio Yanovich\u201d.\n\nFor further verification, we did a Google search with the similar text in Portuguese, \u201chomem corta o cabelo da mulher\u201d (man cuts woman\u2019s hair \u2013 Google translation). This led us to a video titled, \u2018Mulher tem os cabelos cortados na frente da filha (Woman has her hair cut in front of her daughter -translation)\u2019 uploaded on January 18, 2017. It has received more than 50000 views and more than 220 comments in Portuguese. The sound in this video is audible.\n\nMoreover, an article was published by Diret\u00e3o da Verdade(Truth Directory) on November 12, 2016, with the sub-heading, \u201cEle foi tra\u00eddo e pra se vingar cortou o cabelo da esposa (He was betrayed and for his revenge cut his wife\u2019s hair -Google translation)\u201c. This is the earliest article we found which refers to the incident. A screenshot of the same has been posted below.\n\nWe also found another article of April, 2017 published by Blasting News titled, \u201cMarido faz v\u00eddeo cortando cabelo de sua esposa por trai\u00e7\u00e3o (Husband makes video cutting his wife\u2019s hair for betrayal \u2013 Google translation)\u201d, with the same claim.\n\nIn both the articles which have been posted in Portuguese, it has been claimed that the incident took place over an extra-marital relation. There is no reference to the claims made in the tweet- that this couple is a Muslim couple and that her hair was chopped off because she refused to wear a burqa. Moreover, the audio of the clip posted by Singh Singh is not the original audio.\n\nAlt News also spoke with Vandan Kumar who teaches Portuguese in New Delhi. He confirmed that the language spoken in the video was Portuguese with a Brazilian accent. He further stated that the man in the video was accusing the woman of adultery. He also stated that there was no part of the video which would suggest that the woman was being punished for not wearing a burkha.\n\nIn the past, we have seen videos from different countries and regions being spread with false claims which constantly target a particular religious minority. For example, in 2017, a video of a Guatemalan woman being lynched was passed off as an assault on a Marwadi woman by a Muslim mob. Such videos with false claims are shared with the objective of inciting communal sentiments. Social media users should be circumspect with regard to such provocative claims.", "lang": "en"}
