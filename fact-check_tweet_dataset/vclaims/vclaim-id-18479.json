It is spuriously attributed to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never come across that remark,\u201d confirmed Gordon Wood, author of \u201cFriends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,\u201d in an email to The Caller. \u201cBut it fits with his sentiments.\u201d\n\nAnother expert, Robert McDonald of the United States Military Academy, told the Caller in an email that Jefferson had expressed a similar sentiment in an 1816 letter from Jefferson to his contemporary Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, which reads, \u201cEnlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
