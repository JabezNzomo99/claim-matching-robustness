Susan Collins.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-09-02T15:39:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-79419", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/susan-collins-fake-quote/", "vclaim": "U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said, \"Yes, I said that I wouldn't endorse him but that doesn't mean I don't fully support him\" in regards to U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nIn late August and early September 2020, a fake quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, went viral on Twitter. Several users quoted Collins as stating, \u201cYes, I said that I wouldn\u2019t endorse him but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t fully support him,\u201d in reference to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne such example can be seen below:\n\nBut Collins never made the above comment, and we couldn\u2019t find evidence that anyone had.\n\nThe quote was posted in the above-displayed tweet along with a link to a July 2020 story about Collins published by the website The American Independent, but the quote doesn\u2019t appear in that story.\n\nInstead, the American Independent story, headlined \u201cSusan Collins refuses to endorse Trump because she\u2019s \u2018in a difficult race,'\u201d reported:\n\nLast week Collins, who is serving her fourth term in the Senate, told reporters that she would not endorse Donald Trump\u2019s reelection \u2014 or speak against him \u2014 because she is also running for reelection in November. She noted that \u201cin parts of the state President Trump is very popular, in parts of the state he\u2019s very unpopular.\u201d During an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, she said, \u201cI have a difficult race. And I am concentrating my efforts on that race.\u201d\n\nCollins did make the statements quoted by the American Independent story in a July 21, 2020, interview with CNN, stating she was not endorsing Trump in order to focus on her own political campaign. But her comments didn\u2019t match the fake quote in the above tweet.\n\nNevertheless, the fake quote spread far and wide online. It was posted, then deleted by The Lincoln Project, which has over 2 million followers.\n\nCollins\u2019 spokeswoman Annie Clark confirmed that the comment attributed to Collins was fake. \u201cIt\u2019s exploitative,\u201d Clark said, in regards to political entities using the fake quote to make a statement about Collins.\n\nMichael Shepherd, politics editor for the Maine newspaper Bangor Daily News, debunked the quote while expressing disbelief at the traction it had gained.\n\nBecause Collins never made this comment and we could find no evidence that anyone did, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
