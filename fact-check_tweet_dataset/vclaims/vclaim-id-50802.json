This claim is usually included in a long list of supposed \u201cachievements\u201d of the late dictator.\n\nThe facts: Official data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) shows the Philippine peso was already valued at P3.91 per dollar when Marcos came into power in 1965. By the time he was ousted in 1986, one dollar was equivalent to P20.46 \u2013 depreciating by 423.46%. (READ: Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy? Look at the data)\n\nBSP data has traced the monthly average of currency exchange rates since 1945, but the Philippine peso never appreciated against the dollar to the P2 level during the entire Marcos administration. The last time the local currency reached P2 was in January 1962, 3 years before Marcos took office. (READ: FALSE: Philippines was \u2018richest country in Asia\u2019 during Marcos years)\n\nPost-World War II, the exchange rate was maintained at P2 per dollar for 15 consecutive years, or until 1960. It's the highest level the Philippine peso has ever reached since 1945. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
