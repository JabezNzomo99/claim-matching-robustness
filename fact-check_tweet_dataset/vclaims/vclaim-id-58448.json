The message begans, \u201cSpoke with a friend of mine who works in DC.\u201d\n\nHere is an example of the message, with the Facebook user\u2019s name cropped out for privacy purposes:\n\nSome version of the text shared above included a note that it was copied and pasted from a person named Rick Wilson, although we were unable to locate a person by that name who posted the text.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the U.S. House of Representatives, lead by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left the Capitol on March 27, 2020, and as of this writing have not returned, following the advice of an attending physician.\n\nThe U.S. Senate, meanwhile, returned to the Capitol on May 4 after a five-week hiatus. And the copypasta, as shown in the screen shot above, has been circulating on Facebook at least as early as May 4.\n\nThe copypasta has also appeared on Twitter and random websites, but never directly attributing the original source nor the \u201cfriend\u201d that witnessed the alleged events and discussions.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence provided and the fact that the text has been copied and pasted or shared by hundreds of people with no connection to it, this appears to be little more than a social media hoax. We therefore rate it \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
