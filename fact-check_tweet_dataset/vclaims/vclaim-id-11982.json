Zakharova also claimed that despite the Netherlands\u2019 non-cooperative attitude, Russia has fully satisfied every request from the Joint Investigative Team (JIT).\n\nOf the two claims -- that Russia is fully satisfying JIT requests and the Netherlands is not sharing all details with Russia \u2013 only the latter is true, while the first remains debatable and likely false.\n\nJeichien de Graaff, a press officer for the Dutch National Public Prosecutor's Office in Rotterdam, told Polygraph.info: \u201cThe Russian authorities have not executed all the JIT requests so far. Since quite some time several simple questions have remained unanswered.\u201d The press office did not provide further details regarding the nature of those questions.\n\nDe Graaff also confirmed that Zakharova was correct in saying that the Russian side has not been granted full access to material from the investigation.\n\nAs Russia has stressed it is willing \u201cto fully cooperate\u201d with the investigation, \u201cthe JIT is gladly expecting the answers,\u201d De Graaff said, adding: \u201cThat does not mean that (Russia) will have access to the complete investigation: it is not customary to give insight in an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have settled on Russia as the culprit in the downing of the civilian aircraft.\n\n\u200bIn May 2018, the JIT released a report concluding that the Russian military was responsible for shooting down MH-17 and killing its passengers and crew. Shortly after the report\u2019s release, the Netherlands and Australian authorities announced they were initiating a formal procedure to bring Russia before an international tribunal and hold it responsible for this crime, which they said was proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nRussia has obstinately denied any involvement in the crime, producing about 60 different versions of the MH-17 downing, many of which Polygraph.info and other fact-checkers have examined and debunked.", "lang": "en"}
