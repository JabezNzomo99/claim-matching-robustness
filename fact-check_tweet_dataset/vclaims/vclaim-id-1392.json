But, the well-scripted performance raised some suspicion with a YouTuber named Spanglevision who decided to dig a little deeper. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, the \u201crandom\u201d participant was none other than child actor, Brennan Leach, whose father just happens to be Pennsylvania democratic State Senator Daylin Leach. Oh, and in case it wasn\u2019t obvious, Daylin supports Hillary for president \u2026 shocking. Here is the full analysis from Spanglevision. Among other things, he points out that Brennan is the only participant of the night who reads her question from a prepared script.\n\nAs is common with most conspiracy theories, the narrative was based on a few realities. Brennan Leach is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 a child actress (if having a small part in a single short film qualifies one as a \u201cchild actress\u201d), she is the daughter of Pennsylvania state senator Daylin Leach, and she appears to have been the only audience member called upon who read her question from a piece of paper.\n\nWhile these three facts were presented as \u201cevidence\u201d that Clinton was \u201ccaught\u201d using a child actress to ask a pre-arranged question, that conclusion was based on nothing more than speculation\n\nIt\u2019s certainly likely that young Brennan Leach\u2019s political views have been informed by her parents, it\u2019s possible she received a prominent seat at the town hall event (making her more visible and more likely to be chosen for a question) because of her father\u2019s political prominence in the state, and it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that her father talked to her before the event (and possibly even suggested a question for her to ask).\n\nBut if the Clinton campaign had truly cast about for a \u201cchild actor\u201d to ask a pre-arranged anti-Trump question, they likely would have hired one with a stronger r\u00e9sum\u00e9 than a single bit part in a short film, selected an actor who could recite a question without having to read it from a \u201cscript,\u201d and coached their choice not to offer her real full name (thereby subjecting the whole plot to exposure by anyone familiar with the Internet Movie Database).\n\nIn short, the only aspect of this claim that suggests a conspiracy is the counterintuitive assertion that it was so easy to uncover.\n\nSteve Hoenstine, Senator Leach\u2019s Director of Communications, denied that Brennan was a paid actor, calling the attacks against the 15-year-old \u201cdisgusting\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
