In June, 2017, Vallaud-Belkacem gave up active politics. \n\n\n\nThe posts have been captioned as \u201c20 years ago, she was herding sheep in Morocco. Now she is France's Education Minister.

The image was clicked in Morocco and the girl, identified as Fouzia, was 8 years old then. The same image is uploaded to UNICEF\u2019s report here.\n\nBOOM found that the young girl's image, identified as Vallaud-Belkacem as a child, was present on the internet since as early as 2016. It was first shared by Saturday Magazine, a Nigerian media outlet that published both the images and identified the shepherd as Vallaud-Belkacem in her childhood.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with Porter Magazine in 2017 Vallaud-Belkacem clarified that she had left Morocco to live in France with her father when she was four years old.\n\nExcerpts from the interview, \u201cReports in the French press that I was a child shepherd hold a grain of truth: I was born in Morocco and lived in Bni Chiker, a mountain hamlet in the north. My early childhood was spent as a country girl living with near and extended family, all under one roof. We were quite poor. I helped my grandfather with the goats, drew water from a well, and spent most of the day in flip-flops. I don\u2019t have many specific memories, but I carry with me the feeling of a happy family life. Then, in 1982, when I was four, we came to France to join my father, who had moved here in 1975 to work in construction\u201d\n\nThe photo was earlier debunked by Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
