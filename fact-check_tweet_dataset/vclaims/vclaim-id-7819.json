Don\u2019t fight with people, don\u2019t criticize your body so much, don\u2019t complain so much. Don\u2019t lose sleep over your bills. Look for the person that makes you happy. If you make a mistake, let it go and keep seeking your happiness. Never stop being a good parent. Don\u2019t worry so much about buying luxuries and comforts for your home, and don\u2019t kill yourself trying to leave an inheritance for your family. Those benefits should be earned by each person, so don\u2019t dedicate yourself to accumulating money. Enjoy, travel, enjoy your journeys, see new places, give yourself the pleasures you deserve. Allow dogs to get closer. Don\u2019t put away the fine glassware. Utilize the new dinnerware; don\u2019t save your favorite perfume, use it to go out with yourself; wear out your favorite sport shoes; repeat your favorite clothes. So what? That\u2019s not bad. Why not now? Why not pray now instead of waiting until before you sleep? Why not call now? Why not forgive now? We wait so long for Christmas; for Friday; for Reunions; for another year; for when I have money; for love to come; when everything is perfect\u2026 look\u2026 Everything perfect doesn\u2019t exist. Human beings can\u2019t accomplish this because it simply was not intended to be completed here. Here is an opportunity to learn. So take this challenge that is life and do it now\u2026 Love more, forgive more, embrace more, love more intensely and leave the rest in God\u2019s hands. Amen.\n\nThis viral message is almost always accompanied by the claim that it was penned by the Pope, but we found no evidence that the Holy See actually wrote these words. This message does not appear on the Pope\u2019s social media pages, nor on any of the official web sites of the Vatican.\n\nOne of the most popular iterations of this message appeared on the Facebook page of \u201cDe La Salle College Malta\u201d in August 2017\u2014it was shared more than 150,000 times. Several other outlets also shared this message around this time as if it were a genuine message from the Pope. Although this message was frequently attributed to Pope Francis in August 2017, we found several earlier versions of this message that were not attributed to any author. Facebook user Jacob Casstevens, for instance, shared an unattributed version of this message as early as Christmas Day 2016.\n\nThis is a typical problem with viral quotes on the internet. A meaningful message may not get traction when it is attributed to an unknown author. When a famous name is attached to it, however, it gets a boost in popularity. This appears to be the case with the \u201cGentle Reminder from Pope Francis\u201d message.\n\nSo who actually wrote these words?\n\nAlthough we can\u2019t say for certain, the earliest posting that we could find was posted to the Tumblr page of singer Marcela Tais in April 2016. That message was written in Portuguese and is a near verbatim version of the viral Facebook post:\n\nOlha, esta vida vai passar r\u00e1pido, n\u00e3o brigue com as pessoas, n\u00e3o critique tanto seu corpo, n\u00e3o reclame tanto, n\u00e3o perca o sono pelas contas, n\u00e3o deixe de beijar seus pais, n\u00e3o preocupe-se tanto em deixar a casa impec\u00e1vel, deixe os cachorros mais por perto, n\u00e3o fique guardando as ta\u00e7as, use os talheres novos, n\u00e3o economize tanto seu perfume predileto, use-o para passear com voc\u00ea mesmo, gaste seu t\u00eanis predileto, repita suas roupas prediletas, e da\u00ed? Se n\u00e3o \u00e9 errado, por que n\u00e3o ser agora? Por que n\u00e3o dar uma fugida? Por que n\u00e3o orar agora ao inv\u00e9s de esperar para orar antes de dormir? Por que n\u00e3o ligar agora? Por que n\u00e3o perdoar agora? Espera-se muito o natal, a sexta-feira, o outro ano, quando tiver dinheiro, quando o amor chegar, quando for perfeito\u2026 Olha, n\u00e3o vai ser perfeito, o ser humano n\u00e3o consegue atingir isso porque ele simplesmente n\u00e3o foi feito para se completar aqui\u2026 Ent\u00e3o, aproveite este ensaio de vida e fa\u00e7a o agora, fa\u00e7a tudo que quiser desde que n\u00e3o deixe Deus triste. Sabe a vida abundante que Deus prometeu? Bom, \u00e9 esta, que voc\u00ea enche todos os dias de pequenas esperan\u00e7as sem culpar-se por divertir-se, sem julgar-se por ser t\u00e3o simples e feliz com o pouco. Olha, desconfio que os bobos acabam sendo mais felizes. Look, this life will pass fast, do not fight with people, do not criticize your body, do not complain so much, do not lose sleep by the beads, be sure to kiss your parents, do not worry so much about leaving the house flawless, let the dogs around, do not keep the bowls, use the new cutlery, do not save your favorite perfume so much, use it to walk with yourself, spend your favorite sneakers, repeat your favorite clothes, so what? If it is not wrong, why not now? Why not run away? Why not pray now instead of waiting to pray before bed? Why not call now? Why not forgive now? Christmas is expected a lot, Friday, the other year, when I have money, when love comes, when it\u2019s perfect \u2026 Look, it\u2019s not going to be perfect, the human being can not reach it because he simply was not made for So, enjoy this rehearsal of life and do it now, do everything you want as long as you do not leave God sad. Do you know the abundant life God has promised? Well, it\u2019s this, that you fill every day with little hopes without blaming yourself for having fun, without judging yourself for being so simple and happy with the little. Look, I bet the fools turn out to be happier.\n\nThe \u201cGentle Reminder from Pope Francis\u201d message was not actually written by Pope Francis. This message was circulating for months before the Pope\u2019s name was subsequently attached to it.", "lang": "en"}
