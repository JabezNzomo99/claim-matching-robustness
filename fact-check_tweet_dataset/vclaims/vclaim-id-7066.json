But because actually the government hasn\u2019t protected the police budget and because there are fewer policemen, that very important role for the police, apart from law enforcement, isn\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nPolice funding is set to increase this year\n\nIn March 2018, the government announced that police funding in England and Wales will \u2018increase by \u00a3460 million in 2018/19\u2019. Not all of this money comes from government directly.\n\nOf the \u00a3460 million, \u00a3280 million extra is being raised locally, not centrally, through increases in council tax charged by Police and Crime commissioners.\n\nSo the budgets of local forces are projected to increase by around \u00a3280 million (or by 2.6%). Once you factor in the effect of price increases on the 2017/18 budget this increase in spending is much smaller at around \u00a3114 million (or 1%).\n\nAn extra \u00a350 million in cash terms is being spent on counter terrorism operations. The remaining \u00a3130 million is for improving the technology used by police forces and for special grants to meet unexpected costs for events such as policing the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.\n\nPolice funding fell from 2010 to 2015 and has been protected since then\n\nFrom 2010/11 to 2015/16 the police budget fell according to estimates compiled by the National Audit Office.\n\nThe 2015 Spending Review promised to \u201cprotect overall police spending in real terms over the Spending Review period\u201d\u2014up to 2019/20, and that\u2019s reflected in more detailed estimates the government has published.\n\nThe central government part of that is actually expected to fall in real terms. It only stays flat overall if local Police and Crime Commissioners raise the maximum they\u2019re allowed to. For 2018/19 PCCs actually raised more from council tax increases than the government\u2019s forecast\n\nWe\u2019ve written more on police funding here.\n\nThe number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen by just under 20,000 between September 2010 and September 2017.\n\nThere were 122,000 police officers in September last year. Counting those from the British Transport Police and those on secondment it was 125,000. We\u2019ve written more about this here.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that community policing deteriorated in 2016 but has since improved\n\nWe asked Ms Abbott\u2019s office what specifically she meant by saying that the police aren\u2019t engaging with communities.\n\nMs Abbott\u2019s office pointed us towards a briefing from the House of Commons Library which shows that the number of Police Community Support Officers has fallen from a peak of around 16,900 in 2010 to around 10,200 in 2017 (working the equivalent of full time).\n\nLast year, the police watchdog HM Inspectorate of Constabulary expressed concern that \u201cthe extent to which neighbourhood teams are diverted to other work is too often detracting from neighbourhood policing and limiting problem solving opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt also said that \u201clocal policing is the area of operational policing that shows the greatest decline in performance.\u201d\n\nBut this year the inspector said: \u201cIt is commendable that since 2016, nearly half of all forces have increased or maintained the number of staff assigned to neighbourhood policing. This is despite an overall 8 percent decrease in expenditure dedicated to this area.\u201d It said further improvements were still needed.", "lang": "en"}
