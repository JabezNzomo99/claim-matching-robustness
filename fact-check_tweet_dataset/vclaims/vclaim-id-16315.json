Antonino Fernandez, who was born in the Spanish village of Cerezales del Condado in 1917, emigrated to Mexico to make his fortune but clearly hasn\u2019t forgotten his roots. The drinks mogul left the 80 residents of his home village \u00a32 million each. Generous Fernandez died in August this year at 99 years of age. His will left \u00a3169 million to the residents of the village in Spain\u2019s Leon province where he grew up in deep poverty as one of 13 siblings.\n\nWhile Fernandez really did pass away in August 2016, a spokeswoman from the Fundaci\u00f3n Cerezales Antonino y Cinia \u2014 an arts and culture foundation established by Fernandez \u2014 told reporters that the billionaire did not leave much of his fortune to the individuals residing in his boyhood village:\n\n\u201cI can confirm he didn\u2019t leave money to his villagers in his will,\u201d Lucia Alajos, the Foundation\u2019s communications department chief told Mashable. \u201cHis family recently opened his will and we actually don\u2019t know who got the money from the inheritance. But it\u2019s definitely not the town or his neighbours. Some family members have a house in the village, but they don\u2019t live there. They just come during the holidays.\u201d\n\nThe misunderstanding seems to have stemmed from a mistranslation of articles published by Spanish-language outlets, such as the local Diario de Le\u00f3n, which emphasized Fernandez\u2019s altruistic nature in their report following his death. However, it is not entirely clear how English-language outlets ended up with the particular story that they did:\n\nThe BBC reported that the details of Fernandez\u2019s will were unknown, but that the bulk of his fortune is expected to go to his family:\n\n\u201cThe lawyers are on the case in Madrid. But they\u2019ve been very discreet. Some of the relatives, who tend not to speak publicly, said that his fortune will be more than $200m or more,\u201d says Pilar Infiesta. \u201cThe whole process could take six or seven months. Antonino had 13 brothers and sisters, so imagine all the nephews who are descended from them. \u201cA few years ago he gave them all some money. Now, as the lawyers go through his last will and testament, they\u2019re finding that he\u2019s not forgotten any of them. \u201cThe amounts they will inherit vary but everyone will get something,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile it is possible that some of Fernandez\u2019s fortune will go to the place of his birth in Spain, reports that every resident of Cerezales del Condado had become millionaires overnight thanks to the generosity of a beer mogul were premature, and based purely on speculation (and possibly bad translation).", "lang": "en"}
