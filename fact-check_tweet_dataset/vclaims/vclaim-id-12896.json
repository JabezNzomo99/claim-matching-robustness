And the majority have been opened, actually, in areas of disadvantage\u2014where they are helping the very children we want to see getting the opportunity to get on in life.\u201d\n\nRising pupil numbers will mean that 420,000 new school places are needed in primary and secondary schools across England between 2016 and 2021, according the National Audit Office.\n\nAround 232,000 will be in primary schools and 189,000 in secondary schools.\n\nThere were almost 600,000 new school places created between 2010 and 2015. Around 20% of these came from free schools. That rises to 43% if you just look at new secondary school places.\n\nIt\u2019s also correct that the majority of free schools have been opened in areas where there is a need for it. 83% of new free schools approved since 2013 were in areas where there was a local need for places.\n\nThe National Audit Office also says that \u201cthe Department [for Education] estimates that 56,000 of the 113,500 new places in mainstream free schools opening between 2015 and 2021 will contribute to meeting local demographic need for new places\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Department for Education what the Prime Minister was referring to when she said that the majority of free schools had been opened in disadvantaged areas.\n\nIn September last year the government said that 48% of the 344 free schools which had been opened up until that point were in the most deprived 30% of areas in England.\n\nOverall spending on mainstream schools, including free schools, is set to increase from \u00a335 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a338 billion in 2019/20. At the same time, spending per pupil is expected to decrease by 6.5% according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, taking account of inflation. This rises to 8% when comparing 2014/15 to 2019/20 and taking account of increasing costs of things like staff pension schemes, according to the National Audit Office.", "lang": "en"}
