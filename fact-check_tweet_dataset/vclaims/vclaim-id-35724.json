In the video, Rahul purportedly is saying eagles are hovering due to the unemployment created by Modi and BJP. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the video in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Rahul Gandhi in his speech said that eagles are hovering due to unemployment created by Modi and BJP. Fact: The video clip is a doctored one. In the original video, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying that eagles were hovering at that place due to the dirt piled up over there. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe video shows Rahul Gandhi\u2019s speech at a rally in Kondli (Delhi), ahead of the Delhi Elections-2020. In the full video, Rahul can be heard speaking about eagles at 8:42 seconds. He said that eagles were hovering at that place due to the dirt piled up over there. Also, in the video, Rahul talks about the rise in unemployment and violence in the country in the past five years and accused Modi and BJP of the same. So, the video is doctored in such a way that it shows Rahul Gandhi saying eagles were hovering due to unemployment created by Modi and BJP.\n\nTo conclude, a doctored video is being shared as Rahul Gandhi claiming that eagles were hovering due to unemployment created by Modi and BJP\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
