Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Congress Party has said that if it forms government at the centre, it would waive-off medical bills of those patients who die in hospitals (both private and government). Fact: In its manifesto, Congress has nowhere spoken about waiving off the medical bills of hospitals, both government and private, if the patient passes away. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the Congress party\u2019s manifesto for 2019 elections, in page 46, it can be found that Congress has discussed about improving healthcare facilities and increase of expenditure on medical related activities but it didn\u2019t mention anywhere about waiving off the patient\u2019s medical bill if he dies in the hospital.\n\nHence, Congress hasn\u2019t mentioned anything in its manifesto about waiving off medical bills of the patients who die in hospital.", "lang": "en"}
