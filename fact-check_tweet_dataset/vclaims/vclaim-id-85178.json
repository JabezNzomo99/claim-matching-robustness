(For instance, a new procedure required heads of intelligence agencies to vouch personally for the credibility of any of their own agency\u2019s sources that are used in a major estimate.)\n\nA 2008 Senate Intelligence Committee report, adopted in a bipartisan vote, that examined whether administration officials accurately portrayed the underlying intelligence was unsparing in its criticism of this aspect of the White House\u2019s case for war. The 170-page report said such Iraq/al-Qaeda statements were \u201cnot substantiated by the intelligence,\u201d adding that multiple CIA reports dismissed the claim that Iraq and al-Qaeda were cooperating partners \u2013 and that there was no intelligence information that supported administration statements that Iraq would provide weapons of mass destruction to al-Qaeda.\n\nNuclear weapons. Before the October 2002 NIE, some intelligence agencies assessed that the Iraqi government was reconstituting a nuclear weapons program, while others disagreed. The NIE reflected a majority view that it was being reconstituted but there were sharp dissents by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the Department of Energy (which is the main source of nuclear weapons expertise in the U.S. government).\n\n\u201cThe intelligence analysis and specifically that much-noticed 2002 estimate on Iraqi weapons programs was faulty,\u201d he said. \u201cIts judgments turned out to be sound on some particular topics (such as missile programs) but erroneous on others. Even if the available fragmentary evidence pointed to some of the postulated weapons programs, the estimate should have stressed, more than it did, how fragmentary and inconclusive most of the evidence was and how much the judgments were more a matter of analytical inference than of hard evidence.\u201d\n\nBut Pillar also said that \u201cthe Bush administration certainly did embrace intelligence that made its case and ignored (or actively disparaged) intelligence that undercut its case.\u201d He noted that one of the few members of Congress who actually read the 2002 NIE, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, \u201cvoted against the war resolution, explaining later that his reading of the document, filled with dissents and caveats, convinced him that the case about Iraqi weapons programs was weak.\u201d\n\nPillar added that intelligence analysis on other aspects of an invasion, such as what would happen in Iraq and the region after Hussein was overthrown, turned out to be largely correct, even though it made for gloomy reading. \u201cThe actual situation that ensued in Iraq beginning in 2003 was far closer to the picture that the intelligence community painted than it was to the administration\u2019s much rosier scenario of democracy breaking out and U.S. troops being greeted with flowers upon arrival and quickly being able to go home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDoes the CIA get everything right? Absolutely not,\u201d said former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, who regularly briefed Bush, during an interview on CBS This Morning. \u201cWas Iraq WMD one of our biggest failures? Yes. But the CIA gets most things right.\u201d Morell said the CIA tracks how its judgments stand up over time and \u201cwhen you look at those averages \u2014 it\u2019s a fielding percentage, not a batting average \u2014 it\u2019s very, very high.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
