At that time, unarmed people died there.\"\n\nBBC Russian reported that Serova commented on the claims in an interview with the radio station \u201cMoscow Speaks,\u201d saying she saw the alleged shelling \u201cbetween experiments.\u201d She also said that it was possible to see where the shells were coming from and where they landed, that it was easier to do so at night, repeating that she was able to see all these details with the \u201cnaked eye.\u201d\n\nWhile Serova did in fact serve on the International Space Station (ISS) as an engineering officer for six months while war was raging in Ukraine, the details she described are impossible to see with a naked eye giving the distance between the Earth and the ISS orbit.\n\nThe International Space Station orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 408 km (254 mi). It would not be possible to make out the explosions of conventional artillery shells being fired or exploding without the aid of powerful optics.\n\nThis was confirmed by Yuri Baturin, another ex-cosmonaut and Russian politician, who told BBC that Serova\u2019s claim was impossible.\n\n\u201cI think that was an exaggeration,\u201d Baturin said. \u201cWithout special optical equipment [the shelling] is impossible to see.\u201d\n\nBaturin said, he has heard the Chinese cosmonauts claiming to have seen the Great Chinese Wall from space, \u201cBut no matter how many times I tried I could not see it. Though it is big, and at a certain angle of sun rays it may give a big shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to see shelling \u2013 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
