The quotes are fabricated; they appear on a list of spurious statements on the website of Washington\u2019s historic Mount Vernon estate, where there is a research library dedicated to the first US president and the country\u2019s founding era.\n\nOne post -- shared here -- quotes Washington as saying: \u201cWhen government takes away citizens\u2019 right to bear arms it becomes citizens\u2019 duty to take away government\u2019s right to govern.\u201d\n\nThe quote is listed on the Mount Vernon website\u2019s \u201cSpurious Quotations\u201d page, which says: \u201cThe library has yet to find an explanation for this misquote or a similar quote of Washington's that was confused for this statement.\u201d\n\nFounding Fathers including Washington are revered figures in the United States, making them a powerful source of support for political arguments, and firearms and gun control are perennially divisive issues, especially in election years such as 2020.\n\nFabricated Washington quotes appear to be on the rise and can take days to debunk, according to Mary V. Thompson, a research historian at Mount Vernon, who works to safeguard the former president\u2019s historical legacy.\n\n\u201cThey do seem to be growing in number (and not just quotes attributed to George Washington, but to Thomas Jefferson, as well),\u201d Thompson told AFP by email.\n\nThis is \u201cprobably because of the deepening political divides in the country, and because it is so easy to make and/or pass along a meme on Facebook,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother post -- shared here and here -- pictures a plaque containing a quote that is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cA free people ought not only be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government,\u201d the plaque says.\n\nThe initial part of the quote is accurate and is taken from Washington\u2019s First Annual Message to Congress, but it is \u201cthen manipulated into a differing context and the remaining text is inaccurate,\u201d according to the Mount Vernon site, which also includes spurious Washington quotes unrelated to firearms.\n\nThe actual quote from Washington\u2019s address was: \u201cA free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.\u201d\n\nA third Facebook post -- shared here -- quotes Washington as saying: \u201cWhen any nation mistrusts its citizens with guns, it is sending a clear message. It no longer trusts it citizens because such a government has evil plans.\u201d\n\nIt is a variation of one that appears on the spurious quotes list.\n\n\u201cThe quote seems to originate from an online publication: The American Wisdom Series presents Pamphlet #230, \u2018President George Washington's Thoughts on Firearms.\u2019 The author provides no citation for the quotations used,\u201d the Mount Vernon website says.\n\nA fourth post -- shared here and here -- quotes Washington as saying: \u201cFirearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. Firearms are the American people\u2019s liberty teeth and keystone under independence.\u201d\n\nBut this quote does not appear in any of Washington\u2019s writings, \u201cnor does any closely related quote,\u201d according to the Mount Vernon site.\n\nOne or two people at Mount Vernon usually work on identifying spurious Washington quotes as they come up, Thompson told AFP.\n\n\u201cAs we see a new one, we tend to deal with them as soon as we can, because somebody is bound to ask us about them at some point,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe typically start by searching compilations of George Washington\u2019s writings, first by looking in the index under entries for subjects relating to the quote in question,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cIt can take just a few minutes, if you find the quote right away in Washington\u2019s writings,\u201d meaning it is real, \u201cor it can take days.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
