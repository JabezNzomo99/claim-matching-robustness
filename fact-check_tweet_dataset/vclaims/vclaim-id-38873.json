They debunk the posts which say that alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19.\n\nAny vaccine or medicine for COVID-19\n\nNo, as of now, there is no vaccine or medicine for COVID-19\n\nAlso, \u2018World Health Organization Western Pacific\u2019 has tweeted that \u2018drinking alcohol does not protect you from #nCoV infection\u2019 \n\n\n\nAnother post (archived) claiming that \u2018weed kills Coronavirus\u2019 is being shared virally on social media. Vivek Agnihotri has also tweeted (archived) the same on his Twitter account.\n\nThere is no evidence that weed kills Coronavirus. The picture was taken from a website where memes are created and posted.\n\nTo sum it up, Aaj Tak did not telecast any program that said drinking alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
