Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tx.) started making its way around the internet in December 2017:\n\nWhoever authored this tweet used the fake tweet generator Tweeterino, which allows users to create fake tweets that they can then screenshot and distribute on social media platforms. In this case, however, Tweeterino used the Twitter handle of an imposter account, @TX18CongWOMAN, rather than that of Jackson\u2019s official Twitter account, @JacksonLeeTX18, creating a multi-layer cake of fakeness. Tweeterino\u2019s watermark appears in the lower right-hand corner of the image.\n\nThe fake (fake) Jackson account on Tweeterino displays a plethora of misogynist, racist, historically inaccurate, and just plain dumb tweets.\n\nIn addition to the dubious origins of this message, the viral tweet was so full of factual errors that it would be vanishingly unlikely for it to have appeared on a genuine account of a U.S. lawmaker. There is no country called \u201cNorth Japan,\u201d the attack on Pearl Harbor was carried out by Japan against the United States (not vice-versa), and it occurred while Franklin Roosevelt was president (not Richard Nixon).", "lang": "en"}
