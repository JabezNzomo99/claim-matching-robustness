It has been claimed that some men associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were torturing Muslim youth in Madhya Pradesh during the ongoing nationwide lockdown due to Coronavirus.\n\nThe caption of the video translated from Bangla read: \u201cSee How BJP\u2019s goons are torture a Muslim youth in the name of lockdown in Madhya Pradesh. \u2026\u201d\n\nAt the filing of the post, it had been shared by 14,305 people.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found the claim to be misleading.\n\nWhen we extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we came across a report by NDTV dated April 18, 2020, which had featured the same video.\n\nAccording to the report, a group of sanitation workers in Madhya Pradesh were attacked by a mob of locals in Dewas district on April 17, when they went to a neighbourhood to clean the streets. That report did not mention anything about the accused having ties with BJP.\n\nHence, it is clear that an attempt has been made to associate BJP supporters with this video to give it political undertones.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
