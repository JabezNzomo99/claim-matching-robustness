I don\u2019t think so. This should disqualify her from consideration by anyone who loves Georgia.\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post shows what appears to be a black-and-white newspaper photo of four people. \"Burning Georgia\u2019s \u2018racist past\u2019 is how Lawrence Jeffries (right) described the flag-burning Sunday at the capitol,\" the caption says. \"From left are Ina Solomon, Jeffrey Harris and Stacy Abrams.\"\n\nThe woman identified as Abrams is standing in the background with her arms crossed, though her face is obscured. The post also includes an apparent news article clipping with the headline: \"AUC students burn state flag in protest at Capitol.\" The story describes 10 students from the Atlanta University Center\u2014members of its Students for African American Empowerment student group\u2014who wanted the Confederate symbol removed from the state flag.\n\nSpeakers said that \"the Georgia flag symbolizes a brutal time in the history of African Americans, and they demanded that the Legislature restore the original Georgia flag: the state seal superimposed on a field of blue,\" the story says. \"The current state flag \u2014 the Confederate battle flag alongside the state seal \u2014 was adopted in 1956 by defiant Georgia lawmakers who were angered by court-ordered integration.\"\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution has claimed the article and photo as its own; they appeared in the newspaper in June 1992. (Abrams\u2019s name is misspelled in the story.)\n\nAnother story that ran in the paper that month identifies Abrams as one of three students who helped lead the Atlanta University Center\u2019s protests after the Rodney King verdict. She was an 18-year-old freshman who was working on a congressional campaign, according to the article. The story also quotes Abrams and her father, a United Methodist minister named Robert Abrams.\n\n\"\u2018Stacey is not going to stop what she\u2019s doing because of other people,\u2019 Mr. Abrams said, just days after his daughter received abusive phone calls because she helped lead the rally where Georgia\u2019s flag was burned.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s been unsettling,\" Stacey Abrams is quoted as saying. \"I got a call from one woman who said her family died in the Civil War, and the flag was a symbol of Southern heritage. She said if black people didn\u2019t like the flag, get the hell out. It\u2019s really strange to have someone call your house, ask for you by name, and call you a nigger. I\u2019m used to stuff like that. When I was in the 10th grade, I had a police escort because my dad spoke out against the KKK. But I have to tell my parents what we\u2019re [SAAE] going to do beforehand. I told them we were going to a demonstration, and we were going to have a rally. I kind of left out the flag burning part.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to PolitiFact from Abigail Collazo, director of strategic communications for Abrams\u2019s campaign, the spokesperson describes Georgia at a crossroads during the candidate\u2019s college years. The state was \"struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues, including symbols of the Confederacy, the sharpest of which was inclusion of the confederate symbol in the Georgia state flag,\" the statement says. \"Stacey was involved with a permitted, peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag. This conversation was sweeping across Georgia as numerous organizations, prominent leaders, and students engaged in the ultimately successful effort to change the flag.\"\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Abrams was at a protest where Georgia\u2019s state flag was burned, context matters. It wasn\u2019t the flag that the state flies today, because the Confederate symbol that Abrams was protesting has been removed.", "lang": "en"}
