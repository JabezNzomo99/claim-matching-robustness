The claim, however, is false; the video shows a mock funeral procession staged during an anti-citizenship law protest in the east Indian state of West Bengal in 2019.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on August 8, 2020. It has since been viewed more than 142,000 times.\n\nThe 26-second video shows a group of men chanting while carrying what appears to be a coffin along a street.\n\nThe video\u2019s Hindi-language description translates to English as: \u201cLook at the mentality of these people at a funeral procession celebrating news of Amit Shahji testing positive for coronavirus. Someone tell them that the lion has now recovered, and they will definitely have to show the papers now.\u201d\n\nAmit Shah is the incumbent Minister of Home Affairs in India. He announced that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus in a tweet published on August 2, 2020.\n\n\u201cShow the papers now\u201d is a reference to a slogan widely used by Muslim groups during the anti-citizenship law protests in India last year. The new Citizenship Amendment Act, which grants citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, prompted months of violent protests across several Indian cities in late 2019. Critics argue the law is anti-Muslim.\n\nAn identical video was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here, here and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated online since December 2019 -- at least eight months before Amit Shah announced he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nA closer examination of the video in the misleading post shows there is a police barricade at the video\u2019s seven-second mark. The blue text reads: \"Kolkata Traffic Police\".\n\nKolkata is the capital city of India\u2019s West Bengal state.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video with the police barricade highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nA subsequent keyword search on Google found a higher quality version of the same video published here on Facebook on December 21, 2019. It is titled: \u201cAmit Shah passed away [smiley face]\u201d.\n\nThe men in the Facebook video can be heard chanting \u201cAzadi\u201d, which translates to freedom in English. \u201cAzadi\u201d is also a slogan that was adopted by those opposing India\u2019s new citizenship law, as seen in this local media report of last year\u2019s protests.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Facebook video (R):\n\nThe same video also circulated online here, here and here on Facebook in December 2019.", "lang": "en"}
