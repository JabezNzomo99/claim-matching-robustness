No, that's not true: Tweets using the words \"invaders\" and \"invasion\" remained on the president's Twitter timeline a day after mass casualty shootings of August 3 and 4, 2019.\n\nThe false claim originated in various social media posts, including this tweet (archived here) published by \"lawyer, writer, quipster, wonk\" Amee Vanderpool on August 4, 2019. It read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nVanderpool, whose Twitter profile said she is a contributor to Playboy and a commentator for the BBC, argued it was a violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978, since the White House has acknowledged Trump's tweets are presidential statements. Other Twitter accounts made the same charge, suggesting Trump aides were trying to clean up the president's record of using the same language -- specifically \"invaders\" and \"invasions\" --that accused El Paso shooter Patrick Crusius used in a \"manifesto\" posted online minutes before the mall massacre that killed 20 people and wounded another 26:\n\nSeveral candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination put blame on President Trump for inspiring the shooting with anti-immigrant rhetoric. Lead Stories is not addressing that claim in this article, just the deleted tweet accusation. Journalist Michelangelo Signorile, who hosts a radio show in SiriusXM, also tweeted the false deleted tweet claim:\n\nBut the tweets did not disappear, as CNN \"Reliable Sources\" host Brian Stelter pointed out to Vanderpool:\n\nWashington Post reporter Aaron Blake also debunked the claim in a response to Vanderpool,\n\nStill, Vanderpool's intial tweet was retweeted thousands of times.\n\nYou can see a \"BAD INFORMATION ALERT\" confirming this at Factbase:\n\nWhile @realDonaldTrump has deleted more than 500 tweets, none of the 13 tweets using the root of the word \"invade\" nor the 9 tweets using the word \"infest\" have been deleted. You can use the search on the page to confirm. All are still public and on his Twitter feed. Three tweets total have been deleted in August as of 8/4/19 @ 8:50 pm ET. There is no change in his delete pattern.\n\nWe wrote about twitter.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Sam Hyde Is NOT The Shooter At The El Paso Walmart\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Paintings or Artworks Worth $10 Million Stolen From House of Elijah Cummings\n\u2022 Fake News: Antifa Does NOT Plan Border Siege in El Paso\n\u2022 Fake News: Rep.
