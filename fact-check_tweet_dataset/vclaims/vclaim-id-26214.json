This video is being circulated in the backdrop of the recent students protest held in Bihar against the government mulling over privatising the Indian Railways. However, Piyush Goyal has reportedly ruled out privatisation but said that he believes in large investments. Addressing the media, the railway minister said, \u201cIt will continue to be government\u2019s entity\u201d.\n\nSeveral Facebook users shared the video with the same message.\n\nThe video is also being shared on WhatsApp with an identical narrative.\n\nThe video actually depicts a 2017 mock drill video from Khunti, Jharkhand.\n\nAlt News has debunked the video thrice in the past when it was shared with different claims suggesting that the police fired shots at Kashmiris and cops shooting down farmers in Mandsaur. The video was also viral as the government diluted Article 370.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, the owner of Jagdamba Steel, a shop seen in the video, confirmed that a mock drill was carried out by the police on October 31, 2017. It may be reiterated that an announcement in the background was enough to raise suspicions against the claims floated with the video.
