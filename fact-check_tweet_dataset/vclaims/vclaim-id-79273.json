Such a shameless religion. Shame on the pandit who solicited the marriage. Shame on those people who feasted at the event. Shame on the faith that justifies child marriage.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral other Facebook users claim the 10-year-old girl is Ameena, who was married off to a 40-year-old Muslim man, who is a cousin of her late father. Both claims are made by mostly Indian Facebook users.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claims to be misleading. The incident is from Punjab province in Pakistan. The 10-year-old girl was sold off by her widowed mother to a 40-year-old man named Tariq Mehmood. Police had foiled the marriage and arrested the man.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found that several Pakistani Twitter handles had posted the image, condemning the incident.\n\nSome NGOs related to social work in Pakistan have claimed this incident to be from Ahmedpur Sharqia in Punjab province.\n\nTaking this as a clue, we searched the Internet using related Urdu keywords and came across several news websites and portals in Pakistan which had published this incident on August 18.\n\nAs per these news reports, Punjab police had foiled an attempted child marriage, reaching the venue at just the right time. The incident took place at Ram Kali area in Ahmedpur Sharqia in Punjab\u2019s Bahawalpur district.\n\nThe 10-year-old girl, who had lost her father a few years ago, was sold off by her mother to his 40-year-old cousin named Tariq Mehmood. Police arrested the man and took the child into safe custody. As per reports, police were investigating the incident and searching for other people involved, who had fled the scene. The reports do not mention the identity of the minor or her religion.\n\nHence, the various communally-charged claims made on Facebook about the child marriage are misleading as the incident has no connection to India and took place in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
