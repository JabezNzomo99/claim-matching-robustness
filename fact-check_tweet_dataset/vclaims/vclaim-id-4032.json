Overall, we haven\u2019t found a fair and accurate way to compare council tax costs in terms of which party runs the local authority.\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to work out which party is responsible for the cost of your council tax in England. In many cases you have to pay council tax to more than one body, and these can be run by different political parties. The answer can also vary a lot depending on whether you\u2019re talking about just council tax, or the whole council tax bill (which confusingly are different things), how you measure the average cost, and the type of local authority you live in.\n\nThe Conservative Party provided us with the source of their claim, but we have been unable to replicate their calculation. We\u2019ve asked for more detail but have not yet received a further reply. The Labour Party have not yet responded to our repeated requests, and we have not been able to replicate their calculations.\n\nCouncil tax is set by your local authority in order to help meet its annual budget for the year, meaning your council tax helps pay for local services.\n\nExactly how much you pay is based on the value of your property and the number of properties in the area which have to pay council tax, so not all households pay the same amount. Households are sorted into different bands, based on the value of their property in 1991, and the more expensive your property, the higher your council tax. Some households are entitled to reductions or exemptions.\n\nWe\u2019re referring to the situation in England throughout this piece.\n\nConfusingly, council tax is only one part of your total council tax bill\n\nIn many areas, people have to pay \u2018precepts\u2019 which fund a range of additional services like adult social care, the police commissioner, and fire and rescue services.\n\nThese precepts might be set by a different authority to the one which sets your main council tax, as the image below from two years ago illustrates.\n\nFor example someone living in Fleet, Hampshire will pay part of their overall council tax bill to Hart District Council, part of it to Hampshire County Council, part to Fleet Parish, part to the Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner, and part to Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority.\n\nCounty councils and district councils aren\u2019t run by the same people, so it\u2019s possible to have some of your total council tax bill set by a Conservative-run body, whilst other parts could be set by a Labour-run body (or any other political party).\n\nHow much does council tax cost in Labour and Conservative councils?\n\nThe Conservative party told us that its calculations were based on official figures for Band D council tax in 2018/19. Based on this, it told us that Conservative-controlled councils in England charge \u00a3116 a year less than Labour-controlled councils.\n\nWe\u2019ve not been able to replicate the calculations and have asked the Conservative party for more information, but have not yet received a further reply.\n\nThe Labour party haven\u2019t told us where its calculations come from. In trying to replicate them we used data on \u201caverage council tax per dwelling\u201d\u2014which includes wider precepts. It\u2019s not possible to pay your council tax without paying the other precepts which make up the bill. We haven\u2019t been able to exactly replicate Labour\u2019s sums either, and have asked for more information about this, which we have not yet received.\n\nLinking the cost of council tax to one party is difficult\n\nBecause of the many ways you can break down the figures on council tax, it\u2019s possible to look at the figures and come up with contradictory claims on the cost of council tax in different areas.\n\nIn attempting to replicate the Labour and Conservative sums, the main problem with any calculations we\u2019ve tried is that your council tax might be paid to more than one body, as we\u2019ve said already.\n\nUsing the data which the Conservative party pointed us to, you can look at the cost of council tax without precepts in England in 2018/19. But even doing this, it\u2019s not possible to link the cost of council tax (minus precepts) to a single party in every local authority. In many areas of England only one council runs an area and sets the council tax, so there\u2019s only one payment. But in around 200 areas there is a smaller district council and a larger county council\u2014with the biggest chunk of council tax paid to the county council. So if we continue using the above example of Fleet, you pay council tax to both Hampshire County Council, and Hart District Council.\n\nIf you don\u2019t include payments to the district councils, then it\u2019s possible to make the Conservative council areas look cheaper, but this is not a complete picture of council tax, missing out payments to over 200 councils.\n\nDifferent data combines all council tax payments and precepts into a single council tax cost, allowing you to look at the average total council tax bill in local authorities. Again using the Fleet example, it includes payments to the county, district, and parish councils, and the fire and police services.\n\nIf we link the total cost of a council tax bill (including all precepts) to the party running the local council (if two councils are responsible for an area, then it\u2019s the smaller district council, not the wider county council), then using this method it is possible to make the Labour council areas look cheaper. But as we\u2019ve already explained, these average bills include multiple payments to different bodies, so you can\u2019t fairly compare \u201cLabour\u201d and \u201cConservative\u201d councils this way either.\n\nThese figures are also for last year as no complete figures are available for 2018/19 yet.\n\nThere\u2019s more than one measure of the average council tax\n\nThe Conservative party\u2019s calculations look at the average cost of council tax for a Band D property, whereas the Labour ones seem to look at the average council tax per dwelling.\n\nThe Band D measure is better for comparing the bill for people living in similar homes in different areas, and \u201chas historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities.\u201d But it may not reflect the true bills paid by residents, especially as almost two thirds of homes in England are in a cheaper bracket than Band D.\n\nSo the \u201cper dwelling\u201d measure gives a better impression of the actual bills paid by residents.\n\nThere could also be other factors, beyond decisions of the council, affecting the average cost of council tax in an area. Institute for Fiscal Studies research suggests that central government policy decisions can have a significant impact on local government finances. They have looked at the impact of policies on business rates, adult social care funding, and council budget funding.\n\nThere are other issues with how you crunch the numbers\n\nIt\u2019s also not always clear which party is in control of a council. We\u2019ve assumed that a council is run by the party which has majority control. If it\u2019s a minority administration or a coalition, we didn\u2019t count these. The Conservative party told us it used a similar method, but used internal party data on which party controls which council\u2014so it could be different to ours.", "lang": "en"}
