Soap and water however will. \n\n\n\nAs the world battles to prise itself out of the grip of the\n\nasked Tanzanians to look to traditional remedies.\n\non 22 April 2020, Magufuli, speaking in Kiswahili, zeroed in on steam inhalation, which\n\nthe country\u2019s health ministry to publicise as the science in favour of it was clear cut.\n\n\u201cNa hili ningeomba Wizara ya Afya mlisisitize zaidi, kama swala la kujifukizia. Na hilo scientifically ni very clear. Kwa sababu inatoka vapour ya maji katika temperature ambayo ni above 100\u00b0C. Na huyo corona kwa sababu ni futa, atapasukapasuka kwenye vapour ambayo iko above above 100\u00b0C. Kwa hiyo it is a scientific treatment. Wizara ya Afya waendelee kufafanua ni namna gani swala la kujifutizia linasaidia kupunguza corona,\u201d Magufuli\n\nMagufuli said that if the virus were in the nose or mouth, it would \u201cmelt\u201d at such temperatures. He also suggested adding herbs,\n\nor Indian lilac, and onions to the boiling water. These approaches would be important for many Tanzanians to know in the fight against the virus, he said.\n\nfor his views on the Covid-19 pandemic. But is steam inhalation, an approach that has a lot of traction in East Africa, worth trying as a treatment for the disease?\n\nWhat exactly did the president recommend?\n\nTo make sure nothing was lost in translation, Africa Check asked language scholars what exactly the president recommended in his speech.\n\n, said that \u201ckufukizia\u201d translated to \u201csteam inhalation\u201d.\n\n, the global association for the promotion of Kiswahili, said that \u201ckufukizia\u201d is when you cover the head, usually with a blanket, over a pan of boiled or boiling water in order to inhale the steam.\n\n\u201cIn this context we can say he was talking about \u2018herbal steaming\u2019,\u201d said Muaka, who is also an\n\nin the department of\n\nin the US.\n\nVirus cannot be \u2018reached by steam\u2019, say experts\n\nIt is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that steam inhalation would treat the coronavirus,\n\n, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the\n\nin the US, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe virus in infected individuals is within cells and will not be reached by steam,\u201d he said.\n\nof using \u201ccontrolled ethanol vapour inhalation\u201d to disinfect the human respiratory tract of the new coronavirus. The study said this could be useful for clinical workers, as they may \u201cneed to use prompt preventative measures at any time\u201d.\n\nShintake, who said his background\n\nthat showed that when the virus was exposed to temperatures as high as 70\u00b0C, the time for its inactivation was \u201creduced to five minutes\u201d.\n\nBut physically attempting this, whether at 70\u00b0C or 100\u00b0C, is dangerous, Shintake said, and would lead to serious burns. Temperatures in the nasal cavity\n\nbetween 32 and 34\u00b0C, he said.\n\n\u201cDo do not try [to inhale steam]. You will damage the\n\nHarvard\u2019s Escherio agreed. \u201cIt is not safe and is likely to cause serious burns. And no matter how hot the steam is, it will not reach active viral particles that are replicating within cells,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n \n\n Is the coronavirus a fat?\n\n\n\n SARS-CoV-2, or \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d, is the technical name of the But is it made up of fat? This is \u201cpartly\u201d accurate as \u201cthere are fats in the viral membrane\u201d of the coronavirus, , an epidemiology and nutrition professor at the US But to describe the virus wholly as \u201ca fat\u201d is misleading, in Japan, said. This is because its structure is more complicated. \u201c[The] weak-point of SARS-CoV-2 is its envelope, made up of a lipid bilayer. Some constituents in the lipid bilayer are actually sort of fats, but not just fats,\u201d Shintake said. ( about this structure. UNESCO, the UN\u2019s science agency, also why water is not enough to dissolve the coronavirus and why soap is so essential . \n\n\n\nNo treatment yet for coronavirus\n\nand not found any evidence that it is a viable treatment for Covid-19. Other fact-checkers including\n\nhave also found no evidence to back up this resilient claim.\n\n\u201cExposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25\u00b0C DOES NOT prevent coronavirus disease,\u201d the\n\nthat your normal body temperature remained around 36.5 to 37\u00b0C, regardless of the temperature of the steam you breathe, or the hot bath or shower you take.\n\nThe health agency is clear there is no cure for Covid-19 yet and\n\nfor handwashing with soap and cold or warm water due to\n\nConclusion: Steam inhalation cannot treat Covid-19 and is dangerous, experts say\n\nIn a national address, Tanzanian president John Magufuli advised citizens to inhale steam to beat the new coronavirus.\n\nExperts told Africa Check that it is very unlikely this would work, and is dangerous.\n\nThere is no effective treatment for Covid-19 yet.", "lang": "en"}
