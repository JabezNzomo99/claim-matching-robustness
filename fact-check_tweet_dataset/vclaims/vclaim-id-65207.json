You can access the archive here\n\nThe screenshot of the post can be viewed below\n\nThe same photo has been viral since 2014 with fake claim that it shows 'Sonia Gandhi, when she was a bar dancer'\n\nBOOM found that the viral photo is a morphed one of the popular picture of actress Marilyn Monroe clicked in 1954. The viral image has used a photo editing software to morph Gandhi's picture on the original image.\n\nWe found the original picture of Monroe on Getty Images and then compared the viral image with the original and found similarities in the pose, the background except the face of the two people suggesting that Gandhi's face had been morphed into the original photo.\n\nThe original photo of Monroe posing over 'Manhattan subway grate' while the wind blows her dress up, was clicked in September 1954.\n\nView the original on Getty Images here\n\nThe photo remains one of the most famours and popular images of Monroe and was also a scene in the movie 'Seven Year Itch'. The same pose has been recreated by several people and was also sculpted into a 26-foot statue of the actress, displayed in Chicago till 2014.\n\nWe compared the original photo with the viral and found several similarities in the pose, the dress, the background of the picture.\n\nWe used the magnifier option and analysed the face in the viral image and found that the face on the viral picture was that of Gandhi meaning that the original picture had been tampered with.\n\nA search for photo editing softwares led us to PhotoFunia, an online photo editor which lets users swap the face of Monroe in the above pose with any person's face. The picture of Monroe is the same popular one where she is seen posing in a white dress with a leg lifted. while her dress is blown by the wind.\n\nLink to the PhotoFunia page can be seen here", "lang": "en"}
