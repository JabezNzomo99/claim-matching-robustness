It also says 'India under lockdown dates increased' and 'PM announces to shut down everything till 04th May'.\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the image is heavily photoshopped and no such graphic was aired by the English news channel.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: WhatsApp Group Admins To Be Detained For Coronavirus Fake News?\n\nSeveral readers sent BOOM the image on our helpline number (7700906111)\n\n\n\nWe also received requests to fact check the image on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one notices the image carefully, the lines about an extension to the lockdown, appear heavily pixelated - a telltale sign that an image has been tampered with.\n\nBOOM also found that India Today and other Indian news channels do not write single-digit dates as double digits for example - 04th May.\n\n\n\nVideos uploaded by India Today on PM's address since the pan India lockdown can be seen below.\n\nOn March 24, 2020 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a pan-India total lockdown for three weeks to arrest the spread of COVID-19 in India. The lockdown is expected to be lifted on April 14th. Since then social media has been flooded with speculation that the lockdown might be extended.\n\n\n\nHowever, on March 30, 2020 the Press Information Bureau of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting tweeted, saying Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has denied speculation in the media that the government will extend the lockdown.\n\nSeveral other news outlets have reported the same. Read The Hindu and Mint's reports.\n\nOne can view the comparison between the original telecast of India Today and the doctored photograph below.\n\nNovel Coronavirus has emerged as a pandemic globally resulting in lockdowns across several countries and putting over 2.5 billion people under self-quarantine. It has killed over 47,500 people and infected close to 9,42,000 people so far. The tally of infected people in India stood at 2,032 with 58 deaths, so far.\n\n\n\nFollow BOOM's LIVE blog here to stay updated on the latest about the spread of COVID-19 in India.", "lang": "en"}
