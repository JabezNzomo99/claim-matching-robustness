No, that's not true: The casting notice is for a project planned weeks after the rally, and role players will help non-governmental organizations (NGOs) prepare for \"challenging international environments.\" The casting agent confirmed in an online message that his project is not associated with the January 20, 2020, protest in Virginia.\n\nThe claim originated from a video published by Hard News TV 2 on January 16, 2020, titled \"Jan 16 2020 Call Out for CRISIS ACTOR in Virginia..As GOV Declares State of Emergency\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nIn the video, the narrator read the casting call for a project based in Amissville, Virginia, for \"Hostile Environment Awareness Training (HEAT).\" Here is the description from the January 14, 2020, posting (now taken down but archived here and also still available online here):\n\nThe narrator claimed the casting director had a different intent. In the video, she said:\n\nIn response to this video, the casting director Shaun Irving told Lead Stories:\n\nIrving noted that this is similar to training simulations that are designed for doctors, soldiers, police officers and journalists. In these scenarios, actors will play a variety of roles to help recreate possible situations that participants may encounter in the real world. He called this role-playing \"some of the most meaningful work an actor can do.\"\n\nIndeed, crisis actors do exist. But in recent years, conspiracy theorists have hijacked the term to claim that mass shootings or other events have been staged. For example, some people claim the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 was orchestrated by actors to effect political change.\n\nIrving went on to say:\n\nIrving added that the next planned simulation would take place in mid-February, about three weeks after Monday's pro-gun rally. Amissville is located approximately 100 miles north of the capital, Richmond, the site of Monday's rally.\n\nThe submission form for the casting call has since been updated with following notice, Lead Stories has learned:\n\nThe casting agent posted this on his website:\n\nAuthorities in Virginia are bracing for the possibility of violence ahead of the rally, which could draw white supremacists and anti-government protesters in addition to pro-gun advocates. The New York Times reported:\n\nNortham, a Democrat, has vowed to push gun control measures through the state legislature, which is now controlled by a new Democratic majority. His proposals have drawn condemnation from pro-gun proponents who argue their Second Amendment rights are being threatened.\n\nWe wrote about fake news on YouTube before.
