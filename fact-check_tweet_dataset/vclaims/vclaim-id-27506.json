Only the current penalties are out of date. This Facebook content has been posted regularly over recent years,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson said the fines quoted in the misleading Facebook post \u201cappear to be penalty rates from the 2013/14 financial year\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe current penalty rates came into effect on July 1 this year. Fines and penalties increase each year in line with the government indexation rate. These rules have been covered by transport regulations for some time, in many cases decades,\u201d they added.\n\nThe TMR also sent AFP a document listing current fines as they correspond to the Facebook post.\n\u2022 Driving with person or animal on lap: $311, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Reversing for longer than necessary: $53, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Following another vehicle too closely: $311, 1 demerit point\n\u2022 Driving without a clear view in all directions: $311, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Driving in right-hand lane of a multi-lane road with an 80km/h or higher limit: $80, 2 demerit points\n\u2022 Entering an intersection when the road beyond is blocked: $204, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Parking/stopping within 10m of an intersection without a traffic light: $53, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Making a U-turn at an intersection controlled by lights: $106, 2 demerit points\n\u2022 Using mobile phone including use by cyclists: $400, 3 demerit points\n\u2022 Having Sat Nav in an impeding position \u2013 supposed to be in bottom right hand in front of driver: $311, 0 demerit points\n\u2022 Failing to have a hand on the wheel while stopped at lights: $311, 0 demerit points\n\nBelow are screenshots of the list:\n\nA post with an identical claim to the misleading June 2019 appeared on Facebook here.
