An army jawan, P Muthu, (25) had attempted suicide by holding a high-tension terminal of a transformer on the premises of the Madurai district collectorate in Tamil Nadu on January 7, 2020. Muthu attempted to end his life, after his wife committed suicide a few days prior, due to disputes over dowry in the family.
