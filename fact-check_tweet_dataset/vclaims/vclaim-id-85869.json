Somehow the Sunni Islamic State mysteriously has disappeared from the narrative and been replaced by Hezbollah, the Shia militant group that is a key player in Lebanon\u2019s politics. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug cartels have morphed into \u201clocals in Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe biggest hole is that Cotton said that Hezbollah is \u201cunder federal indictment collaborating with locals in Mexico to cross our borders, attack us here.\u201d But the federal complaint made no mention of Hezbollah, just Iran\u2019s Quds Force; neither did Arbabsiar\u2019s guilty plea.\n\nIn the plea, Arbabsiar\u2014an Iranian-American used car salesman\u2013 said he operated under the direction of the Iranian military. He thought he had recruited \u201ca representative of a sophisticated and violent Latin American drug cartel\u201d to murder the ambassador but that he turned out to be a Drug Enforcement Agency informant.\n\n\u201cIt was a strictly Qods force plot and I mention it only on that context. I\u2019ve had to clarify this to members of Congress and their staffs on several occasions,\u201d Levitt said in an e-mail. \u201cThere was so much Hezbollah stuff going on at that time, but Hezbollah wasn\u2019t involved in that op.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials say they are less convinced that top Iranian and Hezbollah leaders worked together to coordinate the attempted hits, noting that both groups have a long history of committing such acts on their own, and for their own purposes. \u201cThe idea that Iran and Hezbollah might have worked together on these attempts is possible,\u201d said a senior U.S. official who has studied the evidence, \u201cbut this conclusion is not definitive.\u201d\n\nRabbit argued that Cotton\u2019s statement was still was credible. \u201cI still think his statement reflects the actual reality of the situation. The connection to Hezbollah is apparent to those familiar with the Quds Force and their activities or even just Iran in general,\u201d she said, noting that the Quds Force was designated by the Treasury Department for supporting terror groups. She added that \u201cArbabsair thought he was collaborating with a drug cartel. That was his intention and what he went looking for.\n\nAt the very least, Cotton is being sloppy when he says Hezbollah was \u201cunder federal indictment.\u201d While there are certainly disturbing connections between Hezbollah and the Quds Force, we know of no evidence that Hezbollah played a role in a rather strange (and unprofessional) assassination plot. As a senator, Cotton will need to be more careful about sticking to documented facts rather than engaging in speculation about particular operations, especially in the United States.\n\nAs a practical matter, Cotton\u2019s sources now are more credible than in the campaign and his assertion is rooted in an actual legal case, however imprecisely described. That\u2019s an improvement, but he still earns some Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
