To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it\u2019s crazy.\n\n Never in my lifetime would I think something like that.\u201d\n\nWhile some viewers speculated the photograph had been doctored, Jeff Oberholtzer of the Mark-1 plumbing company in Texas City confirmed it was indeed his company\u2019s truck seen in the picture:\n\nThe truck can also be found in other photos:\n\nThe export market for used U.S. vehicles reaches across the globe. The cars and trucks we think of as old and busted hold immense value in other parts of\n\n the world, and auction transactions happen fast. The truck likely passed through numerous hands and ended up on a dealer\u2019s lot in Syria.\n\nThe plumbing company put the truck up for auction in November 2013. It\u2019s unclear how many people owned the truckafter it was purchased from the AutoNation Ford Dealership in Houston and who ultimately sold it to the rebel group in Syria:\n\nOberholtzer said that shortly after the photo went viral, he started receiving phone calls accusing his company of supporting terrorist groups. Regardless of\n\n how this truck ended up in Syria, Oberholtzer said he has learned a valuable lesson and will be removing the company\u2019s logo before selling any more trucks:\n\nIn December 2015, Mark Oberholtzer (Jeff Oberholtzer\u2019s father and also part owner of the company) filed a lawsuit in Texas state court against\n\n AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway for $1 million for neglecting to peel off his company\u2019s decals before selling the truck he had traded in. The lawsuit contended\n\n that he and his employees had received continual abuse and harassment \u2013 including death threats \u2013 by phone, email, and social media since the photos of the truck first showed up on Twitter.<!\u2013Last updated: 15 December 2015", "lang": "en"}
