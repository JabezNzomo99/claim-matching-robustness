Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Central Government Cancels Pension for Former Ministers and Ex-MPs who have more than Ten Crores of assets\u2019. Fact: No, the Central Government did not cancel pensions for Ex-MPs who have more than 10 crores of assets. In \u2018The Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954\u2019, it can be seen that Ex-MPs are entitled to get Rs 25,000 pension per month (and extra Rs. 2,000 per month for every year served in excess of five years). There is no rule specified in the Act that Ex-MPs with assets above a certain limit will not get pensions. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google with the keywords, \u2018Pension for ex-MPs with 10 crore assets removed\u2019, no relevant news regarding the Central Government\u2019s decision to scrap pensions was found\n\nTo scrap the pensions being given to Ex-MPs, the Central Government should amend \u2018The Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954\u2019. But, no such amendment was found in the Act. According to the Act, an Ex-MP is entitled to get Rs 25,000 pension per month (and extra Rs. 2,000 per month for every year served in excess of five years). There is no rule specified in the Act that Ex-MPs with assets above a certain limit will not get pensions. It can also be read in an order issued by Lok Sabha Secretariat recently that pension was increased from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000 in 2018.\n\nTo sum it up, the Central Government did not cancel pensions for Ex-MPs with assets more than 10 crores.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
