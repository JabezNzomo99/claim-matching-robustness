This claim is false.\n\nExamples of this claim can be found here , here , and here .\n\nThe posts began circulating on social media in late August 2020 as the number of recorded U.S. deaths related to the novel coronavirus topped 180,000 ( here ).\n\nPresident Donald Trump, downplaying the pandemic\u2019s domestic death toll ahead of the Nov. 3 election, shared the claim on Aug. 30 ( here ) in a Tweet that has since been removed by Twitter ( here ).\n\nThe claim that the CDC \u201cadmitted that only 6% of\u2026 (COVID-19-related) deaths recorded actually died from Covid\u201d is false, because the remaining 94% of cases were instances of comorbidity (the existence of two or more conditions or illnesses in a patient). This does not exclude COVID-19, but combines it with other illnesses, often triggered by the new coronavirus itself.\n\nIterations of the claim on Facebook include an authentic screenshot of a dataset on comorbidities from the CDC\u2019s provisional COVID-19 death count page ( here ). Although text above Table 3 says, \u201cFor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned,\u201d the CDC did not mean that the other 94% of individuals did not die from novel coronavirus infection.\n\nThe table\u2019s left-most column, labeled \u201cConditions Contributing to Deaths where COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate,\u201d includes both serious complications from COVID-19 infection -- such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome ( here ) \u2013 as well as pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as diabetes and obesity ( here ).\n\nAn emailed statement to Reuters from the Mortality Statistics Branch at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) said death certificates, filled out by a physician, medical examiner, or coroner, list any causes or conditions that contributed to the person\u2019s death, determined based on the medical expertise of that professional. The condition \u201cthat began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person\u2019s death\u201d is considered the person\u2019s \u201cunderlying cause of death.\u201d\n\nIn these cases, this would be COVID-19.\n\nThe NCHS statement broke down the death certificates mentioning COVID-19. For 94% of people who had COVID-19 also had other conditions listed. COVID-19 alone was cause of death for 6%.\n\nDr. Maja Artandi ( here ), medical director of the Stanford CROWN Clinic for COVID-19 patients ( here ), told Reuters via email that the CDC\u2019s numbers \u201care really not a big surprise,\u201d as \u201cpatients who have a comorbidity such as diabetes, hypertension or obesity have a higher risk of getting seriously ill and dying from COVID-19.\u201d The numbers are also consistent with the fact that the novel coronavirus \u201ccan cause severe damage to the organs in the body such as the lungs, which then leads to respiratory failure and death.\u201d\n\nKey to understanding the issues in these posts is that, \u201cIf they had not gotten the infection,\u201d Dr. Artandi said, \u201cthey would still be alive.\u201d\n\nDr. Marc Larsen, an emergency medicine physician who serves as Incident Command Operations Chair for COVID-19 at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas ( here ), told Reuters via email that when filling out death certificates, physicians will typically use a standard format and list the primary cause of death as well as other contributing factors.\n\nHe provided an analogy to someone dying of a gunshot wound whose death certificate might list gunshot wound, along with hemorrhagic shock and liver laceration, as causes of death, with homelessness (associated with more exposure to potential violence, here ), as a contributing factor. For someone who died of COVID-19, the death certificate might read COVID-19, as well as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as causes of death, with diabetes and hypertension as contributing factors.\n\nDr. Larsen said that in both cases, \u201cwithout those two triggers,\u201d a gunshot wound and COVID-19, \u201cthe death would not have occurred. Nothing that appears after those primary diagnoses would have transpired had it not been for the primary event. In these examples, the patients did not die directly from being homeless or being diabetic with hypertension, however, they were contributing factors.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 1, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), debunked the claim on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America ( here ).\n\nAsked to explain \u201cwhy the president would retweet a theory that suggests only 9,000 people have died of COVID-19,\u201d Fauci said, \u201cThe point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of (Americans who have died of COVID-19) had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn\u2019t die of COVID-19. They did.\u201d\n\nHe then confirmed that the recorded 180,000 American deaths \u201care real deaths from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAt the time the screenshot in the posts was taken, the provisional COVID-19 death count was at 153,504. Using Wayback Machine, an Internet archive tool, this number reflected CDC data as of August 15 and was on the CDC\u2019s website from August 17 ( here ).\n\nAs explained by the CDC here, COVID-19 death counts may vary \u201cas data currently are lagged by an average of 1\u20132 weeks.\u201d Because the data here comes from processed death certificates, a note under Table 1 explains, \u201cthis delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction, age, and cause of death.\u201d\n\nThe posts also falsely allege that the CDC \u201cquietly updated\u201d its COVID-19 data in August to say that \u201cfor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.\u201d The page included the latest comorbidity data as early as May 8, at that time reporting that 7% of deaths had COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death ( here ). The NCHS also told Reuters it has been publishing this information since it began posting data on COVID-19 deaths on its website.\n\nThe posts claim most recorded COVID-19 deaths were individuals of \u201cvery advanced age\u201d. While 79% of the 161,392 deaths recorded by the provisional CDC death count were of those over 65 years old, 31.5%, or less than a third, were of those over 85 (see Table 3 here ).\n\nFalse. The 6% figure represents death certificates with COVID-19 listed as the only cause of death, but the remaining death certificates listed additional conditions, either COVID-19 complications or pre-existing illnesses, along with COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
