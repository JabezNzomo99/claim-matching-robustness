[DETAILS] The shamelessness of President-elect Donald Trump and his family is limitless and without boundaries. They do not care about the appearance of impropriety or actual impropriety. That is why Trump\u2019s sons, Eric and Donald Jr., founded a non-profit organization to funnel money through when they sell access to Trump once he is inaugurated. Indeed, Fascism has come to America in the form of an orange failed businessman with a penchant for using racial slurs. The non-profit the Trump offspring founded is named the \u201cOpening Day Foundation\u201c, and they are offering Trump\u2019s richest supporters the grand opportunity of private access. However, the access comes with a price tag of a cool one million dollars. Individuals who are rich, but not rich enough to attempt to buy a favor from the president, can also purchase time with either of the Trump boys for as little as $25,000. What does one purchase besides time with Trump? Certain packages include pictures and a private reception with the president. Others include a multi-day hunting trip, or a fishing trip with Eric or Donald Jr.\n\nReports that the Trump sons were selling access to their father began on 16 December 2016 when the gossip web site TMZ published a draft of an invitation for the \u201cOpening Day 45\u201d event. The unofficial invitation featured several packages which donors could buy, such as the $1 million \u201cBald Eagle\u201d package (which included a photo opportunity with the president-elect) or the $500,000 \u201cGrizzly Bear\u201d package (which included a hunting trip with Donald Jr. and Eric Trump):\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the Trump sons were temporarily listed as \u201chosts\u201d of the event on the \u201cOpening Day 45\u201d web site. However, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said that the initial invitation was just a draft and had not been approved by Trump\u2019s transition team. Furthermore, Hicks added, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were not involved with the event:\n\nWhile Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump may not be involved with the planning of this particular event, they were listed as members of the Board of Directors on paperwork filed to register the non-profit \u201cOpening Day\u201d foundation on 14 December 2016. Again, however, Trump\u2019s transition team asserted that Eric and Donald Jr. were included on the foundation\u2019s paperwork without their permission:\n\nBut transition officials said the Trump sons were listed on the document without their permission and have asked the Texas secretary of state to remove their names. [Mark Brinkerhoff, a spokesman for the event] confirmed that they should not have been named as directors of the Opening Day Foundation. He said that the paperwork filed last week was \u201cnot the official filing\u201d and that new documents would be submitted shortly. Still, he said the Trump brothers were \u201csupportive\u201d of the foundation and its goals.\n\nEric and Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s level of involvement with the organization is still unclear. A new version of the invitation for \u201cOpening Day 45\u201d published on the event web site on 20 December 2016 listed them as \u201chonorary chairmen\u201d but not organizers or hosts.\n\nThe photo opportunity with President-elect Donald Trump, as well as the hunting trip with his sons, was also absent from the newer invitation. Instead, donors who spent $1 million on the \u201cBald Eagle\u201d package would get a private reception with unnamed VIPs and celebrities associated with the event:\n\nThis version of the invitation is no longer available on the web site, however, which now leads to a \u201cComing Soon\u201d page.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to event spokesman Mark Brinkerhoff to clarify some information regarding the event.", "lang": "en"}
