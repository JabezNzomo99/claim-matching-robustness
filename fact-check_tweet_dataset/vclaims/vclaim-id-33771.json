PolitiFact fact-checked the claim when it first surfaced and found it to be a combination of fabrication and unsupported speculation. We rated it Pants on Fire.\n\nA new viral post goes further, however, using a gruesome photo of a man being tortured as evidence of the false claim that Stevens was tortured and contrasting that photo with an image of Marie Yovanovich, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn the post, text alongside the photo of the tortured person reads:\n\n\"This ambassador was tortured, raped, cattle-prodded, and burned for 7 hours with no help from Obama or Hillary. No impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nBelow it is a photo of Yovanovitch, who is seated facing a camera during her Nov. 15 testimony in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The text accompanying her picture reads:\n\n\"This ambassador had her feelings hurt by President Trump. Must impeach now!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBut this photo depicting violence does not show ambassador Stevens. The image, in fact, appeared on the internet years before Stevens\u2019 death. Facebook screens the troubling torture image from viewers until they click on an \"Uncover Photo\" icon, warning first that, \"This photo may show violent or graphic content.\"\n\nAs we previously reported, speculation that Stevens was raped and tortured prior to his death is unsupported. The rumor does not line up with government reviews of the attack and its aftermath, or with contemporaneous media reports and video footage.\n\nA website called \"The Meme Policeman\" reported that it found the photo on the internet as early as 2004 when it appeared in a story by Spanish newspaper Diario de Le\u00f3n about Argentinian military torture. We can\u2019t verify that it was shared that early, as the article\u2019s link no longer works, and it doesn\u2019t appear in a search of internet archives.\n\nNevertheless, we did find the image posted on various blogs as early as 2009. As well, a reverse-image search shows versions of the photo on the internet as early as 2008 \u2013\u2013 four years before Stevens\u2019 death.\n\nVarious blog posts make a myriad of claims about the image\u2019s origin. It has been used to illustrate articles about Spanish war crimes, Argentinian war crimes and CIA torture in Afghanistan. While we weren\u2019t able to pinpoint its exact origin or date, it is clear that this photo existed online several years before Stevens\u2019 death.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
