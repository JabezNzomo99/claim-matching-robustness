Reverse image searches show the pictures are actually of demonstrations that took place in 2016 and 2017. Police said no such rally had taken place in the capital on that day.\n\nThe photographs were shared on Facebook on September 14, 2018, with a caption in Bahasa Indonesia saying: \u201cEven though there was no coverage by media, someone was able to capture the event with a cell phone: a plethora of people protest in Jakarta today, while the country\u2019s ruler is still hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully your movement could result in #2019GantiPresiden.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag refers to a social media campaign that opposes Widodo\u2019s bid for re-election in April, 2019.\n\nThe post was shared hundreds of times and the images were also used in multiple other Facebook posts like this one which also claimed they showed anti-Widodo rallies in Jakarta on September 14.\n\nThe first photo shows what appears to be a crowd of students carrying banners and flags demanding Widodo act on unfulfilled campaign promises.\n\nIn the second image a large crowd can be seen sitting in a square at the base of a building. The image carries the logo of student newspaper Bulaksumur, from Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta.\n\nReverse image searches using Google found that neither photograph was from a September 14 rally in Jakarta.\n\nThe first photo is from an article on news website Suara.com published on October 20, 2017, and shows students and workers demonstrating in Jakarta against Widodo\u2019s first three years in office.\n\nThe second image is of a student rally at Gadjah Mada University in the Javanese city of Yogyakarta and was published student newspaper Bulaksumur's Instagram page on May 2, 2016.\n\nJakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told AFP that no anti-Widodo rally had taken place in Jakarta on September 14.", "lang": "en"}
