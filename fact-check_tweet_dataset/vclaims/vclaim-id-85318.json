It is being passed off an as evidence to claim, \u201cCorvid-19 is a US biological weapon.\u201d\n\nA tweet by a user who goes by the handle African Revolt, said: \u201cListen to Saddam Hussein was in a 1990 meeting with his cabinet, telling them how America was threatening Iraq with Corona Virus\u201d. It may be noted that the name of the disease COVID-19 has been misspelt as CORVID-19. Corvid is a family of birds.\n\nMany other users on Twitter and Facebook posted the video with a similar narrative.\n\nSeveral users have also requested Alt News on its official mobile application to fact-check this video.\n\nThe video is also circulating in the Pakistani social media ecosystem with an Urdu text.\n\nUsing the digital verification tool InVid, Alt News obtained multiple key-frames of the video. With a reverse of one of the key-frames on Russian search engine Yandex, we found a video of the same meeting posted by the YouTube channel of The Associated Press\u2019s archive on July 21, 2015. We watched the video frame-by-frame and were able to establish that it is the same video. In the comparison posted below, we have matched two frames \u2013 one from the AP\u2019s video and another from the viral video \u2013 to establish that it has been clipped from the latter.\n\nIf one compares the audio and the video of the original footage with the viral video, it can be said that the 2:03-minute video has been manufactured by repeating visuals from the 1:18-minute original video. Moreover, it was also found that audio in the viral video has been superimposed and edited to give a false impression that Saddam Hussein had referred to the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d in the \u201c1990s\u201d. While there is not a single mention of the word \u201cvirus\u201d in the original video, one can listen to the multiple mentions of the word \u201cvirus\u201d in the manufactured clip.\n\nThe relevant portion can be heard from 30 seconds in the video posted below. Right before Hussein begins to laugh, the previous visuals are repeated in the viral clip. Moreover, Hussein\u2019s voice does not match the voice in the viral clip.\n\nThe fact that Saddam Hussein doesn\u2019t refer to \u2018virus\u2019 or \u2018coronavirus\u2019 also can be corroborated with the details given along with the AP video. According to AP\u2019s transcription, Saddam Hussein said, \u201cIf God wills it and we have to run after the enemy, then we will do it.\u201d It is noteworthy that time, date and location of the address couldn\u2019t be ascertained.\n\nFormer Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was toppled by a US-led invasion in 2003. In 2006, Hussein was hanged in Baghdad for ordering the killing of 148 Shiites in the city of Dujail in 1982.\n\nIn conclusion, a clip featuring Hussein was manufactured to claim that the US had threatened Iraq with \u201cbiological weapon\u201d COVID-19 in the year 1990. However, there is no mention of the word \u201cvirus\u201d let alone \u201ccoronavirus\u201d in the original footage available with the AP\u2019s archive.\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, repetitive misinformation aims to convince people that the virus is a biological weapon even though scientific research says that it had a natural origin. A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says, \u201cWe stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.\u201d It is likely that infected bats and/or pangolins from the wet livestock market of Wuhan are the original source of the virus.", "lang": "en"}
