For months, Republicans and Democrats alike have speculated about the down-ballot implications of Trump\u2019s presidential run.\n\nIn this case, the ad is in support of state Sen. Ruben Kihuen\u2019s bid for the Democratic nomination in Nevada\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Kihuen is a former aide of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has endorsed Kihuen\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe ad begins with an angry image of Trump as the narrator states, \u201cDonald Trump says you have to look at Medicare going away.\u201d A graphic on the screen shows a partially paraphrased quote: \u201c\u2018You have to look at \u2026 \u2018 Medicare going away. Donald Trump.\u201d The ad then goes on to say that \u201cSen. Harry Reid always protected Medicare\u201d and that \u201cRuben will protect Medicare like Harry Reid did.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from United Here did not respond to our requests for backup material, but the partial quote used in the ad appears to come from an Oct. 25, 2015, interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump what he thought about Ben Carson\u2019s plan for health care savings accounts, and specifically if Trump agreed with Carson that Medicare probably won\u2019t be necessary if money is shifted from Medicare to the health care savings accounts.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to look at that, but I\u2019ll tell you what, the health savings accounts, I\u2019ve been talking about it also. I think it\u2019s a very good idea and it\u2019s an idea whose probably time has come.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos, Oct. 25, 2015: On health care, Ben Carson\u2019s calling for health savings accounts. He says he wants to shift money from Medicare and Medicaid and other health spending to these accounts and he says that, under his plan, Medicare probably won\u2019t be necessary. What do you think of that? Trump: Well, I\u2019m OK with the savings accounts. I think it\u2019s a good idea; it\u2019s a very down-the-middle idea. It works. It\u2019s something that\u2019s proven. \u2026 Stephanopoulos: So if you agree with these health savings accounts idea, do you also agree with Ben Carson when he says Medicare probably won\u2019t be necessary? Trump: Well, it\u2019s possible. You\u2019re going to have to look at that, but I\u2019ll tell you what, the health savings accounts, I\u2019ve been talking about it also. I think it\u2019s a very good idea and it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s an idea whose probably time has come.\n\nWe\u2019ll allow that Trump\u2019s answer is a bit confusing. And it\u2019s true that Trump has been short on details on how to keep Medicare solvent, aside from saying that he would seek to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. But Trump has been crystal clear on numerous occasions both before and after this interview that he would preserve Medicare.\n\nIn fact, just a few days after the ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d interview, Trump was on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program attacking Carson for those same comments.\n\n\u201cBen [Carson] wants to knock out Medicare. I heard that over the weekend. He wants to abolish Medicare,\u201d Trump said. He went on to say: \u201cAbolishing Medicare, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get away with that one. It\u2019s actually a program that\u2019s worked. It\u2019s a program that some people love, actually.\u201d\n\nWe found at least a dozen instances of Trump vowing to preserve Medicare, and in many cases contrasting his steadfast support with plans by some of his Republican rivals to change it.\n\nIn his speech announcing his presidential candidacy last year, Trump promised to save Medicare \u201cwithout cuts.\u201d\n\nBut his position goes back long before that. In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013, Trump warned (at the 1:51 mark) that Republicans who insist on major changes to Medicare will lose.\n\nIndeed, in February, Trump said Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was hurt in 2012 by choosing Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, because Ryan had proposed a budget that called for an overhaul of the Medicare program.\n\n\u201cEvery single other candidate is going to cut the hell out of your Social Security \u2014 remember the wheelchair being pushed over the cliff when you had Ryan chosen as your vice president?\u201d Trump said at an event at a retirement community. \u201cThat was the end of that campaign, by the way, when they chose Ryan. And I like him, he\u2019s a nice person, but that was the end of the campaign. I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding \u2014 because he represented cutting entitlements, et cetera, et cetera.\u2019 The only one that\u2019s not going to cut is me.\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to a widely seen Internet video in 2011 of a man pushing a white-haired woman in a wheelchair to the edge of a scenic cliff and dumping her over it. It ends by asking, \u201cIs America Beautiful without Medicare?\u201d The attack was bogus. At the time, Ryan proposed changes to Medicare for workers now under age 55, not current seniors, and subsidize the purchase of private insurance for those who go on Medicare after 2022.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News on March 13, Howard Kurtz asked Trump about Social Security and Medicare and Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to change [them].\u201d He then explained, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to change it for a number of reasons. But one is because they\u2019ve committed, they\u2019ve paid in for years.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network on May 9, Trump promised to leave Medicare \u201cthe way it is.\u201d\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in Milwaukee on April 4, Trump insisted that while some have called for substantial changes to Medicare, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, OK? Remember that. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nHere are a few other examples of Trump vowing to \u201csave\u201d Medicare: Oct. 28, 2015; April 12; April 13; and May 20.\n\nTrump may make an enticing target for down-ballot candidates \u2014 and those supporting them \u2014 but in this case, the ad\u2019s claim that Trump \u201csays you have to look at Medicare going away\u201d is misleading, and contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated statements on Medicare. Kihuen is one of eight Democrats running in the June 14 primary for the 4th Congressional District, with the winner hoping to compete for a seat currently held by Republican Rep.
