For example, if your friend tells you, \"Let's bounce\", he/she means, \"Let's go.\"\n\nHowever, showrunners at Times Now did not consult UrbanDictionary, before writing the script, which led to some hilarious responses from social media users.\n\nPeople started tweeting jokes about Times Now overreacted to commonly used colloquial terms and expressions, allegedly from Chakraborty's chats.\n\n\n\nTimes Now tweet carrying the video has now been deleted.", "lang": "en"}
