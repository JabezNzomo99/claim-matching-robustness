Now, President Trump is charging that former vice president Joe Biden (and his fellow Democrats) has gone so far left that he wants to \u201cabolish all charter schools.\u201d These are publicly funded schools but operated under contract by independent groups, allowing for more flexibility in curriculum and hiring.\n\nCharter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. Democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. And we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds. We support measures to increase accountability for charter schools, including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools, including with regard to civil rights protections, racial equity, admissions practices, disciplinary procedures, and school finances. We will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district\u2019s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students. And Democrats oppose private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from the public school system.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of inside-the-Beltway code in here, some of which has raised concern from charter school advocates. But the key thing Biden is targeting are for-profit charter schools. A Biden campaign official said there are relatively few such entities, mainly education management organizations (EMOs) that are hired to manage aspects of charter schools.\n\nNina Rees, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, had issued a statement expressing disappointment in the language of the Biden-Sanders statement. She said, for instance, that \u201cfederal charter school funding for charter schools should not be contingent upon a review by a school district\u201d because \u201cdistricts have a conflict of interest and often see charters as competitors.\u201d So that in theory could limit the growth of charter schools.\n\n\u201cOn the for-profit question, most charter schools are constructed as nonprofits \u2014 the only variation is in Arizona where less than 5 percent of the charters are for-profit,\u201d Rees said, noting that less than 15 percent of charter schools are managed by EMOs. \u201cWhat Mr. Biden is likely talking about is cutting federal charter school funding from charter schools that have a contract with a for-profit company, but we haven\u2019t seen the details behind his plan for me to be able to answer this question accurately \u2014 these contracts range from full management of the school to contracting out for certain services,\u201d similar to how some districts contract with for-profits for janitorial services and so forth.\n\nWe will note that this is a classic Democratic-Republican dispute, not distinct to Biden and Trump. The Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), imposed on D.C. by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, was targeted for elimination by President Barack Obama. The Biden-Sanders unity recommendations also call for eliminating the program, saying it \u201coffers taxpayers no accountability for the use of the funds and has consistently failed to demonstrate academic effectiveness.\u201d\n\nNearly 2,000 students, mainly minorities, participate in the program at a cost of nearly $20 million a year, which provides vouchers \u2014 averaging $9,500 \u2014 to attend private schools. A recent federal study found little difference in the academic performance of students using the vouchers and those who did not: \u201cIt seems possible that the OSP\u2019s lack of effectiveness might be related to DC families\u2019 already-widespread access to school choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are several types of \u2018school choice\u2019 and Biden is against only some of them,\u201d said Thomas Toch, director of FutureEd, an educational think tank at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. \u201cHe opposes spending public money to send students to private schools (vouchers/tuition tax credits/opportunity scholarships). He is opposed to for-profit charter schools and \u2018low-performing\u2019 charter schools. But he\u2019s not opposed to charter schools per se. And he\u2019s not opposed to providing students choices within public school systems via magnet schools. \u2026 So Trump\u2019s blanket claims are false.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of giving parents the opportunity to send their children to a better school, Joe Biden wants to end school choice as we know it,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said. \u201cBiden not only attended a private school himself, he also sent his own children to one, exercising a choice he would deny other parents. From pledging to \u2018end\u2019 charter schools to saying they won\u2019t receive \u2018a penny of federal money\u2019 if he is elected, Biden has made his hostility to school choice abundantly clear. Biden has turned his back on these parents and children, and if elected, would put charter schools on a path to destruction.\u201d\n\nOnce again, more subtlety and skillful word choice by the president would limit the Pinocchio count. A case could be made that Biden has signed onto concepts that could slow the expansion of charter schools \u2014 or that Biden is opposed to providing federal funding for \u201csome\u201d charter schools (the for-profit ones). The distinctions are subtle and certainly open to debate.", "lang": "en"}
