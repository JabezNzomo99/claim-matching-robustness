He has also wrongly said that raking \u2014 a method he attributed to Finland \u2014 could have solved the problem.\n\nTrump has a history of critiquing California for its frequent wildfires, but his latest comments started with an early morning tweet on Nov. 10, two days after the two fires began:\n\nThe next day, Trump followed up with another tweet:\n\nThis past weekend, the president continued with the theme, announcing on his way to California that he would be talking with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom about forest management, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. And this could have been a lot different situation.\u201d\n\nWhile forest management can be an important element in certain wildfires, Trump\u2019s claim that forest management is solely or even largely responsible for these fires is false. Experts told us neither of the wildfires are true forest fires, and wind was a presiding factor that quickly spread the flames. Dry, hot conditions \u2014 both of which are exacerbated by climate change \u2014 made the fires possible and gave them extra life. Humans, too, were contributors, by living and building in areas prone to fires.\n\nThe two wildfires in question are the Woolsey Fire outside of Los Angeles in Southern California and the innocuous-sounding Camp Fire near the town of Paradise in Northern California. As of this writing, the Woolsey Fire has killed three people, destroyed 1,500 structures and consumed nearly 100,000 acres. The Camp Fire has killed 79 people and claimed more than 15,000 buildings across 150,000 acres, making it the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. Hundreds of people are also missing.\n\nTrump blundered again during his visit to Northern California, when he singled out Finland\u2019s forest management practices and suggested raking to prevent fires.\n\nFinland does have fewer severe forest fires, but they do not rake as a fire prevention method, and raking would not have prevented the fires in California. Finnish forests are also very different from the California ecosystems that are burning, making the comparison invalid.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed the science of wildfires before. But in light of Trump\u2019s repeated claims, we\u2019re taking another look, and we\u2019ll explain why Trump\u2019s focus on forest management in this case is misplaced.\n\nOne of the president\u2019s key mistakes, scientists said, was failing to consider the particular ecosystems of the current fires.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire that hit Malibu and the surrounding area, for example, is not a forest fire. It\u2019s burning chaparral, a woody shrubland that University of Arizona disturbance ecologist and postdoctoral researcher Erica Newman said is almost completely treeless.\n\nAs a result, forest management methods, which include tree thinning, or the selective removal of smaller trees, and prescribed burns \u2014 often in combination \u2014 aren\u2019t exactly relevant.\n\nThose practices can be helpful in other areas, such as California\u2019s Sierra mixed conifer forests, Newman said. The forests there have generally not burned enough over the last century, thanks to decades of fire suppression by the U.S. Forest Service, and tree thinning and prescribed fire can mitigate some of the risk.\n\nThe basic idea with management is to reduce the amount of material that can burn, or what scientists call fuels, so that any resulting fire will have less fuel and spread less quickly. This helps avoid the most intense fires that harm forests and are the most dangerous to humans.\n\nChaparral, though, is a different story. Not only are there no trees to manage, but Newman said doing vegetation management on chaparral is likely to exacerbate the problem.\n\n\u201cManaging California chaparral, whether with fire, cutting, or mechanical removal like mastication, leads to degradation of the ecosystem,\u201d she told us in an email. \u201cManagement of any type causes fire risk to increase, because non-native grasses invade, introducing fine fuels into the ecosystem that are more ignitable.\u201d\n\nPhilip Dennison, a geographer and fire scientist with the University of Utah who has previously studied fires in Southern California, agreed that poor management was not at fault in the Woolsey Fire. Instead, wind was a driving factor.\n\n\u201cIt jumped the 101 freeway eight lanes wide with no problem,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s really no management that would have helped.\u201d\n\nThe Camp Fire in Northern California is different from the Woolsey Fire. Trees were involved in the Camp Fire, but it was not a true forest fire, either. Most experts told us management had little or nothing to do with how the fire manifested.\n\nOne of the reasons to do tree thinning is to prevent smaller trees from serving as \u201cladder fuels\u201d that allow fire to spread to the canopies of large trees. But Newman told us the majority of the area burning in the Camp Fire isn\u2019t the kind of crowded, closed-canopy forest that benefits from such treatment.\n\nThe region there contains multiple ecosystems, including Ponderosa pines at high elevations, chaparral and other forest types, such as oak woodlands lower down, and some grasslands. Many of the ecosystems, she added, are heavily invaded with ornamental plants and non-native grasses that affect fire behavior.\n\nThe Ponderosa pines can be managed with thinning and prescribed burning, Newman said, but the area had previously been logged, and as Dennison pointed out, there were two wildfires in 2008 that would have already greatly reduced the fuel load.\n\nFurther treatment would be unlikely to do anything, Newman explained, because the wind was so strong. In these types of wind-driven fires, she said, many thousands of embers are thrown up ahead \u2014 sometimes as far as a mile or more \u2014 and these create many new blazes. This dramatic and far-flung transfer means the fire will spread regardless of efforts to reduce the number of fuels or to create breaks in the environment.\n\n\u201cIn 80 mile per hour winds, the overall sparseness and \u2018managedness\u2019 of the vegetation will not prevent embers from reaching additional flammable things,\u201d she said.\n\nAs evidence, Newman points to the pictures of the Camp Fire scene, which often show houses reduced to ash, but nearby trees and shrubs intact. This suggests that in many cases, the fire wasn\u2019t spreading from neighboring vegetation, as it might in a more typical fire, but rather from other buildings.\n\nChris Dicus, a professor of fire science at Cal Poly, took a different view from Newman, and said that additional tree thinning or logging might have helped slow the intensity of the fire\u2019s spread before it reached the town of Paradise. But he also acknowledged the dominant role of wind. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve done everything,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you have hot, dry winds pushing through these landscapes, it\u2019s going to burn through.\u201d\n\nThe scientists we consulted were careful to note that there is no single reason for wildfires, and that was no less true of the California cases here.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s a distinction between what provides the literal spark to a wildfire, and the overall conditions that enable the fire to become a disaster.\n\nIn terms of the spark, Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in an email that it\u2019s \u201cnearly certain\u201d that both the Woolsey and Camp Fires were caused in some way by human activity. Lightning, he said, is the only natural culprit, and thunderstorms were not present for weeks before the blazes began. Both fires remain under investigation, but there are already suspicions that the Camp Fire may have started from damaged power lines.\n\nAs for the conditions, Swain pointed to a combination of weather and climate.\n\n\u201cIn the case of both the Camp Fire and Woolsey Fire,\u201d he said, \u201cstrong and dry land-to-sea (\u2018offshore\u2019) winds were a major factor in pushing these fires rapidly down slopes and canyons into populated regions.\u201d\n\nThese Santa Ana and Santa Ana-like winds typically peak in late fall, so they\u2019re expected. But this year the vegetation was especially dry: The summer was one of the warmest on record, and the rainy season, which usually kicks into gear by mid-October \u2014 especially in the north \u2014 was late.\n\nAlthough climate change can\u2019t be tied to any particular fire, Swain said it can make several of these contributing factors more extreme, and in that way, acts as \u201cthreat multiplier.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate trends are taking pre-existing wildfire hazards that are already quite high in many regions and amplifying them well beyond what they would be otherwise,\u201d he said. For example, in California, the fire season is now starting earlier and ending later because of hotter temperatures and a shortening raining season.\n\n\u201cAll else being equal, warming temperatures and longer dry seasons mean that vegetation is drier and more flammable than it would be otherwise,\u201d Swain added. \u201cAnd in California specifically, there is an increasing chance that the dangerous offshore wind season in autumn coincides with summer-like dryness.\u201d\n\nThe other essential component in all of this is humans.\n\nWildfires, of course, would still happen in California with or without humans. But Swain said people are increasingly building homes and towns in high wildfire risk zones, or what scientists term the wildland-urban interface. And this makes it more likely that when a fire happens, it will have a major impact on communities.\n\nIn perhaps the oddest chapter of all of Trump\u2019s comments on wildfires, the president invoked Finland, and said the Finnish president had told him they \u201cspent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Finland has surprisingly few forest fires for a nation that\u2019s 75 percent forest, it\u2019s not attributable to raking.\n\nTimo Kuuluvainen, a forest scientist at the University of Helsinki, told us emphatically via email, \u201cRaking is not done in forests!!!\u201d A representative of the Finnish Interior Ministry, which is responsible for wildfire management, has also said that raking does not occur, and the Finnish president has stated that he never told Trump that his country rakes.\n\nNewman, the disturbance ecologist at the University of Arizona, was not familiar with raking as a fire prevention technique beyond the raking a person might do around their house or yard, which, she said, would remain \u201ca very local and small-scale effort.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to our questions about the president\u2019s remarks on the California wildfires. But based on Trump\u2019s description, Newman said it\u2019s possible he could be thinking of a mop-up, which happens after a fire has already burned through an area. To keep a fire from spreading, firefighters use rakes and garden hoe- and ax-like tools, combined with water hoses, to squelch hot embers and extinguish any remaining pockets of fire. While this is helpful, it doesn\u2019t stop fires from happening in the first place, and is part of containment.\n\nForest management in Finland, Kuuluvainen explained, is primarily tree thinning, with a very small amount of prescribed fire. The country also sponsors an airplane monitoring system that operates during dry spells, and a vast network of forest roads on flat terrain make it easy for voluntary fire brigades to rapidly snuff out any fires.\n\nBut any success Finland has had in reducing the number of severe wildfires is not very relevant to the United States because the climate is so different. \u201c[Finland] is much colder, and supports very different, moister vegetation that is not as prone to drying out and burning,\u201d said Newman. The Nordic country, she noted, is between 60 and 70 degrees latitude, which is farther north than anywhere in the U.S. except Alaska. Finland also benefits from a landscape peppered with lakes and swamps that serve as natural barriers and can prevent fires from spreading. All of these features mean Finland\u2019s fire risk is naturally much lower than California\u2019s.\n\n\u201cComparison is impossible,\u201d Kuuluvainen said, \u201cbecause the ecosystems and weather conditions are totally different.\u201d\n\nThe other sticking point for many of the fire experts we spoke to was Trump\u2019s insinuation that wildfires can be eliminated from California. The reality is that even with ideal fire management, the state will always have them.\n\n\u201cFire is part of California\u2019s ecosystem,\u201d said Dennison, \u201cand it\u2019s impossible to remove.\u201d\n\nMaureen Kennedy, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington Tacoma, agreed. \u201cFires have always occurred and will always continue to occur,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nTo think otherwise is potentially dangerous because it assumes our tools work better than they actually do. Even in the forests that can benefit from thinning and prescribed burning, Kennedy explained that the goal is not to stop wildfire, but to change its distribution, shifting the most intense flames to places further away from humans.\n\nAnd many of the most effective methods, at least in terms of saving lives and communities, are likely to have less to do with trying to control fire, and more to do with fireproofing homes in vulnerable areas and changing where people live.\n\nAs an international group of scientists warned in a 2014 review in the journal Nature, \u201cUnless people view and plan for fire as an inevitable and natural process, it will continue to have serious consequences for both social and ecological systems.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
