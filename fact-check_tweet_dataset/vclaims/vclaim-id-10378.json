As blood dries, the amount of virus decreases very quickly. HIV is also very vulnerable to heat, acidity and sunlight. In addition, an infection will only occur if a certain amount of the virus reaches the target cells through a damaged tissue of another person. This makes transmission of HIV through surfaces or objects extremely unlikely,\" it added.\n\nThe story, which first appeared on social media on April 13, 2017, was reshared on social media on April 10, the United States\u2019 National Youth HIV and AIDS Awareness Day. The website was created in 2016, and the story's source, thehealthcenter.me, leads to a broken link.\n\n\n\nThe biggest traffic on social media generators: Pasaway News and Barangay ni Kapitan Tiyago.\n\nEditor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
