Among those who tweeted it was IAS officer Captain Manivannan. His tweet received over 1,500 likes and among those who retweeted it was Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana.\n\nNDTV\u2019s defence editor Vishnu Som narrated the poem live on the channel, attributing it to the pilot\u2019s sister.\n\nDelhi municipal councilor Yasmin Kidwai from Congress shared the poem from her Twitter account.\n\nSeveral other handles also circulated the poem, claiming that it was penned by the Indian pilot\u2019s sister.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe poem attributed to wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman\u2019s sister was not written by her. It was actually written by Varun Ram Iyer on February 27, 2019, the same day Varthaman was taken into custody by the Pakistani army.\n\nHe also put out a comment stating that the poem was penned by him. The misinformation was earlier debunked by Boomlive and India Today.\n\nSince wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman made headlines after his capture by the Pakistani army, social media has been brimming with misinformation shared at the expense of the pilot and his family members, including his mother and wife.", "lang": "en"}
