At one point, Plouffe and Clinton discuss possible strategies that President Trump and Republicans would use in the 2020 election, and Plouffe notes that Trump did not win a majority of the vote in 2016. (The podcast can be found here, and the relevant discussion begins at the 35:00 mark.)\n\nIn fact, Clinton earned nearly 3 million more popular votes than Trump but narrowly lost three key states \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 so the electoral college tipped to Trump. In all three cases, the votes for third-party candidates, such as libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein, exceeded the margin between Clinton and Trump.\n\nClinton told Plouffe that the GOP strategy will have \u201ctwo parts.\u201d First, she said, Republicans would demonize the Democratic candidate so that even if voters find Trump\u2019s behavior distasteful, they might be reluctant to cast a ballot for a Democrat. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the same as 2016: \u2018Don\u2019t vote for the other guy. You don\u2019t like me? Don\u2019t vote for the other guy because the other guy is going to do X, Y and Z,\u2019 \u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cThey are also going to do third-party again, and I\u2019m not making any predictions but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton added, still not saying who she was talking about. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And, that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset. Totally. And so they know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee they\u2019ll have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is not some outlandish claim. This is reality. If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\u201d\n\nGabbard pushed back hard against Clinton\u2019s statements. When she announced Oct. 25 that she would not run for another term in Congress so she could concentrate on winning the Democratic nomination for president, she added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to run as a third party candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up for debate, as Plouffe\u2019s question is pretty clear, that Secretary Clinton was talking about the GOP, not the Russians, in her grooming comment,\u201d Merrill told the Fact Checker. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how the Wall Street Journal can publish a piece that is factually incorrect, especially when this same thing happened with the New York Times last week and they addressed it immediately.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI spent the bulk of the day and ensuing days pushing back, but it was me versus Twitter with very few people listening to the primary source, which was of course the podcast itself. When something goes out into the world incorrectly, it\u2019s hard to put that toothpaste back into the tube, as I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d\n\nThe initial news reports got it wrong, perhaps fueled by the \u201cnesting doll\u201d comment, with many saying Clinton said the Russians were grooming Gabbard for a third-party bid. Still, Clinton certainly said Gabbard was backed by Russian bots and even suggested she was a Russian asset.", "lang": "en"}
