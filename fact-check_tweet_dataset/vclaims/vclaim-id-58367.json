General Secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Milind Parande claimed that the video depicts brutality against Hindus in West Bengal (archive).\n\n[Disclaimer: The video is violent in nature. Viewer discretion is advised.]\n\nThe video he shared is circulating in the backdrop of communal violence in West Bengal\u2019s Telinipara sparked after members of a community taunted another group as \u201ccorona\u201d. Several shops were ransacked and the two groups also hurled bombs at each other. The police has so far arrested 129 people for the clashes. Parande\u2019s tweet by quote-tweeted by ABVP member and VHP spokesperson Vijay Shankar Tiwari.\n\nTwitter user Akash RSS shared the video and wrote, \u201cThe day Muslim population crosses 50% in India, this will be the condition of all Hindus,\u201d he wrote (archive).\n\nAkash RSS is \u2018Akash Soni\u2019. In a 2017 report, Alt News had investigated that he was the man behind a popular fake news website Coverage Times. Another report published in June 2018 revealed that he was one of the individuals running misinformation and propaganda Facebook page \u2018BJP All India\u2019. Soni was also found to be behind the targetted harassment of journalist Ravish Kumar through a WhatsApp group.\n\nIn fact, the clip is viral on Twitter. One Nitin Shukla added a \u2018Rohingya angle\u2019 to the claim. He wrote, \u201cI repeat \u2013 Palghar wasn\u2019t an accident but an experiment. After Sadhus, common citizens are being lynched. It is being said that this video is from Bengal. Rohingya are catching hold of local Hindus and breaking their arms and legs. Tomorrow, it will be your turn.\u201d An archived version of his tweet can be accessed here.\n\nSplitting the video into multiple keyframes using InVid and reverse-searching one of them on Yandex led us to Bangladeshi pages which had shared the video earlier in April.\n\nGoing through the comments section of the above post on the page \u2018Abu Hossain\u2019, we found people claiming that the incident is from Bangladesh where the men were beaten for stealing autos. In the video as well, we could hear the word \u2018auto\u2019 uttered by someone in the crowd. Using this as a clue, we searched videos on Facebook with Bengali keywords \u2018\u0985\u099f\u09cb \u099a\u09c1\u09b0\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u2019 which translates to \u2018auto theft Bangladesh\u2019. This redirected us to several posts from March 2019.\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Bangladeshi page \u2018News media Bangla\u2019 shared the video with the caption, \u201cA thief was brutally beating for stealing an auto. Was it okay to thrash him in this manner? What do you think?\u201d\n\nAnother page \u2018\u099a\u0981 \u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u2019 shared the video the next day and wrote, \u201cThief beaten for stealing auto.\u201d\n\nWhile we were unable to locate any media reports, it is clear that the video is over a year old and cannot represent any recent incident from West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
