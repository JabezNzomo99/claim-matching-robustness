Due to that tendency, we regularly remind our readers that no one is ever known to have died from receiving randomly poisoned Halloween candy, that teenagers are not smoking bedbugs to get high, receiving temporary tattoos laced with hallucinogens, or rubbing Burt\u2019s Bees lip balm under their eyelids for an easy buzz.\n\nIn November 2017, a Facebook user named David Samson took advantage of this form of parental overconcern when he shared an image of a common hand gesture along with the claim that it was being used by teenagers to help them acquire drugs:\n\nThis is not a joke! This is a sign our kids are using nowadays for drug communication of cocaine and acid! If your kid does this hand sign it\u2019s their way of asking \u201cdo you have the goods?\u201d please spread this to other parents! My 10 year old little Susan and her friends were caught up in this and thankfully the wife and I caught it and got them all the help and support they needed.\u201d\n\nDespite the first sentence of the post, the warning was not based in reality. Although the pictured hand gesture may have different meanings to different people, it is most commonly used by youngsters in conjunction with \u201cThe Circle Game,\u201d a sort of \u201cmade you look\u201d prank that appears to be experiencing a surge in popularity. The Urban Dictionary explains the game as follows:\n\nThe game starts out when the Offensive Player creates a circle with their thumb and forefinger, not unlike an \u201cA-Okay\u201d signal, somewhere below his waist. His goal is to trick another person into looking at his hand. If the Victim looks at the hand, he has lost the game, and is subsequently hit on the bicep with a closed fist, by the offensive player.\n\nAs it turned out, this \u201cwarning\u201d was an online version of the aforementioned \u201cCircle Game\u201d: the person who posted the original (and fake) \u201cwarning\u201d declared himself the \u201cBEST troll\u201d in a message posted a few days after the original post went viral:\n\nThe claim that this hand gesture was being used to acquire drugs did not originate with a police department, school, or any other authoritative body \u2014 it was simply posted to troll overly worried parents and trick his followers into a digital round of an online game.", "lang": "en"}
