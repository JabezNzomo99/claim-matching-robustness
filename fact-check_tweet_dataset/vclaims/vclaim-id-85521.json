Trump\u2019s facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to Obama\u2019s in 2011\n\nObama responded to an actual threat \u2014 the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. Obama\u2019s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country from traveling to the United States. Trump\u2019s policy was much more sweeping. The Trump White House failed to provide any evidence for its position, pointing to attacks unrelated to countries named in the original executive order.\n\n4. Here\u2019s what you need to know about preexisting conditions in the GOP health plan\n\nWhen it comes to health care, readers should be wary about claims that important changes in health-care coverage are without consequences and that people are \u201cprotected\u201d \u2014 or that the changes will result in massive dislocation and turmoil. There are always winners and losers in a bill of this size. In this case, if the House bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states \u2014 and then how those decisions are implemented.\n\n7. Spicer earns Four Pinocchios for false claims on inauguration crowd size\n\nThe day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe.\u201d Trump later made similar claims touting his crowd size.\n\n \n\n It was easy to discover that this statement was simply not true. Although crowd estimates are not definitive, images extending over the Mall and looking toward the Capitol clearly showed that fewer people attended Trump\u2019s inauguration than either of Barack Obama\u2019s. Viewership data further debunked such claims.\n\n8. Julian Assange\u2019s claim that there was no Russian involvement in WikiLeaks emails\n\n9. Did the Clinton Foundation pay for Chelsea\u2019s wedding?\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, two readers separately asked The Fact Checker about a news report that apparently swayed some voters at the last minute. These readers\u2019 friends had heard just before Election Day that Hillary Clinton used Clinton Foundation money to pay for Chelsea\u2019s wedding \u2014 and this news tipped their vote for Trump. \u201cI know the election is over, but I would love to know the real facts,\u201d a reader said.\n\nThe claim originated in a former Clinton aide\u2019s email, released via WikiLeaks just before Election Day. The aide claimed Chelsea had used \u201cfoundation resources for her wedding.\u201d But no evidence has emerged that even volunteers were used. The foundation, the family and the wedding planner deny the claim made in the email. The wedding planner paid the bills and submitted one bill to the Clinton family. We didn\u2019t award a Pinocchio rating, since no specific person repeated this allegation.\n\n10. Trump\u2019s claim that Korea \u2018actually used to be a part of China\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump misunderstood what Xi told him during their meeting, or whether Xi really told him that Korea \u201cactually used to be a part of China.\u201d But what is clear is the history, which we explained in our fact check. Bottom line: Korea and China have long been intertwined, geopolitically and culturally. But Korea was not a spinoff of China, as he made it seem, and Korea has its own unique roots and history.", "lang": "en"}
