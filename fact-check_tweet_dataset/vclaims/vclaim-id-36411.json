The viral video with a similar claim has been shared by many on Facebook.\n\nAt the 56th second of the video, we saw a man in uniform pass by with a dark-coloured emblem on his left arm.\n\nSince the viral video looks like an eviction drive where police are usually deployed, we started looking for similar police emblems on the Internet. Searching among police emblems of various states, we found that the emblem in the viral video looks similar to the one of Odisha Police.\n\nAfter getting this clue that the video might be from Odisha, we searched the Internet using keywords such as \"eviction, fruit vendors, Odisha\", and found a similar video of the same incident from the YouTube channel of Odisha TV.\n\nThe video was uploaded by OTV on January 24, 2010. The video is more than three minutes long. The caption of the video reads: \"Fruit Carts Destroyed During BMC's Eviction Drive Near Unit 1 Market In Bhubaneswar.\"\n\nThe above video was shot from a different angle. But we could identify the same people seen in the viral video as well.\n\nIn both the videos, a man in a white cap and blue jeans can be seen instructing people.\n\nA man in a half sweater and full sleeve shirt can be identified easily in both the videos.\n\nWe also found that on February 8 this year, news website \"Odisha Bytes\" did a fact-check story saying that the viral video is from Odisha.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral video of the eviction drive is not from Uttar Pradesh but Bhubaneswar in Odisha.", "lang": "en"}
