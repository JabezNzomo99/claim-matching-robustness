Sanders certainly kept it quiet", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-04-13T07:00:29Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84821", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/13/the-bernie-sanders-general-electric-dispute-over-a-plant-visit/", "vclaim": "General Electric insisted Immelt was correct. \u201cWe stand by Jeff\u2019s piece,\u201d said spokeswoman Uni Pulizzi.\n\n We should note that the two men could be talking past each other. Immelt\u2019s article referred to the \u201csenator\u201d and said \u201cVermont\u2019s junior senator is always welcome to come by for a visit\u201d to see some $100 million in new investments. Sanders\u2019s Senate tenure began nine years ago, in 2007. But Sanders said he had visited the plant \u201cyears ago,\u201d apparently referring to before his Senate tenure.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\u2019s Senate colleague, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D), at least twice in recent years has toured the plant to learn about the company\u2019s new technology and meet with company officials. The Rutland Herald described a 2013 visit by Leahy, noting it was not even an election year. \u201cLeahy works to get more business for GE Rutland,\u201d said the headline on the article.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2008, Stewart had headed the Addison County Economic Development Corp. He said in that post he also saw a lack of interest by Sanders in the concerns of business. Sanders at the time was Vermont\u2019s lone member of the House. \u201cOn many occasions, we had both Sen. Leahy and Sen. [James] Jeffords but Sanders never got involved with anything having to do with the business community,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nStewart recalled that when he was upset at some remarks Sanders had made concerning a labor-management dispute at a local factory, he called Sanders\u2019s office to warn that his rhetoric might inflame a delicate situation that could result in the plant\u2019s closure. \u201cI was told there was no one in his office who dealt with the business side,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then the Sanders campaign connected The Fact Checker with Chris Townsend, a retired political director of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). Townsend distinctly remembers Sanders visiting the Rutland plant in 1996 or 1997, when he was a member of Congress. Townsend says he recalls the visit because he was quite upset that Sanders would visit the plant \u2014 which remains nonunion despite years of efforts by the UE to try to unionize it.\n\nTownsend said he objected to the visit because he felt it would be too stage-managed and that a visit by Sanders would give too much credibility to a company that he said was \u201cethically and criminally challenged.\u201d He has no clear memory of Sanders\u2019s impressions of the visit.\n\n Normally, a lawmaker might issue a news release about such a plant visit. But Warren Gunnels, a Sanders policy adviser, said no news release was issued because of the union issue. But he said, \u201cthe senator has a good memory.\u201d\n\nPulizzi of GE, informed of Townsend\u2019s remarks, went back again to GE officials at the plant and reported that no one recalls a visit by Sanders in the 1990s. There appear to be no records of a visit either, such as photographs, news releases or even memos. \u201cIt is kind of a big deal when a member of Congress visits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not an everyday occurrence. People remember that stuff and there is always some institutional memory.\u201d That was not the case with Sanders, she said.\n\nAs a factual matter, Sanders clearly has not visited the plant or taken a tour since he became senator nine years ago. Sanders bluntly accused Immelt of \u201cnot telling the truth,\u201d saying he had visited the plant \u201cyears ago.\u201d But that sidesteps the point that Immelt was making \u2014 that the company has invested tens of millions of dollars to modernize the facility and yet Sanders has not bothered to see the improvements. His posture stands in contrast to other members of the Vermont delegation who have been repeat visitors to the facility during Sanders\u2019s Senate tenure.", "lang": "en"}
