It may actually come from advertising executive Howard W. Newton.\n\nAn English physicist and mathematician, Newton formulated three laws describing the motion of objects that would eventually form the basis of classical mechanics. He published the three laws of motion, as well as his theory of universal gravity, in the \u201cPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.\u201d\n\nNewton wrote on a variety of subjects during his lifetime, ranging from the motion of the planets to the composition of white light, yet there is no evidence that he authored this saying. A search of the Newton Project archive turned up no results in his texts, notebooks, or correspondence.\n\n\u201cIsaac Newton never made such a statement,\u201d said California Institute of Technology professor Mordechai Feingold in an email to The Daily Caller. \u201cIt\u2019s often attributed to Howard Newton.\u201d\n\nIndeed, website Quote Investigator found the earliest match for the statement in the August 1946 issue of a women\u2019s magazine called Redbook. The quote, which appears in a sidebar along with seven other sayings, appears to have been written by Howard W. Newton.", "lang": "en"}
