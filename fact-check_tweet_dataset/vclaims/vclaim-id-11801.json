He said:\n\nThe ICC is chaired by Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, a Nigerian lawyer who was elected in March to serve as the court\u2019s president for three years, replacing Judge Silvia Fern\u00e1ndez de Gurmendi.\n\nDuterte confused Eboe-Osuji with Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, the cousin\u2014not the brother\u2014of Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein and the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR).\n\nUnlike the OHCHR, the ICC, an independent judicial body created by the Rome Statute, is of the UN.\n\nZeid, whose term as UN rights chief ended in August, earned Duterte\u2019s ire when he suggested that the president submit himself to a psychiatric examination after the Philippine government linked Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, to communist rebels.\n\nIn 2002, Zeid served as the first president of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), the management oversight and legislative of the ICC.\n\nBoth the ICC and the ASP were established under the Rome Statute but as separate bodies.\n\nThe ICC investigates, prosecutes and tries individuals accused of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.\n\nThe ASP provides oversight, elects the court\u2019s judges and prosecutors and approves the budget.\n\nIn March, the Philippines from the ICC after it a preliminary examination on the government over the thousands of killings arising from the government\u2019s war on drugs.\n\nDespite this, the ICC has Dec. 5 it has continued to \u201cgather, receive and review information\u201d on the alleged crimes from a wide range of sources.\n\nIn the same speech, Duterte repeated at least four false claims previously fact-checked by VERA Files.\n\nFirst, that the European Union created the ICC, which was established by the Rome Statute. (See )\n\nSecond, that Japan got the \u201cgreatest\u201d aid after World War II, which could not have been possible based on official data. (See )\n\nThird, that the Philippines has no oil despite the presence of an oil field that started commercial production as early as 1979. (See )\n\nLast, that 3,000 policemen and soldiers have been killed in the drug war, higher than his figure of 700 in November and 1,000 in August.
