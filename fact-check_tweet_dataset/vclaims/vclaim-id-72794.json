Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., focused on a fast-food icon to drive home her message.\n\nHer tweet said: \"In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million. The median pay for a McDonald's worker that year was $7,000. This is a moral outrage. We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. #RaiseTheWage\"\n\nThe tweet features a video of Omar at a Feb. 7 congressional hearing in which she said, \"The median pay for a McDonald\u2019s worker was $7,000 in 2017. That is the pay gap between the CEO that\u2019s making $21.8 (million) to the $7,000 that a worker who has put in 40 hours a day gets paid.\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of Omar before, it\u2019s because she was in the news recently apologizing for comments about campaign contributions and Israel, after her fellow Democrats said the comments were anti-Semitic.\n\nMost of Omar\u2019s public comments since her 2018 election have focused on families and wages.\n\nOmar\u2019s staff told us the McDonald\u2019s numbers come from the company itself. (She meant to say 40 hours \"a week\" and not \"a day\" during her remarks.) As part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms, publicly traded companies have to report how much compensation the CEO got and how much the median worker got.\n\nIn McDonald\u2019s SEC filing, it said CEO Steve Easterbrook made $21.8 million in 2017. The amount was largely driven by stock price and other company performance incentives.\n\nThe company also said its median worker made $7,017, as Omar said. But there are two important qualifications: That was for all McDonald\u2019s workers across the globe. And it included \"all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers.\" The company\u2019s filing gave the example of a part-time restaurant crew worker in Poland who made the median amount.\n\nOmar\u2019s statement was about raising the U.S. hourly wage to $15.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s worldwide median pay doesn\u2019t say anything about pay in the United States, with its very different labor market and all the things that affect those markets, such as health insurance, labor laws and more.\n\nIf $7,000 a year isn\u2019t the right number for a median American McDonald\u2019s worker, what is?\n\nMcDonald\u2019s couldn\u2019t provide the answer, although the press office told us that the average pay of hourly workers is over $10 an hour, for corporate-owned establishments. That represents about one out of nine McDonald\u2019s, because most are franchise-owned.\n\nThe economics firm Indeed posts McDonald\u2019s pay on its website. The average crew member, like the one in Poland, makes $9.21 an hour in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median pay for a someone doing that work in the fast-food industry is $9.70 an hour.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hours worked per week at a limited-service restaurant is 24.2 hours.\n\nScale that up to a full year and, using the slightly higher rate from the BLS, the typical crew worker makes about $12,200.\n\nWe invited McDonald\u2019s to respond to our calculation and the press office said the company had no further information to share.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented think tank, compares the pay of CEOs to typical workers. The institute estimated that in the United States, the typical CEO makes 312 times more than the average worker. Based on our analysis, the ratio at McDonald\u2019s is about 1,786 to one.\n\nOmar said that while the McDonald\u2019s CEO made $21.8 million, the median worker made $7,000.\n\nThose numbers reflect the company\u2019s official filing, but Omar failed to note that the worker pay was a worldwide estimate and that it included part-time workers. Based on available information, we estimated that the typical McDonald\u2019s crew member works part-time and makes about $12,000 a year. That\u2019s about two-thirds more than Omar said.\n\nThe disparity between the CEO and the typical worker remains vast. But the specifics Omar offered leave the wrong impression about the real numbers for U.S. workers who would be affected by a minimum wage hike. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
