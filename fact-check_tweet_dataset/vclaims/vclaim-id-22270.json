It said that people claiming to be living alone, when they weren\u2019t, was one of the most common types of benefit fraud.\n\nLooking at the cost of overpayments where benefit fraud has happened, about 9% was estimated to be down to claimants saying they were single and not informing DWP they actually lived with someone else and had a \u201cjoint household\u201d in 2016/17. So this was probably the fourth most common type of benefit fraud that year, where the reason was known.\n\nThe figure includes the cost of fraud overpayments for Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment. These account for around a third of all benefit spending and a sample of cases are continuously reviewed for fraud and other types of overpayment or underpayment to claimants. From this sample of benefits an overall estimate is then produced, so there is a grey area around the numbers meaning we can\u2019t be sure exactly what the rank order is.\n\nMost other benefits are only reviewed occasionally or not at all so we don\u2019t know the specific reasons for fraud overpayments in these cases.\n\nDWP says that benefit fraud occurs when three things happen: \u201cThe basic conditions for receipt of benefit, or the rate of benefit in payment, are not being met; The claimant can reasonably be expected to be aware of the effect on entitlement; [and] Benefit stops or reduces as a result of the review\u201d.\n\nConcealing employment by the claimant or the claimant\u2019s partner was the most common type of fraud (estimated to be 35% of spending on fraud overpayments) where the reason was known.\n\nOther fraud types include \u2018loss of claimant contact\u2019, which is estimated to account for 23% of fraud overpayments. This is where a claimant being reviewed by the survey does not engage with the process, or withdraws their benefit claim.\n\nAn estimated 9% of fraud overpayments relate to the information about a claimant\u2019s savings being hidden or incorrect.\n\nBenefit fraud is one type of overpayment\u2014where money is lost because claimants are paid too much. Fraud accounted for almost two thirds of overpayments in 2016/17 where the reason for the overpayment was known. Other overpayments were due to errors made by the claimant or officials.\n\nThe value of fraud overpayments was estimated to be 1.2% of all benefit spending that year.\n\nThe estimates don\u2019t catch every instance of fraud. \u201cThis is because fraud is, by its nature, a covert activity and some suspicions of fraud on the sample cases cannot be proven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
