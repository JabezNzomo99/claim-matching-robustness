Vehicle owner was dragged and thrashed today on 14th by police of Gaur thana in Basti district. Strict action should be taken against these policemen.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The incident is two years old and has nothing to do with traffic checking.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the 25-second video was viewed more than 5,07,000 times and shared over 9,300 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nSeveral people have shared it on Twitter as well.\n\nIn the video, a few policemen are seen dragging and thrashing a man in front of a police station, while onlookers are standing around. A woman's voice can also be heard in the background.\n\nWhen the man is taken inside the police station campus, one of the cops questioned the person who was shooting the incident, to which the latter replied he is a reporter. A board with Gaur police station, Basti, can be seen in the background.\n\nWith the help of keyword search using a combination of words \"Basti man beaten by police\" we found a news clip published by \"Samachar Plus\" on November 14, 2017, with the caption \"Horrifying Face of UP Police: Video Cops Beating Man In Basti\". The news clip has the same viral video.\n\nAccording to the news report, the incident took place on November 14, 2017, in Gaur police station in Basti district. The man was in an inebriated state and causing trouble. The same incident was also reported by \"Patrika\".\n\n\"The Times of India\" had also uploaded this video on the same day with the same report.\n\nAfter this video went viral recently, Basti police replied on Twitter clarifying that the incident took place in 2017.\n\nThey also claimed that this incident has no connection with traffic checking. According to them, policemen seen in the video are wearing winter uniforms, and therefore, it has no relation with the current context of traffic checking.\n\nThis incident of police brutality caught on camera had shocked many people and UP police were heavily criticised for this outrageous behavior. But the viral claim connecting this video with traffic checking is misleading.\n\nThis claim was earlier debunked by \"Factly\" as well.", "lang": "en"}
