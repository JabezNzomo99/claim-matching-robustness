However, we found that these are actually Apache choppers belonging to the US military flying over a lake in Arizona and has no relation to India at all. This claim comes in the aftermath of reports of the Indian Army increasing their presence and strength of troops in the Ladakh sector. Reports have claimed that weapons and equipment have also been increased in the area as tensions with China and India continue to simmer along the LAC. An archived version of this tweet can be seen here. Many people shared the video of two choppers flying low over a lake with blue waters, with a continuous range of hills on one side, claiming that it showed Apache helicopters of the Indian Air Force flying over the Pangong Lake in Ladakh. Why Do People Believe in Fake News Even After Reading Fact-Checks?\n\nOne of the comments on this post was by a user called Ron Warren who said that it was one of the best flights of his life and also added more photos and videos of the same day. On going through Warren\u2019s Facebook profile, we found a photo of him in the uniform of the US Army, as well as a photo of him with an Apache AH-64. Further, we found other videos of Lake Havasu on Facebook and Instagram which matched the visuals of the viral video - the same hills, and the same lake with water of the same colour. We also searched on YouTube with relevant keywords and found a video tagged Lake Havasu with similar visuals, which also stated that it showed Apache helicopters flying low over Lake Havasu. Lastly, we checked photos of the Apache AH-64 helicopter used by the US Army, and found that they matched with those seen in the viral video. Picture of Apache Ah-64 from Wikipedia (top); picture of chopper from viral video (bottom) We also corroborated photos of the AH-64 chopper from Boeing\u2019s official website. Apache AH-64 taken from Boeing website (left); Chopper seen at the back in the viral video (right). Moreover, choppers of the Indian Air Force have the Indian tricolour and the the IAF insignia, both of which are missing on the choppers seen in the viral video. Below are photos of Apaches owned by the Indian Air Force. Therefore, it is clear that a video of Apache choppers belonging to the US Army flying over Lake Havasu, Arizona, is being falsely shared as IAF choppers over Ladakh\u2019s Lake Pangong.
