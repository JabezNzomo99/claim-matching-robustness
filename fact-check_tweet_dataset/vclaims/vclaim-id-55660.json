The accompanying caption claims that morel mushrooms are the cause of the new coronavirus.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any scientific research to support the post\u2019s claim. Searching the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization turns up no results linking the mushroom to the new coronavirus or the disease caused by it, COVID-19.\n\n\u201cCoronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets,\u201d the CDC notes on its website. \u201cCurrently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Catfish Are Coronavirus Carriers)\n\nThe exact origin of the new coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019 remains unknown, but experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Its genetic sequence shares similarities with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to civet cats to humans, according to Nature.\n\nThe meme was posted in a Facebook group dedicated to morel-hunting on April 2. It appears to have been intended as a joke, but some Facebook users took the meme\u2019s claim as fact amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 102,000 people worldwide to date.", "lang": "en"}
