You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said at least twice that the whistleblower has a \u201cstatutory right\u201d to anonymity. When Republicans ask questions that might touch on the whistleblower\u2019s identity, Schiff usually interjects to tell witnesses to be careful with their answers. (In September, Schiff was arranging for the whistleblower to give testimony, but after threats started to emerge, those plans were scuttled and Schiff said the whistleblower\u2019s safety would be \u201cat grave risk.\u201d)\n\n\u201cNothing in the ICWPA expressly protects the anonymity of a complainant, or provides sanctions for someone who discloses it,\u201d Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and an expert on national security law, previously told The Fact Checker. \u201cI think the harder question is whether disclosing a whistleblower\u2019s identity could run afoul of other statutes, such as the federal criminal laws barring efforts to intimidate witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile not explicit in the statute, the obvious intent of the ICWPA was to create a channel through which intelligence employees could make disclosures of urgent concerns internally, securely, and anonymously (if they so choose),\u201d McCullough wrote in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s reinforced by the committee report\u2019s recognition that whistleblowers could seek anonymous guidance from their home agency when making whistleblowing disclosures. The lack of whistleblowers\u2019 right to enforce their confidentiality may be a loophole that Congress should correct.\u201d\n\nA House Democratic aide made similar points when we sought comment: \u201cCongress has enacted laws that require agencies that are responsible for receiving whistleblower disclosures, including the inspector general for the intelligence community, have restrictions on revealing identities of whistleblowers. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has long recognized that right. Republican members are asking witnesses to reveal the identity of an anonymous whistleblower, which would violate the law by changing the working conditions for the whistleblower. Revealing the whistleblower\u2019s identity would be an act of retaliation because it would cause a fundamental change in the individual\u2019s working conditions.\u201d\n\nFederal law expressly restricts the inspector general\u2019s office from disclosing whistleblowers\u2019 identities. It says that \u201cthe Inspector General shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation or the disclosure is made to an official of the Department of Justice responsible for determining whether a prosecution should be undertaken.\u201d\n\nThat appears to be the lone statutory restriction on disclosing a whistleblower\u2019s identity, applicable only to the inspector general\u2019s office. We found no court rulings on whether whistleblowers have a right to anonymity under the ICWPA or related statutes. Vladeck said it is nonetheless a best practice to avoid disclosure of the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s identity, \u201cgiven the concerns about retaliation.\u201d McCullough said, \u201cWe\u2019ve stepped into bizarro-land when senior policymakers are trying to yank a CIA employee into the public spotlight in retaliation for making a whistleblowing complaint, especially when there are credible threats to that employee\u2019s personal safety.\u201d\n\nIn his Sept. 26 testimony, Maguire, the acting DNI, said, \u201cThe inspector general is properly protecting the complainant\u2019s identity and will not permit the complainant to be subject to any retaliation or adverse consequences for communicating the complaint to the inspector general.\u201d He also said, \u201cI am absolutely, absolutely committed to protecting the anonymity of this individual, as well as making sure that Michael Atkinson, who is our ICIG, continues to be able to do his job unfettered.\u201d\n\nThe case for Two: The ICWPA provides a confidential process to report concerns, and some observers say it gives whistleblowers an implied right to anonymity. Outing the whistleblower could lead to the sort of workplace retribution barred by law. The whistleblower filed his complaint to the intelligence community inspector general\u2019s office, which is restricted by statute from disclosing his identity (though other officials are not).\n\nThe case for Three: The ICWPA doesn\u2019t include language granting whistleblowers a right to anonymity. Neither do other statutes, directives or court rulings that apply to the intelligence community. The argument that whistleblower-protection laws implicitly provide anonymity is more nuanced, and debatable, than what Schiff said in a nationally televised hearing. (And what good is a statutory right anyway if there\u2019s no mechanism to enforce it?)", "lang": "en"}
