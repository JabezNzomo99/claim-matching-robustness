(Read here, here)\n\nWe searched with the same text on Facebook and found that the image was viral with the same misleading caption.\n\nAlso Read: No, A Temple Was Not Turned Into A Quarantine Center For Muslims In AP\n\n\n\nOn performing a reverse image search using Google Images, we found that the viral image goes as far back as 2015. The search results showed a July 2015 article that had the same image stating that the Telangana Government would be distributing gift packs of 500-500 rupees to poor Muslim families during Ramzan.\n\nWhile we could not establish when exactly the photo was taken, it is possible that the image could be older than 2015.\n\n\n\nThe Telangana government has in the past distributed Ramzan gift packs, however this year due to the spread of the Coronavirus it has not done so.\n\nA memo by the Minorities Welfare Department dated April 27, 2020, says that all government programs pertaining to Ramzan this year had been canceled in view of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\"The state government is not giving Ramzan gift this year due to the Coronavirus situation,\" Dileep Konatham, Director, Digital Media, Government of Telangana, said.\n\nTelangana Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao at a recent press conference said that the Ramzan gift bags would not be distributed as people would touch the bags with their hands and there is a chance for the virus to spread.\n\nKrishank Manne, Telangana Rashtra Samiti leader and head of the party's social media wing tweeted the clip from the press conference calling out Chavhanke.\n\nBOOM spoke to Manne, who also said that the government was not distributing the Ramzan kits this year and said that the government also distributes such kits during other festivals like Dushera.\n\nOn searching with the keywords, 'gifts', 'Christmas', 'Dushera', we found news reports on the Telangana government distributing gift schemes to the poor during other festivals also like during Bathukamma and Christmas.\n\nThe false claim was earlier fact-checked by Newsmeter. \n\n\n\nTelangana has reported 1275 positive COVID-19 cases and 30 deaths while writing this article.
