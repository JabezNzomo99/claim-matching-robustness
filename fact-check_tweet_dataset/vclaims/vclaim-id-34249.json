Sondland said he did not.\n\nTrump emphasized this distinction in brief remarks to reporters.\n\n\"I\u2019d say to the ambassador in response: \u2018I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky \u2014 President Zelensky \u2014 to do the right thing,\" Trump said, citing Sondland\u2019s earlier deposition.\n\nWe heard several claims to fact-check from the hearing and the commentary around it, including President Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\nTrump: \"I don\u2019t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well.\"\n\nThe term \"very well\" is in the eye of the beholder, but the available evidence suggests more than a passing acquaintance between the two men.\n\nThere are numerous photos of the Sondand and Trump together, including aboard Air Force One. In October, Trump tweeted that he \"would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify.\"\n\nDuring Sondland\u2019s public testimony, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., read Trump\u2019s comments aloud and asked Sondland if he knew the president well. Sondland said they were not \"close friends\" but have a \"professional, cordial working relationship.\"\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Donald Trump's claim he doesn\u2019t know Gordon Sondland very well\n\nWhile Sondland testified that \"I haven\u2019t had that many communications with the president,\" he later added, when pressed by Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., that it was in the neighborhood of 20 conversations, not all of which were about Ukraine.\n\nSondland said he couldn\u2019t be sure of the exact number because the White House has not turned over all his call records.\n\nHouse Intelligence Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif.: Kurt Volker testified that he was a proud part of the Three Amigos.\n\nThis may have been one of the hearing\u2019s lighter moments, but it\u2019s not accurate.\n\nNunes and Sondland bantered about the \"three amigos\" \u2014 the name of the group that pursued an alternative diplomatic channel to Ukraine. The three \"amigos\" were Sondland; Kurt Volker, who was then the special representative to Ukraine; and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. According to testimony, these three officials conducted an irregular channel of diplomacy to to Ukraine, spearheaded by Giuliani.\n\nNunes said, \"Did you know you were part of the Three Amigos?\"\n\nSondland responded, with a smile, \"I am. I\u2019m a proud part of the Three Amigos.\"\n\nNunes answered, also with a smile: \"And that\u2019s the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what Volker actually said Nov. 19:\n\n\"Much has been made of the term 'Three Amigos.' ... I've never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it, because for me the 'Three Amigos' will always refer to Sen. (John) McCain, Sen. (Joe) Lieberman, and Sen. (Lindsey) Graham in witness to their support for the surge in Iraq.\"\n\nNunes: There were \"anti-Trump efforts by DNC operative Alexandra Chalupa.\"\n\nAlexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee, looked for compromising information about former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and revealed some findings to Ukrainian embassy officials and the DNC, according to Politico.\n\nWe found no evidence that the DNC authorized Chalupa\u2019s research or worked directly with Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Fact-checking what Chalupa and the DNC did in Ukraine\n\nChalupa said she took it upon herself to research Manafort\u2019s connections to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who fled Ukraine amid protests. As Trump\u2019s campaign surged, she started researching Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, too.\n\nChalupa shared some rumors and findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, according to the Politico report.\n\nBut Chalupa took issue with the Politico article. She told CNN she was not an opposition researcher and that the DNC never asked her to seek dirt from Ukraine.\n\nKenneth Vogel, one of the reporters behind the Politico story, clarified on Twitter that the \"DNC consultant was not repping DNC\" in her communications with Ukrainians.\n\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the DNC, told PolitiFact that Chalupa was a part-time consultant hired to help the DNC \"engage in outreach to American ethnic communities.\"\n\n\"The DNC\u2019s contract with Chalupa permitted her to have other clients and/or engage in activities not on behalf of the DNC, which she presumably did,\" Watson said.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas: \"I'd like to enter into the record a Washington Post article from today headlined, \u2018Schiff\u2019s claim that the whistleblower has a \u2018statutory right\u2019 to anonymity.\u2019\"\n\nOur friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Three Pinocchios to the assertion by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that the whistleblower whose letter prompted the impeachment inquiry has \"a statutory right to remain anonymous.\"\n\nWe came to similar conclusions Nov. 11 and again Nov. 19.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Is outing the whistleblower only a crime if the inspector general does it?\n\nA whistleblower has a statutory right not to be retaliated against, but under that law, it\u2019s not at all clear that this includes a right to anonymity.\n\nU.S. Code Section 3033 specifically bars the inspector general for the intelligence community from releasing a name, but it is silent on others who would do so.\n\nAnother part of Section 3033 does provide broader protection for workplace \"reprisal.\" But by addressing \"disclosure\" and \"reprisal\" separately, the law suggests that disclosure by itself doesn\u2019t amount to reprisal \u2014 and that disclosure alone doesn\u2019t qualify for the stronger protections granted against \"reprisal.\"\n\nPam Bondi, Trump impeachment adviser, on CBS News: Says Gordon Sondland \"was ambassador to the Ukraine. He is ambassador to the Ukraine. And the president knows him, the president does not know him very well. He\u2019s a short-term ambassador.\"\n\nSondland is ambassador to the European Union, not Ukraine. The Trump campaign donor and Pacific Northwest hotel magnate was confirmed by the Senate on June 29, 2018.\n\nBondi: \"You know, this all started in a bunker with Adam Schiff and Democrats. Republicans weren't allowed in the door. in fact, they were kicked out of the hearings.\"\n\nThis is also false.\n\nThere were 47 Republicans across three House committees that were allowed to participate in the closed-door depositions in the early stages of the impeachment inquiry, before the formal House vote.\n\nBondi was referencing an attempt to disrupt the hearings led by fellow Floridian Matt Gaetz, a representative from the Panhandle. Gaetz and other members with him were not allowed in because they were not on the relevant committees. Some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, chose not to attend despite being able to.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Limbaugh wrongly claims Republicans are being shut out of impeachment hearings", "lang": "en"}
