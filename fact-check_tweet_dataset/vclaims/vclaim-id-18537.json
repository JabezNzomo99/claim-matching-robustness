Brothers, please share this video and make this video viral. The policeman should be punished -translated ).\n\nThis video is being widely shared on Facebook and Twitter with an identical narrative.\n\nWith the help of a digital verification tool InVid, Alt News obtained multiple keyframes of the video. On reverse searching one of the keyframes on Google, we found a news report which dated back to November 2017. The said incident took place at Paniyara police station located in Maharajganj district (UP) and NOT Gahmar police station which is in Ghazipur district (UP). The teenage boy assaulted by the policemen in the video was accused of theft. Hence, the specific claim, that the teenager was punished by the police for not serving them tea, is false. According to the report, the incident took place in the month of September in 2017.\n\nSub Inspector KN Shahi, one of the senior police officers seen in the video, was then suspended in the matter. Ashutosh Shukla, Additional SP of Maharajganj district was quoted in the report of November 2017, saying, \u201cThe cops were trying to beat the boy and recover the items allegedly stolen by him. They could not find any items on him and so he was let off. We have suspended the policeman in question, the Sub Inspector, and we will take more action after a detailed inquiry.\u201d\n\nNDTV reported, \u201cThe boy was accused of theft by a woman from his village and after a complaint was lodged against him, he was picked up by the police and brought to the police station for questioning.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a two-year-old video of a boy tortured by two policemen over an allegation of theft was falsely shared on social media with the claim that he was tortured for not serving them tea.", "lang": "en"}
