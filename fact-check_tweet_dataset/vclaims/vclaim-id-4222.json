No, that's not true: that story originated from a website that habitually makes up bizarre stories about weird crimes and sex acts purely for entertainment value. It did not happen, the story is not real.\n\nIt was originally published as an article on World News Daily Report on May 7, 2018 under the headline \"Confessed pedophile arrested in Walmart while making love to baby doll\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nChicago, IL | A suspected pedophile has been apprehended by the Chicago police after security guards in a Walmart found the man making love to a realistic-looking baby doll.\n\nSecurity agents warned authorities after capturing video footage of Adam Peever, 59, taking his pants off and proceeding to partake in anal sex with a Berenguer baby doll. A raid at the man's home later revealed he was in possession of child pornography and dozens of similar-looking baby dolls. Peever allegedly confessed to police officers his obsession for children and explained he tried to soothe his addiction with sex with baby dolls so as not to harm any children.\n\nHowever the image used to illustrate the story appears to show an actual pedophile who was convicted in 2007 (Vincent Margera, 51 at the time):\n\nThe man known as \"Don Vito\" on MTV's show \"Viva La Bam\" was convicted Wednesday of two counts of sexual assault on a child. Vincent Margera, 51, who was accused of groping three girls ages 12 to 14 during an autograph signing event last year at mall skate park in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, fell to the floor cursing and yelled, \"Just kill me now.\"\n\nHe passed away in 2015 so it would be hard for him to get arrested in a Walmart in 2018:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
