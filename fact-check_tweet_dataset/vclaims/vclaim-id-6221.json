Facebook users flagged one such story that carried the false headline \u201cDavid Letterman Just Pointed Out What Others Won\u2019t About The Vegas Mass Shooter.\u201d\n\nThe story, which appears on the website Verified Politics, claims that the former late night talk show host \u201ctook to Twitter to lay bare an inconvenient truth that the media usually fails to mention.\u201d The story then inserted a tweet purportedly from Letterman that says, \u201cLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock was NOT a \u2018lone wolf\u2019, he was NOT \u2018mentally ill\u2019, he was a TERRORIST. End white privilege today.\u201d\n\nBut the tweet embedded in the story is not real. It was from an unverified parody account, which Twitter allows under certain rules.\n\nTwitter says a parody account \u201cshould indicate that the user is not affiliated with the account subject by stating a word such as \u2018parody\u2019\u201d in the account bio. Twitter also says the parody account name \u201cshould not be the exact name of the account subject.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter handle for the Letterman parody account is @DavidLetternan \u2013 a misspelling of Letterman\u2019s name. The account also has the word \u201cparody\u201d in the bio.\n\nLetterman\u2019s real Twitter handle is @Letterman, and, unlike the parody account, it is a verified account \u2014 which carries the iconic blue check that indicates the account has been verified by Twitter.\n\nIronically, the website Verified Politics tells its readers, \u201cIf you are tired of \u2018fake news,\u2019 we are the site for you.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nAssociated Press. \u201cLas Vegas attack is deadliest shooting in modern US history.\u201d ABC News. 2 Oct 2017.\n\nRivero, Omar. \u201cDavid Letterman Just Pointed Out What Others Won\u2019t About The Vegas Mass Shooter.\u201d Verified Politics. 2 Oct 2017.", "lang": "en"}
