Two state police officers also died when the helicopter they were piloting while monitoring the unrest crashed. In laying blame on \u201cmany sides\u201d for the carnage, President Trump told reporters:\n\nI will tell you something. I watched those very closely \u2014 much more closely than you people watched it. And you have \u2014 you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I\u2019ll say it right now. You had a group \u2014 you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.\n\nOpponents to the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally on 12 August 2017 in fact did have permits, which were provided to us by the city of Charlottesville; they were allowed to be in nearby Justice and McGuffey parks from 9 A.M. until 7 P.M. Both parks are within a short walking distance to Emancipation Park, where the white supremacist rally was held. Counter-demonstration organizer Walter Heinecke told us:\n\nIt was a rally for racial justice, harmony, and end of white supremacy. I got the permits because at the [8 July 2017] KKK rally after the KKK had left, the police moved on counter-protesters really quickly and declared it an unlawful assembly, and then teargassed counter-protesters without giving them much of a chance to leave. So I got the permits with the understanding that the two parks were fairly close to Emancipation Park and were to be used as lawful assembly spots for counter-demonstrators.\n\nOn the other hand, the Unite the Right rally didn\u2019t have a city permit \u2014 they had a judge\u2019s order. According to documents provided by the city, organizer Jason Kessler applied for a permit on 30 May 2017 to hold the rally at Emancipation Park (which used to be called Lee Park), where a controversial statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee has been the focal point of racial tensions. The city had tried to move that demonstration from Emancipation Park, which is the size of one city block downtown, to McIntire Park, which is larger and away from central Charlottesville. But Kessler sued, and a judge sided with him.\n\nCity spokeswoman Miriam Dickler explained by e-mail how the alt-right rally was allowed to go forward in its originally intended location:\n\nThe City agreed to issue the applicant for the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally a permit for McIntire Park rather than Emancipation Park. The applicant chose to file a lawsuit to go to Emancipation instead. The judge issued an injunction late Friday ordering the City to allow the event to take place in Emancipation Park. This quick turnaround, and the court order, meant that a formal permit for the event was not issued. The City did comply with the court\u2019s direction.\n\nHeinecke, a University of Virginia professor, told us that counter-demonstrators did not need a permit to protest the white supremacist rally at Emancipation Park because it is a public space:\n\nAs Dickler pointed out to the Washington Post, that is true \u2014 the public doesn\u2019t need a permit to enter the park or the sidewalks surrounding it even if an event is scheduled.\n\nThe night before the deadly events of 12 August 2017, tiki-torch carrying white supremacists held another chaotic, violent demonstration during which they were also confronted by counter-protesters. In this instance, no one had a permit because no permit was needed. University of Virginia spokesman Anthony de Bruyn told us in an e-mail:\n\nCounter-protesters did have a city permit for 12 August 2017 events. For the UVA \u201calt-right\u201d rally the night before, no permits were needed and it was a judge\u2019s injunction on the night of 11 August 2017 that allowed the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally to be held the next day at Emancipation Park.", "lang": "en"}
