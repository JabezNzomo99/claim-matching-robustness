Raam raam satty ha\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be false. The coffins are of CRPF personnel who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack in February last year.\n\nUsing reverse image search, AFWA found that the picture was taken on February 15, 2019 a day after the attack during the wreath-laying ceremony at the CRPF camp in Budgam, Jammu and Kashmir. The suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama had led to the death of 40 jawans.\n\nThe post by \"SaLman Hameed\" was shared more than 1,400 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThere have been frequent face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops at multiple locations along LAC in Ladakh. Both countries have increased troop presence in the area. But as of now, there is no such news that China killed 75 Indian troops. Had it been the case, it would have been the most prominent news in the media.\n\nA few days before, it was reported that some Indian jawans were detained by Chinese forces near Pangong Lake in Ladakh. The Indian Army had categorically denied the incident.\n\nSome reports say Chinese troops used sticks, clubs with barbed wires and stones to target Indian forces during a recent stand-off in Eastern Ladakh. But despite being outnumbered, Indian troops retaliated in equal measure, reports say.\n\nIndia Today had reported that tension between the two countries was triggered after India started road construction north of Pangong Lake, well within Indian territory and far from Chinese claim.\n\nBut the viral claim that Chinese troops killed 75 Indian forces in Ladakh is absolutely false.", "lang": "en"}
