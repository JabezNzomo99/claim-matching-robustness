The title of a clip of the episode uploaded on the show\u2019s Youtube channel also said Guterres was \u201cin favor\u201d of Duterte\u2019s drug war.\n\nThe Youtube channel BITAG OFFICIAL uploaded Oct. 12 a 9-minute clip of Tulfo\u2019s BITAG Live episode that day with the title, \u201cUN chief, pabor sa Drug War ni PDu30! CHR, sampal sa inyo (UN chief, in favor of PDu30\u2019s drug war! CHR, this is a slap to your face)!\u201d\n\nThe episode, aired over People\u2019s Television Network (PTV-4) and Radyo Pilipinas (DZRP 738), featured Tulfo reading and translating excerpts from Guterres\u2019 speech at the Sept. 24 High Level Event on Counter-Narcotics at the UN Headquarters in New York.\n\nHe translated this as:\n\nAnother passage he quoted was:\n\nBoth the title of the clip and Tulfo\u2019s report are misleading.\n\nNowhere in his speech did Guterres express support, refer to or even mention Duterte and his drug war, rendering the title untrue.\n\nTulfo also skewed his translation of the UN chief\u2019s words to fit his claim about Duterte\u2019s drug war being in line with the UN\u2019s.\n\nHe turned Guterres\u2019 statement about countries having \u201cdifferences in national priorities\u201d into countries having \u201cdifferences in strategies\u201d in addressing the drug problem.\n\nTulfo also emphasized Guterres\u2019 and the UN\u2019s support for governments fighting substance abuse in their countries, but omitted mentioning that Guterres had repeatedly said drug addicts need to be treated as \u201cvictims\u201d and \u201cpatients.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cTo tackle this complex issue, we need strong action in two areas\u2026 The second action area is making sure that those who need treatment get it. Consumers are first and foremost patients and victims.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201c(D)rug addicts are victims who need treatment rather than punishment.\u201d\n\nDuterte has justified the killings of drug users by saying they were \u201cnot human beings.\u201d He admitted two weeks ago that the only \u201csin\u201d he is guilty of is \u201cextrajudicial killings.\u201d\n\nAt least one website, pinolitika.com, used the misleading Tulfo report in a story that bore the same misleading headline.\n\nThe original YouTube clip and the pinolitika.com report could have reached almost 1.2 million people; its largest traffic generators being the pages President Duterte TV, President Rody Duterte and SENATOR HARRY ROQUE 2019 \u2026.
