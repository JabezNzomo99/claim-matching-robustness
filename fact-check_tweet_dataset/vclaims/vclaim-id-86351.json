Strzok suggests that McCabe be ready if Flynn asked if he were under criminal investigation or began volunteering information, and to consider having an agent present in that event. In a brief email the evening before, [former FBI lawyer Lisa] Page asked Strzok and others to clarify whether FBI policy required agents to inform Flynn that lying to investigators was a crime before they began, or after they believed he made a false statement. A final disclosure includes one page of handwritten notes, dated Jan. 24, that appear to be the writer\u2019s talking points for an internal FBI meeting, advocating that if Flynn lies in the interview, agents should confront him with a redacted piece of evidence so that he will come clean. \u201cI don\u2019t see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on him,\u201d the notes say, adding, \u201cIf we\u2019re seen as playing games, WH will be furious.\u201d It is not clear what evidence the writer was referring to. In the interview, the FBI did not show Flynn a transcript of his conversations with Kislyak. Flynn told investigators he assumed they knew what was said on the call. The Justice Department is expected to formally respond to the allegations by May 11, and has not so far retreated from Flynn\u2019s prosecution. Investigators commonly prepare for interviews, including how to handle situations in which the targets lie.\n\n\u201cTo succeed here, the defense will have to prove not merely that the FBI anticipated that Flynn might lie during the interview, but that the FBI encouraged him to lie and induced him to commit a crime that he otherwise would not have committed,\u201d Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, previously told The Post.\n\nWhat do the prosecutors and judge say?", "lang": "en"}
