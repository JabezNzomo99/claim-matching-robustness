It said that 68% of people in the UK on zero hours contracts didn\u2019t want more hours, rather than 58% as Mr Stewart claimed.\n\nThe figures in the report were from the Labour Force Survey published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in March 2017. It found that 68% of people on zero hours contracts between October and December 2016 who specified a view said they didn\u2019t want more hours. Out of everyone on the contracts (including those who didn\u2019t say what they wanted), 57% didn\u2019t want more hours.\n\nNewer figures are available from the ONS covering the period from April to June 2018. They show that 72% of people on a zero hours contract expressing a preference said they didn\u2019t want more hours, or 63% of everyone on the contracts (including the unknowns).\n\nThe average person on a zero hours contract in mid-2018 usually worked about 25 hours per week, compared to an average of 36 hours for everyone in employment.\n\nThere were estimated to be around 780,000 people employed on zero hours contracts as their main job between April and June 2018. That\u2019s roughly 2.4% of people in employment, or about one in 40 workers. This includes contracts explicitly called \u201czero hours\u201d, but also arrangements with different labels such as \u2018casual contracts\u2019 or 'hours to be notified'.\n\nIn November 2017 there were estimated to be around 1.8 million contracts that \u201cdid not guarantee a minimum number of hours, where work had actually been carried out under those contracts\u201d.\n\nNeither measure is perfect, so we use both to get a better overview of how zero hours contracts are used.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to get comparisons of zero hours contracts over time, increases in the number of people on zero hours contracts between 2011 and 2016 were \u201clikely to have been affected by greater awareness and recognition of the term \u201czero-hours contract\u201d, according to the ONS. This upwards trend in the numbers has reversed more recently.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about how zero hours contracts work and how the figures on them are calculated here.", "lang": "en"}
