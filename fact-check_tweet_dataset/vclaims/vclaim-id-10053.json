During a conference call associated with the results, company executives attributed these weaker-than-expected numbers to a year-on-year decline in NFL television viewership, as well as \u201cnegative consumer sentiment\u201d associated with the controversy surrounding the national anthem protests.\n\nPapa John\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Steve Richie explained the link between the company\u2019s financial position and the NFL:\n\nWe\u2019ve had a long-standing relationship with the NFL and it\u2019s served us quite well, just in terms of the overall brand awareness \u2014 we\u2019re actually the number one recognized partner with the NFL, two years running. So we get the benefit when things are going well, but clearly we\u2019re going to get the downside implications when things aren\u2019t going that well.\n\nRichie summarized the issue as being related to a combination of declining NFL ratings and negative publicity generated by the ongoing anthem protests:", "lang": "en"}
