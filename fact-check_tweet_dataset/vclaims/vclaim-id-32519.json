Trump also made similar remarks about the person who supplied information to the whistleblower.\n\nAt any other time in modern history, a headline that suggested the U.S. president threatened a government whistleblower with death perhaps would seem too far-fetched to be real. But in the toxic political and internet landscape of 2019, some Snopes readers inquired whether it was true.\n\nThe headline, \u201cLeaked Audio Catches Trump Threatening Ukraine Whistleblower With Death And Calling Reporters Scum\u201d was published by the liberal website PoliticusUSA, which pulled its story from the Los Angeles Times, where the story originated.\n\nOn Sept. 26, 2019, the Times published the audio, which was provided by an unnamed attendee at the event where Trump made the remarks. The Times described the event as a private gathering for American diplomatic officials, held that same day at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York. The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump tried to strong-arm Ukraine\u2019s leader into interfering in the 2020 election.\n\nBut basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call. He never saw the call, heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is \u2014 they\u2019re almost a spy. I want to know, who is this person that gave the whistleblower. Who\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? With spies and treason. We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\n\nThe first part of the quote above appears to reference the whistleblower when Trump says, \u201cBut basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call. He never saw the call, heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is \u2014 they\u2019re almost a spy.\u201d The second part of the quote, however, appears to reference the person who provided information to the whistleblower.\n\nIn both cases, Trump suggests they\u2019re spies, and his remarks have been interpreted by some as a \u201cveiled reference to execution\u201d because treason carries the death penalty. It was not the first time the president has brandished the specter of harsh punishment to be levied against his political enemies for investigating him, an action he has stated he considers treason. On Twitter, Trump has accused the whistleblower, and/or the person who supplied the whistleblower with sensitive information, of \u201cspying\u201d on the president.\n\n\n\n In the past, Trump has referenced the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, two American citizens who were executed in 1953 for espionage against the United States on behalf of what was then the Soviet Union. In July 2019, talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump stated in reference to allegations against his campaign of collusion with Russia:\n\nWhat pressure? I didn\u2019t \u2014 I did nothing. Hey, now it\u2019s shown there\u2019s no collusion, there\u2019s no obstruction, there\u2019s no nothing. Honestly, the whole thing, it is really a media witch hunt. It\u2019s been a media witch hunt. And it\u2019s bad for the country. You know, when you talk about Russia, if Russia actually did whatever they want to do, they got to be laughing, because look at what happens \u2014 how much time. . . . They feel it\u2019s a witch hunt, the people. There are a lot of people. And those people vote. They don\u2019t stay home because it\u2019s drizzling. We proved that. But every single party chairman said that my base is substantially stronger than it was in November. That\u2019s a big compliment. That\u2019s a big compliment. And I feel it. And I think what\u2019s happening is, as usual, the Democrats have played their card too hard on the Russia thing, because people aren\u2019t believing it. It\u2019s a witch hunt and they understand that. When they say \u201ctreason\u201d \u2014 you know what treason is? That\u2019s Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving the atomic bomb, okay? But what about all the congressmen, where I see the woman sitting there surrounded by \u2014 in Congress.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s true Trump\u2019s comments are threatening in nature, and he has discussed the death penalty as punishment for treason, we are rating this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d That\u2019s because Trump did not state outright that the whistleblower and/or the whistleblower\u2019s informant should be put to death, but rather implied it.", "lang": "en"}
