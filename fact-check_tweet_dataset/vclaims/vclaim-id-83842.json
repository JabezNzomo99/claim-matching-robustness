The image is a montage of two photos, one from a 2010 protest in Toronto, and another from Trudeau\u2019s visit to a relative\u2019s gravestone in November 2018 in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThis is a photo of the Prime Minister laughing and taking his own picture while burning a CANADIAN FLAG,\u201d claims one Facebook post shared nearly 4,000 times since late December. In the photo, an enthusiastic Trudeau is taking a selfie while crouching next to a burning Canadian flag held by a person dressed in black.\n\nThe photo is a montage made from two distinct pictures, one which was shared on Twitter in November 2018.\n\nWhile on an official trip in Singapore, the social media-friendly prime minister posed for a selfie in front of his fourth-great-grandmother\u2019s gravestone. CTV news reporter Kevin Gallagher posted the photo on Twitter on November 15.\n\nThe photo was then posted to the \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d section of 4chan, an online forum, where it was cropped, flipped, and juxtaposed on several photos.\n\nWhile most of the resulting images were clearly fabricated and trivial in their tone, some were more realistic, such as the one with the burning flag which was later presented as real content on Facebook.\n\nThe burning flag photo was taken at an anti-G20 protest in Toronto in July 2010. It was posted by Tami Starlight to the Vancouver Media Co-Op.", "lang": "en"}
