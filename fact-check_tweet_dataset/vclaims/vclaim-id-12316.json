Critics of the Liberal Party tag its members as \u2018dilawan\u2019 (yellow). Roxas and Aquino were not always in the top 12 across these surveys.\u201d\n\nIn January, Gadon asked the Commission on Elections to bar the two research firms from releasing pre-election surveys.\n\nHis expletive-laden rant disputing the statistical basis of SWS and Pulse Asia survey sample sizes had also been been debunked by VERA Files.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang Palace Presidential Museum and Library.
