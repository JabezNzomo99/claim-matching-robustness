We were not agitating. We had claimed that space. We had set up a triage area in case of any injuries. We had eyewash, sutures, EMT, doctors, EMS workers. They came in full riot gear, hit us with shields, threw several people to the ground. We were grabbed, thrown, shouted at, screamed at, treated as criminals. No one resisted.\u201d Videos of the tent\u2019s destruction went viral, and public outrage followed.\n\nThe Asheville Police Department\u2019s initial statement from Chief David Zack on June 3, 2020, confirmed that the incident took place, but defended the department\u2019s actions, largely placing blame for the incident on the medical volunteers:\n\nAs the Chief of Police I understand the concern has been raised over the destruction of water, food, and medical supplies. The Asheville Police Department (APD) would always prefer confiscation over destruction. We apologize for not being able to confiscate these supplies last night. Over the past three days APD has tried to eliminate objects that can be thrown at protesters and law enforcement. Because water bottles, in particular, have been continuously used over the last three nights, officers destroyed them. Officers also searched for potentially dangerous objects, such as explosives. The supply station was not permitted by the City of Asheville and was located on private property, without the permission of the property owner. The actions involving the supply station occurred following multiple warnings, and after the 8 p.m. city-wide curfew.\n\nBut this statement from the chief only exacerbated tensions in Asheville.\n\nSean Miller, one of the organizers of the medic tent, told a local CBS affiliate that the statement was \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nMiller continued, saying, \u201cWe had no explosives. There was nothing that could have been perceived as an explosive.\u201d\n\nFaced with continued backlash, Zack, who has been on the job just four months, released a second statement on June 4, 2020, this time apologizing for his department\u2019s role in the incident:\n\nI am David Zack, chief of the Asheville police department, speaking to you today to address a matter that has deeply affected our community, embarrassed our city and our department. Of course, I am referring to the destruction of a medic tent during protests on Tuesday, June 2nd. For these actions, I am truly sorry. Some may find this message to be too little too late, and that\u2019s fair. Yesterday\u2019s statement was inadequate in addressing your concerns. And I apologize for that as well. \u2026 I know you\u2019ve been promised change in the past, but you\u2019ve yet to hear that promise from me. Police reform needs to be more than a conversation. There needs to be action. And I assure you, action is forthcoming.\n\nBecause the incident was captured in multiple videos and has been confirmed by the Asheville Police Department itself, the claim that officers forcibly destroyed a medic tent during a protest against police brutality is \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
