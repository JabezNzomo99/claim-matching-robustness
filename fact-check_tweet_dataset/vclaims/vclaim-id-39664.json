The Marcoses have failed to show proof of other legitimate sources of their wealth, thus the High Court used this to declare the family's Swiss deposits as ill-gotten.\n\nThe SC declared the Swiss deposits, which had an aggregate amount of over $658 million as of January 31, 2002, as ill-gotten wealth. The money was held in escrow at the time at the Philippine National Bank (PNB). (READ: FALSE: \u2018No proof\u2019 that Marcos couple stole billions from Filipinos).\n\nBased on the official report of the budget minister then, Ferdinand Marcos earned a total salary of P660,000 from 1966 to 1976, and P800,000 from 1977 to 1984 while he was president. Imelda Marcos accumulated a total of P718,750 from June 1976 to February 22-25, 1986 as then-human settlements minister. Below is the amount of salaries they earned and the sources of income as reflected in the SC decision:\n\nThe total accumulated salaries of the Marcos couple while in power was over P2,319,583.33. This amount, when converted based on the dollar-exchange rate during their time, is equivalent to $304,372.43 \u2013 lower than the illegal money forfeited from Swiss banks.\n\nHowever, the SC said in its July 2003 ruling that only the sum of over $304,000 could be considered as the known lawful income of the Marcos couple since they did not file any Statement of Assets and Liabilities (SAL) which could determine their net worth.", "lang": "en"}
