(Read more about our partnership.)\n\nFor starters, the evidence listed by the post isn\u2019t evidence at all. It simply reports the vote totals for Trump, Clinton, Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson.\n\nClinton lost Wisconsin by 22,748 votes, while Stein accumulated 31,072, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. But this would only be evidence if every Stein voter had voted for Clinton instead, a claim the post doesn\u2019t make and that experts say is not true.\n\nAnd this line of thinking ignores that Johnson pulled a far larger vote share \u2014 106,674 \u2014 and Libertarians have historically drawn more voters from the Republican side.\n\n\"This idea that categorically minority parties draw from Democratic voters is just absurd,\" said Christopher Devine, assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton, whose study on the 2016 third-party candidates is currently going through peer review.\n\nBarry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed.\n\n\"Every minor party or independent candidate who has run in modern history has taken some votes from (both parties),\" said Burden, who has authored numerous studies on the impact of third-party candidates. \"It\u2019s also incorrect to say the votes come even disproportionately from a Democratic candidate.\"\n\nTo be sure, some third-party candidates have swung races to Democrats, most notably the 2000 election where Ralph Nader\u2019s presence pulled votes that could have swung Florida \u2014 and ultimately the country \u2014 in favor of Al Gore instead of George W. Bush.\n\nBut the impact in other recent elections has varied, according to experts and an array of studies. The impact depended on the specific background of the third-party candidate.\n\nIn the 2016 election, voters who backed Johnson or Stein would have leaned toward Trump if forced to choose in a two-way race, according to a survey by international research group YouGov. Among likely voters, 34% preferred Trump, 25% preferred Clinton and 42% said they had no preference.\n\nThe Washington Post cited exit polls in reporting Johnson likely moved the final margin about 0.4% in Trump\u2019s favor. And a study from Devine going through peer review found Johnson voters would have favored Trump by a 2-to-1 margin in a two-person race.\n\nNader in 2000 is the most prominent example of third-party impact given the historically tiny margin deciding that election. Florida\u2019s outcome determined the presidency, and Bush topped Gore there by a mere 537 votes.\n\nNader received 97,488 votes in Florida. And national exit polling showed Nader voters would have chosen Gore (47%) over Bush (21%) in a two-man race. A book by Burden estimated a similar breakdown.\n\nThe highest-polling third-party candidate in recent history was Ross Perot, who ran in 1992 and 1996. He drew support from both parties, but a study by Burden found 36% of Perot voters would have backed George H.W. Bush with Perot out of the 1992 race, while 44% would have supported Bill Clinton. About 20% would not have voted.\n\nDevine noted that Libertarians, the most prominent and successful third-party in recent decades, have nominated a slate of former Republican politicians, and \"clearly it has tended to draw more from Republicans over the years.\"\n\nThe trickier question is what impact West could have on the 2020 race if he does make it on the ballot in Wisconsin or anywhere else.\n\nWest has previously supported Trump \u2014 including donning a \"Make America Great Again\" hat \u2014 but he\u2019s such an unusual candidate experts say it\u2019s too early to say much for sure.\n\nA July 2020 poll found Biden leading Trump 48% to 40% if West wasn\u2019t mentioned. But if West was included as a potential candidate in the poll question, Biden remained at 48% while Trump dropped a point to 39%.\n\n\"He has a kind of unorthodox and muddled set of things he would do in office, so it\u2019s not a clear ideological thing he has to offer,\" Burden said. \"He\u2019s more progressive in some issues, but he\u2019s also pro-life apparently and in favor of private schools to some degree, things Democrats wouldn\u2019t normally go for. I think he would appeal to a real hodgepodge of voters.\"\n\nAddressing the potential addition of West in the 2020 race, an Instagram post claimed \"Third party votes only siphon from dems for a candidate with no chance of winning.\"\n\nThere have been prominent examples of Democrats losing votes, most notably Nader in 2000. But experts are unanimous in noting this is not remotely true as a hard-and-fast-rule.\n\nThe 2016 election even disproves this claim, with far more third-party voters favoring Trump over Clinton.", "lang": "en"}
