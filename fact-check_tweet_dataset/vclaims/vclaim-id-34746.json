The image is being shared after India defeated Pakistan in a recent match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 with a false claim that Pakistani fan want Indian cricket team captain Kohli instead of Kashmir.\n\nBOOM found that the original image is from 2016 and shows protestors in Kashmir displaying Pakistan flag and banners demanding 'freedom'.\n\nWriter and academic Madhu Kishwar, who has in the past shared fake news tweeted the same photo with the caption, \"At one time Pakistanis used to chant, \"Madhuri de do, POK bhi le lo\". New ambitions, new frustrations.\" BOOM has previously debunked Kishwar's post here.\n\nBOOM found that the banner shown in the viral image is photoshopped and the people holding it are protestors from Kashmir, not Pakistani Cricket fans.\n\nA reverse image search using the Russian search engine Yandex led us to an August 2016 article published in India Today about a demonstration in Kashmir.\n\nThe story titled, \"Kashmir unrest: Youths raise pro-Pakistan slogans in the Valley\" published a photo showing the protestors holding Pakistani flags and Pro-Pakistan banners in their hands.\n\nThe banner in the original picture reads, \"We Want Azadi\" and not \n\n\"We don't want Kashmir, give us Virat Kohli\" which has been photoshopped on it.\n\nThe viral photoshop image has been circulating on social media before also as evident by this 2018 tweet with the same photoshopped image.", "lang": "en"}
