Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, \"I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun.\"\n\nThe fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail.\n\nTo be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan \u2014 he called the president a \"clown\" in a Billboard interview \u2014 and the video for \"Lavender\" does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive. But Snoop did not say he hoped someone shot Trump.\n\nAs is the case with several other claims we\u2019ve checked before, this post originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org. They posted the story on March 14.\n\nThe site doesn\u2019t identify the Obama story as fake, but its About Us page notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nNone of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either. But the post has been shared tens of thousands of times via various websites.\n\nTrump, who boasted as a presidential candidate, \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,\" tweeted to decry the content of the video:\n\nLike all presidents, Obama did face death threats, although it\u2019s tough to say just how many.\n\nAt least one other official also decried the imagery of the president with a gun to his head. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told TMZ.com on March 13 that \"Snoop shouldn\u2019t have done that.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about,\" Rubio said, adding that if the \"wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem.\"\n\nThe Secret Service did tell TheWrap.com on March 14 that they were \"aware\" of Snoop\u2019s video. But it doesn\u2019t appear they\u2019re hauling him off to prison over his comments. It is a federal crime to threaten the president, but such actions have to be substantial and credible enough to meet the level of a \"true threat.\"\n\nThe First Amendment allows a lot of leeway for criticism, and Snoop Dogg is hardly the only recording artist to signal his distaste for Trump. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, for example, released a video teaser in November 2016 for his new album Say10, in which he beheads a man dressed suspiciously similar to Trump.\n\nSnoop Dogg\u2019s reaction since has been limited to a March 15 Instagram video in which he said he\u2019s \"got nothing to say, mate.\"\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been arrested for his video or for talking about it, despite what the fake reports say.\n\nWe rate this one Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
