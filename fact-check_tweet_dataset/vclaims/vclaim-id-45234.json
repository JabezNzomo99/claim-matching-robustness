A spokesperson for the National Mall and Memorial Parks confirmed that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington has not been vandalized.\n\nThe image, purportedly taken after recent protests in Washington, shows what appears to be the Vietnam Veterans Memorial marred by graffiti, with the caption claiming, \u201cRioters deface Vietnam War Memorial.\u201d Facebook users shared the photo amid protests and riots occurring in major U.S. cities following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident.\n\nThe caption\u2019s claim is inaccurate, however.

The graffiti resembles that in similar photos from media reports about a painted replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Los Angeles being vandalized that year. The man who vandalized the replica was sentenced to four years in state prison, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cThere has been no graffiti or vandalism of any kind to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or its grounds,\u201d Mike Litterst, chief of communications for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, said in an email to the Caller.\n\nOther monuments, including the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial, sustained some damage during D.C. protests following Floyd\u2019s death, CNN reported. The graffiti on those monuments has since been removed, according to Litterst.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared photos that they claim show damage from protesters. The Caller previously debunked a fake photo of the Lincoln Memorial covered in graffiti and missing a chunk from the statue\u2019s head.", "lang": "en"}
