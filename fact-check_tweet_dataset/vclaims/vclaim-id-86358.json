It never really says that McConnell became \u201cone of the richest guys\u201d in the Senate because of backroom deals he did as a lawmaker. But it certainly implies that. We view these kind of attack ads through the lens of an ordinary viewer. What would they think if they heard:\n\nIt is correct that McConnell is now the seventh-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics \u2014 an image that flashes on the screen. But how did he get that wealth?\n\nWe explained this the last time McConnell sought reelection, in 2014, when this attack playbook was used by his challenger at the time, Alison Lundergan Grimes. She charged that McConnell \u201cquadrupled his net worth on the backs of hard-working Kentuckians that can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are required to file personal financial disclosure forms listing their assets within broad ranges (such as $5 million to $25 million), making it difficult to get a precise sense of a lawmaker\u2019s wealth. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that McConnell has a net worth of $34,137,534, much of it invested in index stock funds or municipal bond funds.\n\nA McConnell spokesman in 2014 told The Fact Checker that this was an inheritance for McConnell\u2019s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, after her mother died in 2007. Forbes magazine obtained the will of Ruth Chao in 2019 and reported that \u201cshe personally had nearly $59 million of assets to her name, according to an inventory filed with her will.\u201d Forbes estimated that about $9 million was passed to Elaine Chao, \u201crather than the $25 million maximum that was reported on McConnell\u2019s disclosure.\u201d Her father, James S.C. Chao, founded what is today a major shipping company, the Foremost Group, but the Transportation Department has said she has no affiliation with the shipping business.\n\nIndeed, Chao\u2019s filing has a section labeled \u201cSpouse\u2019s Employment Assets & Income and Retirement Accounts,\u201d intended to show assets related to the filer\u2019s spouse\u2019s employment, business activities or other income-generating activities. Chao reported that McConnell has assets of between $110,000 and $300,000 in these accounts. He also earned $145,000 for a book advance on his 2016 memoir.\n\nThe ad also lists various ways in which Kentucky, one of the nation\u2019s poorest states, ranks low among other states in terms of job opportunities. The implication is that McConnell did well as his state was left behind, but McConnell has long directed federal money toward his home state, including nearly $1 billion at the end of 2019. The Transportation Department Inspector General has been investigating whether Chao\u2019s office was giving preferential treatment to Kentucky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that Rich Mitch, a fan of soft-money deals, has seen his wealth increase in ways few Kentuckians will ever experience, while his state remains in decline,\u201d said Keith Edwards, spokesman for the Lincoln Project. \u201cRich Mitch has spent his career cutting deals to consolidate his power while gutting the rules of the Senate, demolishing our democracy in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell has steered billions of dollars to Kentucky during his time in the Senate,\u201d said Kate Cooksey, press secretary for his reelection campaign. \u201cAs the only congressional leader not from New York or California, Leader McConnell is consistently instrumental in making sure Kentucky receives needed resources.\u201d She added: \u201cSenator McConnell\u2019s decades of leadership on behalf of all Kentuckians will long outlast three days of dishonest ads from this group of D.C. consultants.\u201d\n\nThe Lincoln Project\u2019s statement gets at what might be an effective attack on McConnell \u2014 his role in weakening rules on campaign fundraising and his use of Senate rules to thwart opposition. But that may be too in-the-weeds or difficult to frame, so instead the Lincoln Project decided to aim for an easy cheap shot. McConnell is far richer than most Kentuckians \u2014 the state ranks 48th in percentage of millionaires \u2014 but he didn\u2019t earn that because of his government service.", "lang": "en"}
