The viral post takes a subtle dig at Tiwari and the Bharatiya Janata Party for indulging in \u2018identity politics\u2019. Tiwari\u2019s name has been in the spotlight as the likely Delhi chief ministerial candidate for the BJP in the upcoming Delhi elections. The party, however, is yet to finalise a name.\n\nCongress\u2019s Salman Nizami shared the photograph on January 17 and wrote, \u201cBukhari Rs 500 mei \u092c\u093f\u0915 \u0917\u092f\u093e . (Bukhari sold at Rs 500.)\u201d\n\nFacebook-user Qader Unisa posted the viral image and wrote, \u201cShahi Imam of Delhi Jama Masjid with Manoj Tiwari BJP Delhi CM Candidate/Bhojpuri Film Actor.\u201d Another Facebook user Aman Pathan shared the viral image and wrote, \u201d \u2018One thief is another thief\u2019s cousin.\u2019 Those who curse the Muslim all day are asking for the support. Anyway\u2026 out of all people, they are asking for support from a person who has no respect among the Muslim community. Who is going to vote for you? #GotHim.\n\nAlt News found that the claim is also circulating on Twitter.\n\nOn January 17, Delhi-based journalist Prashant Kanojia posted a sarcastic tweet along with the viral image. The tweet said, \u201cBukhari\u2019s deal final on 250 grams of walnuts and 500 grams of raisins.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search on Google and found a video from May 6, 2017, by Zee Media. The video reported that Bukhari met Tiwari after an attack that took place at the latter\u2019s residence. In the video, Bukhari says, \u201cHe is my old friend and our friendship goes long back. As soon as I learnt he (Tiwari) was attacked, I decided to pay him a visit.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn May 1, 2017, Times of Indiareported that two men were arrested after they allegedly barged into Delhi BJP chief and MP Manoj Tiwari\u2019s residence and roughed up his staff.\n\nAlt News also found that the viral image was tweeted by journalist Atul Krishna on May 6, 2017.\n\nSocial media users have shared an image of BJP MP Manoj Tiwari with Imam Ahmed Bukhari and portrayed this as the BJP\u2019s attempt at vote bank politics ahead of Delhi elections in February.", "lang": "en"}
