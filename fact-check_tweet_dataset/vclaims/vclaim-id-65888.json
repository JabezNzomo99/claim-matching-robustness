His death last month has sparked widespread demonstrations in the United States. However, the photo has been shared in a misleading context. It was taken in 2015, during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches.\n\nThe claim that this photo was taken during the recent protests has spread across numerous Facebook accounts in Nigeria, including this page called \u201cGeorge Udom\u201d with nearly 200,000 followers. The image shows Barack Obama and his family holding hands while standing in the front row of a crowd.\n\n\u201cFormer President Obama Leading the protest against the killing of blacks,\u201d reads the caption on the Facebook post published on June 3, 2020.\n\nComments on the Facebook post indicate that users believe the picture was taken following Floyd's killing.\n\nWhile many users accuse Obama of failing to address racist killings during his time in office, others raise concerns about a lack of safety measures against the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAfter Obama spent 8 useless years without concrete legislation against racism and black full rights, he now ended up in cunning street protest against racism and gruesome George Floyd murder,\u201d one of the comments read.\n\nThe photo has also circulated in other parts of Africa alongside a similar claim. We have archived some of the posts here in Cameroon, here (in French) in Ivory Coast and here in Angola.\n\nThe posts emerged in the wake of reignited anti-racism protests after Floyd, 46, was filmed pleading for his life as a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nIt is the latest protest in the Black Lives Matter movement, launched in 2013 to demand an end to police brutality and racism.\n\nAlthough Obama spoke out after George Floyd\u2019s death, the former US president is yet to participate publicly in the protests, as of June 5, 2020.\n\nThe photo of him walking in front of a crowd has been circulating online since 2015, during the Obama administration.\n\nA Google reverse image search led to the website of the Obama White House, an archive of the Obama administration. The picture features in a 2015 web publication headlined: \u201cPresident Obama Marks the 50th Anniversary of the Marches from Selma to Montgomery\u201d.\n\nAccording to the report, the image was shot by official Obama White House photographer Lawrence Jackson on March 7, 2015.\n\nAn AFP photographer also photographed the scene:\n\nThe photos show Obama and his family shortly before they walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches.\n\nObama himself tweeted the picture in March 2020, five years after it was taken and 55 years after the civil rights marches.\n\nObama said last week he shared the \"anguish\" of millions of Americans and that racism cannot be \u201cnormal\u201d in the US. \"If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must do better,\" he said.\n\nThe former president also took to his official Twitter account to show support for the protests following Floyd's killing, which have now moved beyond the US to other countries around the world.\n\n\"The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence \u2013 not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support,\" he wrote.", "lang": "en"}
