A group of political pundits gathers around a table weekdays at 5 p.m. and shouts back and forth on the topics of the day.\n\nMost are professional pundits, though co-host Dana Perino did serve as press secretary for George W. Bush. And many times, the panel offers some harsh criticism for President Barack Obama.\n\nOn its Halloween episode, co-host Greg Gutfeld broadsided Obama\u2019s health care law and the administration\u2019s sales job.\n\nHolding a demon puppet he called Seth, Gutfeld said that if Democrats had \"to sell a razor blade\" they\u2019d \"put it in an apple.\"\n\n\"They got to hide the ugliness of their beliefs,\" Gutfeld said.\n\nThe comment drew a response from liberal co-host Bob Beckel, who made an effort to defend the law and countered that his conservative colleagues were schilling for the insurance industry.\n\n\"The insurance industry is actually run by mostly Democrats and gave President Obama a lot of \u2026\" Perino jumped in.\n\nBefore she could finish, Beckel groaned, \"Buuulllll \u2026.\" before trailing off himself.\n\n\"That is true, Bob, and the associations prove it,\" countered Perino.\n\nBeckel, who wears trademark suspenders, was later seen resting his arms on a pumpkin that had \"single payer\" written on it in marker.\n\nAs fact-checkers, we\u2019ll weigh in on Perino\u2019s point, that the insurance industry is \"run by mostly Democrats.\" We reached out to Perino but didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nOf course, there is no simple way to determine the political affiliation of the entire health insurance industry.\n\nWe started by checking Perino\u2019s suggestion that health insurance associations prove her claim to be right. The two largest that we could identify are and the\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tallies political contributions, has contributed about $396,000 to Democrats since 2008 compared to $436,000 to Republicans over the same period of time.\n\nThe CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, Karen Ignagni, has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years -- including Eric Cantor and Josh Mandel on the Republican side and Henry Waxman and Charles Schumer among the Democrats. Ignagni has led health industry groups since 1993 and worked for the AFL-CIO before that.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t conclude that means the industry is mostly run by Democrats. (We wouldn\u2019t conclude that the industry is run mostly by Republicans, either.)\n\nThe , meanwhile, has contributed $1.74 million to Republicans since 2008 and $494,000 to Democrats. (We found no political contributions from CEO Janet Trautwein.)\n\nOverall, the Center for Responsive Politics says that the insurance industry has contributed $94 million to Republicans since 2008 and $62 million to Democrats. (This particular comparison is only modestly helpful, however, as it includes companies that also provide property, life and car insurance.)\n\nAnother way to consider Perino\u2019s claim is to look at the men and women running the largest health insurance companies in the United States.\n\nHere is a list of some of those companies, the number of people they say they serve, and what we know about the political leanings of the chief executives:\n\nUnitedHealthcare (70 million people served): The company\u2019s PAC, United For Health, that 58 percent of its 2012 federal contributions went to Republicans, while 42 percent went to Democrats. Since 2008, the group has given slightly more to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- $721,000 to Democrats and $704,000 to Republicans. CEO Stephen Hemsley has donated almost solely to Republicans since 2010 , including $10,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $5,000 to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nAetna (50 million people served): Aetna\u2019s that it donated $285,500 to Republican candidates in 2012, compared with $170,000 to Democrats. It contributed more money to Republican candidates in 2010 and 2008 . CEO Mark T. Bertolini has donated to both Republicans and Democrats , including Republican U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte and Roy Blunt, and Democrats Ron Wyden and Max Baucus.\n\nWellPoint (36 million people served): The company\u2019s political action committee, WellPAC, contributed about $1.5 million to Republican candidates since 2008 and about half as much to Democrats. , who was named CEO in March, has only made one contribution to a federal candidate since 2010, $500 to Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\nHumana (20 million people served): Humana\u2019s political action committee has contributed more to Republicans in . Humana CEO Bruce D. Broussard mainly has contributed only to Humana\u2019s PAC.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity reported that from \"the political action committees of the 11 largest health insurance companies and their primary trade group gave $10.2 million to federal politicians with nearly two-thirds of the total going to Republicans who oppose the law or support its repeal.\"\n\nIn the case of America\u2019s largest health insurers, there is little evidence to suggest they are run mostly by Democrats based on their political giving.\n\nPerino claimed that the health insurance industry is run mostly by Democrats. We could find almost nothing to suggest that\u2019s the case.\n\nThe way most large businesses and industries show their political stripes, through campaign contributions, suggests that large health insurers and their trade associations are more likely to support Republicans. Or at the least, that they hedge their bets by supporting both sides.", "lang": "en"}
