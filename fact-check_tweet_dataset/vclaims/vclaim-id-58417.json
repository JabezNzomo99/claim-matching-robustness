The video circulated widely without any indication as to when it was filmed and with the words \u201cHeads up Oklahoma\u201d edited in, leading some to think it pertained to the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, specifically in the state of Oklahoma.\n\nThe video, which has been on YouTube since 2009, featured Greg Evensen, a blogger who described himself as a former Kansas State Trooper. In the video, Evensen discussed a government \u201cedict of mandated vaccinations.\u201d\n\nEvensen said in the video that he had been \u201ctold by state troopers across the country that there are plans ready to be implemented that include roadblocks and chokepoints,\u201d and that there was a plan to fit members of the public with microchips containing \u201call kinds of information,\u201d including whether they had been vaccinated. Anyone who refused to be vaccinated, Evensen said, would be placed in buses and shipped off to detention.\n\nEvensen\u2019s comments appear to be a variation on a cross between two long-standing conspiracy theories. One theory centers on the mass detention of Americans \u2014 in most iterations the detention is to take place in camps created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). And the other theory centers on activists who believe vaccines are harmful, and that a nefarious conspiracy exists to force them on the public. His remarks were made during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a large-scale emergency prompted a variation of the claim that FEMA would be forcing people to receive vaccines. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a false claim circulated that the agency was denying those impacted by the storm any aid unless they had been vaccinated.\n\nBecause the video was made in 2009 and has nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (for which there is no vaccine, anyway, as of this writing), and because the statements made in the video allude to unfounded conspiracies that have not come to pass, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
