Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) suggests State Department officials deliberately transferred information from classified to unclassified systems.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-11-21T08:00:14Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85160", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/21/hillary-clintons-email-controversy-was-classified-information-transferred-via-thumb-drive/", "vclaim": "Out of more than 30,000 emails Clinton returned to the State Department, the FBI found 110 messages in 52 email chains that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. \u201cEight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification,\u201d Comey said.\n\nAn additional 2,000 were \u201cupclassified\u201d to make them confidential and thus redacted from public view before release. That\u2019s because the State Department, to the consternation of other government agencies, had a culture of more freely exchanging sensitive information over an unclassified system, with the expectation that sections could be redacted from public view if the emails were released under the Freedom of Information Act. Some of the emails were deemed classified at the time they were sent, but were downgraded during the investigation.\n\nChaffetz\u2019s staff initially pointed us to an FBI summary of an interview, known as a 302, of a technology specialist working for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) that was released after the FBI declined to pursue prosecution of Clinton. (See page 96.) During an interview, the specialist said a search of the email data turned up about 50 \u201ccall sheets\u201d to lay out the talking points for Clinton\u2019s conversations with foreign officials, labeled \u201cSecret\u201d or \u201cNOFORN.\u201d He speculated that they had been moved from the classified system to the unclassified system.\n\nCall sheets generally are pretty low-level classified documents. Still, seven emails were labeled top secret/special access program (SAP), which signifies material that is considered highly classified. But there\u2019s no evidence that these were deliberately transferred from the classified system to the unclassified system via a thumb drive. According to the FBI\u2019s full report on the matter, all of these emails were drafted in the State Department\u2019s unclassified system and were sent to Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff. He then forwarded them to Clinton.\n\nThe FBI asked Sullivan to review approximately 14 emails he sent or received on unclassified systems that were later determined to contain classified information up to the top secret/SAP level. \u201cWith respect to the SAP, Sullivan stated that it was discussed on unclassified systems due to the operational tempo at that time, and State employees attempted to talk around classified information,\u201d the report said. Sullivan also noted that for some of the emails, the information may have already appeared in news reports. \u201cWhen forwarding e-mails, Sullivan relied on the judgment of the individuals who sent the e-mails to him to ensure that the e-mails did not contain classified information,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recall that these emails did not have markings indicating the presence of classified information. State Department officials thought they had drafted emails that, during an urgent situation, allowed them to discuss a secret program in a way that avoided the disclosure of classified information. When intelligence agencies reviewed the emails after the Clinton server was revealed, they determined that was not the case.", "lang": "en"}
