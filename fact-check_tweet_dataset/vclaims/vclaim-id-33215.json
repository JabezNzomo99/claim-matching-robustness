The project is composed of 189 houses, and is described as \u201c189 houses in Onagawa Town, Miyagi prefecture by proposing two-storied temporary houses by stacking containers for marine transport (20 ft) in a checkerboard pattern.\u201d (translated from Japanese)\n\nHowever, there is indeed a post-siege housing project in Marawi City. The project was inaugurated on March 1. Photos of the houses can be seen in Inquirer, Rappler, Philstar, MindaNews, and the Philippine Information Agency.\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
