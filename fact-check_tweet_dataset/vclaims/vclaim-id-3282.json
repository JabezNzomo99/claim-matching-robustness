Al Franken said Republican Roy Moore \u2014 who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls \u2014 is running for the U.S. Senate \u201cwith the full support of his party.\u201d That\u2019s not entirely accurate.\n\nMoore has the support of President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee. But he doesn\u2019t have the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and numerous Republican senators.\n\nIn a speech from the Senate floor, Franken announced that he would resign \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d after several women accused him of improper behavior, including groping and unwanted kissing. \u201cSome of the allegations against me are simply not true; others, I remember very differently,\u201d the Democratic senator said in his resignation speech.\n\nFranken, Dec. 7: Nevertheless, today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate. I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving, while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the \u2014 with the full support of his party.\n\nFranken was referring to Trump and Roy Moore, a former state judge who is running for the U.S. Senate in a special election that will be held on Dec. 12.\n\nIn a Nov. 9 report that scrambled the Alabama Senate race, Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 years old and Moore was 32. Since then, several other women have stepped forward to accuse Moore of improper behavior when they were teenagers. Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nThe allegations against Moore have split the Republican Party, contrary to Franken\u2019s claim that the GOP candidate has the \u201cfull support of his party.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee initially withdrew its support for Moore, pulling out of a joint fundraising agreement that it had with the candidate. But it reversed course and agreed to help Moore, providing at least $170,000 in funding so far. The reversal came on the same day that the president called Moore and endorsed him.\n\nStill, there are those in the party who oppose Moore\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 a party committee that supports Republican senators and candidates \u2014 announced it would not help Moore raise money, and NRSC chairman, Sen. Cory Gardner, urged Moore to withdraw from the race.\n\n\u201cIf he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,\u201d Gardner said in a Nov. 13 statement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell initially urged Moore to drop out of the race, too, saying he believed Moore\u2019s accusers. On Dec. 3, McConnell appeared to soften his opposition during an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Asked if Moore should be in the Senate, McConnell said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let the people of Alabama make the call.\u201d Two days later, the Republican leader said he had \u201cno change of heart\u201d on Moore\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAfter the RNC reversed its position on Moore, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse criticized the RNC for making a \u201cbad decision,\u201d and warned the NRSC not to follow suit. Sasse threatened to stop fundraising for and donating to the NRSC if it supported Moore. But Gardner, the NRSC chairman, reiterated on Dec. 7 that the committee \u201cwill never endorse\u201d Moore.\n\nIn addition to McConnell, Sasse and Gardner, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby disclosed on Nov. 28 that he cast an absentee ballot for a write-in candidate that he would only describe as \u201ca distinguished Republican \u2026 not Judge Moore.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Sen. Jeff Flake tweeted an image of a $100 check he wrote on Dec. 5 to Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, writing the words \u201ccountry over party\u201d in the memo field.\n\nIn all, at least 16 of the 52 Republican senators have said they do not support Moore, according to a list compiled by New York magazine.", "lang": "en"}
