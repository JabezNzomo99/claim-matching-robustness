No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on August 5, 2019 titled \"FBI Surveillance- Malia Obama Seen Leaving Antifa Meeting In Baltimore\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSince the possibility of Antifa being declared a terrorist organization has been suggested, the FBI has become proactive with their treatment of the notorious group. They've been keeping a close eye on suspected names on Antifa membership rolls, tapping phones, questioning on the street, and conducting surveillance operations at their regular weekly meetings. At one such meeting in Baltimore, last Sunday, a very familiar face to all Americans was seen leaving the premises - Malia Obama, eldest daughter of former president, Barack Hussein Obama. The FBI report states that Antifa meetings had been held in the Mason's Hall in downtown Baltimore every weekend for the past year and had increased in frequency since President Trump's disparaging remarks about the city a couple of weeks ago. The group was easily identified as an Antifa Klan by their vocal opposition to our president as well as things like their clothing - \"F**k Trump\" shirts being commonly worn by all. Who but Antifa would wear such a thing?\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under the categories \"Conservative Fan Fiction\" and \"Malia Obama's Satirical Criminal Tendencies\". And the \"surveillance footage\" from Baltimore is actually from 2017 in San Francisco:\n\nSan Francisco Police Seek Public Assistance in Solving June 2017 SOMA Homicide from San Francisco Police on Vimeo.\n\nThe site that posted the satirical story is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes dailyworldupdate.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
