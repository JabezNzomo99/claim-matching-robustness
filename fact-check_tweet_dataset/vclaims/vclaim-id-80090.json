The claim is false; the images have been taken from his appearance on a television talent show in 2017.\n\nThe images were shared in a Facebook post here on April 14, 2019 and show Jim Paredes, a Filipino musician. This is his official Twitter account.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Tagalog language post translates to English as: \u201cHahahaha! Jim Vidmasturbate Paredes, you really are shameless you even have the gall to guest in \"I CAN SEE YOUR VOICE\" in ABS-CBN just earlier, it's obvious that the audience is trying to control their laughter! Nyahahaha! You really are SHAMELESS it's because it's the mark of the Yellows!\u201d\n\nThe caption is referring to a video of Paredes engaging in a sex act, which emerged online on March 31, 2019. Here is a Manila Times article about the video.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Paredes admitted in a blog post that he was the man in the video. Below is a screenshot of the statement, which he posted on April 2, 2019 on his official Facebook account, which has since been made private:\n\nThis report published by ABS-CBN on April 2, 2019, also states that Paredes publicly apologised after the incident.\n\nThe misleading post refers to \u201cYellows\u201d, a derogatory term used for supporters of the Liberal Party, the main opposition group in the Philippines. The term is used in this report about the Liberal Party published by Philippine news site Rappler on January 12, 2019.\n\nThe misleading post also refers to \u201cI Can See Your Voice\u201d, a television talent show filmed in the Philippines. This is its official Facebook page.\n\nThe same photos were shared on Facebook with an identical caption here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; Paredes did not appear on \u201cI Can See Your Voice\u201d after videos of him appearing to masturbate appeared online in 2019. He appeared on the television show in 2017.\n\nA search on the \u201cI Can See Your Voice\u201d official YouTube account found that the images in the misleading Facebook posts had been captured from footage of Paredes\u2019 appearance on the show in November 2017.\n\nThis is the footage of Paredes' appearance, which was posted on YouTube on November 15, 2017.\n\nA screenshot comparison of the images from the misleading Facebook posts shows a direct match with the YouTube video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the first image:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the second image in the misleading posts:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the third image in the misleading posts:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the fourth image in the misleading posts:", "lang": "en"}
