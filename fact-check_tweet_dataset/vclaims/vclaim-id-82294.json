But many readers vehemently disagreed with our award of Three Pinocchios\u2014so much so that we published a response. That still didn\u2019t end the complaints.\n\n2: Ben Carson\u2019s claim that \u2018we have 10 times more people on welfare\u2019 since the 1960s\n\nGOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson made a series of claims about the ineffectiveness of anti-poverty programs. But his claim that the number of people on \u201cwelfare\u201d has grown tenfold is not supported by the numbers. There has been an increase, at a rate that exceeds population growth, but not to the extent claimed by Carson. So he earned Two Pinocchios.\n\n3: Ben Carson\u2019s claim that \u2018taqiyya\u2019 encourages Muslims \u2018to lie to achieve your goals\u2019\n\nWe interviewed experts on Islamic law to see if Carson\u2019s claim had much basis in fact, and concluded he was mouthing a discredited and inaccurate interpretation of a relatively minor section of the Koran. But some readers objected to our sources.\n\n4: For Planned Parenthood abortion stats, \u20183 percent\u2019 and \u201994 percent\u2019 are both misleading\n\nThis is a rare instance when a fact check in one month continues to be so popular that it also appears on the top-five list the following month. This fact check of two misleading claims about Planned Parenthood was in fourth place in August\u2014and remained in fourth place in September.", "lang": "en"}
