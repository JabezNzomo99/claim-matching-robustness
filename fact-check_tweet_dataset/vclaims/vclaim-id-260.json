As explained by David J. Barron, U.S. Circuit Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, \u201cThe Tenth Amendment endows the people with the right to choose and define their local government\u201d (here).\n\nAnnenberg classroom, a foundation that provides a multimedia curriculum on the Constitution (here), says the Tenth Amendment is designed \u201cto further define the balance of power between the federal government and the states\u201d ( here ). Any power not explicitly granted to the federal government by the Constitution \u201cis left to the states or the people.\u201d Management of disasters or emergencies are one such power given to state governments, led by elected governors.\n\nThe National Governors Association, a bipartisan organization that defines itself (www.nga.org/about/) as \u201cthe voice of the nation\u2019s governors,\u201d says, \u201cgovernors are responsible for ensuring their state is adequately prepared for emergencies and disasters of all types and sizes. Most emergencies and disasters are handled at the local level, and few require a presidential disaster declaration or attract worldwide media attention\u201d (here).\n\nAs reported by Business Insider ( here ), 32 state governors had issued a state of emergency in response to the new coronavirus before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020 ( here ). Governor Jay Inslee of Washington was the first to do so, issuing a COVID-19 emergency proclamation on February 29 ( here ).\n\nShould President Trump decide to lift his national emergency declaration, he would not have the authority to decide when states reopen. According to the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization, \u201cNo federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions\u2026 If governors choose to disregard his call to reopen their states, their decisions will be final\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe National Governors Association explains: \u201cState emergency management laws usually define how a governor may declare and end a state of emergency\u201d ( here ). In other words, state statutes have already granted the governor the authority to declare and manage a state of emergency.\n\nJessica Bulman-Pozen, a professor at Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Constitutional Governance (here), told Reuters: \u201cIn these states where we\u2019re seeing concerns about the executive branch, either the governor or the department of health\u2019s orders, the legislature has previously authorized the executive branch to issue such orders.\u201d Governors have already received \u201cbroad grants of authority from the state legislature to respond to emergencies,\u201d she added, which are typically based on existing state statutes previously passed by the legislature.\n\nSuch statutes vary by state. Lawfare, a blog dedicated to national security issues, published by the Lawfare Institute along with the Brookings Institution, has published a review of U.S. state and territory laws giving state executives the authority to impose a statewide quarantine here. Lawfare\u2019s review of state laws granting state executives the authority to enforce stay-at-home orders and restrict non-essential business can be found here .\n\nFalse. U.S. governors have the authority to manage emergencies within their state, as granted by the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as well as existing statutes passed by respective state legislatures.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
