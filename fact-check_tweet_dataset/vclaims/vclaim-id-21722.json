In January 2017, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko announced that Voronenkov had given testimony about two letters written by Yanukovych in February 2014, one of which was registered with the UN Security Council by Russia on behalf of Yanukovych by the late Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, in which Yanukovych requested Russian troops to put down the Maidan demonstrations []\n\nBoth Yanukovych and the Kremlin denied that any formal letter had been submitted despite the official record at the UN showing otherwise.\n\nThe independent Russian news site Novaya Gazeta has also written about Voronenkov\u2019s business dealings which involve an offshore account that came to light in the Panama Papers. It has also covered Voronenkov\u2019s claims that agents of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which he allegedly exposed as involved in contraband, had a vendetta against him. These circumstances could also give grounds for suspecting a murderer from Russia.\n\nAs for the explosion of the ammunition depot in the eastern Ukrainian town of Balakliya in which one person was killed and a half dozen injured, the Ukrainian military called it an \u201cact of sabotage.\" Some Ukrainian military experts have expressed skepticism about the hand of Moscow, as negligence could also be a factor.\n\nBut the week following Voronenkov\u2019s murder, there was also a grenade attack on the Polish Consulate in the western Ukrainian city of Lutsk. President Petro Poroshenko and other officials believed this, too, to be the work of Russian or Russian-backed saboteurs because Moscow would have the means and the motive.\n\nThroughout the war in Ukraine, there have been dozens of cases of bombings in Ukraine, such as the February 2015 explosion in Kharkiv that killed 2 and injured 10. Police said the suspect's weapons were provided by Russia.\n\nStephen Blank, an expert on Russia and currently a Senior Fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council, has outlined Russian measures in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as Ukraine and the UK (the Litvinenko murder) and describes these as the \u201cactions of a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nUltimately, it does not diminish Ukraine\u2019s status as a democracy with a relatively free media if the president and other officials freely voice suspicions that have some validity given the Kremlin\u2019s track record of aggression. Furthermore, even when the Ukrainian prosecutor general has established facts, with credible testimony from Voronenkov, the Russian government scoffed at them.\n\nThroughout the wars in Ukraine and Syria, there have been numerous occasions when overwhelming numbers of facts of atrocities have been established, such as with the shooting down of MH17 or the latest chemical weapons attack and the Kremlin\u2019s strategy has been to float one dubious counter-narrative after another, and distract with attacks on the credibility of accusers.", "lang": "en"}
