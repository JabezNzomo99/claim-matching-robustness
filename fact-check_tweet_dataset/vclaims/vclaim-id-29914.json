Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of police evicting people out of their homes in Assam after the NRC. Fact: The video is from Telangana and it shows Hyderabad Police arresting the demonstrators who were protesting against CAA and NRC at Nampally (Hyderabad). Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the \u2018DD News\u2019 article, it can be found that the names of over 19 lakh people were excluded from the final NRC list of Assam.\n\n\n\nA simple reverse image search of screenshots of the video leads to an article of \u2018Siasat\u2019. The article had a collage of photos pertaining to an anti-CAA & anti-NRC protest at Nampally, Hyderabad. In the article, a similar image as shown in the video can be seen sliding along with other photographs of that event. The image had the following description- \u2018More than 300 activists and leaders of the left parties were arrested by City Police during protest against CAA and possible NRC\u2019. So, the video is from Telangana and has nothing to do with NRC in Assam.\n\nTo conclude, a video of Hyderabad Police arresting the demonstrators protesting against CAA and NRC is being falsely shared as \u2018NRC eviction started in Assam\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
