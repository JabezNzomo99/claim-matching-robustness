But the video actually shows the country\u2019s roads minister ordering the arrest of foreign developers over construction work done near state roads.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on December 19, 2019. It has been viewed more than a million times, according to data provided by the social network.\n\nThe four-and-a-half-minute footage shows a man surrounded by uniformed men, pointing and yelling at a foreigner holding a hard hat for extending the perimeter of a construction site to the state road.\n\n\u201cThe owner of this property must be arrested immediately. The contractor, all those working here, must be arrested immediately. You have destroyed the public road. In which country can this be allowed? In your own country, can anybody do this? It is madness!\u201d, the man shouts.\n\nHe then tells the uniformed men to arrest the foreigner, who is handcuffed, and orders all remaining builders to halt their work.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cWe need this man in naija, Ghana President got mad wt the contractor.!!! (sic).\u201d\n\nThe video clip has also been shared here and here on Facebook, as well as here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nBut while the clip was indeed shot in Ghana, it doesn\u2019t show President Nana Akudo-Addo but the country\u2019s roads and highways minister Kwesi Amoako Atta.\n\nHis outburst came months after about 1.56 billion Ghanaian Cedi ($290 million) worth of funding was approved for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of 14 road networks across different regions in Ghana.\n\nMultiple Google searches for keywords in the Facebook post led us to this version of the footage with higher quality.\n\nReports published on December 18, 2019 on leading Ghanaian news websites, including JoyOnline and TheGhanaReport, say Atta ordered the arrest of some contractors over their failure to secure a building permit and extending the construction of the barricade of a 22-storey building which led to the destruction of a public road in Accra.\n\nThe reports, along with building structures and paintings seen in the footage, provide clues to the location of the construction site.\n\nUsing Google Street View, AFP confirmed that the video was shot at Senchi Street, Accra.\n\nBackground buildings, natural features and other visual clues are seen in both the video and on Google Street View, including wooden electric poles, balcony railing, and palm trees.\n\nIn addition, comparing images of the president and roads minister, the man in the video is identifiable as the latter.\n\nAFP has contacted Atta as well as the Ghana Highway Authority for comment but has not yet heard back.", "lang": "en"}
