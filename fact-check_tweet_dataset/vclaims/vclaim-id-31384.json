Know your enemy!\u201d\n\nThe women did not wear t-shirts bearing this statement. The words were superimposed onto shirts that actually say \u201cI\u2019m A Trump Girl.\u201d\n\nThe image, which has been shared on Facebook more than 800 times, depicts six women, presumably supportive of President Donald Trump, wearing shirts adorned with the words \u201cI\u2019m A Racist Bitch\u201d and a stiletto heel.

A reverse image search revealed that the photograph has been digitally manipulated.\n\nGerri McDaniels, who, according to her Twitter biography, serves as the director of Trump\u2019s campaign efforts in South Carolina, tweeted the original picture on July 18.\n\n\u201cWomen for Trump were on the move in Greenville, NC at the Trump Rally,\u201d reads her tweet. \u201cSo much support it was hard to not be excited.\u201d\n\nIn the original image, McDaniels, who is pictured, and five other women pose for a picture while wearing t-shirts that say \u201cI\u2019m A Trump Girl 2020.\u201d The photograph was taken on July 17 before the group attended the Trump rally in Greenville, North Carolina, reports The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe would never wear a shirt that said anything like that,\u201d McDaniels told The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
