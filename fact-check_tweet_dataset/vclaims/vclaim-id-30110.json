A representative for Chick-fil-A told Snopes that each Chick-fil-A location is a locally owned and operated franchise and could hold special promotions limited to each location. So the promotions seen in the above posts applied only at those specific restaurants.\n\nBoth Chick-fil-A restaurants pictured above \u2014 in McCalla, Alabama, and Dalton, Georgia \u2014 invited customers to enter a drawing for a chance to win free Chick-fil-A meals for the year of 2020.\n\nBut deadlines to enter both promotions passed in December 2019. Therefore we rate the claim about the promotions as \u201cOutdated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
