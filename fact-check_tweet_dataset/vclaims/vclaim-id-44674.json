His nephew is married to Chelsea Clinton! His son wed the sister of U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff! But in this dimension, those are just false, unfounded claims that we\u2019ve fact-checked. These couples don\u2019t exist. And a recent Facebook post alleging a new political connection by marriage is also wrong.\n\n\"How many of you are aware that the female governor of Michigan is the niece of George Soros?\" the June 1 post says.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s office and a spokesperson told us Whitmer isn\u2019t related to Soros.\n\n\"This is completely false,\" said Chelsea Lewis, the governor\u2019s deputy press secretary.\n\nSoros\u2019 brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013. According to his obituary in the New York Times, he was survived by two sons: Peter and Jeffrey. He had two other children but they both died at 18 months old. A third son, Steven, was in a playground accident and a daughter, Linda, was hit by a vehicle backing out of the family\u2019s garage.\n\nSo George Soros has no surviving nieces. And his nephews didn\u2019t marry Whitmer (whose husband is Marc Mallory, a dentist in Lansing, Mich.).\n\nPeter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997. Jeffrey Soros was married to Catharine Cosover in 1995.\n\nIf this disinformation connecting Whitmer to Soros seems arbitrary, keep in mind two things: A lot of anger was directed at Whitmer as she locked down Michigan to curb COVID-19, and baseless claims tying George Soros to the coronavirus have proliferated online. Combined, we have this Facebook post. And we\u2019re rating it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
