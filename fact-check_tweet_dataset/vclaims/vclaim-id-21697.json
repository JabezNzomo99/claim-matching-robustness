That paper found the 3rd Circuit (2.33 percent) and the 5th Circuit (1.14 percent) had lower dissent rates than the 10th Circuit.\n\nAs for Gorsuch, the CRS calculated the percentage of written dissents among seven judges on the 10th Circuit, and found that Gorsuch \u201cdisplayed relatively more willingness to dissent from others\u2019 majority opinions than some colleagues.\u201d Gorsuch\u2019s rate of dissent of 1.6 percent \u201cplaces him in the middle\u201d among his colleagues.\n\nChristopher A. Cotropia, who authored the 2010 paper cited by the CRS, told us that the dissent rates for Gorsuch and his court say more about how federal appeals courts work than how Gorsuch may rule on the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing what most appellate court judges do,\u201d Cotropia, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not instructive as to what he will do when he is one of nine [on the Supreme Court].\u201d\n\nCotropia illustrated his point by determining the dissent rates for two associate justices, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor, who previously had served on circuit courts. Alito had a 1.6 percent dissent rate on the 3rd Circuit Court and Sotomayor had a 0.69 percent dissent rate on the 2nd Circuit. Nevertheless, the judges are on opposite extremes of the court. By one measure, Sotomayor is the most liberal of the Supreme Court justices and Alito is the second most conservative.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Gorsuch in late January to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia has set off a historic partisan battle in the Senate. That battle came to a head on April 6, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to advance Gorsuch\u2019s nomination.\n\nUnable to muster the 60 votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster, McConnell changed the Senate rules to allow a simple majority of 51 votes to end the filibuster. The Senate is now expected to confirm Gorsuch\u2019s nomination April 7 by a simple majority. The Republicans control 52 Senate seats.\n\nThroughout the contentious confirmation process, the White House and Republicans described Gorsuch as \u201cmainstream,\u201d while Democrats have criticized him as \u201cextreme.\u201d Those are subjective terms, and each side is entitled to its opinion.\n\nWhat caught our attention is Republicans\u2019 repeated use of the same statistics as evidence of Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d judicial record.\n\nWhen the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Gorsuch\u2019s nomination on April 3 along party lines, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said that Gorsuch\u2019s record on the federal appeals court \u201cfalls well within the mainstream.\u201d\n\nIn a blog item posted April 4, the White House used the same statistics to describe Gorsuch as \u201cthe ultimate example of a mainstream judge.\u201d The blog item said, \u201cIn the more than 2,700 cases he has participated in on the 10th Circuit, 97 percent of them have been unanimously decided and he was in the majority 99 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nTwo days earlier on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Senate Majority Leader McConnell gave a truncated version of the GOP talking point: \u201cIn the majority, 99 percent of the time. Ninety-seven percent of his rulings were unanimous.\u201d\n\nGorsuch himself repeatedly cited the statistics during his confirmation hearings. On March 22, Gorsuch described the 10th Circuit Court\u2019s low dissent rate as \u201can amazing accomplishment.\u201d\n\nBut such high rates of unanimity are not unusual for the federal courts of appeals, as the Congressional Research Service explained in its report on Gorsuch\u2019s record.\n\nIn footnotes, the CRS cites a book by law professor Frank B. Cross of the University of Texas Law School, \u201cDecision Making in the U.S. Courts of Appeals,\u201d which notes the \u201crelative paucity of circuit court panel dissents.\u201d The CRS also cited Cotropia\u2019s paper, \u201cDetermining Uniformity Within the Federal Circuit by Measuring Dissent and En Banc Review,\u201d noting that it found \u201cfrom 1998 to 2009, 2.54% of the opinions issued by the Tenth Circuit included a dissent.\u201d As we said, two of the six courts that Cotropia reviewed had lower percentages than the 10th Circuit.\n\nCotropia said the nature of how federal appeals courts work explains the lack of dissents. Unlike the Supreme Court, which can pick and choose its cases, the appeals court must take all appeals and \u201ca lot of cases are just slam dunks,\u201d he said. Because it must take all cases, the appeals court also has a heavy workload and part of the job is \u201cjust keeping the trains running.\u201d Also, he said, appeals court dissents are not cited often, but \u201ca Supreme Court dissent carries a lot more weight.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Gorsuch himself in delivering the Thirteenth Annual Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lecture at the Federalist Society said the 10th Circuit\u2019s high percentage of unanimous rulings is \u201cpretty typical.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver 90 percent of the decisions issued by my court are unanimous; that\u2019s pretty typical of the federal appellate courts,\u201d Gorsuch said in his speech, which was reprinted in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.\n\nAs for Gorsuch, this is what the CRS reported:\n\u2022 Gorsuch authored 778 majority opinions and 12 of them, or 1.5 percent, were accompanied by written dissents.\n\u2022 Gorsuch authored 33 dissenting opinions to accompany 2,060 decisions in which a dissent or concurrence could occur. That\u2019s a 1.6 percent dissent rate, which \u201cplaces him in the middle of his colleagues\u201d \u2014 fourth among seven judges included in the CRS study. Judge Jerome A. Holmes had the lowest dissent rate at 0.6 percent.\n\n\u201cJudge Gorsuch\u2019s rate of dissent is pretty much on the mean with other circuits and judges I have looked at,\u201d Cotropia told us. \u201cHe is certainly not the lowest, but he does not reach the higher end as well. I don\u2019t know that it tells us much at all.\u201d\n\nCRS also provides this word of caution about appeals court judges who join in majority opinions.\n\nDespite these caveats about the relative meaning of dissent rates, we have found that senators on both sides of the aisle have cited such statistics over the years when supporting their party\u2019s Supreme Court nominees.\n\nDuring the 2006 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr., Grassley and Sen. Orrin Hatch told Alito that he had a dissent rate of 1.6 percent of cases that he decided on the 3rd Circuit.\n\nGrassley, Jan. 11, 2006: I recall from reading a synopsis of your opinions, and the reality is, as I see it, you don\u2019t disagree with majority opinions more frequently than most Federal appeals judges do in similar cases. And of more than 4,800 cases\u2014and that we got from the Washington Post. But of more than 4,800 cases that you decided during your tenure on the Third Circuit, you dissented only in 79 cases, which would be only 1.6 percent of all those cases. Hatch, Jan. 11, 2006: Well, would it surprise you to know that you have dissented only 79 times in nearly 5,000 cases in which you have participated? That comes to about 1.6 percent, which is considerably lower than most others who have been on the appellate courts.\n\nCotropia, the University of Richmond law professor, confirmed Alito\u2019s 1.6 percent dissent rate for us using the same method that the CRS used to calculate the rate for Gorsuch. Cotropia found that Alito had authored 82 dissents on 5,192 majority opinions.\n\nDuring the confirmation hearings for Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer also touted Sotomayor\u2019s low dissent rate, except he focused on the few times that Sotomayor disagreed with Republican-appointed judges.\n\nSchumer said Sotomayor\u2019s \u201crecord shows that she is in the mainstream\u201d because she \u201chas agreed with Republican colleagues 95 percent of the time\u201d on the 2nd Circuit.\n\nRepublican Sen. Hatch acknowledged the Democratic talking point on her agreement with Republican-appointed judges \u2014 \u201cfor which I congratulate her,\u201d he said. But Hatch added that many of the Democrats who cited that statistic in praise of Sotomayor\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d record also opposed Alito \u201ceven though he had voted with his Democrat-appointed Third Circuit colleagues 99 percent of the time during a more longer appeals court career.\u201d\n\nCotropia told us that actually Sotomayor had a lower overall dissent rate than either Alito or Gorsuch. He found she issued 25 written dissents out of 3,641 opinions for a rate of just 0.69 percent.\n\nSotomayor and Alito are good examples of how federal appeals judges \u201cdissent more as justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing the Supreme Court database maintained by the Washington University School of Law, Cotropia found that Alito has a Supreme Court dissent rate of 17.25 percent (124 dissents in 719 rulings) and Sotomayor has a 17.95 percent rate (84 dissents out of 468 rulings).\n\nWe also note that, as of the 2015 term, Sotomayor is the most liberal of the Supreme Court justices and Alito is the second most conservative, according to a 2016 study co-authored by Lee Epstein, the co-director of the Center for Empirical Research in the Law at the Washington University School of Law. Her study, \u201cPresident-Elect Trump and his Possible Justices,\u201d compared the judges on Trump\u2019s list of Supreme Court candidates to sitting justices. For current justices, Epstein\u2019s study used Martin-Quinn scores, which measure the relative location of current U.S. Supreme Court justices on an ideological scale based on their voting patterns.\n\n\u201cThese judges, even with low dissent when judging on the appeals court, show their ideology when they go to the Supreme Court,\u201d Cotropia said.\n\nThat same study projects Gorsuch \u2014 once confirmed to the Supreme Court, as expected \u2014 would fall \u201cwithin the Alito-Scalia ideological range\u201d and to the right of Alito.\n\nWe take no position on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination or whether he is \u201cmainstream\u201d or not. What we have found, though, is that a circuit court judge\u2019s overall dissent rate isn\u2019t useful in determining a nominee\u2019s ideology.\n\nUpdated, April 7: The Senate confirmed Gorsuch, 54 to 45, on April 7. Three Democratic senators \u2014 Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly \u2014 joined the GOP majority to approve the nomination.", "lang": "en"}
