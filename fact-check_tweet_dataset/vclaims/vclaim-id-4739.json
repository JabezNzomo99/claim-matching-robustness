This theme is nothing new. The president has claimed without evidence that undocumented immigrants bring \u201ctremendous crime\u201d since he announced he was running for office.\n\nTrump gets into trouble right off the bat. The report he\u2019s referencing defines \u201ccriminal alien\u201d as any \u201cnoncitizen residing in the United States legally or illegally and convicted of a crime.\u201d In other words, it combines arrest statistics for both legal and undocumented immigrants, but the president points to it as evidence of the \u201chuman toll of illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe crime tally Trump uses spans a 55-year period \u2014 from August 1955 to April 2010. Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the pro-immigration Cato Institute, found that there were about 934,000 homicides total during that period. Let\u2019s generously assume that (a) each arrest led to a conviction and (b) no person was arrested twice. That means approximately 2.7 percent of all homicides during the 55-year period were committed by noncitizens, whether they were legal or undocumented immigrants. Considering they made up 4.6 percent of the U.S. population during that time, according to Nowrasteh, \u201cthey were underrepresented among murderers.\u201d\n\nNowrasteh points out these statistics aren\u2019t as clear as they might seem. \u201cIt is important to note that the Texas DPS data report the number of convictions and arrests, not the number of people actually convicted or arrested.\u201d That means one person is convicted of say five crimes, the data will show five convictions, not one person. In other words, there is not a perfect head count.\n\nSome sleuthing led us to a TDPS chart that is no longer available online. (We found a copy in this PolitiFact article, but the TDPS link is now dead.) It shows \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d arrested between June 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2017, were charged with 638,411 criminal offenses over the course of their criminal careers. Key words there: criminal careers. Assuming that \u201ccriminal career\u201d means every crime an individual has been arrested for in their life, it\u2019s safe to assume many of these individuals committed crimes outside of Trump\u2019s seven-year time frame.\n\nOur colleague Philip Bump did the forensics on this statistic. He found it was the product of tortured math that originated in a 2006 blog post from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). \u201cThe lives of 12 U.S. citizens would be saved who otherwise die a violent death at the hands of murderous illegal aliens each day,\u201d King claimed. \u201cAnother 13 Americans would survive who are otherwise killed each day by uninsured drunk driving illegals.\u201d\n\nKing explained his math in a speech on the House floor: \u201cThat means then that criminal aliens are committing 28 percent of the crimes in the United States. And so that means 28 percent of the murders, 28 percent of the rapes, 28 percent of the violence and the assaults and battery, first- and second-degree murder and also manslaughter attacks are committed by criminal aliens.\u201d\n\nKing is referencing a 2005 government report that looks at \u201ccriminal aliens incarcerated in federal prisons, state prisons and local jails.\u201d But as we\u2019ve pointed out, most crimes are prosecuted at the state level and there are no nationwide data tracking offenders by immigration status. So, King\u2019s 28 percent (which is really 27 percent) is the number of legal and undocumented immigrants in federal prison. The Justice Department says only 10 percent of U.S. prisoners are housed in the federal system (the rest being in the state or local systems).\n\nSetting that large caveat aside, there are several things wrong with the Trump-King claim. First, the 2005 report on which it\u2019s based does not distinguish between legal and undocumented immigrants. It does not in any way assume that, because immigrants made up 27 percent of the federal prison population, that means they committed 27 percent of all crimes. That\u2019s like saying because 15 percent of people in prison are blond, blonds committed 15 percent of all crimes. It just makes no sense.\n\nTrump started this statistical dive saying, \u201cHere are just a few statistics on the human toll of illegal immigration.\u201d He then used data for all immigrants \u2014 not just those here illegally \u2014 to make his points. He used numbers for arrests, not convictions, which are more authoritative when discussing crime rates. And even with all those misleading errors, his numbers still showed immigrants were underrepresented among homicide offenders relative to their share of the population, according to Cato.", "lang": "en"}
