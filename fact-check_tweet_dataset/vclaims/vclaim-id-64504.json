He made headlines again after he was killed in an encounter on July 10 - a day after he was apprehended by police in Madya Pradesh's Ujjain.\n\n\n\nAlso read Vikas Dubey: A Timeline Of Events From Ambush To Gangster's Encounter\n\nBOOM found the doctored image circulating on the internet for the past few days, initially posted with satirical captions. However, the posts turned from satire to misinformation, when the captions started insinuating that Patra was indeed found dancing with Dubey in the photo.\n\nOne of the viral captions read: \"Vikas Dubey dancing with Sambit Patra. Got this photo with a lot of difficulties (Original Hindi caption: \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924 \u092a\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0921\u093e\u0902\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0938 \u0926\u0941\u092c\u0947 \u092c\u095c\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0915\u093f\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0939 \u092b\u094b\u091f\u094b)\".\n\nSearching for the caption on Twitter revealed that the image was being shared with similar captions on the micro-blogging site as well.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search of the photo, and came across the exact same photo of Dubey dancing being published by several news websites. However, Sambit Patra was nowhere to be seen in this photo.\n\nHindi news website Amar Ujala also ran the photo with the caption: \"Vikas Dubey dancing at Amar's (Vikas Dubey's close aide Amar Dubey) wedding\".\n\n\n\nAccording to news reports, Amar Dubey's wedding was held on June 29, which was attended by Vikas Dubey. Amar Dubey was eventually killed in an encounter on July 8, just a day before Vikas Dubey was arrested by the police.\n\nAs you can see from the photo above, Sambit Patra is not in it. Below, we have put both the images together for you to compare the real image to the doctored one.", "lang": "en"}
