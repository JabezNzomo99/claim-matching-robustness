In it, Leonid Maslovsky argued that the Czech people should be \u201cgrateful\u201d to the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies for militarily invading Czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d protests.\n\nMaslovsky alleged that the protests were a Western-instigated plot to overthrow the government. \u201cThe introduction of troops into Czechoslovakia in 1968 prevented the West from carrying out a coup d'etat in Czechoslovakia using the technology of \u2018velvet\u2019 revolutions and preserved peace and harmony with all the peoples of the countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization for more than twenty years,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMaslovsky also accused the Czechs of responsibility for the spilling of Soviet blood during the Second World War.\n\n\u201cBut for the sake of truth, it must be said that Russian blood was spilled during the war through the fault of Czechoslovakia no less than through the fault of Hungary and Romania, whose armies, together with Germany, attacked the USSR in 1941,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCzechoslovakia, from 1938 and throughout the war, supplied a large number of weapons to the German army, with which Soviet soldiers and civilians of our country were killed.\u201d\n\nGermany did indeed acquire a wealth of weapons, from small arms to tanks and heavy artillery, when it annexed Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1939 as a result of the Munich Agreement of 1938. However, it seems unlikely that many Czechs were willing participants in the plunder. Slovakia was broken off and a pro-Nazi puppet state was set up there under dictator Jozef Tiso.\n\nIt is worth noting that despite earlier offers to defend Czechoslovakia from German aggression prior to the Munich agreement, the Soviet Union recognized Axis Slovakia all the way up to the German invasion of the USSR on June 22, 1941. Both Czechs and Slovaks served in the war against Nazi Germany, both with the Western allies and the Red Army.\n\nMaslovsky portrays Czechoslovakia\u2019s Prague Spring as a Western plot against the Soviet Union and its allies, but in reality the Warsaw Pact was far from united on the issue. Romania refused to take part in the military invasion of Czechoslovakia, while the Soviet command refrained from calling on troops from East Germany due to fears that it would be politically dangerous to include German troops in the occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAlbania reacted by officially leaving the Warsaw Pact. Its Stalinist leader, Enver Hoxha, repeatedly criticized the Soviet Union\u2019s actions in public.\n\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018socialist family\u2019 or \u2018socialist community\u2019 resembles a concentration camp, a prison of peoples, Soviet troops are stationed everywhere and they make the law in these (Warsaw Pact) countries,\u201d Hoxha wrote in an article published in the Albanian state newspaper Zeri I Popullit in 1969. In the same article, Hoxha went as far as to label the intervention in Czechoslovakia as \u201cfascist aggression.\u201d\n\nTV Zvezda pulled Maslovsky\u2019s article the day after it was published, and posted an article in its place which called the news site a \u201cdiscussion platform on which different opinions are placed.\u201d According to the independent Russian news site Meduza, the article may have been taken down because of a negative reaction by Czech President Milos Zeman, who, according to Czech media reports, called the author a \u201ccrazy journalist without brains.\u201d\n\nThe piece, which was published the same day as a meeting between President Zeman and Russian President Vladimir Putin, also drew criticism from Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek and Defense Minister Martin Stropnicky.", "lang": "en"}
