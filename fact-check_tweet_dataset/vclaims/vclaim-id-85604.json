In that singular object, we are resolute. Foreign Minister [Mohammad Javad] Zarif emphasized that they don\u2019t intend to do this, and the supreme leader has indicated there is a fatwa, which forbids them to do this.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the Iranian government was the best source for information. But she added: \u201cMany Iranian officials have spoken of the fatwa publicly, and their comments are publicly available. There are various descriptions of it in the public domain. And importantly, the Iranians have also referenced the fatwa in our negotiations.\u201d\n\n[Update: Gareth Porter, in a rebuttal to this column, says that Iran only said that it had \u201cchemical weapons capability, while maintaining the policy not to resort to these weapons.\" He argues that the distinction between production and capability had been lost through years of inaccurate reporting. He is certainly correct we should have linked to an original document, but we could not find one, and are pleased to do so now. One of the Wikileaks cables included a statement from Iran to the United States in 2004 that chemical weapons agents were produced but not weaponized.]\n\nKhalaji, who in 2011 collaborated with Michael Eisenstadt on an in-depth look at the supposed fatwa, notes that on many occasions, Khomeini abruptly shifted course, despite a previously issued ruling. Khalaji says this is quite common among senior Shiite religious figures. So Khomeini said the modern tax system in Iran was against Islam \u2014 until he came to power and said such laws should be obeyed. He also was against women\u2019s suffrage when the shah was in power \u2014 and then after the revolution urged women to vote. He was also against the eating of sturgeon \u2014 until he was for it.\n\nThe most definitive written account of the fatwa appears in a statement that an Iranian official read at an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2005: \u201cThe Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued the fatwa that the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never acquire these weapons.\u201d\n\nJust about every Alfred Hitchcock thriller had what he called a \u201cMacGuffin\u201d \u2014 a plot device that gets the action going but is unimportant to the overall story. The Iranian fatwa thus appears to be a diplomatic MacGuffin \u2014 something that gives the Americans a reason to begin to trust the Iranians and the Iranians a reason to make a deal. No one knows how this story will end, but just as in the movies, the fatwa likely will not be critical to the outcome.\n\nEven if one believes the fatwa exists \u2014 and will not later be reversed \u2014 it clearly appears to have evolved over time. U.S. officials should be careful about saying the fatwa prohibits the development of nuclear weapons, as that is not especially clear anymore. The administration\u2019s statements at this point do not quite rise to the level of earning Pinocchios, but we will keep an eye on this issue.", "lang": "en"}
