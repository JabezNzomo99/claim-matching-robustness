The low point in jobs was reached in February 2010, and there has indeed been a gain of about 8 million jobs since then, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. (Obama, saying \u201cbusinesses,\u201d appears to be referring to private sector growth of 8.2 million; adding government jobs reduces the total to 7.6 million.) But the data also show that since the start of his presidency, about 3.2 million jobs have been created \u2014 and the number of jobs in the economy still is about 1.2 million lower than when the recession began in December 2007.\n\nThe low point for manufacturing jobs was reached in January 2010, and there has been a gain of 570,000 jobs since then. But BLS data show that the number of manufacturing jobs is still 500,000 fewer than when Obama took office in the depths of the recession \u2014 and 1.7 million fewer than when the recession began in December 2007. The gain in manufacturing actually has begun to stall a bit in the past year. The only reason Obama can tout a gain in manufacturing jobs \u201cfor the first time since the 1990s\u201d is because, before the recession, manufacturing had been on a slow decline for many years.\n\nMoreover, the deficit soared in the first place because of the recession, so as the economy has improved, the deficit naturally decreased. The United States still has a deficit higher than it was in nominal terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product than it was in 2008 and a debt much greater as a percentage of the overall economy than it was prior to the recession.\n\nClose readers of the president\u2019s speeches might have noticed an interesting shift in the president\u2019s rhetoric. Just in December the president gave a speech on economic mobility in which he three times asserted that it was \u201cdeclining\u201d in the United States. But earlier this month, renowned economists Raj Chetty, Emmanuel Saez and colleagues published a paper based on tens of millions of tax records showing that upward mobility had not changed significantly over time. The rate essentially is the same now as it was 20 years ago.\n\nStill, the same study confirmed that income inequality had increased in the same period. \u201cHence, the consequences of the \u2018birth lottery\u2019 \u2014 the parents to whom a child is born \u2014 are larger today than in the past,\u201d the paper said, offering the analogy of a ladder in which the rungs have grown farther apart but the children\u2019s chances of moving upward from one rung to another had not changed.\n\nBoth Chetty and Saez are recent winners of the biennial John Bates Clark Medal, for distinguished economist under the age of 40, and it\u2019s a mark of their esteem that their paper would lead to such a swift change in presidential rhetoric. Even so, some might argue that Obama is stretching the use of the term \u201cstalled,\u201d since the main point of the research was that the trend was constant, not that it halted.\n\nObama is using a figure (annual wages, from the Census Bureau) that makes the disparity appear the greatest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, shows that the gap is 19 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap is even smaller when you look at hourly wages \u2014 it is 14 cents \u2014 but then not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so that statistic excludes salaried workers.\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis surveyed economic literature and concluded that \u201cresearch suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers are compared with male workers who have similar characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.\u201d They cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department, which concluded that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap dwindled, to about 5 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe ACA expanded Medicaid to those who earn less than 133 percent of the poverty line \u2014 about $15,000 for an individual \u2014 to 26 states (and the District) that decided to embrace that element of the law. But no one really knows how many of the 6.3 million are in this expansion pool \u2014 or whether they are simply renewing or would have qualified for Medicaid before the new law. Indeed, the number also includes people joining Medicaid in states that chose not accept the expansion.\n\nThis has become a familiar theme by Republicans, but as we have noted before, the decline in the labor participation rate is largely due to factors beyond Obama\u2019s control \u2014 namely the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. When Obama took office in January 2009, the workforce participation rate was 65.7 percent \u2014 and now it is 62.8 percent. So there has certainly been a decline. But the rate had already been on a steady downward track since it hit a high of 67.3 percent in the last year of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in 2012 concluded that just over half of the post-1999 decline in the participation rate comes from the retirement of the baby boomers. Critically, the research showed that the problem is only going to get worse in the rest of the decade, with retirements accounting for two-thirds of the decline of participation rate by 2020. In other words, the rate will keep declining, no matter how well the economy does.", "lang": "en"}
