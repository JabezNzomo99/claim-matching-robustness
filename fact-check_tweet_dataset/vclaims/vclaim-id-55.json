Though the slogan of Daily World Update is \"satire for flat Earthers, Trumpsters and y'all Qaeda,\" many users who interacted with this post appeared to take it seriously. The link was also shared over 1,000 times from the page \"Keep America Great Again\" ( here ) and over 600 times from the page \"Send Them All to Prison\" ( here ).\n\nThe article includes a photoshopped mugshot of Malia Obama, using this photo from Getty Images ( here ) of Malia walking in New York City on April 18, 2017. Intended as a joke, the article on the satirical Daily World Update page includes several hoax claims about Malia Obama, now an undergraduate student at Harvard University, such as reference to her \"arrest in 2016 for providing her little sister\u2019s Girl Scout troop with 'enough whip-its to drop a team of well-kept alpacas.'\" The use of \"whip-it\" here refers to the slang term for the recreational use of nitrous oxide ( here ).\n\nThe site claims, \u201cMalia was busted by campus security at Harvard as she and a friend were caught using a \u2018white, powdery substance\u2019 in the women\u2019s shower room.\u201d Suggesting that Malia and her friend were in possession of cocaine, the article claims she was \u201cheld at the Harvard County Jail \u2014 which is nestled between Middlesex and Essex counties \u2014 but she was released the next day\u201d after \u201cthe family\u2019s lawyer got them off.\u201d Harvard County does not exist, as Harvard University is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, part of Middlesex County.\n\nThough the original content was intended as satire, it has since been shared out of context and users were therefore misled into thinking it was real. The post on \u201cFreedom of Thought,\u201d for example, does not have a caption marking it as satire, just a link to the article with the headline \u201cMalia Obama Arrested Again, Complete Media Blackout.\u201d Users\u2019 comments on the \u201cFreedom of Thought\u201d post include \u201d And yet the Press can go after [President Trump\u2019s] wife and kids! WOW!!\u201d while another added, \u201cThe media is not honest in any way!\u201d.\n\nFalse: Malia Obama was not arrested for cocaine possession. The claim originated in an article on a satirical site that was shared out of context as if it were true.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
