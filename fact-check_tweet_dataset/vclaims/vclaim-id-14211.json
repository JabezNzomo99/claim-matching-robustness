On Sunday [March 26], Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted a video alleging that former Union minister and BJP MP Kalraj Mishra had threatened to shoot those who asked him questions.\n\nA video of Kalraj Mishra addressing a rally where the comment was allegedly made went viral on social media.\n\nThe archived version of the tweet.\n\nRandeep Surjewala tweeted, \"New example of violent mentality of BJP. Kalraj Mishra threatens people who raise slogans against Faridabad MP, saying that if it were my home state I would have got down from the stage and shot the people who are creating a mess. Is this the message of BJP? Get shot for asking a question!\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Randeep Surjewala\u2019s claim is misleading. Kalraj Mishra didn\u2019t make any such statement in the rally. It is likely that people misheard Kalraj Mishra\u2019s speech due to the low pitch of the audio.\n\nRandeep Surjewala\u2019s tweet has already attracted more than 2,500 retweets and about 7,000 likes. Not only Surjewala, but many prominent media houses also focused on the same false claim.\n\nThe video clip with the same misleading claim is doing the rounds on Facebook as well.\n\nIn response to Randeep Surjewala\u2019s allegation, Kalraj Mishra tweeted a video of the rally which was recorded from a different angle, and criticized Congress for fooling the public.\n\nIn the tweet, Mishra clarified that he had said\n\n\n\nWe found that the video is from a Vijay Sankalp Rally\u2019 organized in Faridabad on Sunday, March 24. While Kalraj Mishra and Union state minister and local MP Krishna Pal Gurjar were addressing the crowd, some people began raising slogans against Gurjar which annoyed Mishra.\n\nWhen we carefully listened to Mishra\u2019s speech in slow motion we found that he had indeed not threatened to shoot anyone.\n\nKalraj Mishra had actually said - Chunaav ladna hai, yahi maapdand nahi hai mitro. Hame bada kharab laga. Agar mera Pradesh hota to main abhi neeche utar ke vahi baat karta. (Fighting election is not the only benchmark. I felt bad; if it was my home state, I would have stepped down from the stage and said the same thing.)\n\nThe full speech is available on the Facebook page of Kalraj Mishra.\n\nRandeep Surjewala and some media houses misheard the sentence vahi baat karta\u2019 as goli maar deta\u2019.\n\nThe false claim has also been debunked by Smhoaxslayer.", "lang": "en"}
