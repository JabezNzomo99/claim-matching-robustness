The fourth suspect, Leonid Kharchenko, is a Ukrainian citizen.\n\nAll are being charged with causing the crash of MH17 and the murder of the 298 people on board.\n\nPutin told journalists Russia had never shied away from taking responsibility, but said no evidence has been presented showing Russia was behind the downing of MH17.\n\n\u201cWe think there is no evidence at all there. Everything that was presented does not prove anything. We have our own version and we have submitted it, but regrettably nobody wants to listen to us,\u201d Putin said, according the Kremlin transcript.\n\nThe Russian president\u2019s claim about Moscow\u2019s own versions submitted to the investigators have, as Polygraph.info reported, been debunked:\n\u2022 \u201cMH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian jet.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was blown up by a missile intended for the Russian President\u2019s plane.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was already full of dead bodies and deliberately crashed.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was shot down by a BUK missile but not one of Russia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn September 2016, the Joint Investigative Team (JIT), a Dutch-led international group of investigators tasked with getting to the bottom of the MH17 tragedy, released a preliminary report refuting several of these narratives.\n\nReports on the perpetrators would come at a later stage in the investigation.\n\nThe previous year, the Dutch Safety Board, which investigates accidents across numerous areas, likewise found that MH17 crashed as a result of the detonation of a 9N314M warhead \u201ccarried on the kind of missile that is installed on the Buk surface-to-air missile system.\u201d\n\nThe claim that no evidence has been presented showing Russia\u2019s culpability is also false. A raft of evidence has been presented, both by the JIT and open-source investigators like Bellingcat. The latter reported that the JIT received 150,000 intercepted phone conversations, \u201can unknown number of which\u201d contain evidence relevant to the MH17 case.\n\nWhile noting that any such information provided by intelligence services must be vetted for authenticity, Bellingcat reported that \u201cevidence from open sources corroborate the authenticity of the published calls\u201d related to the culpability of the Russia-backed militia in shooting down the civilian airliner.\n\n\u201cFirstly, the route that the Buk convoy took in Ukraine matches the exact route discussed in the recorded conversations,\u201d Bellingcat reported. \u201cSecondly, the separatist leaders Dubinsky, Bezler, and Nikolay Kozitsyn have admitted that it was indeed their voices that were heard on some of the intercepts. Lastly, voice comparisons carried out by forensic analysts in two research institutions have confirmed the identity of Russian officers Nikolay \u2018Delfin\u2019 Tkachev and Oleg \u2018Orion\u2019 Ivannikov, as described in previous Bellingcat publications.\u201d\n\nDubinsky, a former Russian military intelligence officer and onetime head of the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u2019s main intelligence department, was recorded speaking about the transport route of the Buk-M1 missile launcher that downed MH17. As Bellingcat noted, the route described in those recorded conversations mirrored the path along which the missile launcher was filmed and photographed on July 17, 2014.\n\nIn May 2018, the JIT concluded the Buk-M1 missile launcher was from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade from Kursk, Russia.\n\nAccording to investigators, that system was transported from Russia to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in eastern Ukraine, from where the missile was launched.\n\n\u201cAfter the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR (vehicle) initially drove off under its own power,\u201d the JIT reported. \u201cA short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nDutch police noted at that time: \"All the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces.\u201d\n\nBellingcat had previously collated photographs and videos of the Buk-M1 missile launcher in Donetsk, Zuhres, Luhansk, Torez, and Snizhne, Ukraine on the day MH17 was shot down.\n\nOn June 19, Girkin said \u201cthe rebels did not shoot down the Boeing,\u201d prompting speculation he was pinning the blame on regular Russian military forces.\n\nThe day of the MH17 tragedy, a social media account associated with Girkin bragged that a Ukrainian military An-26 cargo plane had been downed near MH17\u2019s crash site. The post showed photos of a rising column of smoke and a warning to the Ukrainian military to \u201cstay out of our sky.\u201d\n\nOnce it became clear that MH17, not an An-26, had been shot down, the post disappeared, and the alternative theories began.\n\nHowever, that same day, Russian state media ran a story headlined \u201cEyewitnesses claim Donbass militia downed Ukrainian An-26 plane,\u201d which mirrored Girkin\u2019s initial claim and is still available online today.\u200b\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Putin\u2019s claim no evidence has been provided showing Russia\u2019s culpability in the downing of MH17 to be false.", "lang": "en"}
