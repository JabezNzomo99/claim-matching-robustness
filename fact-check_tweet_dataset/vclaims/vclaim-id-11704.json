But his figures correspond to those in a Customs and Border Protection video on various border security strategies deployed before he took office, from 1992 to 2016. And in most sectors Trump cited as successful, there is very little fencing designed to stop pedestrians.\n\u2022 In advocating a border wall, Trump claimed that \u201cpeople with \u2026 medical problems are pouring in \u2026 in many cases, it\u2019s contagious.\u201d Scientific evidence doesn\u2019t support the idea that migrants pose a public health risk.\n\u2022 Another reason the president cited was that \u201cdrugs are pouring into our country.\u201d But most illegal drugs come across the Southwest border through legal ports of entry, hidden in passenger cars and tractor trailers, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency and Trump\u2019s former Department of Homeland Security secretary, John Kelly.\n\u2022 Pelosi, the House minority leader, said \u201cpeople are losing their jobs,\u201d despite the fact that the economy has added jobs for a record 98 months, beginning in October 2010. Her office said she was referring to recent layoffs, such as at General Motors.\n\u2022 Senate Minority Leader Schumer disagreed with Trump\u2019s statement that the last government shutdown was caused by Schumer. But neutral observers said the three-day partial shutdown was largely due to Senate Democrats\u2019 efforts to protect DACA recipients.\n\u2022 Trump claimed: \u201cWe caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time,\u201d but the White House didn\u2019t provide any support for that statement.\n\nThe on-camera Dec. 11 meeting was held 10 days before a deadline for Congress to pass, and the president to sign, spending legislation to avoid a government shutdown. Trump said near the end of the meeting: \u201cYes, if we don\u2019t get what we want, one way or the other \u2014 whether it\u2019s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call \u2014 I will shut down the government.\u201d\n\nTrump said statistics show \u201cillegal traffic\u201d was reduced in various sectors along the Southwest border as a result of the construction of border \u201cwall.\u201d But the gains he cited were the result of a myriad of border security strategies over two decades that included enhanced technology and an increase in border agents. In some areas, those strategies included fencing, but in most of the areas Trump cited, no barriers were added that would stop anyone crossing by foot.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our inquiry seeking backup for these statistics.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments suggest he was talking about the effectiveness of a border wall constructed since he took office, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Indeed, very little new fencing has been built under Trump.\n\nAlthough Congress last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas, the new barriers are not concrete and are not like any of Trump\u2019s wall prototypes.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection, the fiscal year 2017 border security program included:\n\u2022 San Diego Primary Replacement Project (14 miles). So far, 9 miles of the project have been completed, and the rest remains on schedule to be completed in May 2019.\n\u2022 El Paso Primary Fence Replacement Project (4 miles). So far, 2 miles of that have been completed, with the remaining scheduled to be completed in late-April 2019.\n\nThat is almost all replacement of existing fencing, and as we said, none of it is the type of solid wall Trump talked about during the campaign. For more on this, see our story \u201cHas the Border Wall Begun?\u201c\n\nIt appears the president was speaking about the effectiveness of fencing constructed along the border over the past 20-plus years.\n\nOfficials at Customs and Border Protection pointed us to a video it published in February 2017 showing a shift in border strategy \u2014 and its effect on apprehensions \u2014 between 1992 and 2016. Many of the apprehension figures cited in the video correspond with the president\u2019s.\n\nIn fiscal year 1992, CBP states in the video, border patrol arrested more than 560,000 immigrants attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally in the 60-mile San Diego sector. Due to various border control strategies employed in that sector, CBP notes, apprehensions fell nearly 90 percent to 68,000 in 2010, and down to 26,290 by fiscal 2015. (Trump said \u201cillegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up\u201d in the San Diego sector.)\n\nBut CBP does not attribute the entirety of that improvement to fencing, though it lists fencing as a factor. CBP says it employed a strategy that included \u201c[i]ncreased manpower, utilized intelligence, focused prosecutions, technology was advanced and tactical infrastructure was improved by adding fencing, all-weather roads and stadium lighting.\u201d\n\nIn El Paso, apprehensions in 1993 were 285,000. As a result of Operation Hold the Line \u2014 which included \u201cforward deployment of agents and technology to high traffic areas, focusing on prevention through deterrence\u201d \u2014 apprehensions decreased more than 70 percent to 79,000 in one year between 1993 and 1994, and they dropped to 14,495 by 2015. There is no mention of additional fencing in the CBP video. (Trump said apprehensions dropped in El Paso by 72 percent, then \u201cultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.\u201d)\n\nA few years later, CBP said, \u201ctraffic shifted\u201d to the Tucson sector in Arizona. That sector led the number of apprehensions in fiscal 2000 with 616,000. \u201cWith an increase in manpower, improvements in technology and intelligence,\u201d as well as \u201cfencing and vehicle barriers,\u201d apprehensions in the Tucson sector dropped from 616,000 in 2000 to 63,400 in 2015, CBP states. (Trump said apprehensions dropped 92 percent in Tucson.)\n\nIllegal border crossing then shifted to the neighboring Yuma sector in 2005, CBP said. To address the surge, CBP said, the sector \u201ctripled manpower, deployed mobile surveillance systems, increased prosecutions, collaborated with state and local partners, including the government of Mexico, and added fencing, all-weather roads and vehicle barriers.\u201d By 2009, CBP states, apprehensions in Yuma dropped nearly 95 percent from 138,000 in 2005 to 6,900 in 2009. (Trump said \u201cillegal traffic\u201d dropped \u201c95 to 96 percent\u201d in Yuma.)\n\nSo while additional fencing was one of the strategies employed by CBP to decrease illegal border crossings, other methods, such as improved technology and increased manpower, were also credited by CBP.\n\nTrump said his point was: \u201cWhere you have walls \u2026 it\u2019s effective. Where you don\u2019t have walls, it is not effective.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not accurate if by \u201cwalls\u201d he means barriers that are designed to stop pedestrians.\n\nAs USA Today documented in its in-depth report on the border, \u201cAbout 650 miles of the 2,000 mile border are fenced, leaving 1,350 miles open. Of that 650 miles, about half is designed to stop vehicles, not people. The 300-plus miles of vehicle barriers, X-shaped crossbars or short steel posts, block cars. These fences often sit in harsh deserts that make crossing deadly on its own. But anybody on foot can cross over, under or through. This means only about 350 miles of the 2,000-mile border currently has fencing meant to stop people.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the USA Today map of fencing types along the Southwest border shows there is very little fencing designed to stop pedestrians in the El Paso, Tucson and Yuma sectors touted by Trump for stopping \u201cillegal traffic \u2026 once the wall was up.\u201d\n\nBoth Pelosi and Schumer said they support enhanced border security. But, Schumer said, \u201cexperts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d And Pelosi called for \u201can evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is.\u201d\n\nTrump cited the threat of migrant disease to promote the building of his border wall.\n\n\u201cPeople with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many \u2014 in many cases, it\u2019s contagious,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re pouring into our country. We have to have border security. We have to have a wall as part of border security.\u201d\n\nPrior to the meeting, Trump also tweeted some of his reasoning for a border wall, claiming that Democrats \u201cwant Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease.\u201d\n\nThe scientific evidence, however, does not support the idea that migrants are a substantial public health risk.\n\nA report published last week in the journal The Lancet directly addressed the subject, and concluded that \u201cthe risk of transmission from migrating populations to host populations is generally low.\u201d\n\nAnd when there are legitimate concerns, such as for tuberculosis, the report notes that studies show while there may be an increased risk for transmission within migrant communities, that isn\u2019t the case for host populations. A 2007 study in Norway that analyzed tuberculosis, or TB, cases over 12 years found that each year on average, 13 immigrants and two nonimmigrants developed the disease as a result of imported TB. The researchers concluded that immigration \u201cdid not appear to influence the TB situation among the existing residents of the country.\u201d\n\nThe more recent report in The Lancet, which was written by two dozen experts on the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health, cautions that it doesn\u2019t have good data on undocumented migrants, and acknowledges that migrant populations \u201cmight come\u201d from countries with higher disease rates. But outbreak risk is low if the destination country has strong surveillance and public health services. \u201cThese services are also crucial to prevent pandemics,\u201d the report said, \u201cwhether associated with population movement or not.\u201d\n\nFor some communicable diseases, such as measles, some migrants come from countries that have higher vaccination rates than the United States. According to the World Bank, 92 percent of U.S. children age 1 to 2 received the measles vaccine in 2017, compared with 96 percent in Mexico, 97 percent in Honduras and 99 percent in Nicaragua.\n\nDrugs Come through Legal Ports of Entry\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has said Mexican cartels \u201ctransport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers,\u201d an assessment with which John Kelly, when he was secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, agreed. But Trump suggested that a wall along the border would stop drugs from \u201cpouring into our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, we have to have the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question; this is a national emergency. Drugs are pouring into our country.\u201d\n\nAt an April 2017 congressional hearing, Kelly, then the DHS secretary, said that illegal drugs from Mexico \u201cmostly come through the ports of entry.\u201d He talked about the need to improve density meters that can \u201clook\u201d into vehicles for signs of drugs. \u201cTechnology that looks into trucks, tractor-trailers is pretty good but I know there\u2019s better stuff out there and we\u2019ll just \u2014 we\u2019ll just get after it,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut mostly the drugs come in, we believe, we know comes in, in relatively small amounts, 10, 15 kilos at a time in \u2014 in automobiles and those kind of conveyances.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s remarks echo the 2015 DEA report, which said: \u201cThe drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or comingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers.\u201d\n\nExperts we contacted when we wrote about this claim in 2017 agreed. Stephen D. Morris, a Middle Tennessee State University political science professor whose research has largely focused on Mexico, told us that \u201cthe wall will not do very much to stop drugs.\u201d\n\nAt one point in the free-wheeling discussion with the president, Pelosi attempted to steer the conversation to other issues \u2014 specifically the economy. But, in doing so, she made a misleading claim about lost jobs.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, told us the Democratic leader was referring \u201cto layoffs, such as GM\u2019s layoffs.\u201d General Motors announced last month that it would be closing seven plants and reducing its North American workforce by 14,000 people.\n\nOf course, layoffs happen even in the best of economies. But the fact is that the U.S. economy has added jobs for a record 98 months, beginning in October 2010. During that time, the U.S. has added 19.5 million jobs \u2014 including nearly 4.2 million since Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nTrump is also right about the current unemployment rate, which is 3.7 percent. That\u2019s the lowest rate since December 1969, when it was 3.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe president and Schumer seemed to disagree over who caused the last government shutdown.\n\nThe federal government partially shut down in January 2018 for three days, in large part due to Democratic efforts to protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients from deportation.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats shut down the government in hopes of striking a deal to shield 700,000 young immigrants from deportation,\u201d as Politico wrote at the time.\n\nThe New York Times similarly wrote that the shutdown occurred \u201cafter Senate Democrats, showing remarkable solidarity in the face of a clear political danger, blocked consideration of a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and the Trump White House called it the \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d because of the Senate Democrats\u2019 demands. Schumer called it a \u201cTrump Shutdown,\u201d because the Republicans controlled Congress and the White House. Shutdowns occur when there is an impasse between both sides, but most neutral observers saw the shutdown then as the result of the Democratic efforts, as Trump said.\n\nTrump also argued that a border wall was necessary to keep terrorists out of the country.\n\n\u201cPeople are pouring into our country, including terrorists,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not provide us with any support for his statement.\n\nWhen we asked DHS about the president\u2019s claim, we were told in an email: \u201cOn average last year, DHS prevented 10 individuals tied to terror \u2014 known or suspect terrorists \u2014 each day from traveling or attempting to travel to the United States.\u201d That includes \u201cindividuals attempting to travel to the United States by air, sea, or land,\u201d who \u201chit against U.S. terror watchlists,\u201d DHS explained.\n\nThat\u2019s what Vice President Mike Pence meant to say in October instead of this: \u201cIn the last fiscal year, we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico.\u201d A Pence spokeswoman later said he misspoke when he said the Southern border.\n\nA July 2017 State Department report said there was \u201cno credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\u201d\n\nIn October, we also had asked DHS about another statistic cited by DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. She said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Oct. 28 that \u201cwe stopped 3,000 people a year who have traveled \u2014 of a pattern similar to terrorists from attempting to come in the Southwest border.\u201d\n\nA DHS official told us the figure includes people apprehended on the Southwest border who engaged in \u201csuspicious travel from countries with elevated levels of risk due to terrorism activity.\u201d DHS didn\u2019t provide any further information, citing law enforcement sensitivity.", "lang": "en"}
