{"title": "Did MLK Say 'Our Lives Begin to End the Day We Become Silent'?", "subtitle": "An oft-quoted statement attributed to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. appears to have been paraphrased from a speech he made in 1965.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1636", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mlk-our-lives-begin-to-end/", "vclaim": "Civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said a great many quotable things, but words have also been attributed to him that were not his own.\n\nIt was not really King who said, for example, \u201cI mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy,\u201d but rather a Facebook user whose prefatory remarks were conflated with King\u2019s when her post was copied and pasted and went viral.\n\nNor did King actually say or write the line, \u201cI was a drum major for justice, peace, and righteousness,\u201d though those exact words were inscribed on a statue of MLK erected in Washington, D.C., in 2011. It was was an ill-considered paraphrase of a deeper thought King had uttered two months before he was assassinated in 1968:\n\nThe shortened version made King look like \u201can arrogant twit,\u201d poet Maya Angelou complained. Others agreed. Ultimately, the wording was removed from the statue.\n\nSimilarly, King never uttered the statement, \u201cOur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter,\u201d though it is abundantly cited as such every year on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:\n\nBut while the exact quote is nowhere to be found in King\u2019s speeches or writings, it does seem to be a paraphrase of a more complex thought he uttered during a sermon in Selma, Alabama, on 8 March 1965, the day after \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d on which civil rights protesters were attacked and beaten by police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge:\n\nDeep down in our non-violent creed is the conviction there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true, that they\u2019re worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36 years old, as I happen to be, some great truth stands before the door of his life \u2014 some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right. A man might be afraid his home will get bombed, or he\u2019s afraid that he will lose his job, or he\u2019s afraid that he will get shot, or beat down by state troopers, and he may go on and live until he\u2019s 80. He\u2019s just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. The cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died \u2026 A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true. So we\u2019re going to stand up amid horses. We\u2019re going to stand up right here in Alabama, amid the billy-clubs. We\u2019re going to stand up right here in Alabama amid police dogs, if they have them. We\u2019re going to stand up amid tear gas! We\u2019re going to stand up amid anything they can muster up, letting the world know that we are determined to be free!\n\nAlbeit shortened, reworded, and deprived of context, the viral passage captures an essential point King was trying to make, but it is more accurately represented as a paraphrase, not a direct quote.", "lang": "en"}
