Migration to the UK has DROPPED in the quarter after Britain voted to leave the European Union \u2013 to the lowest level in two years\u201d \u201cNet migration to UK falls by 49,000 after Brexit vote\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen headlines this morning claiming net migration has fallen by 49,000 to 273,000 in the year to last September, and anything linking this with the EU referendum, you need to tread carefully when drawing conclusions about them. \u2018Net migration\u2019 is the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and the number of people leaving to live abroad.\n\nThe change looks big, but it isn\u2019t actually \u201cstatistically significant\u201d. In other words, we can\u2019t be sure enough that the change isn\u2019t just down to random variation, as opposed to something genuine. That\u2019s because all these numbers come out of a survey of passengers at ports across the UK, so they can\u2019t precisely count everyone in and out. Uncertainty is inevitable.\n\nThat said, given the scale of the measured fall there\u2019s still a good chance that we\u2019re seeing something genuine.\n\nWithin the EU there is a mixed picture, with a fall in net migration of Eastern Europeans but a rise in immigration by Bulgarians and Romanians.\n\nFew significant changes but lots of food for thought\n\nBehind the headline decreases there were also falls in net migration from the rest of the EU and outside the EU as well. Again, these weren\u2019t big enough to be significant but do potentially mark the start of genuine decreases.\n\nBut there were some changes we can be reasonably sure about:\n\u2022 None Up: Immigration of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens to the UK.\n\u2022 None Up: Emigration of citizens of eight Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004\n\u2022 None Up: Emigration of African, American and Oceanian citizens from the UK.\n\u2022 None Down: Immigration of people arriving to study, mainly from outside the EU. It is too early to tell if this is \u201can emerging long-term trend\u201d, the Office for National Statistics\n\nToo soon to say what effect the EU referendum has had\n\nThis is the first set of estimates we\u2019ve had covering the months following last year\u2019s EU referendum. But as the ONS points out this morning:\n\n\u201cit is too early to say what effect the referendum result has had on long-term international migration\u201d\n\nPart of that is because there hasn\u2019t been a consistent picture of EU immigration and emigration. Net migration from Eastern Europe was estimated to have fallen slightly, while there were significant increases in Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants.", "lang": "en"}
