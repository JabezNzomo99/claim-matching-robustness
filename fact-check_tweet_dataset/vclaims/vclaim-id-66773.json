John Lewis, D-Ga., and NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell.\n\n\"You've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American,\" said Mitchell, who hosted the Aug. 17 show in place of (Gregory\u2019s full-time replacement is Chuck Todd, who starts Sept. 7.)\n\nThe racial makeup of the police force emerged as a story line after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by white officer 28.\n\nMitchell\u2019s statistic about Ferguson\u2019s black population checks out through the city\u2019s from the U.S. Census Bureau. As of 2010, 67.4 percent of the city\u2019s 21,000 residents are black, and 29.3 percent are white.\n\nThe state of Missouri, by comparison, is 83 percent white and 11 percent black.\n\nFerguson\u2019s black population was almost nonexistent four decades ago, when of the population in 1970 was white, Census .\n\nFerguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who is white, said the police department has 53 officers, three of whom are black, according to the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press. He also said that the other 50 officers are white, according to newspaper reports. Put another way, Ferguson police officers are 94 percent white and 5.6 percent black.\n\nTimothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, said Sunday that there actually are four African-American officers among the 53-person officer corps. \"The discrepancy may have been that we really don't see black or white among our colleagues,\" Zoll said.\n\nSo there is some question whether the number is three or four, but there is no question that an imbalance exists.\n\nFerguson Mayor James Knowles, who is also white, has addressed the lack of diversity in the police department. According to an Aug. 12 report by St. Louis-based TV station , Knowles told reporters that young African-Americans aren\u2019t interested in police jobs. Knowles said:\n\n\"We hire everyone that we can get. There's also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap.\"\n\nThe lack of racial diversity on the police force compared with the city population is not unique to Ferguson. It\u2019s actually comparable to other cities its size around the country. A of local police departments found the national average for all local police was 75 percent white. The average for an agency serving a city around Ferguson\u2019s population was 87.5 percent white.\n\nMissouri law requires the state\u2019s attorney general to issue an detailing demographic information for people pulled over by officers in each city. In 2013, the attorney general\u2019s office reported that black drivers in Ferguson were about twice as likely to be arrested after police stops than whites.\n\nBlacks made up 93 percent of 2013 arrests after car stops.\n\nMitchell said Ferguson has \"three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American.\"\n\nThis claim has emerged as a central talking point in the fallout from Brown\u2019s shooting. Her numbers are backed up by news reports quoting the city's police chief and Census data.\n\nThe only caveat is that a police spokesman now says that the department has four African-Americans, while the chief previously has said three.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
