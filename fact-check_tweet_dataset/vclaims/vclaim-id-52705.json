Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post doing rounds on social media reads: Italy finds home remedy for Covid\u201919 / 500gms aspirin dissolved with lemon juice boiled with honey, it is taken hot. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWhen Vishvas News investigated, we found that the COVID-19 guidance released by the Ministry of Health, Italy, makes no reference to the purported home remedy as stated in the viral post.\n\nIt states that: Do not take antiviral drugs and antibiotics, unless prescribed by your doctor. It further states: The sick person must rest, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food, and wear a surgical mask that needs to be changed every day. If he/she does not tolerate the mask, he/she must adopt a strict respiratory hygiene: cover his/her mouth and nose with a disposable paper tissue/handkerchief when he/she coughs or sneezes and throw it away immediately, or wash it after use, wash his/her hands with soap and water or with hydroalcoholic solution.\n\nHowever there are certain immunity boosters as mentioned by the Ministry of AYUSH but consuming the combination of Aspirin, lemon juice, and honey is not proven.\n\nAs per the Ministry of AYUSH, lemon can be added in a herbal tea / decoction (Kadha) made from Tulsi (Basil), Dalchini (Cinnamon), Kalimirch (Black pepper), Shunthi (Dry Ginger) and Munakka (Raisin) \u2013 once or twice a day as an immunity booster.\n\nAnd, honey can be mixed in Lavang (Clove) can be taken 2-3 times a day in case of cough or throat irritation. But, these are immunity boosting measures and does not claim to be the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Nikhil Modi who is a respiratory care specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi. He said: One should never consume medicine without doctors recommendation. The purporting home remedy is no cure or treatment for COVID-19. It is completely fake.\u201d\n\nAs per WHO, here are seven steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus:\n\u2022 Cover your cough with the bend of your elbow or tissue\n\u2022 Stay at home if you feel unwell \u2013 even with a slight fever and cough\n\u2022 If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early \u2013 but call by phone first\n\u2022 Stay aware of the latest information from WHO\n\nAs per WHO, \u201cTo date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicines against COVID-19. However, .people, particularly those with serious illness, may need to be hospitalized so that they can receive life-saving treatment for complications.. Most patients recover thanks to such care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are currently under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVishvas News performed social scanning of the user named Minervs Blancio. We found that the user is based out of Philippines.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
