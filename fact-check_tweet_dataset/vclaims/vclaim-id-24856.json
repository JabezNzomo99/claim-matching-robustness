(The anterior hypothalamus is a part of the brain that controls the body\u2019s temperature regulation, among other things.) Supposedly, the dog thus overheats and can become ill and die.\n\nMultiple veterinary advice outlets have addressed the claims made in the post. The consensus is that there is little danger in giving ice or ice water to a healthy dog in warm weather.\n\nThe RSPCA does not warn against giving your dog ice, and even recommend putting ice cubes in your dog\u2019s bowl, or making them ice treats.\n\nHowever, if your dog is already exhibiting signs of heatstroke\u2014which include excessive panting or drooling, vomiting or collapsing\u2014then do not give them ice, either to eat or placed on their skin. Instead, you should cool them gently to avoid shock and take them to a vet.", "lang": "en"}
