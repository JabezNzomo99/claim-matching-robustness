(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte flip-flops on family\u2019s wealth and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: In his own words: Duterte sometimes poor, sometimes rich)\n\nLate last year, the president, probed by the Office of the Ombudsman for alleged hidden wealth, said his lifetime savings \u201cwould not go beyond P40 million.\u201d (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Timeline of the controversy on Duterte\u2019s wealth)\n\nDela Rosa\u2019s second claim could either mean Duterte did not get the support of the rich, or that their votes were not crucial to his landslide victory in 2016. Both are baseless.\n\nDuterte\u2019s statement of contributions and expenditures (SOCE) shows a sizable amount of his campaign funds came from a number of prominent rich personalities. His top donors include Davao del Norte 2nd District Representative Antonio Floirendo Jr. and then Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano who was his running mate.\n\nDuterte has also said on separate occasions that then Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos and Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade funded his campaign. Neither Marcos nor Tugade appear in Duterte\u2019s SOCE. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Did Imee fund Duterte\u2019s campaign? and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte either made a false claim or admitted to election offense in Jerusalem)\n\nIf Dela Rosa had meant that voters in higher income classes were not instrumental to Duterte's win, the Social Weather Stations (SWS) exit poll in 2016 sponsored by TV5 Network Inc. contradicts his claim.\n\nWhile the survey showed that Duterte led in votes across all socioeconomic classes, his biggest lead was among voters in class ABC.\n\nIn his Philippine Daily Inquirer column on May 14, 2016, SWS president Mahar Mangahas wrote:\n\nFormer Interior Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas came in second in the 2016 presidential race with over 6.6 million votes behind.\n\nThe TV5-SWS exit poll had a final sample size of 72,821 voters from 802 voting centers across the country. Apart from socioeconomic class, the survey covered standard demographics including gender, age, education and religion.\n\nThe full poll results will be open for public consumption in 2019, until which the survey sponsor has exclusive rights, said Vladymir Licudine, SWS deputy director for survey design, analysis and training group.\n\nUNTV News and Rescue, Ronald \u201cBato\u201d Dela Rosa, Interview at Get it Straight with Daniel Razon, Nov. 21, 2018\n\nPCOO, President Rodrigo Duterte, Speech during the installation of new officers and induction of new members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Davao City Chapter, Sept. 30, 2017\n\nMangahas, M.
