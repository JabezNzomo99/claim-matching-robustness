Ever since BJP and Mr Modi were voted to lead the country in May 2014, India has seen a series of hate crimes and hate campaigns, from murders over beef to campaigns such as Love Jihad. A similar trend can now be seen in the US, one which started right from the days when Donald Trump started his presidential campaign to the brutal murder of an Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla a day ago just over a month after Mr Trump assumed office. In India, the mob lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, with sticks and bricks shocked many across the country.\n\nWhile Akhlaq was killed on the night of 28th September 2015, Srinivas was killed on the night of 23rd February 2017 according to Indian Standard Time (IST). Since the killings happened at night, Indian newspapers covered neither of the crimes the day after. While Akhlaq\u2019s mob lynching was covered on 30th September 2015, Srinivas\u2019s murder has been covered by Indian Newspapers on 25th February 2015. In this post, we present a pictorial comparison of how Indian Newspapers covered the two crimes. Let\u2019s start with Times of India, Delhi edition on the day after Akhlaq was lynched.\n\nThe front page of Times of India on 30th September 2015 could only afford a tiny space on the left column on the front page of its newspaper regarding Akhlaq\u2019s mob lynching. How did Times of India, Delhi Edition, cover Srinivas\u2019s murder?\n\nTimes of India dedicated a front page lead story for the murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla. Next, let us look at Hindustan Times, Delhi Edition, coverage of Srinivas\u2019s murder.\n\nAgain, a front page lead story. How did Hindustan Times cover Mohammad Akhlaq\u2019s mob lynching on 30th September 2015?\n\nAs one can see, Mohammad Akhlaq is nowhere to be seen on the front page of Hindustan Times, Delhi Edition, on 30th September 2015. In fact, this incident was relegated to the 3rd page. Let us look at Mail Today front page next on 25th February 2017 to see how they covered Srinivas Kuchibhotla\u2019s murder.\n\nMail Today, being a tabloid newspaper, featured it as one of its lead stories. How did Mail Today cover Mohammad Akhlaq\u2019s lynching on 30th September 2015?\n\nMail Today not only skipped Mohammad Akhlaq\u2019s mob lynching on 30th September 2015 on its front page but they failed to feature it anywhere at all on that day. They wrote about it on 1st October 2015 and that too in one of their inner pages. In fact, the only newspaper that did justice in their news coverage to these hate crimes was Indian Express. Here\u2019s a comparison of their coverage of Akhlaq\u2019s murder vs Srinivas\u2019s murder.\n\nFrom the above examples, one can see a clear bias in the coverage of Mohammad Akhlaq\u2019s mob lynching vs the coverage of Srinivas Kuchibhotla\u2019s murder in the US. Why this bias? Why did Indian media have to wait for a pan-national outrage to feature Mohammad Akhlaq in the news cycle? Why wasn\u2019t adequate space given to Mohammad Akhlaq in newspapers the day after he was brutally murdered? Is it because Indian media is hesitant in highlighting right wing hate crimes? These are some of the troubling questions that Indian media needs to answer.", "lang": "en"}
