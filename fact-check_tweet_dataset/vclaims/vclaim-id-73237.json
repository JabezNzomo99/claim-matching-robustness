Some of the posts claim the photo was taken at the scene of the attack. This is false; the picture already appeared online in September 2018.\n\nOne version of the picture, posted by a Facebook page claiming to be \u201cthe Only Authentic Page Of\u201d Maulana Tariq Jameel, a Pakistani Islamic scholar and preacher, was captioned: \"This is the Image of the Quran, my friend was reading in #ChristChurch #NoorMasjid,#NewZealand when he got Shaadah. He went early so he can offer his Jummah (Friday prayers) in first Row. Maasha Allah (God willing) what a way to meet Allah.\u201d\n\nThe same image has been shared more than 4,000 times with varying captions that link it to the attack at two mosques in Christchurch which left 50 people dead and dozens injured (the full AFP story can be read here).\n\nMany of these posts, from India and Pakistan to Nigeria, express sympathy or anger over the attack, often alongside the caption: \u201cThis noble Quran will be a witness of the martyrs in New Zealand.\u201d\n\nOther posts more explicitly state that it was taken at the scene of the attack, such as here and here.\n\nBut a simple Google reverse image search shows that the image was already online in September 2018, and therefore cannot have been taken after Friday\u2019s attack in New Zealand.\n\nThe first version we can find online was posted by the Twitter account \u201cMuslim Daily\u201d, with a caption claiming it was taken in Somalia after a US drone strike on Al-Shabab militants.\n\nThe US has been carrying out military operations against the Somali militants for a decade, although we have been unable to verify whether this photo was in fact taken in Somalia. However, we can say with certainty that it was not taken after the New Zealand attack.", "lang": "en"}
