However, the High Court ruled in favour of the students but had withheld their results till the final judgement. The NCC, however, decided to release their result and issue them their certificate.\n\nIn 2015, the Andhra Pradesh Minorities Commission had issued a notice to the Director General of the NCC seeking clarification about a particular notice that was issued in 2013 by the DG\u2019s office that had forbidden cadets, other than Sikhs, from growing beard, The Hindu reported. The circular had asked the Sikh cadets with long beard to tie the beard properly and had ordered all other cadets to be clean shaven.\n\nLater, the commission had approached the Ministry of Defence to also exempt Muslims from compulsorily shaving their beards, but that matter is still being examined.", "lang": "en"}
