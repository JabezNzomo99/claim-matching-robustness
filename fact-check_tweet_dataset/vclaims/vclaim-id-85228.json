Then, in a Jan. 30, 2017, meeting, Trump announced a dramatic cut of $600 million from the program. Is that correct?\n\nIn December, Trump criticized Lockheed Martin for its \u201ctremendous cost and cost overruns\u201d of the F-35 program, and said he had asked Boeing to \u201cprice out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.\u201d The two companies, respectively, are primarily responsible for the two programs.\n\nAfter a Jan. 13, 2017, meeting with Trump, Hewson told reporters that the defense company was working on a deal to cut the cost of the program and create jobs. She said she and Trump discussed the programs, and told him \u201cthat we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it\u2019s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut Lockheed already had planned cost reductions. In a Dec. 19 briefing \u2014 before Trump began meeting with Hewson \u2014 the head of the Defense Department\u2019s F-35 Joint Program Office, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, announced costs would come down \u201csignificantly.\u201d The next stage in the F-35 program\u2019s low-rate initial production was a new batch of 90 airplanes, called Lot 10. Bogdan had estimated that Lot 10 planes would cost \u201csomewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane\u201d less than Lot 9 planes.\n\nBetween 6 to 7 percent comes out to a cost reduction of between $6.1 million and $7.1 million per plane, or between $549 million and $630 million for a full lot of 90 planes, The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Gregg reported. This cost reduction is already reflected in the Air Force\u2019s budget.\n\nAviation Week\u2019s Lara Seligman noted that Trump overstated his role. The average unit price has been decreasing for years, and Bogdan repeatedly has announced his intention to lower the cost of the jets, Seligman wrote.\n\n\u201cAlthough a much-anticipated contract for the latest batch of F-35s has not yet materialized, Trump claimed early Jan. 30 that he has cut $600 million from the upcoming low-rate initial production lot 10, estimated to be about 90 aircraft.\u201d Bottom line: Trump appears to be taking credit for years of work by the Pentagon and Lockheed. \u201cHe is taking credit for work that\u2019s already been done on the program by Bogdan and by Lockheed,\u201d says Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners.\u201d\n\nTrump, yet again, claims credit for decisions that were already made before he became president. Trump stated he \u201cwas able to get $600 million approximately off those planes,\u201d thereby ending the \u201cdifficulty\u201d and \u201cno movement\u201d in the program.", "lang": "en"}
