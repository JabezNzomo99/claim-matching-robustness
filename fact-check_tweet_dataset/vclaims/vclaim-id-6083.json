Eastern Ukraine remains a war zone and the only internationally recognized borders are those between Ukraine and Russia.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "September 22, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-6083", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukraine-russia-un-peacekeepers-fact-check/28751235.html", "vclaim": "On September 21, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that the main obstacle to the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Ukraine is Kyiv\u2019s position toward Moscow. \u201cGiven the position that Russia allegedly is an aggressor, of course, there is hardly room for maneuver. Because this position is absolutely contrary to the real state of affairs,\u201d Peskov said. Russia, he added, is not a \u201cparty to Ukraine\u2019s domestic conflict,\u201d but instead serves as a \u201cguarantor of the settlement process.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info has regularly fact-checked Russia\u2019s claims about not being a party to the conflict in Ukraine and found them to be false.\n\nThe discussions around a proposed UN peacekeeping mission for Ukraine intensified last week after Putin surprisingly announced that Russia might be more flexible about a possible expansion of a UN mission in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, a UN Security Council draft resolution reportedly prepared by Russia includes conditions that belie Putin\u2019s stated flexibility, with Moscow insisting on limiting the mission\u2019s mandate to Ukraine\u2019s internal regional borders instead of covering the entire conflict zone.\n\nDaniel Fried, a career U.S. diplomat and a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Polygraph.info that Russia\u2019s latest \u201cmodified proposal\u201d is a \u201ctrap\u201d into which the U.S. is \u201cnot going to fall.\u201d Russia\u2019s vision, he said, has a problem: \u201cit will, of course, freeze the conflict\u201d instead of resolving it, and, if approved by the UN, \u201cwill be in a sense ratifying Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s proposal, he said, should not be a subject of negotiations with the U.S.: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to negotiate with Russia about the disposition of UN peacekeepers in a third country, Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFollowing Putin\u2019s announcement, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and support for a UN peacekeeping mission being given a broader mandate than that envisioned by Moscow.\n\n\u201d I want to be clear about this, and that is any such force should have a broad mandate for peace and security throughout the occupied territory of Ukraine up to and including the border with Russia in order to avoid deepening or institutionalizing the divisions inside Ukraine,\u201d said U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert.\n\nAlexey Pushkov, Chairman of the Commission on Information Policy in Russia\u2019s Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament, responded to Nauert\u2019s statement via Twitter. \u201cThere is no basis for the deployment of peacekeepers on the border between the DNR/LNR and Russia,\u201d Pushkov tweeted. \u201cIt is a zone of peace and tranquility. So let them deal with the zone of tension.\u201d\n\nDNR and LNR are the Russian abbreviations for \u201cthe Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d and \u201cthe Lugansk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the two self-declared entities established by Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia.\n\nHowever, despite Pushkov\u2019s claim that this area is a \u201czone of peace and tranquility,\u201d a recent UN report states that the \u201congoing tensions\u201d in eastern Ukraine \u201cpose danger for civilians,\u201d and that the economic situation there is \u201cgrim.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom 16 May to 15 August 2017, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine recorded 26 conflict-related civilian deaths and 135 injuries. At least 2,803 civilians have been killed, and between 7,000 and 9,000 civilians injured during the conflict overall,\u201d the UN reported on September 12.\n\n\u201cThe socio-economic situation in eastern Ukraine continued to deteriorate. Hardships caused by the hostilities, measures hindering economic prosperity, and rising unemployment have led to increased levels of poverty on both sides of the contact line,\u201d the UN Human Rights Office reported.\n\nAccording to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, 13,000 people have fled eastern Ukraine in 2017 because of the conflict. As of 2016, the total number of internally displaced persons in Ukraine was 1,653,000, in addition to 239,000 granted refugee status abroad.\n\nAccording to an assessment by the World Bank, the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u201chas had a significant and detrimental impact on human welfare, and on social and economic conditions generally.\u201d The report stated that \u201cfreezing\u201d the conflict \u201cwould aggravate the distress of people in eastern Ukraine, and likely lead to additional waves of displacement,\u201d and \u201cvery likely worsen the conflict.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
