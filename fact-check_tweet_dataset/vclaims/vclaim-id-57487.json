Similar hoaxes have been routinely debunked over the years.\n\nThe post directs social media users to a website that bears the Kroger logo and asks users to answer a series of questions related to customer service. It requires users to answer the questions and share the link on Facebook before they can claim the alleged $55 check from Kroger.\n\nBut the link and its promotional offer are actually a scam. The website\u2019s URL doesn\u2019t match that of the official Kroger website, and it does not appear on the supermarket chain\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nOther companies, including Costco, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Starbucks, have been the subject of similar scams. Kroger has previously debunked a promotional scam on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThat offer is a scam \u2013 we are not affiliated w/ that website,\u201d reads part of an October 2014 tweet from Kroger.

However, Kroger was founded in 1883 in Cincinnati, making the supermarket chain roughly 137 years old.\n\nIn December, a hoax falsely claimed Kroger was giving away a year of free groceries to four families who shared and commented on a Facebook post, according to USA Today.", "lang": "en"}
