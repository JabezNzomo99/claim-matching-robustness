We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives.\u201d\n\nInstead, let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s factual accuracy concerning the status of Libya\u2019s oil now, which he correctly notes is considered high-quality crude. Does the terror group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have control of oil fields and is it \u201cmaking a fortune now in Libya\u201d?\n\nThe toppling of Gaddafi \u2014 at the hands of Libyan rebels aided by U.S. and NATO air power \u2014 has led to highly unstable governance as the country\u2019s tribes have vied for influence and power. There are rival governments based in the capital of Tripoli and the eastern city of Tobruk, and neither has fully recognized the \u201cunity\u201d government established by United Nations mediators.\n\nThe National Oil Corporation (NOC) claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the country\u2019s rival governments, though a rival NOC appears to have been set up in the east.\n\nISIS has attempted to step into the power vacuum. But not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that ISIS has grabbed a single oil field. Instead, militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil, mainly by scaring workers away.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,\u201d Gazzini said. \u201cAt the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.\u201d\n\nA review of recent news articles confirms that while some fields have been temporarily closed in response to Islamic State attacks, not a single field has been taken by the terrorist group.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for exaggeration continues unabated. The terror group\u2019s activities have at times disrupted the flow of oil. But contrary to Trump\u2019s claim on national television, the Islamic State does not control any oil fields and is not \u201cmaking a fortune\u201d from Libyan oil.\n\nBut what do you expect from a man who appears to have conveniently forgotten that he urged an intervention in Libya to topple the country\u2019s leader?", "lang": "en"}
