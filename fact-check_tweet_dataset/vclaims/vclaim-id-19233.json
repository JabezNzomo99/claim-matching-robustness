The independent Novaya Gazeta reported on Wednesday, two specialists died not of traumatic injuries from the blast itself but of radiation sickness.\n\nLassina Zerbo, Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \u2013 designed to detect any nuclear explosion conducted on Earth \u2013 tweeted the CTBTO was addressing those technical problems with station operators in Russia.\n\nZerbo tweeted out an animated map of a \u201cpotential plume\u201d showing the possible movement of radionuclides that would have been detected by those two monitoring stations.\n\nThe CTBTO would later clarify that image was \u201cstandard tech modeling and did \u201cnot show actual [radionuclide] detection and is not health-related.\u201d\n\nTwo other radionuclide-monitoring stations in Siberia also reportedly stopped transmitting data on August 13, although they later came back online.\n\n\"RN stations RUP 56 (Peleduy) and RUP 57 (Bilibino) have resumed operations in Russia & are currently backfilling data,\" Zerbo tweeted.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on August 20, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin is not responsible for monitoring those stations.\n\n\u201cAs for the work of the [radiation monitoring] stations, I honestly don\u2019t know who they are subordinate to. It\u2019s probably up to you to find out who they belong to and ask for information why this or that information is either transmitted or not transmitted,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nSo who do those stations belong to?\n\nThe CTBTO\u2019s International Monitoring System (IMS), when fully functioning, consists of 337 facilities located worldwide, with Radionuclide stations being among the four monitoring technologies employed.\n\nThe CTBTO said while information gathered from those stations is sent back to its office in Vienna, Austria, local institutions control those facilities. Through the CTBTO\u2019s International Data Center, all raw data and data bulletins generated by the 300-plus facilities at its disposal are accessible to all state signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This information \u201ccan assist a state in exercising its prerogative to make the final judgement in the case of a suspicious event.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CTBTO, the Russian portion of the CTBT\u2019s International Monitoring System covers 32 facilities, including six primary and 13 auxiliary seismic stations, four infrasound stations, eight radionuclide stations and one radionuclide laboratory. Apart from the radionuclide monitoring station, Dubna also hosts an infrared sound station, a noble gas system and the National Data Center (NDC).\n\nThe CTBTO said NDCs are usually \u201cinstitutions specializing in verification technologies, such as a national earthquake institution or a nuclear radiation monitoring agency.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, the body responsible for handling the country\u2019s segment of the CTBTO is the 12th Chief Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nAs the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense is under Putin\u2019s auspices.\n\nThat critical aspects of Russia\u2019s own monitoring system would go down at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied an increase in background radiation following a mysterious explosion has fueled speculation Russian authorities intentionally took the stations offline.\n\nDoes that make the Kremlin responsible for the radionuclide monitoring stations? Constitutionally \u2013 yes, from the technical perspective, however, experts\u2019 opinions differ.\n\nDaryl G. Kimball, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association, a U.S. based non-partisan organization promoting arms control, said individual human beings at their respective institutions are ultimately monitoring that data.\n\nAlthough the Russian government is ultimately responsible for operating the stations even if the data is sent onto the CBTBO, Kimball told Polygraph.info it would be a \u201ca big stretch\u201d to say the Kremlin is directly in charge of them.\n\nKimbal said Peskov \u201cshould know\u201d who the stations are subordinate to, but added press secretaries don\u2019t always have the facts \u201cimmediately at their disposal.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Interfax news agency said the Russian Ministry of Defense has so far not answered questions regarding its failure to transmit data to the CTBTO monitoring system.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax that the transfer of data from stations of the national segment to the international monitoring system of any country is \u201cpurely voluntary.\"\n\nThat, according to the CTBTO, is correct. While monitoring data is central to the CTBTO\u2019s verification efforts, member states\u2019 data belongs to them.\n\n\u201cWhat is absurd is why Russian government won\u2019t explain why these stations went down,\u201d Kimbal told Polygraph.info. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want the info these stations can provide to be known.\u201d\n\nAs for Peskov\u2019s statement,, while the radiation detection facilities might technically be under the Ministry of Defense, Polygraph.info finds his claim that the Kremlin is not responsible for them to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
