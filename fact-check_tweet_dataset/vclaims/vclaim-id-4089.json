They can choose to claim a reduced rate of \u00a3150 instead, or not claim at all. If they are working away from Westminster on parliamentary business they can only claim \u00a3150 a day, as well as some travel expenses.\n\nThose paid a salary cannot claim this attendance allowance.\n\nAttendance can include sitting in the House of Lords when formal business takes place, and attending other specific committees and meetings. There are also certain events they cannot claim attendance allowance for, like the State Opening of parliament, or speeches by visiting dignitaries.\n\nOn top of the daily allowance, members can claim expenses for some travel. Lords who are paid a salary can also claim for some expenses, for example secretarial expenses.\n\nExpenses and allowances for unsalaried members of the Lords are not subject to tax or national insurance contributions as membership is not classified as employment.\n\nFull disclosure: several of Full Fact\u2019s trustees are members of the House of Lords.", "lang": "en"}
