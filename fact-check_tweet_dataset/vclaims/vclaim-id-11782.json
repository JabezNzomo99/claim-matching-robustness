The website added an FAQ that a netizen posted on Facebook last Dec. 3 to boost its false claim.\n\nThree days after the false post was published, the Philippine Statistics Authority issued a notice to the public clarifying they have not begun accepting registrations for the PhilID.\n\n\"The Philippine Statistics Authority, as the primary implementing agency to carry out the provisions of Republic Act No. 11055 or the Philippine Identification System Act (PhilSys Act), has not yet started the registration of applicants for the PhilID,\" National Statistician Lisa Grace Bersales said.\n\n\"Entities or persons collecting fees and representing themselves as authorized registration centers are not in any way connected to the Agency,\" she added, reiterating that registration for the PhilID is free under the law.\n\nThe PhilSys Act, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte last Aug. 6, is set to be \"the government\u2019s central identification platform for all citizens and resident aliens of the Philippines,\" according to the PSA. Bersales had previously said they were targeting a December start date for the pilot implementation of the PhilSys Law.\n\nThedailynewsblog.online's false story could have reached over 9.5 million people. Traffic to the story largely came from the pages Unofficial: Vice Ganda, Barangay Ni Kapitan Tiyago and Magsasaka Mabuhay Ka. The website has been publishing stories since Oct. 11.", "lang": "en"}
