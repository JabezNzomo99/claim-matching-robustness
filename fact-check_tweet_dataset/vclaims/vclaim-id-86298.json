{"title": "Analysis | President Trump has made 12,019 false or misleading claims over 928 days", "subtitle": "The president has topped 12,000 in our database of false and misleading claims, adding about 20 a day in the past two months.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-08-12T07:00:14.458Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86298", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/12/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/", "vclaim": "Trump crossed the 10,000 mark on April 26, and he has been averaging about 20 fishy claims a day since then. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged about 13 such claims a day.\n\nAbout one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \u2014 190 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \u201ca wall.\u201d\n\nFalse or misleading claims about trade, the economy and the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign each account for about 10 percent of the total. Claims on those subjects are also among his most repeated.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed 186 times that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \u2014 or Ulysses S. Grant. Moreover, the economy is beginning to hit the head winds caused by the president\u2019s trade wars.\n\nOn 166 occasions, he has claimed the United States has \u201clost\u201d money on trade deficits. This reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.\n\nTrump has falsely said 162 times that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised that it would be the biggest in U.S. history \u2014 bigger than Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1981. Reagan\u2019s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9 percent of GDP, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. This continues to be an all-purpose applause line at the president\u2019s rallies.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded more than 300 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times. He also now has earned 23 \u201cBottomless Pinocchios,\u201d claims that have earned Three or Four Pinocchios and that have been repeated at least 20 times.\n\nFewer than 3 in 10 Americans believe many of his most-common false statements, according to a Washington Post Fact Checker poll published in December. Only among a pool of strong Trump approvers \u2014 about 1 in 6 adults in the survey \u2014 did large majorities accept several, although not all, of his falsehoods as true.\n\nThe award-winning database website, created by graphics reporter Leslie Shapiro, has an extremely fast search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements the president has made. We encourage readers to explore it in detail. For this update, we have added a new feature that provides a URL for every claim that is fact-checked, allowing readers to post the link on social media.\n\nNote: The Fact Checker welcomes academic research of the Trump claims database.
