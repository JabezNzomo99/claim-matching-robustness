The incident had no communal angle to it. It is clear from news articles from Pakistan that those who were attacked were not targeted because of their religion.\n\nA large group of people from villages around Khurrianwala town were protesting against unannounced load shedding. Protesters who claimed they were facing power outages of 14-16 hours a day, burnt tires, pelted stones at police vehicles and blocked several roads of Faisalabad, news articles at the time reported.\n\nThey also attacked a grid station and offices of private utility Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco).\n\nPolice chased after the protesters and forcefully entered their homes by scaling walls or breaking open the gates and thrashing anyone they found there.\n\nImages capturing excesses by the police created outrage in Punjab. An inquiry team was set up under directions of then Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to investigate claims that police had misbehaved with women protesters and children. Five cops were suspended at the time.", "lang": "en"}
