The claims are false; they use old images available online about regular pre-election activities. Indonesia\u2019s election commissioner has also said the reports are false.\n\nThis post was shared more than 16,000 times in the first 13 hours after being published on January 2.\n\nIts caption translates to: \u201cNew update. Seven containers from China containing ballots that had been cast for the ballot number one candidate have been discovered in Tanjung Priok port. Each of the containers contains 10 million ballots. So the total is 70 million casted ballots. The containers have been confiscated by Indonesian Navy officials and have been sent to the general election commission.\u201d\n\nTanjung Priok is a port in Indonesia\u2019s capital of Jakarta. Indonesia will hold a presidential election in April this year, which pits Widodo against his sole rival, Prabowo Subianto.\n\nWidodo is officially number one on the ballot, according to the election commission\u2019s website.\n\nThe post features an image of a blue container with the watermark of Waspada.co.id -- an online news outlet based in Medan, capital of Indonesia\u2019s North Sumatra province.\n\nThis other post, which was shared more than 11,000 times in the first 15 hours after being posted on January 2, made a similar claim, although with different illustrations.\n\nThe false claims have appeared elsewhere online, including these reports here and here.\n\nReverse image searches found that the photos used in both of the false posts above were taken from earlier media reports.\n\nThe photo used in the first Facebook post was taken from this Waspada.co.id articled dated November 16, 2018, about the distribution of ballots for the coming election in North Sumatra province.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Waspada article.\n\nThree images shared by the second post were sourced from various news reports about the 2017 elections for Jakarta\u2019s governorship.\n\nThe links to the three articles are here, here and here.\n\nBelow are the snapshots of those articles.\n\nThe final image of the green boxes of paper was taken from an illustration of a stationery business advertisement posted in a local online marketplace.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of that advertisement.\n\nIndonesian general elections commission (KPU) chairman Arif Budiman visited Tanjung Priok late on January 2 in response to the false claims and inspect the port. In a press briefing held after the operation and broadcast by local station Kompas TV, Budiman dismissed the claims. Below is Kompas\u2019s Youtube broadcast of the press briefing.\n\nAt minute 48:12 of the clip, Budiman says: \u201cToday we can confirm that, based on what we have been told by customs and excises officials, there is no information about the discovery of the claimed seven containers. That\u2019s not true. It is also false that the containers were found by Indonesian Navy officials and have been sent to KPU.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
