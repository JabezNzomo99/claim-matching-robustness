The claim is false; a closer analysis of the video found the parliamentarian did not use the Sinhalese word for \u201cArabic\u201d in his speech; the parliamentarian also denied he used the word in the speech.\n\nThe 17-second video was published in this Facebook post on October 21, 2019.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 17,000 times and has been shared more than 1,400 times.\n\nThe clip shows Mujibur Rahuman, a parliamentarian of the ruling United National Party (UNP), speaking at a rally in Waththegama, a town in central Sri Lanka on October 19, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala text superimposed on the video translates to English as: \u201cSajith Premadasa must be made president of this country in order to enable singing this country\u2019s national anthem in Arabic a reality.\n\n\u201cThis is for the attention of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim patriots.\u201d\n\nThe caption refers to Sajith Premadasa, the candidate fielded by the Sri Lanka ruling party-led coalition for the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for November 16, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala caption translates to English as: \u201cBring victory to Sajith, in order to sing the national anthem in Arabic.\u201d\n\nThe post suggests Rahuman claimed Sri Lanka\u2019s national anthem would be sung in Arabic if Premadasa was elected president.\n\nThe same video with a similar claim was published on Facebook here and here, where it has been viewed more than 38,000 times and shared over 5,500 times.\n\nThis claim is false; a closer analysis of the video of Rahuman\u2019s speech shows he did not make any reference to Arabic.\n\nA keyword search found the video in the misleading posts was taken from this longer YouTube video of Rahuman\u2019s speech published on October 19, 2019, by Sri Lankan news channel Uncut News.\n\nThe video in the misleading posts corresponds with the YouTube video from the 14-minute, 50-second mark to the 15-minute, seven-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and YouTube video (R):\n\nRahuman\u2019s statement in Sinhala during the 15-second section of the clip translates to English as: \u201cOur children, in our country ... when we sing the national anthem we say, we are the children of one mother ... It is in order to make that notion of \u2018the children of one mother\u2019 a reality, that we should make Sajith Premadasa president of this country.\u201d\n\nThree seconds into this section, Rahuman utters the Sinhala phrase \u201cara api\u201d which translates to \u201cwhen we\u201d in English. In the misleading posts, this phrase has been highlighted to suggest Rahuman uttered the Sinhala word \u201caraabi\u201d, which translates to \u201cArabic\u201d.\n\nRahuman told AFP by phone on October 28, 2019, that he had not used the Sinhalese word for \u201cArabic\u201d in the speech.\n\n\u201cI never even mentioned the word \u2018araabi\u2019. It\u2019s disgraceful, the lengths the opponents go to in order to tarnish their competition,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nRahuman also published this video on his official Facebook page, dismissing the claims made on social media about his speech during a press conference held on October 21, 2019.\n\nHis full statement during the press conference was published in this article published by Sinhala-language newspaper Dinamina on October 22, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Dinamina article; his comments on the false claims on social media has been highlighted in red:\n\nHis comments in Sinhala translate to English in part as: \u201cThey even twist the things we say now ... A speech I made has been twisted by them and circulated on social media claiming that I said the national anthem has to be sung in Arabic. The speech was made at a rally where I said, our wish is to make our singing \u2018as children of one mother\u2019 a reality. My utterance of the phrase \u2018ara api\u2019 -- they try to claim its \u2018araabi\u2019 ...\u201d", "lang": "en"}
