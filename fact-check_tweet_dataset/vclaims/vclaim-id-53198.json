In the video, several masked, armed men can be seen roaming inside the plane while the passengers have their arms above their seats. Twitter user Primo posted the video with the message, \u201cA plane got hijacked with passengers in Mexico hope everyone is safe\u201d. It has garnered more than 34,000 retweets so far.\n\nOne more user tweeted the video with an identical claim.\n\nAlt News found that this video depicts a \u2018real-scale aircraft hijacking simulation\u2019, in other words, a drill. By looking at the comments below the video, we found an article published by a Mexican news site Vanguardia. According to the report, the drill was conducted in an Interjet airline at Mexico\u2019s Ciudad del Carmen International Airport.\n\nEarlier in October, Interjet had also put out a statement in which they said that an aircraft of their company participated in a \u2018real-scale simulation\u2019 held at the airport on October 5.\n\n\u201cAuthorities from the three levels of government coordinated to implement the protocols for passenger rescue. In this way, the videos that circulate in social networks and where an Interjet plane is observed were recorded during this drill\u201d, reads the statement issued by the airline on October 7, 2019.\n\nThe Mirror UK reported that the airline was forced to release a statement saying videos circulating on social media of a \u2018hijacking\u2019 on one of its flights was actually a drill. The drill video was also reported by Mexican News channel Imagen Televisi\u00f3n.\n\nAirport operator Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, or ASA, a federal government-owned corporation, issued a clarification about the video when it went viral earlier in October. The authorities thanked Interjet and its CEO William Shaw for \u201cthe facilities and great support granted for the real-scale simulation: Aircraft hijacking\u201d. On October 7, Shaw tweeted about a meeting where results of the drill conducted by the airport of Ciudad del Carmen in coordination with ASA were analysed.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of drill conducted in an aeroplane in Mexico was falsely shared with the claim that it was actually hijacked.", "lang": "en"}
