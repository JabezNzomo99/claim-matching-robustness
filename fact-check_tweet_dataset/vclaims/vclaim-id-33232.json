One of these was the claim that there are 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.\n\nThe Statistics Authority said: \u201cWhile accurate as far as it goes, this figure does not give a full picture.\u201d\n\nThis is because much of the increase could be down to rising pupil numbers\u2014there were 560,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2017 compared to 2010\u2014and changes to inspection practices. 579,000 pupils attend schools that are rated as good or outstanding but have not been inspected since at least 2010, and inspection practices mean schools rated below \u201cgood\u201d are prioritised for inspection.\n\nOn Wednesday, the claim was repeated by the Prime Minister at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions\u2014albeit with something of a caveat about the government only being responsible for \u201cpart\u201d of that increase.\n\nHowever, this caveat does not fully spell out how much uncertainty there is around this number. It would be more helpful to public debate if the government made this uncertainty clear, or stopped using this statistic completely.\n\nPupil numbers are going up\n\n\u201cGood\u201d and \u201coutstanding\u201d are the two highest ratings schools can be given by Ofsted (the schools inspector in England). Schools that don\u2019t meet this standard are rated as \u201crequiring improvement\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d.\n\nThere were 1.9 million more pupils in state-funded primary schools rated \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d in England in August 2017, compared to August 2010.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all down to improving standards in schools. The number of pupils in state-funded schools increased by 560,000 (7%) between 2010 and 2017\u2014so the sheer increase in number of pupils will contribute significantly to the number of pupils in good or outstanding schools.\n\nThe Education Policy Institute argues that pupils who started school after 2010 are more likely to have chosen a school if it was rated good or outstanding. It estimates that 578,000 of the 1.9 million increase is down to a combination of increasing pupil numbers, and pupil choices about which school to attend.\n\nChanges to inspection practices may overstate the increase\n\nA more meaningful comparison is to look at the percentage of pupils in good or outstanding schools. This still shows a rise: 66% of pupils were in good or outstanding schools in August 2010, compared to 88% in August 2017.\n\nBut this rise is also likely to be overstated, as Ofsted has not inspected a small but significant proportion of schools since 2010\u2014meaning we can\u2019t be sure if they are still of the same standard.\n\n\u201c579,000 pupils attend schools that are rated as good or outstanding but have not been inspected since at least 2010\u201d according to the Education Policy Institute. Overall, there were around eight million pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2017.\n\nThis effect is driven by a government policy where outstanding schools don\u2019t have to be re-inspected unless there is a significant drop in exam results, while schools rated below good or outstanding are prioritised for re-inspection.\n\nA National Audit Office report from 2018 said: \u201cThe older an inspection judgement, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cexempting outstanding schools from routine re-inspection reduces the extent to which Ofsted\u2019s inspectors see outstanding schools, and therefore the extent to which they can compare with and reference outstanding practice.\u201d\n\nMoreover, changing inspection practices in 2012 are likely to have contributed to an increased number of schools being rated good or outstanding.\n\nIn 2012, the government changed the rating \u201csatisfactory\u201d (the one below \u201cgood\u201d) to \u201crequires improvement\u201d, and \u201cgood\u201d became the minimum expected standard for schools.\n\nThe Education Policy Institute notes that this change in ratings was followed by a step change in the number of primary schools (but not secondaries) improving at inspection in the following year (rising from 48% to 57%). It theorises that inspectors were less likely to give the new \u201crequires improvement\u201d rating, as it was more punitive for schools.\n\nIt accepts that the point above is not a \u201cfull analysis of the issue\u201d. However, it underlines the level of uncertainty around what is driving the increasing number of pupils in good or outstanding schools.", "lang": "en"}
