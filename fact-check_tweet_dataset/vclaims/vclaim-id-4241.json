Sandhya Phadke, a member of the Durga Vahini, RSS accepted the challenge and entered the wrestling ring. Watch the video to see what happened next.)\n\nTwitter user Rishi Bagree with a large following of right-wing sympathisers had also shared the video with the same narrative back in 2016. BOOM has exposed Rishi Bagree for sharing videos/images with fake narratives in the past. Click here and here.\n\nThe video is from 2016 of Continental Wrestling Entertainment in Jalandhar according to a DNA report. It says that Bull Bull challenged the crowd, following which Kavita Devi accepted the challenge and stepped into the ring. CWE is a professional wrestling school started by The Great Khali and these videos are meant for entertainment purpose.\n\nBOOM spoke to Anil Rana, Continental Wrestling Entertainment Office In-charge who said, 'They are professional wrestlers and have no connection to Pakistan. The name of the lady is not Sandhya Phadke but Kavita Devi and she has also gone to WWE from our organisation. As far as I know, she doesn't have any connection with RSS. The other lady in the video challenging the crowd is BB Bull Bull who is going to have a fight soon in Himachal.'\n\nWe also found the same video on the YouTube channel of Continental Wrestling Entertainment.", "lang": "en"}
