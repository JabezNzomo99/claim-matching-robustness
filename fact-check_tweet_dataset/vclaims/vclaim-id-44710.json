The videos pre-date Floyd\u2019s death and show the president mocking his political rivals \u2014 not Floyd.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said of several political rivals that they \u201cchoked.\u201d He then puts his hand to his throat and says, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s done this at rallies since 2016, referencing Mitt Romney, Michael Bloomberg (twice), and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBut after George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody May 25 saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d video clips of the president making this statement have been spreading on social media.\n\nSome versions neglect to include the date of the video clip or explain the context, while others more overtly imply that Trump is referring to George Floyd.\n\nNone of the clips show the president talking about Floyd.\n\nMost of them show a Feb. 20 rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which took place the night after a Democratic primary debate. At one point, Trump said of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, \u201cLook, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He\u2019s another one, he\u2019s going, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe.'\u201d\n\nBut the only part of the video that is shown in the clips is when the president says, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d and feigns choking.\n\nThe words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d have been a rallying cry at protests against police brutality since Eric Garner said them before dying in police custody in New York City in 2014.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s use of the phrase has been noted before.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
