But the document is a forged version of the student council\u2019s usual notices, and the university says no such policy has been announced.\n\n\u201cIf this is for real it\u2019s very worrying,\u201d reads the caption on one Facebook post sharing the forged notice. \u201cStudents at the university of Zimbabwe as part of austerity, are going in with National Parks and going to eat game meat: even elephants\u2026\u201d\n\nThe forged notice provides real contact information for the university\u2019s Student Representative Council but appears edited, depicting a blurry signature at the bottom of the document in a different font size, as if it were copied and pasted from elsewhere.\n\nThe Student Representative Council confirmed that it usually communicated via written notices in this format, but told AFP the notice \u201cwas doctored\u201d and \u201cthere is nothing true in that article\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it very clear to all Students that this message is not from the SRC but a fake message, that is not just fake but malicious, fictitious and frivolous,\u201d the student council said in a statement issued on February 22. \u201cIt is aimed at causing panic among students.\u201d\n\nThe student council said it would stamp and date its future written notices to help prevent forgeries in the future.\n\nThe University echoed the SRC\u2019s sentiments in a statement saying it \u201chas never, at one time, engaged the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority or any Safari operator, for that matter, with a view of sourcing game meat for purposes of feeding students.\u201d\n\nTinashe Farawo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, also said the claim was \u201cuntrue and very misleading to the general public\u201d and confirmed to AFP that the letter seen below was sent to the university last week.\n\n\u201cThe Authority wishes to put it on record that we do not have such arrangements with University of Zimbabwe and we have no such plans/arrangements with any institution,\u201d reads the letter.\n\nEarlier in the month local reports quoted a statement from UZ saying tuition and accomodation fees would remain unchanged for 2019:\n\n\u201cThe university is conscious of challenges that our students, parents, guardians and sponsors, including Government, are facing under the current economic environment,\" it read.", "lang": "en"}
