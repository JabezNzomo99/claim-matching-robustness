Fred Thompson combined his folksy charm (the truck) with a set of conservative principles (less government, lower taxes, more free markets) to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1994.\n\nAnd, indeed, in February of that year Thompson trailed Democrat Jim Cooper by 19 points \u2014 36 to 17 percent \u2014 according to polling at the time by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research.\n\nThompson went on to win the race, which was a special election to complete the term of Al Gore who became vice president, with 60 percent of the vote to Cooper's 39 percent (a 21 percentage-point spread). Thompson won re-election to a full term two years later, defeating Democrat Houston Gordon, 61 to 37 percent.\n\nThe truck played a role for the lobbyist and actor. He leased it to campaign in the state, building his down-home bona fides among voters.\n\nIn the same speech Thompson also pointed out, correctly, that President Bill Clinton won Tennessee twice. But it's worth noting that Thompson's first victory, 1994, came in a tidal wave year for Republicans, who took control of Congress.\n\n\"That was kind of a watershed year in Tennessee,\" said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon.", "lang": "en"}
