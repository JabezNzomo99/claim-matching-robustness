The images are being used in a misleading context; the school told AFP the photos were taken during a school activity in early June 2019, before three consecutive months of pro-democracy protests hit the city.\n\nThe photos were published in this Facebook post on September 17, 2019, by Leticia Lee, chairwoman of a pro-Beijing group called the Justice Alliance.\n\nLee published the photos in a Facebook group called \u201cHong Kong citizens support severe punishment for local rioters, protect Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law\u201d, which has more than 7,000 members.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nIn the background of one of the photos, advertising boards with the logo of NERF, a toy gun made by American toy company Hasbro with a branch in Hong Kong, can be seen.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cAll students at a primary school in Hong Kong have been dressed in \u2018cockroach outfit\u2019, holding \u2018fake weapons\u2019 and looking like they are preparing to shoot.\n\n\u201cIt was the poisonous teachers\u2019 attempt to brainwash them.\n\n\u201cThese children is Hong Kong\u2019s next generation! How much of this do their parents know?\u201d\n\nLee later edited the caption of the post.\n\nProtesters have been called \u201ccockroaches\u201d by police and pro-establishment figures during the city\u2019s ongoing protests, according to this AFP report published on September 16.\n\nThe post includes a logo for the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School.\n\nSome comments on the post show multiple Facebook users believed the claim.\n\nOne user\u2019s comment in traditional Chinese translates to English as: \u201cScary, this should stop!\u201d\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cThe teacher should be executed by shooting.\u201d [This is] \u201cFailed education\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of some of the comments:\n\nSome or all of the photos have been shared hundreds of times here and here on Facebook, here on Instagram and here and here on Weibo alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the school told AFP the photos were taken during a school activity in early June 2019, before mass pro-democracy protests hit the city.\n\nA reverse image search on Google shows the same photos have been indexed for the website of the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the reverse image search results:\n\nThe photos have since been removed from the school\u2019s website, as seen here.\n\nIn an email to AFP on September 18, a spokesperson for the school said the photos of its students were taken at an event on June 5, 2019, before three consecutive months of pro-democracy protests in the city.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language statement translates to English as: \u201cPhotos of our students taken at an activity have been circulating on social media since yesterday alongside inaccurate captions, which do not represent facts. We hereby issue the following clarification:\n\n\u201cIn April this year, our school received several written invitations from various organisations that wished to provide our students with a range of free activities, including shooting, horse riding and leadership training.\n\n\u201cThe shooting activity, which aimed at deepening students\u2019 learning experience, was held on June 5, 2019. The students\u2019 outfit, as seen in the photos, served protective purposes during the training and is not relevant to recent events in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe photos were taken by our staff during the activity, and the equipment was provided by the organisation.\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret the photos have caused misunderstandings among some people.\u201d\n\nThe school confirmed with AFP the photos in the misleading post had been deleted from the mobile phone of a staffer, who took them and sent them back to school via Whatsapp.\n\nOn September 19, the school emailed AFP the metadata of a similar photo showing a group of masked students taken by another staffer at the same event on June 5.\n\nThe screenshot of photo\u2019s metadata shows it was taken at 2:24 pm June 5, 2019, at 10 Lo Ping Road, Ting Kok using a Samsung SM-C9000 mobile phone.\n\nThe address corresponds with the location of the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image metadata provided by the school:", "lang": "en"}
