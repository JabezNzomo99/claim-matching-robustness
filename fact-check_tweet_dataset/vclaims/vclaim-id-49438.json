No, that's not true: This is a made-up statement that has been falsely attributed to the CEO and part-owner of the NFL team and also to other NFL owners in the past.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook on July 7, 2020. The bulk of it read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThis is not a new fake statement, nor has it been exclusively attributed to Hunt. In September 2016, the statement -- with the team name changed -- was attributed to the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones. Snopes wrote a fact check on this claim when it was circulating. A month later, the statement was falsely attributed to Hunt. \"It was an internet hoax,\" Hunt told the Kansas City Star.\n\nBrad Gee, the director of communications for the Kansas City Chiefs, confirmed with Lead Stories that Hunt never made that statement.\n\nIn fact, early last month, Hunt called two Chiefs players, Patrick Mahomes and Tyrann Mathieu, to voice his support of their participation in a Black Lives Matter video featuring a number of the league's players.\n\nA day after the NFL players posted the Black Lives Matter video, Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL, posted an unprecedented response video, saying:\n\nNot only is Hunt supporting his players participation in the Black Lives Matter movement, Goodell is encouraging players to voice their concerns and peacefully protest.", "lang": "en"}
