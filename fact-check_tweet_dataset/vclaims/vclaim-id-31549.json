The ONS does this by converting the earnings from each period into 2015 money. So the figures reflect the value of earnings in 2015, not what they actually are worth now or when they were being paid out.\n\nIn December 2019 weekly earnings averaged \u00a3473.68 in 2015 money, higher than the previous peak of \u00a3473.33 in August 2007.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing to bear in mind with saying that pay is now at a record high. The figures reported by the media represent what\u2019s called \u201cregular pay\u201d. This doesn\u2019t include bonuses, and so doesn\u2019t actually reflect the total average amount that all employees across the economy are earning. (Not all employees earn bonuses, but some do.)\n\nWhen you include bonuses, and look at \u201ctotal pay\u201d, the average weekly wage of \u00a3502.74 is still below the February 2008 peak of \u00a3522.15 (in 2015 money).", "lang": "en"}
