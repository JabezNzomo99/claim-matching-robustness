There is no evidence that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and billionaire George Soros want to implant microchips in people via coronavirus testing.\n\nThe image includes a diagram of the nasopharyngeal swabbing procedure used to collect samples in some forms of COVID-19 testing. An arrow pointing toward the end of the swab says, \u201cInsert microchip here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what Bill Gates and George Soros want to do\u2026. Secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the corona virus,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThe Dems have a bill on the house floor ready to vote on it to require this\u2026. House Bill 6666\u2026. no bull\u2026. look it up and wake up!\u201d\n\nH.R. 6666, also known as the Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, was introduced by Democratic Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush on May 1. The bill seeks to \u201cauthorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals\u2019 residences, and for other purposes,\u201d according to its text.\n\nThere is, however, no mention of microchips or implants in the text of the bill. There is also no evidence that Gates or Soros want to microchip people through COVID-19 testing. Similar claims about Gates have been debunked by other fact-checkers.
