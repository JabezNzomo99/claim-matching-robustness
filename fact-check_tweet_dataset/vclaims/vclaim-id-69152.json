{"title": "PolitiFact - Hoagenson partially right on Missouri's poor road quality", "subtitle": "Does Missouri have the worst roads in the Midwest? Renee Hoagenson, Democratic candidate for the 4th Congressional Distr", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-69152", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2018/oct/05/renee-hoagenson/hoagenson-partially-right-missouris-poor-road-qual/", "vclaim": "Wisconsin was the only Midwestern state to edge Missouri in how much it costs motorists to drive on bad roads, also computed by the engineering society. Wisconsin\u2019s figure is an extra $637 per motorist per year. Missouri\u2019s $604 is second-highest in the region.\n\nAccording to the Citizen\u2019s Guide to Transportation, produced by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the state has the seventh-largest road system in the country at 33,856 miles, and it ranks 46th nationally in revenue per mile.\n\nOne more measure that Buttlar pointed out was the International Roughness Index. The index measures the impact of a road\u2019s roughness on a vehicle\u2019s suspension; the lower the IRI, the better the road. Missouri\u2019s IRI data show 19.58 percent of roads considered not \"good\" or \"acceptable,\" the third-highest proportion in the Midwest and the 26th-highest in the country.\n\nNone of the measures, though, paints a smooth ride for Missouri\u2019s roads. The state ranked near the bottom of the Midwest in nearly all important measures and fell in the bottom half of most rankings nationally. So, Hoagenson has a point that the state\u2019s roads need work.", "lang": "en"}
