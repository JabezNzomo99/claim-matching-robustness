Tim Kaine \u201ctook far more money\u201d in gifts than another former Virginia governor, Bob McDonnell, who was convicted on bribery charges \u2014 a conviction later overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump compared Kaine \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice for vice president \u2014 to McDonnell, who was convicted in 2014 of taking more than $175,000 in loans and gifts from a businessman without disclosing them. As lieutenant governor and governor, Kaine reported accepting gifts worth about $161,000. But much of the money came from political committees for travel expenses and Kaine disclosed them as required by law.\n\nOn July 23, Trump tweeted \u2014 and later deleted \u2014 this: \u201cWhy did Tim Kaine have no problem when he took far more money as Governor of Virginia than Bob McDonald. Crooked Hillary & rigged system!\u201d Trump meant McDonnell, not \u201cMcDonald,\u201d as he made clear the next day on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Trump told host Chuck Todd, \u201cBob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took.\u201d\n\nTodd pointed out that Kaine\u2019s gifts were legal and properly reported. The two men had the following exchange, which began with Todd asking Trump why he loves that Clinton selected Kaine to be on the Democratic ticket:\n\nTrump, July 24: Well, first of all, he took over $160,000 of gifts. And they said, \u201cWell, they weren\u2019t really gifts, they were suits and trips and lots of different things,\u201d all for 160\u2013 Todd: Legal, legal in the state of Virginia. Trump: Bob McDonnell\u2013 I believe it was Bob McDonnell, in the meantime, he had to go to the United States Supreme Court to get out of going to jail\u2013 Todd: Well, they proved to quid pro quo\u2013 Todd: They proved quid pro quo on that one. Trump: Excuse me, Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took. And I think, to me, it\u2019s a big problem. Now, how do you take all these gifts? Hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nTrump gets the dollar amounts wrong. It was actually McDonnell who took more in gifts and loans.\n\nIn overturning McDonnell\u2019s conviction, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that the value of the loans and gifts at issue in the case was \u201cover $175,000.\u201d Jonnie R. Williams Sr., who at the time was chief executive of Star Scientific, gave McDonnell a Rolex watch and agreed to provide a $50,000 loan and a $15,000 gift to help pay for the wedding for McDonnell\u2019s daughter, among other gifts, according to the court ruling.\n\nNevertheless, the court ruled that prosecutors overreached in contending that five \u201cofficial acts\u201d taken by McDonnell on behalf of William and Star Scientific amounted to bribery.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that, \u201cChief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. \u201cBut our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government\u2019s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.\u201d\n\nIn a July 24 article, the New York Times wrote than Kaine received more than $160,000 in gifts, citing the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The group on its website places the exact amount as $161,033, based on public records.\n\n\u201cTim Kaine reported these items on Schedule D-1 (paid conferences) and Schedule E (gifts) in his personal finance disclosures,\u201d the Virginia Public Access Project site says.\n\nThe Times story notes that some of Kaine\u2019s gifts were given by those with business before the state, including four cases of wine from a lobbying firm that \u201cworked closely with Mr. Kaine\u2019s office to create a new system for distributing wine produced\u201d by the state\u2019s small vineyards. Kaine reported the value of the wine at $720.\n\nKaine also stayed for a week on the Caribbean island of Mustique, courtesy of businessman James B. Murray Jr., the paper wrote. Kaine reported the vacation\u2019s value at $18,000.\n\nHowever, the Virginia Public Access Project\u2019s website shows that many of the gifts were from political organizations.\n\nFor example, the top two \u201cgift givers\u201d were Obama for America ($45,075), which was the official campaign committee of Barack Obama, and Moving Virginia Forward PAC ($20,025), Kaine\u2019s leadership PAC. The Democratic Party of Virginia ($10,830), the Arizona Democratic Party ($3,957), Mark Warner\u2019s U.S. Senate campaign ($2,588) and the West Virginia Democratic Party ($1,233) were also among the gift givers.\n\nThe gifts alone from these six political organizations, which covered Kaine\u2019s travel and hotel accommodations for political events, accounted for half of the $161,000 reported by Kaine.\n\nSo Trump is not only wrong when he said Kaine \u201ctook far more money\u201d than McDonnell, but much of what Kaine reported reflected routine political travel.", "lang": "en"}
