No, that's not true: the story was published by a satirical website from South Africa that earlier posted another hoax story claiming Trump was going to send troops to the country. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by News Updates South Africa on August 25, 2018 titled \"'Trumps must not send troops to our country, we have our own soldiers who can protect our farms and farmers', Says SA Minister of Defence - News Updates South Africa\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFirst of all, the fact that the article manages to spell \"Trump\" as \"Trumps\" in the headline should be an obvious hint the site is not a reliable source of news.

And thirdly, it was the same site that pushed the original hoax that Trump was planning to send troops to begin with:\n\nAnd of course the site comes with an \"About Us\" page that says:\n\nThis indicates the story is not true.\n\nWe wrote about newsupdatessa.site before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Donald Trump Did NOT Announce \"I am sending troops to South Africa, and they will not leave until the killings stop and the land issue is resolved'\n\u2022 Fake News: Malema Did NOT Say Whites Should Not Be Allowed in Shopping Malls\n\u2022 Fake News: Floyd Shivambu Did NOT Say \"When we rename South Africa to Azania, we will require all whites and Indians to reapply for citizenship and adopt African names, else they will be loaded on boats and deported\"", "lang": "en"}
