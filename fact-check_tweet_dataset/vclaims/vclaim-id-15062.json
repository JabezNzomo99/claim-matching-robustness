However, similar posts have been shared on several Facebook pages.\n\nThe post can be seen here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe claim has also been debunked by India Today.\n\nBOOM looked up the internet for a list of '50 most honest politicians' in the world but could find any such list. However, we found other rankings over the years which featured the prime minister.\n\nAn article published in the American business magazine Forbes published in 2018 ranked the Indian prime minister ninth on the list of World's Most Powerful People. Xi Jinping, president of the People's Republic of China is ranked first on the list.\n\nIn its list of 50 greatest world leaders published in 2015, Fortune magazine ranked Narendra Modi at number five.\n\nFortune's list of 50 greatest world leaders in 2018 did not include Narendra Modi's name. In fact, the top ten slots of the list has no one from India.\n\nModi had also made it to the Time magazine's list of 100 most influential people in 2017.\n\nBOOM could not find a single list of 'most honest leaders' that was released by the United States. However, we found news reports which said the former US president Barrack Obama felt 'Modi was an honest and direct politician', according to then White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.
