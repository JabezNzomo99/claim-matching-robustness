This is going to affect over 6000 farmers from 26 villages along the border in Baksa dist, Assam. Don't know how many disaster we would see under the Surrender Modi's regime\"\n\n\n\nHis tweet has been shared over 2000 times. On social media platforms, several users shared the same information. The general notion of these posts was that \"after China, Pakistan and Nepal, now Bhutan has also started hassling India\".\n\nBhutan has stopped irrigation water to Indian farmers in Assam. The Bhutanese foreign ministry issued a press release, that refuted the viral claims and stated that the news articles are totally baseless and called it \"a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam\". Below is the press release:\n\nAccording to the communique, the farmers of Baksa and Udalguri districts of Assam, adjoining Samdrup Jongkhar district of Bhutan, have been benefitting from Bhutan's water sources for several decades. Usually, during this time of the year, farmers from Assam enter Bhutan to manage the irrigation channels. However, since the borders of both countries were sealed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian farmers could not enter Bhutan to maintain the irrigation channels. This led to the disruption of irrigation water supply to Assam. According to the Bhutanese government, the indigenous people of the concerned regions are trying to repair these irrigation channels to ensure smooth flow of water to Assam. Heavy monsoon, however, is hampering work. The ministry has released photographs which show how the local administration is working to clear the irrigation channels.\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that the photo in the viral graphic is actually 5 years old. The website for Bhutan's agriculture and forests ministry has posted that photograph on April 20, 2015.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: \"Totally Baseless\": Bhutan Dismisses Reports Of Water Stoppage To Assam", "lang": "en"}
