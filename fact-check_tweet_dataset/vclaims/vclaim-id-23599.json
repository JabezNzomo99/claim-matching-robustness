The sentence in single quotes is actually a quote from Shutteran Wala.\n\n\"I have nine votes in my family but got only five votes and this is shocking for me. My entire street had vowed to vote for me but I just got five votes. I had remained away from my shop for a month and worked among people but they did not vote for me,\" said a sobbing Neetu who also vowed not to contest any election in future. Times of India quoted him as saying.\n\nWhile the article mentioned Shutteran Wala won 856 votes - in the second last paragraph - screenshots of the headline went viral on social media.\n\nBOOM checked the Election Commission of India's website and found that Shutteran Wala had in fact polled 856 votes and not just five.\n\nMeanwhile the seat was won by Santokh Singh Chaudhary from the Indian National Congress with 3,85,449 votes.\n\nShutteran Wala appears to have lost heart after just one round of counting.\n\n\"Only after one round, he got so shattered that he did not even think that there were many rounds left. He cried loudly and was inconsolable. He said that he would not contest the elections in the future,\" reported The Tribue.", "lang": "en"}
