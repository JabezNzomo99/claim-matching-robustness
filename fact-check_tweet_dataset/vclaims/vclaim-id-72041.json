Scott Walker.\n\n\"He cut shared revenue to municipalities, which really strained their budgets in terms of providing police and fire and local services,\" Burke said.\n\n\"And in fact, according to the latest FBI reports, we have seen an increase in violent crimes that's second in the Midwest. So, out of 10 Midwestern states, the second largest increase in violent crime. So, we are not doing enough.\"\n\nIs Burke right that funding cuts to local units of government contributed to such an increase?\n\nEarlier this month, we rated a similar but broader claim by the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The union, which has endorsed Burke, said Wisconsin \"has become less safe than it was when\" Walker took office.\n\nAs Burke did, the union cited Walker\u2019s reduction of shared revenue -- which is general state aid to local governments not tied to a specific purpose -- by $76 million, or 9 percent. That move, made in Walker\u2019s first state budget, was the largest such cut in at least a decade. Walker also on how much local governments could raise property taxes.\n\nAt the same time, Walker\u2019s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits. And Walker\u2019s campaign argued that the state has taken other anti-crime measures, such as increased funding to fight domestic violence.\n\nAnd ultimately, local governments, using local as well as state funds, decide how much to spend on law enforcement.\n\nSo, Burke is correct that Walker cut shared revenue to local governments. But she doesn\u2019t provide evidence that led to significant cuts in law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe size of Milwaukee\u2019s police force, in fact, has remained steady, as we found in an August 2014 . There were 1,362 officers in 2010, the year before Walker took office; a dip to 1,348 in 2011, then an increase to 1,384 in 2012.\n\nAs for the statistical part of Burke\u2019s claim, the FBI includes four offenses in its count of : murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The latest available figures are for 2012.\n\nWe checked FBI figures for Wisconsin and the nine other states Burke has cited when she has made comparisons on how the state ranks in the Midwest. We found that Wisconsin\u2019s violent crime rate in 2012 was higher than in 2010, the year before Walker took office, and higher than in 2011, his first year in office.\n\nSo, whether comparing 2012 to 2010, or 2012 to 2011, the increase in Wisconsin\u2019s violent crime rate was the second-highest among 10 Midwestern states, behind South Dakota.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t part of Burke\u2019s claim, we also found a slight increase in property crimes -- such as burglaries -- in Wisconsin in that period. The rate was 2,453.8 per 100,000 residents , the year Walker\u2019s budget moves affecting local government took effect, up from 2,432.7 .\n\nAs we noted in rating the police union claim, many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one.\n\nAt the same time, there is evidence that more police can be correlated with a reduction in violent crime.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, Berkeley, police departments and crime in medium and large cities from 1960 through 2010. The data suggested cities \"employ too few police\" and \"confirm a controversial finding from the previous literature that police reduce violent crime more so than property crime.\"\n\nBurke said Walker cut funding to local governments in Wisconsin, contributing to the \"second-largest increase in violent crime\" in the Midwest.\n\nWalker did significantly reduce general-purpose shared revenue, which local governments use to help pay for a variety of functions, including law enforcement. And the increase in Wisconsin\u2019s 2012 violent crime compared to the previous two years was higher than all but one other Midwestern state.\n\nBut Burke doesn\u2019t provide evidence that the shared revenue cuts significantly reduced funding for local law enforcement, nor evidence that funding reductions necessarily lead to an increase in violent crime.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
