As usual, the Trump campaign did not respond to our request for supporting information. During his speech the next day attacking Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, Trump repeated the charge that Clinton treated the State Department as her \u201cpersonal hedge fund\u201d with no evidence to back it up, either.\n\nThis talking point traces back to information from Peter Schweizer\u2019s book, \u201cClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.\u201d In one chapter, in discussing Bill Clinton\u2019s role with Laureate Education, Inc., Schweizer describes a \u201cClinton blur\u201d between the activities of Bill Clinton, the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. But critics, including Schweizer, have not been able to prove quid pro quo.\n\nThe short answer here is: Laureate Education Inc. did not receive $55.2 million in grants from the State Department while Bill Clinton was being paid by the company. This talking point actually conflates two organizations that are independent of each other, and is worth unraveling for our readers. So we explored it.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton was an honorary chancellor of Laureate International Universities, which is a part of Laureate Education Inc., from 2010 through 2014. In a news release announcing his role, Clinton said he had visited Laureate\u2019s schools the prior year and found that private universities \u201cexemplify the same principles of innovation and social responsibility in education that we worked to advance during my Presidency and now through my [Clinton] Foundation.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s main responsibility was to speak to students at Laureate campuses around the world, from Turkey to Peru to Malaysia and beyond, about the \u201cimportance of their lives as young people in the world today,\u201d his spokesman said. He also advised Laureate on youth leadership and expanding access to higher education.\n\nTrump says Laureate received $55.2 million in grants from the State Department from 2010 to 2012. We found no evidence of direct grants from State Department to Laureate in those years, or any other point during Hillary Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state. However, Laureate said the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development awarded less than $1.5 million in grants and scholarships for four of its schools in other countries between 2009 and 2016.\n\nThe scholarships were given to students attending those schools, and grants were given to \u201cpromote access to a free and open internet and integrate technology in teaching to enhance student learning,\u201d Laureate\u2019s spokeswoman said. The bulk of the grants were awarded between 2013 and 2016, after Hillary Clinton\u2019s term, the spokeswoman said. Three scholarships worth less than $15,000 total were awarded between 2010 and 2014.\n\nState Department Spokesman John Kirby said in a statement to The Fact Checker: \u201cThe State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network.\u201d USAID directed us to Kirby\u2019s statement in lieu of its own response.\n\nIt\u2019s a reference to grants received by another organization: International Youth Foundation (IYF), a nonprofit that promotes education and employment opportunities for youth around the world. Since 1999, IYF has received grants from USAID, the State Department and the Department of Labor to support its various initiatives. IYF received 13 grants from USAID between 2009 and 2013, valued at $52 million. It also received a $30.2 million grant in March 2009 that was negotiated under the George W. Bush administration, according to the IYF president. It competed for and was awarded $1.9 million State Department grant in March 2012 for a workforce development project.\n\nCritics of the Clintons have conflated IYF and Laureate because of Doug Becker, Laureate\u2019s founder and chief executive. He also is the chairman of IYF\u2019s 14-member volunteer board of directors \u2014 but Becker\u2019s role is unpaid, and the two organizations are independent of each other. (Schweizer notes in his book that the two organizations once launched a youth program together that Bill Clinton supported.)\n\nDid Laureate gain \u201cunbelievable access\u201d to the State Department thanks to Bill Clinton? We asked both Clinton\u2019s staff and Laureate Education, Inc., if there were any arrangements made for his role as honorary chancellor regarding access Laureate may have to Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Both sides said there were none.\n\nLaureate has partnered with Clinton Global Initiative, an arm of the Clinton Foundation, since 2008. But while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, Clinton Global Initiative spun off and incorporated as its own entity apart from the Clinton Foundation, under an ethics agreement between the foundation and the Obama administration.\n\nThere was a reference to Laureate in one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails released by the State Department, as reported by Inside Higher Ed. She wrote to an aide that Laureate \u201cshould be represented\u201d at a closed-door higher education policy dinner. She described it as \u201cthe fastest-growing college network in the world,\u201d which was \u201cstarted by Doug Becker, who Bill likes a lot.\u201d That email was sent in 2009, before Bill Clinton\u2019s official role began with Laureate.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t raising questions about Doug Becker\u2019s role with IYF, or suggesting there was more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye. Instead, Trump\u2019s campaign flat-out said \u201cHillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education\u201d and gave $55.2 million in grants to Laureate after Laureate hired Bill Clinton for the $16.5 million position.\n\nAs with so many claims by Trump and his campaign, we\u2019ve done our part to chase down any possible way that Laureate could have received $55.2 million from the State Department under Hillary Clinton, or any evidence of quid pro quo. We found none; this is a conflated and inaccurate talking point. If the campaign wants to stand by it, they need to give us some real information to back it up, rather than throw out a bombastic charge that is simply not credible.
