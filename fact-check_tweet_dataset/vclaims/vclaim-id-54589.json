Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The person shown in the photo is Praveen Koshiyari, a native of Balvakot village in Dharchula district, Uttarakhand. He sowed the rice saplings (paddy) on the mud-filled street road to grab the attention of Uttarakhand state government about the condition of the roads in the state. The photo has nothing to do with Bihar. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar image was found in an article published by \u2018Uttarakhand News Network\u2019 news website on \u201816 July 2015\u2019. In the article, it is mentioned that the incident shown in the photo took place in Balvakot village of Uttarakhand state during the year 2015. Tired of inconvenience caused by the mud-filled and waterlogged streets in his village, a man called Praveen Koshiyari sowed the rice saplings (Paddy) on the street road. He chose this unique way of protest to grab the attention of the Uttarakhand state government about the condition of roads in the state. Article with similar context showing the same photo was found in a news portal website \u2018The Logical Indian\u2019.\n\nEarlier, when the same image was shared as people sowing crops on the roads of Telangana, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has debunked the claim and has written a fact-check article that can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo of a person planting saplings on the roads in Uttarakhand is falsely shared as that from Bihar.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
