It is a well-known fact that Dhoni was the captain of the Indian team and there is no way he can be appointed as \"former captain\".\n\nAFWA found that the viral claim is baseless and factually incorrect.\n\nHowever, it is understandable why this post has become viral since it expresses the immense love that fans have for the cricketer.\n\nIt was being speculated that Dhoni might announce his retirement at the end of the World Cup. But as of now, there is no evidence that Dhoni has made up her mind about this. On Dhoni's official Twitter, Facebook and Instagram handles, there is no such mention of him calling it quits yet.\n\nIndian captain Virat Kohli has also clarified that the veteran has not told him anything about his future plans.\n\nAlso, we didn't found any reports suggesting BCCI cancelling his test retirement, as claimed in the viral post.\n\nConsidering the fact that Dhoni is already 38, many people think that probably it was Dhoni's last World Cup knock, but his fans don't want him to leave. Soon after Team India's dream of another cup crushed, #donotretiredhoni started trending on Twitter.\n\nEven the Nightingale of Bollywood Lata Mangeshkar urged Dhoni not to retire as Team India needs him and his game.\n\u2022 Dhoni had announced his retirement from the test format on December 30, 2014, when India was playing against Australia. His retirement came in the middle of the series after India lost the second test and drew the third.\n\u2022 He left the limited overs (ODI and T20I) captaincy in January 2017 to hand over the reign to Virat Kohli, leaving everyone surprised.\n\u2022 Dhoni, who earned the fame as Caption Cool of Team India, has also played for Bihar, Jhardkhand, India A, Asia XI, IPL teams Chennai Super Kings and Rising Pune Supergiant.\n\u2022 MS Dhoni is the only captain in the world to lift all three ICC trophies: ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, ICC Champions Trophy 2013 and ICC World T20 2007.\n\u2022 Having featured in 350 One Day Internationals, Dhoni holds the record for most stumpings.", "lang": "en"}
