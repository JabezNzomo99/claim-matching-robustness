No, that's not true: the story was made up by a known fake news website imitating the URL and design of Fox News but it is not true. The same story was published by a different fake news website (the now defunct sundayinquirer.com) run by the same owner almost a year ago but back then it was set in Hendersonville, North Carolina. It still is not real.\n\nThe latest version of the story originated from an article published on foxnews-us.com (not the real foxnews.com) on August 16, 2018 titled \"Tulsa Man Caught Molesting Pig After His Penis Gets Stuck\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA Tulsa Man Was Caught Having Sex With A Pig After His Penis Got Lodged In The Pig's Vagina. David Hern\u00e1ndez of Tulsa, Oklahoma is in police custody after a local farmer found him having \"inappropriate relations\" with a pig on his property. The farmer, not wanting to be named publicly, reported hearing loud squealing coming from the pig pen in the back area of his property. Suspecting that wild dogs might be trying to hurt his pigs, he quickly grabbed his shotgun and made his way out. \"That's when I saw him. I was just in shock at the sight of it. I yelled at the man to get off my pig or I would damn well shoot him. He was screaming saying he was unable to move as his penis was stuck in the pig's vagina.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might have confused it with a real news article:\n\nWe wrote about foxnews-us.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Beloved Actor And Back To The Future Star Michael J.
