Another 10 candidates who qualified for the debates will appear on the same stage on Thursday. Here is how the candidates\u2019 remarks stacked up against the truth. \u201cI am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman\u2019s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I\u2019m the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everybody\u2019s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that\u2019s actually advance the ball.\u201d Mr. Inslee, of Washington, signed a bill into law last year that would require all health insurers to cover abortion if they also cover maternity care. But none of the other candidates onstage would be in a position to pass such a bill because it is a state prerogative. And, as Senator Amy Klobuchar jumped in to point out, many of them \u2014 especially the three women onstage \u2014 have strong records on protecting abortion rights.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s general point is that income inequality has been widening, with the wealthiest faring far better over the last 40 years. However, Americans in the bottom income brackets have seen their incomes rise during that period, albeit at a slower rate than those at the top. According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, from 1979 to 2014, the top 20 percent saw a 101 percent increase in their average incomes. For everyone else, incomes rose by 32 percent.\n\n\u201cI am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.\u201d Ms. Klobuchar was referring to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s bill that would put a Medicare-for-all national health insurance program into effect over a four-year period. His bill would create a universal Medicare program that would cover all Americans \u2014 including the roughly half who are currently covered by employer plans \u2014 with generous benefits and minimal out-of-pocket costs. Private insurers could offer coverage only for services not covered by the public program, such as cosmetic surgery.\n\n\u201cThe reason that they are separating these little children from their families is that they are using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it, some like Congressman O\u2019Rourke have not.\u201d Section 1325 is the part of the United States Code that criminalizes illegal entry into the country as a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment or fines. Mr. Castro is right that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has opposed repealing the law. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, there is no need to incarcerate or to detain migrant families and especially children,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in June on CNN. \u201cBut if somebody is attempting to smuggle human beings into the United States, if they are attempting to cross illegal drugs into this country, I want to make sure that we have the legal mechanism necessary to hold them accountable and to detain them to make sure they do not pose a threat to this country or to our communities.\u201d \u201cI do not think that it should be repealed,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke continued.\n\n\u201cI will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes.\u201d Amazon paid no federal income taxes in 2018. It does, however, pay state taxes, and it does not always come away with a tax bill of zero. The company said in April that it paid $2.6 billion in corporate taxes over the past three years. Halliburton\u2019s tax bills also swing in both directions. For instance, in January 2018, it was hit by an $882 million tax charge related to changes in the tax law. \u201cAnd yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we\u2019re seeing throughout this country, they have been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
