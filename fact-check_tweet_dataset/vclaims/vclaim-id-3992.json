No, that's not true, it is just a scam designed to gain control over people's Twitter account so the app makers can later use it to send or retweet spam or even use it in a bot network for various purposes (sending scams, promoting fake news, phishing...). The app does not work because it would be technically impossible and a grave breach of all kinds of privacy laws if it did.\n\nUsers are lured to the site of the fake app with tweets sent from previously compromised accounts (we archived the site here):\n\nUsers are then prompted to give the app permission to use their account, including the ability for the app to send out tweets on their behalf or change their profile:\n\nThat's a big, red flag right there. If you see an app asking these permissions you should really wonder why it needs this.\n\nUsers are complaining left and right the app is used for spamming people:\n\nFortunately one user already explained how you can get rid of it:\n\nAs you can see in this live running search, the fake app sends out fairly well randomized tweets to promote the app, heavily spamming people's timelines:", "lang": "en"}
