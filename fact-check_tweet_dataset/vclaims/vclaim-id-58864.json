The claim is misleading; the video only shows part of the incident; a longer version of the video shows the worker putting the poster above the opposition party\u2019s poster.\n\nThe 34-second video was published here on Facebook on July 5, 2020. It has been viewed more than 8,300 times and shared more than 170 times.\n\nIt shows a man putting up a poster featuring a man\u2019s face on a lamp post. A vehicle parked next to the lamp post displays flags for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The clip ends as the man appears to place the poster over another poster for the opposition, the Workers' Party (WP).\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cSigh why cannot play fair ..... be gracious to your opponents ... doing underhand stuff to your opponents means you are afraid of them ...Yes ?\u201d\n\nThe post was shared shortly after Singapore dissolved its Parliament on June 23, 2020. A general election was held on July 10, 2020. The PAP retained power in the election, but its support fell sharply, while the opposition made gains, as AFP reported here.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a longer version of the video published here. The clip is one minute one-second in length.\n\nThis longer video shows the same man eventually hanging the poster for the PAP candidate above the poster for the opposition candidate.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the longer version (R):\n\nThe location of the video is Hougang, located in the North-East Region of Singapore. AFP found the location on Google Maps here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the image on Google Street View (R):\n\nThe two candidates vying for the constituency were PAP\u2019s Lee Hong Chuang and WP\u2019s Dennis Tan Lip Fong. Tan won with 61.19% of the votes, according to the Elections Department Singapore (ELD) here.", "lang": "en"}
