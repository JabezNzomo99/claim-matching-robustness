The typical formula for these conspiracies is as follows: Someone in the Clinton family orbit dies in an accident or commits suicide. Official accounts confirm the means of death by accident or suicide. Then conspiracists suggest the \"real\" story is that the individual was offed before they could reveal damaging information about the Clintons.\n\nWe are not surprised, then, to see it again following news of NBA legend Kobe Bryant\u2019s deadly helicopter crash. A Jan. 26 Facebook post follows this roadmap to misinformation, showing what looks like a screenshot of a Kobe Bryant tweet with the time and date \"9:30 a.m. - Jan 26, 2020.\" (The helicopter Bryant was riding in crashed just before 10 a.m. Jan. 26 in Calabasas, Calif.)\n\nThe supposed tweet says: \"I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because Bryant didn\u2019t tweet that. He didn\u2019t tweet anything on Jan. 26.\n\nSearching his account for any tweets about the Clintons, we found one from January 2013.\n\nHe tweeted a photo of himself with former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Great event with President Clinton and @KVBFF for renovation of Step Up on Vine!\" he wrote.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct a typo. Kobe Bryant tweeted \"Great event with President Clinton.\" Originally this story said he tweeted: \"Great even with President Clinton.\"", "lang": "en"}
