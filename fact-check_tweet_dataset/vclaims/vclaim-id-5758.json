This claim, however, is false.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nComments indicate that some users believe this receipt is proof of a donation to the Black Lives Matter movement. Examples of comments include: \u201cWow!! Are white lives ever going to matter? Where does that go,i know to Blm but who actually gets it?\u201d and \u201c Kroger as a company has chosen to support BLM. And can add this as a charge by default.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Kroger told Reuters via email: \u201cThe post that\u2019s circulating with a BLM receipt code is a dupe. It\u2019s a photoshopped version of this receipt here .\u201d\n\nThe original receipt is identical to the one in the claim, except for a \u201cchange shortage\u201d charge which is replaced with a \u201cBLM charge\u201d.\n\nThe spokesperson pointed to Kroger\u2019s response to the coin shortage: \u201cCustomers can switch their payment type (e.g., use debit or credit vs. cash), and through our upgraded technology, we can now load coin change to their loyalty card for use during the next shopping trip, provide coin change at a lane with coins available.\u201d Customers can round up amounts in donations to charities.\n\nFalse. Kroger does not add a charge on every receipt for a donation to Black Lives Matter. The image in the claim is photoshopped from a regular receipt that has a change shortage charge.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
