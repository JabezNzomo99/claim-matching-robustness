It is viral in the context of the first batch of Rafale fighter jets that got inducted into the Indian Air Force (IAF) at the Ambala Airforce Airbase on July 29, 2020.\n\nBOOM was the first to debunk the same video in August 2019, when it was falsely shared as India\u2019s 73 Independence Day celebrated at London\u2019s Trafalgar Square. We found that the viral video shows a flypast for Italy's Republic Day celebrations on June 2 at the Piazza Venezia in Rome. On closer examination, one can spot the Italian flag in the video, and that the monument matches with the Piazza Venezia in Rome, Italy. The Italian Air Force's aerobatic unit Frecce Tricolori (Tricolour Arrows) performs the flyover which is a highlight during the Festa della Repubblica or Republic Day in Italy.", "lang": "en"}
