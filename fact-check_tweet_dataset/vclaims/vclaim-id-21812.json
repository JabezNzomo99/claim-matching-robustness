There\u2019s a guy named Osama bin Laden. Nobody really knew who he was. But he was nasty. He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it. And I wrote in the book [in] 2000 \u2014 two years before the World Trade Center came down \u2014 I talked to you about Osama bin Laden, you better take him out. I said he\u2019s going to crawl under a rock. You better take him out. And now people are seeing that, they\u2019re saying, \u2018You know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden\u2019 \u2013 which actually is true.\u201d\n\nGOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump seems to subscribe to the theory that the more often you assert something, the more true it becomes. In various speeches and interviews, he has claimed that two years before the 9/11 attacks, he warned that Osama bin Laden was a threat \u2014 going to \u201cdo damage\u201d to the United States \u2014 and even predicted the rise of terrorism.\n\nThis claim rests on a few sentences in Trump\u2019s 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d Just about every word uttered by Trump needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Did Trump really suggest that bin Laden was going to attack the United States \u2014 and did he predict terrorism?\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a bit strange that he claims that in 2000 \u201cnobody really knew who [bin Laden] was,\u201d given that the leader of al-Qaeda had already been the public target of U.S. warplanes for his role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. (Moreover, a federal grand jury in 1998 indicted him for his role in the bombings.)\n\n\u201cInstead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, standoffs, and hot spots. We\u2019re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We\u2019re playing tournament chess \u2014 one master against many rivals. One day we\u2019re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis. Dealing with many different countries at once may require many different strategies. But there isn\u2019t any excuse for the haphazard nature of our foreign policy. We don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel for every new conflict.\u201d\n\nNote that he\u2019s not saying the World Trade Center will be attacked again, but merely there will be some kind of bigger attack in the future. This was not a particularly original thought in 2000 \u2014 and even Trump acknowledges that \u201cno sensible analyst rejects this possibility.\u201d\n\nThis line was in Trump\u2019s first chapter. In his fifth chapter, devoted to terrorism, Trump described the type of attack he was predicting: \u201cIn our age of miniaturization, weapons have shrunk \u2014 and the threat against us is suddenly very large. When a nuclear device can fit in a suitcase, and a canister of anthrax can devastate New York, Boston, Los Angeles, or any other American city, the equation has changed radically.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s time to get down to the hard business of preparing for what I believe is the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that he predicted in his 2000 book that bin Laden was going to attack the United States and that America needed to \u201ctake him out.\u201d Moreover, his claims of predicting terrorism in the United States are similarly overblown.
