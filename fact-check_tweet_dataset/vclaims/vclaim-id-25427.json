The passage in the Facebook post is taken almost word for word from the original article, with a section from the original missed out.\n\nBoris Johnson was the editor of the Spectator between 1999 and 2005. Public comments made after it was published suggest that while he did commission and publish it, he may not have personally written the piece. (Leader columns or editorials are often written by someone other than the editor, although conventionally the editor takes responsibility for them.)\n\nJournalist Simon Heffer wrote in the Spectator a few weeks after it was first published that he had \u201chad a hand\u201d in writing the article. Writing for the Mail in 2012, Mr Heffer said \u201cI wrote the first draft of the article, at Mr Johnson\u2019s request.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I heard\u2026that Mr Johnson was in trouble with Michael Howard, I offered to ring the then Tory leader and admit responsibility. Mr Johnson, most creditably I thought, refused to let me do this, saying he was the editor of the magazine, and it was his duty to deal with the matter,\u201d the journalist wrote.\n\nBoris Johnson has since apologised for the comments, saying in 2012: \u201cI was very, very sorry in 2004 that the Spectator did carry an editorial that partially repeated those allegations [about the behaviour of fans], I apologised then and I apologise now.\u201d\n\nBoth the 1990 Taylor Report and the 2016 inquest into the Hillsborough disaster rejected the suggestion that drunken fans were to blame.", "lang": "en"}
