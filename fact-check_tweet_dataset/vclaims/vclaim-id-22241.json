The article \u2014 which has actually been around since at least 2014 \u2014 was intended as a joke.\n\nThe link to the IAU \u201cpress release\u201d in the article leads to an animated Google search of \u201cApril Fools!\u201d And the article\u2019s closing line says, \u201chave a happy April Fool\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAfter it was republished on April 1, 2017, Futurism.com updated its post to note that it was intended as humor, \u201clest anyone reading not read to the end and become confused.\u201d\n\nOther websites though have posted the story with slightly different wording and no reference to it being a joke. Facebook users flagged some versions as potentially false.\n\nEven without the warning, there are several clues that the articles are fiction.\n\nFor example, the IAU\u2019s decision to change Pluto\u2019s classification in 2006 is wrongly attributed to confusion with the Disney character of the same name. In reality, the IAU downgraded Pluto because it has not \u201ccleared the neighbourhood around its orbit,\u201d which is one of the three criteria for recognition as a planet by the IAU.\n\nThe article\u2019s quotes from \u201cDr. Amy Joggy\u201d are also made up. There is no one with that name associated with the IAU, nor does the organization have a \u201cPlanetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force.\u201d\n\nAnd the version of the story published on the Science & Cosmology blog on Jan. 30 included a March 2017 video that explains the real reason for Pluto\u2019s 2006 reclassification, that is contrary to what the bogus article says.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nInternational Astronomical Union. \u201cResolution B5, Definition of a Planet in the Solar System.\u201d Accessed 1 Feb 2018.\n\nOverbye, Dennis. \u201cPluto Is Demoted to \u2018Dwarf Planet.'\u201d New York Times. 24 Aug 2006.\n\nCreighton, Jolene. \u201cPluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet!\u201d Futurism.com. 1 Apr 2017.\n\n\u201cBig Announcement: Pluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet.\u201d Sciencecosmolgy.blogspot.com. 30 Jan 2018.\n\n\u201cPluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet!\u201d Untold-universe.org.
