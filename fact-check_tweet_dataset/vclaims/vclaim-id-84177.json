However, the picture is actually of a Kenyan man and was taken by a BBC journalist covering a hunger crisis in northern Kenya in March.\n\nOne of the false posts, shared on The People's News Africa Facebook page placed the picture of the emaciated man alongside a picture of a man dressed in military regalia.\n\nAccording to the caption, the two pictures show the same person, Colonel Awad Ibn Awuf.\n\n\u201cBreaking News: Colonel Awad Ibn Awuf, former Defence Minister of Sudan, jailed in 1995 by the ousted President Omar al-Bashir and declared dead in a plane crash in 2008 has been discovered alive in an underground prison in a Mosque. African needs self love more than anything!\u201d the caption reads.\n\nThe post has since been shared more than 1000 times and attracted over 700 comments and reactions.\n\nHowever, Sudanese General Awad Ibn Ouf was not declared dead in a plane crash in 2008 -- he is the man who announced the overthrow of Bashir in April 2019 following months of protests in Khartoum. He briefly became chief of the military council that took over, before stepping down.\n\nThe man pictured in military uniform is actually Lieutenant General Omar Zain al-Abdin, the former head of the military council's political committee. AFP pictures of Zain al-Abdin can be found here.\n\nHe and two other military heads also resigned, as reported by AFP here.\n\nOther posts, including this one shared on a private group, claimed the emaciated man was \u201cColonel Ibrahim Chamsadine who was Minister of State in Charge of the Defense in Bashir's government\u201d.\n\nA number of articles, including here and here, also published that version.\n\nColonel Ibrahim Shamseddine died in April 2001 in a plane crash that killed several of Sudan\u2019s military leaders, according to a news article published here.\n\nAnother post, with over 400 shares, said the man was \u201cBashir\u2019s political prisoner\u201d.\n\nThe visibly malnourished man is, in fact, a Kenyan man whose image was captured by BBC journalist Roncliffe Odit in March this year, during a drought in Turkana, northern Kenya.\n\nOdit responded to one of the false posts stating: \u201cI personally took this photo in Turkana Kenya\u201d\n\nSudan\u2019s National Intelligence and Security Service announced the release of all political prisoners across the country, the state news agency SUNA reported in April.\n\nSudan has been rocked by months of nationwide protests that initially erupted after the price of bread tripled, before targeting Bashir's 30-year rule.\n\nSudan's new military rulers and leaders of the protest movement have held several rounds of talks on the composition of a new ruling council, but they have failed to make headway.", "lang": "en"}
