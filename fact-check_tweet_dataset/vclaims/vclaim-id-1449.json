Read about this, and every one of his crimes against women\n\nAs the 2016 presidential campaign closed in on the finish line, the Washington Post published an eleven-year-old tape of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s making controversial remarks about women. The inevitable partisan rancor that ensued largely targeted the behavior Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including the repetition of rumors that he had been expelled from Oxford University in 1969 for raping classmate Eileen Wellstone.\n\nThe allegations weren\u2019t new \u2014 Republican opposition research strategist Roger Stone had tweeted about them a year earlier:\n\nThe backdrop for these rumors was that just prior to his graduation from Georgetown University, Bill Clinton won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, for two years and headed off to England for the 1968-69 academic term \u2014 but he returned to the United States before finishing out the full two-year course of study.\n\nIn October 1992, during Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, a British news report included interviews with a number of Clinton\u2019s Oxford classmates. The article described Clinton\u2019s truncated study trajectory at Oxford as one that was disrupted by the Vietnam-era draft, not by penalties for misbehavior. Had Clinton left Oxford under dubious circumstances, reporting on such a scoop just prior to the presidential election of 1992 would have been irresistible for the British (and American) press. But Clinton\u2019s classmates made absolutely no mention of his departing abruptly or in disgrace:\n\nClinton\u2019s non-completion of the scholar program at Oxford was public knowledge more than 20 years prior to the origination of rumors that he had been expelled from that university for sexual misconduct. And as documented in a separate article on this site, Clinton\u2019s efforts to avoid the military draft (ostensibly by joining the ROTC at the University of Arkansas) were the likely reason behind the timing of his movements between the U.S. and England.\n\nNonetheless, by June 2004 the Eileen Wellstone rape allegation had appeared in the Washington Times, published in an article that lacked an author, a citation, or any other information supporting the claim:\n\nBill Clinton calls his sexual encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky \u201cimmoral and foolish\u201d and said his \u201crelationship\u201d with Gennifer Flowers was one he \u201cshould not have had.\u201d But in his autobiography flying out of bookstores, he doesn\u2019t mention several other women whose names were linked in scandal with his \u2026 He is less forthcoming about, or does not mention, other women who say they were either sexually involved with him, or that they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. These include: \u2013 Eileen Wellstone, an English woman who said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969.\n\nAlthough often unattributed, the claim appears to have originated with a February 1999 article on Capitol Hill Blue (a web site known for publishing dubious information at that time). That primary iteration (since deleted) mentioned nothing about Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford, but it alleged \u2014 based on a second-hand report from an anonymous source \u2014 that Wellstone had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her during his time at Oxford:\n\nEileen Wellstone, 19-year-old English woman, said Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near the Oxford where the future President was a student in 1969. A retired State Department employee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that he spoke with the family of the girl and filed a report with his superiors. Clinton admitted having sex with the girl, but claimed it was consensual. The victim\u2019s family declined to pursue the case. In an interview with Capitol Hill Blue, the retired State Department employee said he believed the story Miss Wellstone, the young English woman who said Clinton raped her in 1969. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind that this young woman had suffered severe emotional trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were under tremendous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of having a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. I filed a report with my superiors and that was the last I heard of it.\u201d Miss Wellstone, who is now married and lives near London, confirmed the incident when contacted, but refused to discuss the matter further. She said she would not go public with further details of the attack. Afterwards, she changed her phone number and hired a barrister who warned a reporter to stay away from his client. In his book, Unlimited Access, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich reported that Clinton left Oxford University for a \u201cEuropean Tour\u201d in 1969 and was told by University officials that he was no longer welcome there. Aldrich said Clinton\u2019s academic record at Oxford was lackluster. Clinton later accepted a scholarship for Yale Law School and did not complete his studies at Oxford. Oxford officials refused comment. The State Department also refused to comment on the incident. A Freedom of Information request filed by Capitol Hill Blue failed to turn up any records of the incident.\n\nThis account doesn\u2019t jibe with the timeline established in our own research and stated elsewhere, which has Clinton in the United States (not on a \u201cEuropean tour\u201d) during the summer of 1969, and then returning to England for his second year at Oxford (rather than being told \u201che was no longer welcome there\u201d) where he remained at least as late as January 1970:\n\nRoger Stone was a primary catalyst of the rumor\u2019s spread. But while he maintained in 2014 that Clinton was expelled from Oxford over a sexual assault incident, he said in 2015 that little to no action was taken. His later reference didn\u2019t involve Clinton\u2019s expulsion and hinged on what Stone \u201cbelieved\u201d may have taken place:\n\nStone also made two mentions of Wellstone in his 2015 book The Clintons\u2019 War on Women, co-authored by Robert Morrow, who was the subject of a 2008 Tampa Bay Times profile which didn\u2019t imply an overabundance of credibility or tendency toward critical examination of Clinton conspiracies:\n\nRobert Morrow is on a roll, talking loud enough to draw wary glances from two women lunching nearby at Macaroni Grill. \u201cChelsea is the seed of Web Hubbell and not Bill Clinton. Would I bet my life on it? No. I would bet my pickup truck,\u201d he declares between bites of salmon. \u201cHillary Clinton was sleeping with both of her law partners, Webb Hubbell and Vince Foster. And she\u2019s a lesbian, too.\u201d Morrow, a perpetually indignant, single 43-year-old, pretty much devotes his life to hating the Clintons and spreading wild, unsubstantiated allegations about them. With no job except occasional day trading of stocks, Morrow spends anywhere from one to 10 hours a day researching Clinton dirt or e-mailing and phoning reporters across the country about his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019ve got other aspects of my life when I\u2019m not, you know, stopping Clinton pond scum,\u201d insists Morrow, who has no steady job but enjoys a family inheritance. Lack of proof means nothing to Morrow. Morrow started his anti-Clinton crusade about three years ago, when he decided he needed to devote himself to making sure Hillary Clinton never wins the White House. He can\u2019t pinpoint what set him on this path beyond his conviction that the Clintons are ruthless \u201csociopaths that need to be crushed and defeated.\u201d\n\nStone and Morrow\u2019s book contained two passages about Wellstone which appeared be be based on second- or third-hand information. Moreover, those passages contained contradictory information: in one, the authors said Clinton\u2019s expulsion or coerced departure from Oxford \u201ccould not be confirmed\u201d; in another, the authors plainly asserted without qualification that Clinton had been expelled. And all of the cited information traced back to the single questionable 1999 Capitol Hill Blue report:\n\nThe original Capitol Hill Blue piece included several instances that all followed the same pattern: A young woman whom no one had ever heard of (in most cases the women weren\u2019t even identified by name) had supposedly accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault decades earlier but had declined to pursue any charges against him at the time. Capitol Hill Blue somehow managed to track all these women down, and all of them allegedly \u201cconfirmed\u201d their experiences \u2014 yet none of them was directly quoted, and all of them declined to go on record or discuss the matter any further. Moreover all of these incidents were coincidentally also \u201cconfirmed\u201d by other people (e.g., government officials, retired policemen, former students), none of whom was identified by name or directly quoted either.\n\nEven more curiously, as far as we know no one else has ever located, talked to, or interviewed Eileen Wellstone or any of the other women referenced in Capitol Hill Blue who were supposedly the victim of sexual assaults by Bill Clinton between 1969 and 1974. Nor has anyone else ever identified, located, talked to, or interviewed the anonymous State Department official and others who purportedly \u201cconfirmed\u201d these rumors.\n\nAll in all, the rumors about Bill Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford over a rape allegation appear to have stemmed from a single uncorroborated, anonymous second-hand report published on a web site of dubious repute in 1999, combined with mere speculation about Clinton\u2019s having departed Oxford prior to the completion of a full two-year course of study. We haven\u2019t yet turned up anything that would counter the notion that the \u201cEileen Wellstone\u201d claim was simply a fabrication made up in 1999.", "lang": "en"}
