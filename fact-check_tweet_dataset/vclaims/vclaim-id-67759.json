(He did make this point in a later ad, which we found to be Mostly True; see it here .)\n\nThe ad also is correct that Obama accepted $222,309 from executives and employees of oil companies, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's worth noting those donations could be from anyone from the CEO to the janitor. People who donate to political candidates are required to list their occupation and employer. It's important to note that this rule is has far from perfect compliance; sometimes people don't fill it in at all.\n\nClinton doesn't mention the fact that she accepted even more money from executives and employees of oil companies \u2014 $309,363, according to the center. And she accepted about $442,800 from energy lobbyists, according to the center, though not all of that is from oil and gas alone.\n\nNevertheless, the ad is correct that Obama did accept money from employees of oil companies, and we rate its statement True.", "lang": "en"}
