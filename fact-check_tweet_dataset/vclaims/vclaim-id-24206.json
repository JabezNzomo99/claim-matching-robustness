As used in this section, the term \u201cadverse action\u201d means the imposition of any tax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to entities exempted from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of title 26, United States Code; or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit.\n\nJuly 12, 2017: \u201cThe evangelicals were so great to me. ... They came out in record numbers. They never came out like that. And we\u2019ve really helped. Because I\u2019ve gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment. Now we\u2019re going to go try and get rid of it permanently in Congress. But I signed an executive order so that now, people like you \u2014 that I want to hear from \u2014 ministers and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You couldn\u2019t speak politically before. Now you can.\u201d\n\nOct. 13, 2017: \u201cAmong many historic steps, the executive order followed through on one of my most important campaign promises to so many of you: to prevent the horrendous Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights. Thank you. We will not allow government workers to censor sermons or target our pastors or our ministers or rabbis. These are the people we want to hear from, and they\u2019re not going to be silenced any longer.\u201d\n\nAug. 1, 2018: \u201cWell, one of the big things we\u2019ve done is the Johnson Amendment. You know, you\u2019re free to do what you want to do now. You couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t talk because you were afraid of a lot of bad repercussion. And we \u2014 as you know, we\u2019ve taken that off. That\u2019s a bad \u2014 that was a bad thing. That was a bad thing that Lyndon Johnson did a long time ago. He had to have a lot of power to get it done, but you now are free to say what you want.\u201d\n\nMay 2, 2019: \u201cOne of the things I am most proud of is the Johnson Amendment. You can now speak your mind and speak it freely. I said I was going to do that. \u2026 They took away your voice politically and these are the people I want to listen to politically but you weren\u2019t allowed to speak. They would lose their tax-exempt status. That\u2019s not happening anymore so we got rid of the Johnson Amendment. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported in 2017 that many religious freedom advocates were actually disappointed with Trump\u2019s executive order. Douglas Laycock, a professor at University of Virginia Law School and an expert on religious freedom, said at the time that the order suggests churches should not be found guilty of implied endorsements where secular organizations would not be. Laycock had not heard stories of that happening but added that \u201cthe IRS does jawbone churches in a way that it does not appear to jawbone secular nonprofits. Maybe that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
