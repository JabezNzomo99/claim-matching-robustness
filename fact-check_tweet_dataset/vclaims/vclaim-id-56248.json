But today is a gift that's why we call it a present,\" the quote continues. Dominguez supposedly said this on April 9.\n\nFacebook user Josh Naz shared this graphic on April 10. As of writing, it has received 74 reactions and 24 comments, and has been shared 41 times.\n\nThe facts: Dominguez did not say what was attributed to him in the graphic, which manipulated an actual graphic of a news organization.\n\nInstead, the graphic is a manipulated version of a quote card posted by the Philippine Daily Inquirer on April 9. It contains Dominguez's actual quote during a late night address by President Rodrigo Duterte that day.\n\n\"Ngayon, itong COVID-19 has hit us in a very hard way. Ang katotohan lang, ang ating estimate natin our GDP (gross domestic product) growth will be 0% or -1%,\" said Dominguez. (Now, this COVID-19 has hit us in a very hard way. To be honest, our estimated GDP growth will be 0% to -1%.)\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
