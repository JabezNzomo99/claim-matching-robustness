Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s stat about the number of homeless and the number of vacant apartments caught our eye.\n\u2022 There are about 63,000 homeless people in New York City, and the number of vacant housing units is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000.\n\u2022 Given the number of families, the actual number of homeless households seeking permanent shelter is about 32,000, and the number of apartments available for rent is closer to 79,000.\n\u2022 The numbers lack great precision but in large measure, the 1-to-3 ratio is about right.\n\nThe math on the homeless count\n\nCampaign spokesman Jeff Latzer told us that \"numbers vary, but there\u2019s roughly 63,495 homeless and 247,977 vacancies.\"\n\nWith those numbers, there are 3.8 empty places for each homeless person.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the sources behind both figures.\n\nOfficial reports back up the homeless count. New York City\u2019s Homeless Services Department\u2019s May survey had 62,147 individuals staying in temporary housing. That stat overstates the number of apartments needed, because it includes children in families.\n\nThe advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless in New York City says the actual number of homeless households, both families and single adults, is closer to 32,000.\n\nTurning to vacancies, the city\u2019s 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey did find 247,977 \"vacant units, not available for sale or rent.\"\n\nBut before we dive into that big number, the survey found another 79,000 vacant apartments that were actually on the rental market. That\u2019s the number Giselle Routhier, the homeless coalition\u2019s policy director, focuses on. Routhier compared it to the number of apartments needed, not the number of homeless people.\n\n\"There are about 2.5 vacant rental apartments for every homeless household in New York City,\" Routhier said. \"But the problem is even worse than the point-in-time data. New York City loses thousands of affordable apartment every year through rent increases and deregulation. Between 1996 and 2017, New York City lost more than 1.1 million housing units with contract rents below $800 per month.\"\n\nRouthier\u2019s way of looking at the city\u2019s costly housing market is very different from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, but the final numbers are reasonably close. Routhier said about 2.5 and Ocasio-Cortez said about three.\n\nMatthew Gordon Lasner, associate professor of urban studies at Hunter College, warned that the focus on math only takes you so far.\n\n\"The comparison she\u2019s making \u2014 no matter the ratio or numbers \u2014 is really a rhetorical device, to point out that the city has the capacity to house all its residents,\" Lasner said.\n\nSo now let\u2019s get back to that big number of nearly 248,000 \"vacant units, not available for sale or rent.\" It\u2019s not what it might seem.\n\nThe total includes 58,000 units \"undergoing renovation\" and another 22,000 rented or sold \"but not yet occupied.\" All told, about 129,000 units are vacant due to one process or another that takes them out of the active housing market.\n\nBut that still leaves nearly 75,000 units in the category of \"held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use.\" These are the pied-\u00e0-terre of the well-to-do, and sometimes, the super-duper-well-to-do.\n\n\"A bit of that is new \u2013 global billionaires parking money in Midtown condos,\" said Lasner. \"But New York\u2019s always had tens of thousands of suburbanites, U.S. out-of-towners, and foreigners keeping apartments. That\u2019s been the case for centuries in all important business and government centers.\"\n\nLasner prefers to focus on what he called a practical figure \u2014 the number of units that could be on the market \"with a few nudges or tweaks of the law.\" For him, between the available and the unavailable vacancies, the baseline is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000.\n\nTaking Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s count of homeless people, and estimating 150,000 and 180,000 vacancies, the ratio falls to 1 person for between 2.4 and nearly 3 apartments.\n\nIf instead we use the number of homeless households, the ratio could get to the neighborhood of 1-to-6 (32,000 households for 180,000 vacancies).\n\nPushing further, comparing homeless households to just the number of vacant apartments truly on the market (79,000 divided by 32,000), the result is 1-to-2.4.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said that \"for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments.\"\n\nThe number of homeless people is about 63,000. The number of vacant apartments is harder to judge, but no matter how we jiggered the numbers, the lowest ratio we found was 1-to-2.4. And the high could get close to 1-to-6.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot push and pull in the underlying statistics, but in the main, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s math holds up.
