Free movement currently applies to countries like Norway and Iceland, who aren\u2019t EU members but are part of the single market, as well as to full members of the EU.\n\nThe head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has also reportedly said recently that he \u201ccannot see any possibility of compromising\u201d on the issue of free movement of people.\n\nLiz Kendall actually suggested as much in a speech shortly after the referendum:\n\n\u201cThe Government seems to want to strike a deal with the EU that allows us to control free movement of people and yet at the same time somehow retain access to the single market, including keeping passporting in the City.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe such a deal is possible.\u201d\n\nExplaining her view on last night\u2019s programme, she said:\n\n\u201cLet's not give up on an ambitious negotiating strategy which allows us to stay in the single market and make some changes to freedom of movement, which is really why most people voted for Leave.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
