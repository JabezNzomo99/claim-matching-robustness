This is a month-old picture from Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nAmong others, Facebook page Hyderabad Star News 72put up the misleading post that has been shared more than 27,000 times till the filing of this story. The page is followed by almost 1.6 lakh users.\n\nThe post is viral on Twitter as well.\n\nWith the help of Yandex reverse search, we found a YouTube video related to the viral image. The video shows the same location and the procession as seen in the viral image. It was uploaded on November 10, 2019, and the title says the procession was for Jashne Julus\u2019 in Bangladesh\u2019s Chittagong.\n\nJashne Julus\u2019 refers to a gathering by the Muslim community on the occasion of Eid-Milad-Un-Nabi, the birthday of Prophet Muhammad. This year, the festival was celebrated on November 9 and 10.\n\nWe found some more photos of the procession posted by Bangladeshi Twitter users.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral image is not from Mumbai but Bangladesh. However, on Friday, a large group of people did stage a protest against the Citizenship Act at Marine Drive in Mumbai.\n\nThe Citizenship Act provides for citizenship to persecuted religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis), even if illegal immigrants, from the three neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.", "lang": "en"}
