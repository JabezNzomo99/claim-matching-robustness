News outlets had already identified the unit by the time Biden first mentioned their role in the operation.\n\nThe death of bin Laden was announced by then-President Barack Obama on May 1, 2011, after a raid carried out by SEAL Team 6 on the al-Qaeda leader\u2019s Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound resulted in his death. The elite Navy SEAL unit often conducts classified missions that make anonymity necessary to protect themselves and loved ones from enemy retaliation.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Biden praised the SEALs for their work in a speech at an event for the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank.

It was just extraordinary.\u201d\n\nThat speech appeared to be the first time the Obama administration publicly acknowledged the involvement of Navy SEALs in the operation. Biden did not mention the unit or team members by name, however.

The claim resurfaced shortly after Biden announced his 2020 presidential candidacy, despite no evidence to support the claim.\n\n\u201cI did not believe that night in May 2011 \u2014 or today \u2014 that Vice President Biden\u2019s comments were in any way inappropriate or that they put at risk the lives of those who conducted that historic operation,\u201d retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis told Snopes in an email. \u201cI think he kept it at a level of generalization that made it completely acceptable in my view.\u201d\n\nMultiple news outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press, had identified the Navy SEALs as those involved in the raid prior to Biden\u2019s speech. An investigation into the deadly August 2011 crash did not find that the helicopter was targeted as part of a premeditated attack.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
