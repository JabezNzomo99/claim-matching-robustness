However, the Bharatiya Janata Party led by the PM has countered the campaign with its own campaign 'Main bhi chowkidar' campaign. (I'm also a chowkidar)\n\nWhen BOOM checked for BBC's fact check on the incident, we came across the original article where the headline states, \"IPL 2019: Chowkidar Chor Hai Slogans Raised At Jaipur Match.\" BBC's story can be accessed here.\n\nThe same image has been photoshopped and the word 'chowkidar' has been replaced with 'Pappu Cong' in the viral post.\n\nHowever, the original photo is not related to the Indian Premier League at all but is from an event by the Indian National Congress (Congress) in January this year where Congress supporters painted their bodies with the colours of the Indian flag and their bellies with the words 'Chokidar chor hai.'\n\nWe ran a reverse image search on the photoshopped picture and then used to time filter to check if the image was online before the IPL started i.e. March 23, 2019. We found that the image was posted on Instagram handles of Congress workers in January.\n\nWe then further looked for the image and found out a video from January 30, 2019 which had the same group of men with the 'Chowkidar Chor Hai' slogan painted over their bodies.\n\nThe video is from Indian National Congress' Yuva Kranti yatra held at Tal Katora stadium in Delhi on January 30 this year. The event was addressed by Rahul Gandhi.\n\nBOOM's fact check on the ' chowkidar hi chor hai' slogan raised at the Jaipur IPL match can be read below.\n\nPolitics Enters The IPL Arena: \u2018Chowkidar Chor Hai\u2019 Chant Heard At KXIP Vs RR Game", "lang": "en"}
