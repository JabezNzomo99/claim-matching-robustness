(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wondered if the headlines were really true.\n\nYes, it is. Red straws etched with the white lettering of \"Trump\" are available in a pack of 10 on the Trump 2020 online collection of campaign merchandise.\n\n\"Liberal paper straws don\u2019t work. STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today,\" reads the description of the straws.\n\nThe campaign told PolitiFact that the straws were added to the online store last week.\n\nLocal and state governments, such as Seattle and California, have enacted restrictions on single-use plastic straws. Alternative straws, such as paper ones, are being sold in affected areas like San Francisco.\n\nThe stories shared on Facebook follow a July 18 tweet from Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign manager, about paper straws.\n\nThe Trump straws sold out on July 19, according to a tweet from Elizabeth Harrington, national spokesperson for the Republican National Committee. Parscale tweeted later that day that they were \"once again available.\"\n\nParscale also tweeted July 22 that the campaign had raised more than $200,000 from the Trump straws.\n\nThe Trump campaign is selling plastic straws. They are advertised as reusable.", "lang": "en"}
