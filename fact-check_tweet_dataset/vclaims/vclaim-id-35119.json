The claim is misleading; the video was recorded by the Associated Press in December 1994, two years after Aquino finished her term as president; the home shown in the video was sequestered by the Philippine government as part of its effort to recover billions stolen by the Marcos family; the home was later sold to a private individual in a sale that was validated by the Philippine ombudsman.\n\nThe 52-second video was published here on Facebook on September 26, 2019. It has been viewed more than 218,000 times and shared more than 4,900 times.\n\nThe clip shows former first lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos, pleading with construction workers to halt the destruction of her home. A logo for the Associated Press (AP) is superimposed on the upper right portion of the video.\n\nThe Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"HOUSES OF MARCOS FAMILY, ORDERED DEMOLISHED BY CORY AQUINO #ferdinandmarcos #marcos #pilipinas #maharlika #ophirians\".\n\nCory Aquino refers to former President Aquino, who succeeded Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 after the dictator was overthrown in the \u201cPeople Power\u201d revolt. She was president until 1992.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same video was also shared on Twitter here and on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the video was recorded by the Associated Press in December 1994, two years after Aquino finished her term as president.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes from the video in the misleading post extracted using InVID, a digital verification tool, found the full video published here on the Associated Press archive website.\n\nThe misleading video corresponds from the one-minute 13-second mark to the two-minute five-second mark in the AP video. Below is a screenshot comparison showing the misleading video (L) and the AP video (R):\n\nThe video's caption states in part: \u201cIn an attempt to recover as much as possible of his allegedly ill-gotten wealth, estimated at as much as five (b) billion U-S dollars, officials have seized numerous assets held by Marcos or his associates in the Philippines and abroad.\n\n\u201cBut Imelda Marcos claims that as the administrator of Marcos properties, the commission had no right to sell them and that the property was sold for about half its real value.\n\n\u201cMarcos said that one sequestered property, a residential lot in the posh suburban Dasmarinas Village, was sold for 215 (m) million pesos - eight point three (m) million U-S dollars - in November 1994, although it had not been determined that it had indeed been acquired illegally.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the AP video shot list with the date circled:\n\nThe Marcos' home was sequestered by the Philippines\u2019 Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), an agency that Aquino created in 1986. The PCGG was tasked with recovering the Marcos family\u2019s ill-gotten wealth and assets.\n\nMarcos is estimated to have looted up to $10 billion during his two decades in power by raiding the public treasury among other means, the World Bank estimates.\n\nThe home shown in the video was secured by the Philippine government and sold to a private individual. Imelda Marcos later sued the PCGG, claiming that the government had no right to sell her family's property.\n\nThe case, however, was dismissed by the government\u2019s Ombudsman on June 11, 1999, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed to AFP in an email on November 19, 2019.\n\nAFP also obtained a copy of the Ombudsman case resolution, which said that the PCGG did have the right to sell the property previously owned by the Marcos family.
