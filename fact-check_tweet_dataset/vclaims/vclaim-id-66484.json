Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and three GOP state senators were brought on by Walker's Act 10 -- a 2011 law that sharply curtailed collective bargaining powers for most public employees in Wisconsin. The measure drew massive protests in Madison.\n\nWhile on an April 27, 2015 trip to Massachusetts, Walker touched on those events during in with , a talk show host who is syndicated on more than 20 radio stations in New England.\n\n\"They caused damage to the Capitol,\" Walker said of the protesters, \"(and) the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run -- the impact on the taxpayers. It was just -- what we found is the Left never stops.\"\n\nWe rated as a 2011 claim by Mike Huebsch, then Walker's secretary of administration, that damage by protesters to the Capitol building would cost $7.5 million to repair. The actual estimate was $347,500.\n\nSo, what about the governor's claim that the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run?\n\nIt suggests at least a couple of tens of millions -- or $20 million -- was spent.\n\nBut the actual total falls short of that.\n\nIn September 2012, there were on an by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections, that the recalls cost more than $14 million -- $6.3 million for the primaries plus $7.2 million for the recall elections.\n\nThe largest costs were poll workers salaries and staff wages. They were borne by local taxpayers, since municipalities administer elections.\n\nIn addition, the Government Accountability Board itself spent $663,000, primarily to process petitions signed by more than 931,000 people in order to get the governor\u2019s recall on the ballot.\n\nThe state board also had previously announced that a separate round of , in July and August of 2011, cost state and local taxpayers $2.1 million.\n\nSo that's a total of nearly $16.3 million, which is sizable, particularly since it hadn't been budgeted. But it's short of tens of millions.\n\nWalker said \"the recall elections\" that aimed to remove him, the lieutenant governor and several state lawmakers from office \"cost tens of millions of dollars to run.\"\n\nHis claim suggests at least $20 million was spent, but the tally was $16.3 million. That's more than a single ten, but less than \"tens of millions.\"\n\nFor a claim that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
