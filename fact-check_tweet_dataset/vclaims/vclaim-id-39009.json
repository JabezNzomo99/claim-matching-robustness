The claim is false; the Vatican said Pope Francis recently fell ill with a common cold; the site that published the misleading claim is not a reputable media organisation.\n\nThe report, which includes several photos of a visible ailing Pope Francis, was shared in this Facebook post on February 29, 2020.\n\nThe article is headlined: \u201cVatican confirms Pope Francis and two aides test positive for Coronavirus\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\n\u201cThe Vatican has confirmed in a statement that Pope Francis and two of his aides have tested positive for the novel Coronavirus,\u201d the article states. \u201cPope Francis missed a planned Mass with clergy in Rome yesterday after showing Coronavirus-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nThe report was published by a website called \u201cMake Comments Meaningful\u201d.\n\nThe report is not dated. It includes photos of the pope taken on February 26, 2020 by the Associated Press and Reuters published here and here.\n\nThe report was also shared alongside a similar claim here on Facebook, here on Twitter, and here on Reddit.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe 83-year-old pontiff was recently suffering from a cold, as AFP reported here on March 1, 2020.\n\nBut the claim that the Vatican confirmed he had contracted the novel coronavirus is false.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that \"the cold diagnosed (in the pope) was running its course, without symptoms attributable to other pathologies,\u201d AFP reported on March 4.\n\nThe statement was released after Messaggero, an Italian newspaper, reported that Pope Francis had tested negative for the novel coronavirus. The Vatican\u2019s statement did not directly confirm or acknowledge the reported test.\n\nKeyword searches on the websites of the Vatican Press Office and Vatican News also found no statements about Pope Francis contracting the novel coronavirus.\n\nA closer analysis of the website \u201cMake Comments Meaningful\u201d reveals it is not a legitimate news site.\n\nIts reports do not have bylines and the sources for its reporting are vague. The site also does not have any description section detailing the nature of the organisation or how to contact the site's creators.\n\nThe false report about the pope was also debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, including Snopes, Politifact and the Taiwan Fact Check Center.", "lang": "en"}
