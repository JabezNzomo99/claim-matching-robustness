The story starts only a hundred years ago, and it\u2019s a complex saga of peace, suppression, resistance, cooperation and violence. Most of that violence is a result of relatively recent political tensions, and, at times, it has been on behalf of the United States.\n\nWithin the Ottoman Empire, there were loosely defined regions where a certain ethnicity was more populous, and Kurdish people occupied one of them. Being \u201cKurdish\u201d is rooted in culture and language \u2014 not in a political ideology. Even under the Ottoman Empire, there were different dialects being spoken by people identifying as ethnically Kurdish.\n\n\u201cWhen the Ottoman Empire dissolves at the end of World War I, you have a number of different agreements that the colonial powers come to,\u201d said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cYou have the drawing of boundaries that not only kind of divide populations based on ethnic and religious divisions, but also are manipulated in order to kind of serve the colonial powers\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nFor instance, when the country of Iraq was created and placed under British supervision, the map was drawn to include a large Kurdish population in the north. Why? Kurds generally follow the Sunni branch of Islam, and the British wanted more Sunnis in the nascent country to balance out the Shiite population in the south.\n\nIn Turkey, Kurdish populations would be heavily suppressed for decades. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of Turkey, \u201chad gone through the Balkan wars and had gone through World War I and saw ethnic nationalism as dangerous. And so, their idea was to create this homogenizing Turkish identity,\u201d Hintz said. This sentiment meant an attempted erasure of Kurdish identity, through decades of killings and displacement.\n\n\u201cAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Syria was under French mandate. Syrian Kurds and other minorities were regarded as strategic assets for the French colonial regime,\u201d Gurbuz said. \u201cThus, their identity was not suppressed. Instead, we saw some Kurdish intellectuals move to Syria from modern Turkey under Ataturk\u2019s regime and start advancing the Kurdish language.\u201d\n\nThat changed in the 1960s, with the rise of a new nationalist movement that wanted to enforce an Arabian identity for Syria. (The country formed after World War II is officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic and has been run by the Assad family since 1970.) Syrian Kurds were stripped of basic citizenship rights, forced to migrate from their towns, and became economically downtrodden.\n\nAfter a civil war erupted in Syria in 2011, the government controlled by Bashar al-Assad pulled troops out of primarily Kurdish areas in northeastern Syria to fight rebels in its civil war. This allowed the Kurdish People\u2019s Protections Units, or YPG, and its political counterpart, the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, to emerge as the dominant ideological and militant force in the area.\n\n\u201cThere is an organic link between the PKK and the YPG,\u201d said Joost Hiltermann, program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIf you go to northeastern Syria, as I\u2019ve been on several occasions, you see the posters of PKK leader [Abdullah] Ocalan everywhere, which can only be there because the YPG allows it.\u201d\n\nWhen the United States needed help pushing back the Islamic State in Syria, it allied itself with the YPG as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. And partly because of that relationship, the United States was able to lead a largely successful campaign against the militant group and detain a large number of Islamic State adherents.\n\n\u201cBut it was very difficult to stomach for Turkey because it was a mortal enemy of the PKK,\u201d Hiltermann said. \u201cAnd so that alliance between the United States and the YPG is something that Turkey never accepted and now is very happy to counter as the U.S. withdraws from northeastern Syria.\u201d\n\nWhen the United States withdrew troops at Trump\u2019s direction and was no longer mediating between Turkey and the YPG along the border, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acted on his long-standing desire to diminish the YPG\u2019s reach. Turkey invaded Syria to create a buffer zone along the border that removed Kurdish fighters. Russia, which has relations with both the Assad government and Turkey, has filled the power vacuum left by the United States withdrawing. The future for people in that region remains uncertain.", "lang": "en"}
