(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNo, North Carolina has not banned or criminalized Sharia law from being practiced in the state.\n\nSharia, which in Arabic means \"the way,\" is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition and refers to wide-ranging moral and broad ethical principles.\n\nIn 2013, the state\u2019s legislature did pass a law that barred North Carolina courts from applying \"foreign law\" to proceedings.\n\nHouse Bill 522, which the state\u2019s General Assembly approved with a 75-37 vote, did not make it illegal for state residents to personally practice any foreign law, including Sharia, but prohibits state courts from applying such laws in cases of divorce, child custody, child support, alimony or other family law proceedings.\n\nOpponents say laws like these, which have been ratified in multiple states and are being proposed in others, target Islam and are, according to the Anti-Defamation League, \"redundant and wholly unnecessary.\"\n\nBut in regard to the claim that Sharia was \"banned\": Nowhere in the bill\u2019s language is it explicitly singled out, nor does the bill declare that practicing the religious law is a \"criminal\" offense.\n\nA popular post on social media says that North Carolina has banned Sharia law and regards it as \"criminal.\"\n\nWhile the claim has some basis, it takes a state law vastly out of context to make it appear as if Muslims living in North Carolina are banned and criminalized from personally practicing Sharia law, when it is, in fact, that all foreign laws are prohibited from being applied in state court proceedings.\n\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
