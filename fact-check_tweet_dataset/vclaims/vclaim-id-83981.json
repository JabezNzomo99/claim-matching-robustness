They first claimed that unexploded dynamite sticks were found at the site and 2 hour laters, they tweeted again saying that they were actually fire crackers and not dynamite sticks.\n\n2 hours between the original erroneous tweet and the correction was enough time for the right wing rumour mills to go to town with this issue. The traditional Keralite fire cracker called \u201cAmittu\u201d became dynamite sticks and the fire become an attack on Hindus thanks to the right wing rumour mills.\n\nFor eg, one of the right wing propagandist Facebook pages put this up with the hashtag #HindusUnderAttack\n\nEven when the ANI News tweeted that its earlier report of dynamite sticks was erroneous, a typical right wing website called lotpot wrote an entire hypothesis as to why it was dynamite and not firecrackers.\n\nThis hypothesis was tweeted over and over again.\n\nEven Times of India wrote an article claiming it was dynamite sticks based on ANI News report and then had to later delete their report. The original URL to their report was =>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Massive-fire-at-Paravur-Puttingal-temple-in-Kerala/liveblog/51761690.cm\n\nOne particular twitter account posted a series of inflammatory tweets and then deleted the account later.\n\nThis is how the right wing rumour mills roll. Question that needs to be asked is, without any forensics reports whatsoever, how did ANI News conclude that those crackers were dynamite sticks? Just because they look big and frightening? If that indeed is the case, it is shameful journalism.", "lang": "en"}
