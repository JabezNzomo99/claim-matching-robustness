In 2016, for instance, The Independent published an article about the video and wrote that \u201cLuciano Pavarotti\u2019s 15-year-old granddaughter Sislena Caparrosa brought an audience to tears following a performance of the classic song that made her grandfather famous years before.\u201d\n\nWhile this video does feature a talented young singer named Sislena Caparrosa, she is not Pavarotti\u2019s granddaughter.\n\nThe Luciano Pavarotti Foundation confirmed to us via email that Pavarotti, who passed away in 2007, had one granddaughter named Caterina Lo Sasso, the only child of Pavarotti\u2019s daughter Cristina.\n\nAs of this writing, Lo Sasso is now 17 and, according to the foundation, she doesn\u2019t sing.\n\nThe answer to your and their question is: NO. This girl Sislena Caparrosa is NOT the granddaughter of Maestro Pavarotti. The ONLY granddaughter he had is named CATERINA LO SASSO, she is the only kid of Maestro\u2019s daughter Cristina. Caterina is 17, lives in Modena, she is a student and, at least for the moment (!), she doesn\u2019t sing.\n\nHere\u2019s a photograph of Pavarotti\u2019s only granddaughter at the premiere of the film \u201cPavarotti\u201d in 2019:\n\nOddly enough, this isn\u2019t the only video circulating on the internet that supposedly shows Pavarotti\u2019s granddaughter singing. While the following video does feature a young, talented singer, this, again, is not Pavarotti\u2019s granddaughter:\n\nWe encountered a similar rumor back in March 2016. At the time, claims circulated that a video showed a young Amy Winehouse singing at age 8, but it actually featured a young singer named Angelina Jordan.", "lang": "en"}
