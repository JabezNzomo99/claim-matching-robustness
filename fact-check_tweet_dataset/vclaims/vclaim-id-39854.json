(Linburg), the registered owner and operator of a private jet with the tail number VP-CSP.\n\u2022 Seychelles-incorporated Autolex Transport Ltd. (Autolex), which owns and operates the private jet with the tail number M-SAAN.\n\nOFAC noted it had identified Prigozhin\u2019s aircraft and vessels to serve as a warning not to provide \u201clanding rights or other general services to them,\u201d as any such service provider would \u201crun the risk of facilitating or supporting Prigozhin\u2019s nefarious activities\u201d and thus be subject to sanctions.\n\nIn response, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the \u201cstupid game of sanctions\u201d had resulted from political turmoil in the United States.\n\nSputnik ran a news item on September 30 claiming related probes into the election meddling allegations had \u201cfailed to find evidence pointing to any Russian interference in the US election.\u201d\n\nRegarding Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russian state media and officials have regularly mischaracterized and/or denied the results of the 2017 to 2019 Special Counsel investigation, popularly known as the Mueller investigation.\n\nAs previously reported by Polygraph.info, former U.S. Department of Justice official and FBI Director Robert Mueller was named special counsel -- tasked with investigating \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller investigation resulted in more than three dozen criminal indictments, as well as guilty pleas and four prison sentences.\n\nAmong those indicted were 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking the Democratic Party\u2019s computers, stealing their data and publishing that information to \u201cinterfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\nIn addition, three entities and 13 Russian individuals, including Prigozhin and the IRA, were indicted for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in order to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d support the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump and disparage then-candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nA letter from U.S. Attorney General William Barr to ranking members of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary noted that \u201cRussian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks,\u201d leading to the indictments.\n\nThe minority members of the U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in March 2018 outlined the breadth of activities carried out by the IRA across social media platforms. The minority members, at the time Democrats, concluded \u201cmore than 11.4 million American\u201d social media users were exposed to Facebook advertisements and on Twitter there were \u201c288 million impressions of Russian bot tweets.\u201d\n\nTheir report also \u201caffirmed\u201d a January 2017 U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016\u201d.\n\nAs for the 2018 midterm U.S. elections, in October of that year the U.S. Justice Department charged Russian citizen Elena Khusyaynova for her alleged role in a Russian conspiracy to interfere in the U.S. political system.\n\nKhusyaynova was the chief accountant for \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d which was accused of conducting \u201cinformation warfare against the United States.\u201d That project was allegedly funded by Prigozhin and two companies he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering, which are also under indictment for election meddling.\n\nThe nature of Khusyaynova\u2019s activities and detailed accounts of funding for Project Lakhta are outlined in the indictment.\n\nA number of news organizations and mid-term candidates alleged interference in 2018 campaigns and voting systems through hacking and/or phishing attacks by Russians.\n\nThe Daily Beast identified Senator Claire McCaskill, a staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the first target of the Kremlin\u2019s 2018 election interference following attempted Russian military intelligence hacks.\n\nAnother Putin critic, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, was repeatedly targeted by Russian hackers. An individual impersonating a Latvian official also attempted to set up a meeting with Shaheen to discuss sanctions against Russia.\n\nShaheen is on the Kremlin\u2019s so-called black list drawn up in response to U.S. sanctions against the country.\n\nClaims also surfaced that Florida\u2019s voter registration systems, as well as the email accounts of four senior National Republican Congressional Committee officials, were hacked by Russians.\n\nIn July 2018, Tom Burt, Microsoft\u2019s vice president for customer security and trust, said that Russian hackers had targeted three candidates running in the mid-term elections that year via a phishing attack using a false Microsoft domain.\n\nThose attacks, viewed as precursors to the 2020 presidential election, are reportedly ongoing.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Sputink\u2019s claim, that investigations into election meddling failed to find evidence of Russian interference in U.S. elections, to be false.", "lang": "en"}
