Police raid caught her and others),\u201d read a post circulated on Facebook group \u2018We Support Narendra Modi\u2019 and was shared over 2,000 times. The aforestated caption was affixed to two images \u2013 the one on the top portrayed the alleged racket, while the bottom image was of a Congress member. The post was circulated on November 14 at 3:05 PM by one Riddhi Pathania.\n\nAlt News found that the post on \u2018We Support Narendra Modi\u2019 was the earliest instance of the claim on social media. Within minutes, it was circulated on two other Facebook groups \u2013 \u2018I Am With JAMMU\u2019S HINDUS \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 100 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u094b\u095c\u0947\u0902\u2018 and \u2018\u090f\u0915 \u0915\u0926\u092e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930\u2018 (One step toward Hindu Rashtra) \u2013 drawing a share count of over 1,300. On both these groups, the post was circulated by one Suchi Devi.\n\nIdentical claims were also made by Facebook page \u2018Modi mission 2019\u2019 however, the post owned its virality to individual shares.\n\nThe same narrative of a Congress MP leader caught in a prostitution raid was propagated on Twitter as well, with a user followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office sharing the post.\n\nImage from China used to malign a fictional Congress leader\n\nAlt News reverse searched the alleged image of the racket, which led us to a website called \u2018Beijing News\u2019. On September 13, 2012, the website published an article titled \u2013 \u2018Wenzhou Police Raid On Call Girls In Hotel 2012\u2019.\n\nThe report included both the viral image and its shot from a different angle.\n\nMoreover, when Alt News contacted Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi, she informed that the party has no officer-bearer by the name of \u2018Shabana Sara Ali\u2019 in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nImage of Congress worker Gurpreet Kaur used as \u2018Shabana Sara Ali\u2019\n\nChaturvedi added that an image of her colleague from Congress Mumbai, Maharashtra was being used to circulate the false information. \u201cIt is so unfortunate that these fake news handles supported by the BJP are first giving a Muslim identity to the perpetrator and second, maligning the image of a Congress worker, Gurpreet Kaur Chadha, by using her photograph,\u201d said Chaturvedi.\n\nChadha is the Vice President of Mumbai Regional Mahila Congress Committee. Stumbling upon posts spreading misinformation in her name, she tweeted out to Mumbai Police and Cyber Crime Branch, Delhi.\n\nAlt News found that one of Kaur\u2019s images was lifted from her website and used in the viral posts.", "lang": "en"}
