The video shows that it\u2019s a free fall ride but converts to a swing chair ride for some seconds before the free-fall. Also, the height of the ride doubles once the ride starts. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the video in the post.\n\nClaim: The video shows a Gyro-ride which has swing chair convertibility and can increase its height by twice once the ride starts. Fact: The video shows an edited CGI version of \u2018Gyro Ride -2\u2019 located at the Lotte World in South Korea. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is divided into frames using Invid plugin and the frames are run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the ride in the video belongs to the Lotte World Adventure Amusement Park, South Korea. The information on the ride can be found on the official website of the Amusement Park. The details of the ride mention nothing about the swing chair or height extension capabilities of the ride other than the free-fall experience.\n\nAlso, when searched for the actual videos of the ride, the videos can be found on the Google Maps page of the Lotte World. The videos do not show the ride converting into a swing chair or doubling its height. Only free-falling of the seats can be seen in the videos. The videos of the ride can be watched here, here, and here.\n\nIn the search results, it can also be found that organizations like CNN and Snopes have already written articles terming the video as \u2018fake\u2019. To sum it up, the Gyro Drop video posted on Facebook is a work of CGI graphics. It\u2019s not real.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
