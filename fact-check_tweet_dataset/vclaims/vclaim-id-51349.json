Unaltered video shows she did not.\n\nThe video, shared over 93,000 times, shows Pelosi sipping water and then answering a question at a May 20 press conference, appearing to slur her words. A graphic at the end of the video suggests it originated on video-sharing app TikTok.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d reads the text accompanying the Facebook video. \u201cShe is blowed out of her mind, I bet this gets taken down!\u201d (RELATED: No, Nancy Pelosi Was Not Removed From The House Floor For Drunkenly Cursing At Republican Colleagues)\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed C-SPAN and PBS NewsHour footage of the press conference and found that the viral video has been significantly slowed down to make Pelosi sound like her speech is slurred. In the unaltered footage, Pelosi does not slur her words when answering a question about President Donald Trump suggesting without evidence on Twitter that MSNBC host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough was linked to the 2001 death of one of his aides.\n\nIt also appears to splice together portions of her answer. A TikTok spokesperson said the platform removed the video, which garnered 37,000 views, for violating its \u201csynthetic media policy,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nSimilarly manipulated videos of Pelosi previously circulated on social media platforms in 2019. In response to those videos, her daughter, Christine, tweeted in May 2019 that the House Speaker \u201cdoesn\u2019t even drink alcohol!\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s office has told other fact-checkers since at least 2010 that she doesn\u2019t drink.", "lang": "en"}
