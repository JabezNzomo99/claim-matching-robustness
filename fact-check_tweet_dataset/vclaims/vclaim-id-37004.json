This video is not from USA and certainly not celebrating Narendra Modi\u2019s win. This video is actually from 2018 Spain tour of Swargandhar, a Mumbai-based Puneri Dhol Tasha group.\n\nWe did a frame-to-frame analysis using InVID, a video verification tool, and then reverse-searched each frame on Yandex. This led us to a post that was titled as \u2018Dhol Tasha on the streets of Spain (2)- Swargandhar Dhol Tasha Pathak\u2019\n\nThen, we searched on YouTube using the keywords \u2018Swargandhar,\u2019 \u2018Dhol,\u2019 \u2018Tasha,\u2019 \u2018Pathak\u2019 and \u2018Spain.\u2019 It led us to a video published by Swargandhar Dhol Tasha group.\n\nThe Swargandhar group had actually gone to Spain for an International Folk Festival held in June 2018. Prasad Pimpale, founder of Swargandhar Dhol Tasha group, told The Quint that the viral video is from their Spain tour.\n\nFurther, imprints of \u2018\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u0917\u0902\u0927\u093e\u0930\u2019 can be clearly seen on the dhols used in the video.", "lang": "en"}
