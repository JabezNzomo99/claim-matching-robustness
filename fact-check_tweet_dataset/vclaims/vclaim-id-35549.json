The claim with the video is that Muslims are being oppressed in Kashmir. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nIn the Facebook post, both the hashtags of Kashmir and Syria can be seen. While some of the users are interpreting the video to be of Kashmir, others are interpreting it to be of Syria. Also, many users are interpreting that the video was posted by \u2018BBC News\u2019. \n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. When these keyframes were subjected to Yandex reverse image search, a search result led to a tweet with a similar video. The tweet had the text \u2013 \u2018Families leaving#Baghouz, the last ISIS stronghold in#Syria.#Searching4Yazidis\u2019. When the same text was copied and searched on YouTube, a video of \u2018Ruptly\u2019 with similar visuals but taken from a different angle was found. The video was uploaded on March 14, 2019, and had the following description with it \u2013 \u2018Footage filmed on Thursday shows what the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) described as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants and their family members leaving their last stronghold near Baghouz, Syria\u2019. \n\n\n\nThe video shared in the post has the logo \u2018BBC News Kashmir\u2019 on it, but there is no such subsidiary of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News. The video clip is posted by a Facebook page with the name \u2018BBC News Kashmir\u2019 that has no connection with the \u2018BBC News\u2019. They seem to be an imposter of \u2018BBC News\u2019\n\nTo conclude, a video from Syria is falsely shared as Muslims oppressed in Kashmir. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
