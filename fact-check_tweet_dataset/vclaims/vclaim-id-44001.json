Shri Amit Shah),\u201dtweeted the Bharatiya Janata Party from its official handle.\n\nIn the live video of Shah\u2019s address uploaded by BJP, at 13:50, he can be heard claiming that no slogans of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 and \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 were raised at the rally.\n\nThe BJP president\u2019s assertion was also reported by mainstream media, including Hindustan Timesand Republic TV.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe United India Rally, where opposition parties came together to rally for a change in central government, took place on January 19 at Kolkata\u2019s Brigade Parade Ground. The over 5-hour video of the event does not validate Amit Shah\u2019s statements. At around 3:04:35 in the full video, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee can be heard chanting \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019, which is preceded with the chants of \u2018Jai Hind\u2019.\n\nHere\u2019s what Banerjee says \u2013 \u201cBadal do badal do, dilli ki sarkar badal do! Jai Hind! Vande Mataram.\u201d\n\nThe chants she made at the end of her speech were also reported on mainstream media.\n\nGujarat youth leader Hardik Patel also made a speech at TMC\u2019s Mega Rally. In the video posted below, he can be heard saying \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 at 4:50.\n\nIn fact, former prime minister HD Deve Gowda also said something similar \u2013 \u2018Jai Bharat\u2019.\n\nIt is, thus, clear that Amit Shah made a false claim accusing Opposition parties of not raising the slogans of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 and \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. Alt News, however, found that the fallacy wasn\u2019t limited to Shah, but was widespread on social media with the help of a fake quote attributed to Aaj Tak\u2019s Sweta Singh.\n\nSweta Singh calls out the fake quote\n\nThe journalist tweeted on January 22 that a statement not made by her was printed in some newspaper \u2013 \u201c\u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0930\u0948\u0932\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0925\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0915\u093e\u0928 \u0924\u0930\u0938 \u0917\u090f \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u092f \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0902\u0926\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u0930\u092e\u094d \u0938\u0941\u0928\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u092f\u0947\u0964 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0947\u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0915\u093f\u0938 \u092e\u0941\u0901\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0939\u093f\u0924 \u092e\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 Such a big rally was organised where the country\u2019s biggest politicians came, but ears were longing to hear the chants of Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram. How can these shameless people claim to work in the country\u2019s favour?\u201d She posted a newspaper clipping, asking people to identify the outlet.\n\nSingh wrote that the newspaper printed the quote from a parody account run under her name. We found that a handle @SwetaSinghHere had tweeted a similar statement, which has now been deleted.\n\nThe quote had also picked up the pace on social media. From a Sweta Singh parody account on Facebook, it drew 11,000 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe claims circulating on social media and the ones made by BJP chief Amit Shah accusing opposition parties of not raising the slogans of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 and \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 are completely false.", "lang": "en"}
