The couple had reportedly separated, leaving the woman in financial difficulties, and as a result, she had taken the video and sent it to her husband\u2019s father in Yemen to warn him of the consequences for failing to ensure that she was paid money,\u201d stated the report.\n\nThis video has been circulating on Twitter and Facebook since 2018 with a similar false message indicating it to be from India.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video from Saudi Arabia of a woman beating her children to threaten her separated husband was shared in the Indian social media ecosystem supposedly as of an incident which took place in India.", "lang": "en"}
