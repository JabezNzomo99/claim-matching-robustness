His father died in an operation against militants. His mother died of shock on hearing the news. He is studying in a boarding Army Public School. Look at his confidence. An exceptionally beautiful video.\u201d Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nWhen one goes through the comments section of the video, a certain user has commented that the boy in the video is Ghulam-e-Murtaza, a social media star from Pakistan.\n\nWhen searched for additional information, it was found that he is the son of a Pakistani singer Nadeem Abbas. While going through his Facebook account, a 2-year old post was found. From this post, it is clear that Nadeem Abbas\u2019s son Ghulam-e-Murtaza has sung this song \u2018Baba Mere Pyaare Baba\u2019 as a tribute to the martyred school children in Peshawar terrorist attacks.\n\nGulam-e-Murtaza clarified through his Facebook account that his father is still alive and he had performed the song along with his father Nadeem Abbas. He even requested people to stop spreading fake news that his father had died. In 2014, Pakistani Taliban terrorists have attacked the Army Public School in Peshawar killing 141 persons that included 132 children.\n\nTo summarise, the child isn\u2019t the son of a martyred Army Officer. He is the son of a Pakistan singer Nadeem Abbas, who is still alive.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
