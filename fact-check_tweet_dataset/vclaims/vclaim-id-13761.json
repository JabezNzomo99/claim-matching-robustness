The picture shows girls in hijabs with the phrase \u201cDown with USA\u201d written on their hands.\n\n\u201cTHIS IS NOT THE MIDDLE-EAST WHERE AMERICA IS HATED AND TERRORISTS ARE BORN,\u201d reads the meme. \u201cTHIS IS MICHIGAN.\u201d\n\nThis picture was taken in November 2013 during an anti-American rally in Tehran, Iran.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama was president, he placed hoards of foreigners from Middle East countries into Michigan and Minnesota, thus the reason for Omar and Tlaib winning those states,\u201d the meme continues.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are two of three Muslims currently serving in Congress. Omar represents Minnesota\u2019s fifth congressional district and Tlaib represents Michigan\u2019s 13th.\n\nSocial media users have shared the photo in the past, claiming it was taken in the U.S. But a quick Google search reveals that\u2019s not the case.\n\nOn Nov. 4, 2013, it appeared in a USA Today picture gallery titled \u201cThousands stage anti-U.S. protest in Iran\u201d and is attributed to Abedin Tahrkenareh, a photographer with the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA).\n\nTahrkenareh is based in Tehran, Iran, according to his EPA profile.\n\nThe photo can be found on the EPA\u2019s website with a description that reads as follows: \u201cIranian female students show their hands with inscription reading \u2018down with US\u2019 during a demonstration marking the 34th anniversary of US Embassy takeover in front of the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, 04 November 2013.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Tehran was seized by hundreds of Iranian student revolutionaries on Nov. 4, 1979, with more than 50 Americans taken hostage. The international crisis ended after 444 days.\n\nNews stories from 2013 confirm that there was a large anti-American rally in Iran that day to commemorate the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover, as the photo caption describes. The rally reportedly included chants of \u201cdeath to America\u201d and the burning of the American flag.\n\nIran annually celebrates the capture of the embassy, as the U.S. and Iran continue to consider each other geopolitical adversaries.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
