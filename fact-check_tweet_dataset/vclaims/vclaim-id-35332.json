This part of the ad is misleading; the video from the facility dates to 2014, when Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama was president.\n\nThe ad was tweeted by the candidate, posted on YouTube, and shared here and here on Facebook.\n\n\u201cAmerica demanded change,\u201d a narrator says at the start. \u201cAnd change is what we got.\u201d\n\nIt then shows a series of clips and images that illustrate hot-button issues including immigration, the border wall, gun violence, and Trump\u2019s relationships with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nAFP used reverse image searches of screenshots of the ad to gather information about the material it contains.\n\nMost of it is from Trump\u2019s presidency, but a brief part of the immigration-related footage -- showing children standing in a line, and lying on mattresses under foil blankets in an area surrounded by chain-link fence -- appears in an Associated Press report from June 2014, more than two years before he took office.\n\nThe AP report says that the footage is from a facility along the Arizona-New Mexico border that held \u201cat least a thousand kids\u201d who crossed into the United States illegally without an accompanying adult.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.\n\nIt is not the first time that images from the same detention facility have been used to criticize Trump administration policy, and the president himself took aim at Democrats over the issue on Twitter in 2018.\n\nTrump has made restrictive immigration policies a central plank of his presidency.\n\nA Trump administration \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy launched in 2018 saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the border before the government backed down amid a torrent of criticism.", "lang": "en"}
