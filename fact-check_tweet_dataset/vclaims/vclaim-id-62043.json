The claim is false. The video, which was created by a New Zealand opposition party, takes footage of ruling-party politicians speaking in parliament and cuts key parts of their sentences to doctor the meaning of the exchange. An AFP analysis of the original parliamentary footage found the politicians were actually discussing plans to require people entering New Zealand to be vaccinated against COVID-19 -- not a mandatory immunisation program for citizens. New Zealand's Ministry of Health said compulsory vaccinations would contravene the country\u2019s bill of rights.\n\nThe one-minute 15-second video was published by the opposition Advance NZ / New Zealand Public Party on its Facebook page here on August 15, 2020, where it has been viewed more than 146,000 times.\n\nThe misleading post's caption says: \"Last week Labour rushed through a law change under urgency to enable them to force our citizens to be vaccinated.\n\n\"Think we are conspiracy theorists? Have a listen to the words from the Minister\u2019s own mouth.\"\n\nThe same video was also shared by the party on its YouTube page here and then reposted widely on Twitter, for example here, here, here, here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe Facebook video was also shared by the New Zealand Public Party\u2019s leader Billy Te Kahika here on his Facebook page.\n\nBut the claim is false.\n\nThe misleading video is composed of footage of New Zealand\u2019s Minister for Housing Megan Woods and Nationals MP Erica Stanford speaking during a parliamentary session.\n\nBut key parts of their speeches have been cut in the Advance NZ / New Zealand Public Party video.\n\nAFP compared the footage in the misleading video with the live footage of the same parliamentary session recorded in New Zealand\u2019s Parliament on August 5, 2020.\n\nMP Stanford\u2019s remarks can be seen here on the New Zealand Parliament's official Vimeo account.\n\nThe session was a discussion of section 7, subsection 3 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill (2020/57) during a August 5, 2020 reading of the legislation.\n\nAt the misleading clip\u2019s 34-second mark, Stanford can be seen stating: \u201cJust to be absolutely clear, this act in this part lays the potential future groundwork for people to be required to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe misleading video then cuts to another scene.\n\nThe misleading footage leaves out the final clause of Stanford\u2019s statement, seen at the 9-second mark in the live footage, where she says: \u201cbefore they enter New Zealand\u201d.\n\nHer full statement in the original footage is: \u201cJust to be absolutely clear this act in this part lays the potential future groundwork for people to be required to be vaccinated before they enter New Zealand.\u201d\n\nIn response to the misleading video, Stanford said her comments in parliament had been misrepresented.\n\n\u201cThe New Zealand Public Party video was not at all representative of the exchange I had with Megan Woods and therefore it is dangerous and misleading,\u201d she said in an August 25 email to AFP.\n\n\u201cBy cutting out part of my comments and questions and using selective responses from the Minister, it looks like we are discussing mandatory vaccinations for Kiwis, which was not the case.\u201d\n\nAt the 18-second mark of the misleading video, Minister for Housing Megan Woods can be seen saying: \u201cBut the critical part of this legislation is making sure it is future proofed. This is a rapidly evolving global situation that could in the future include the requirement that someone is vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe Advance NZ / New Zealand Public Party video, however, has been misleadingly edited to cut out Woods\u2019 comment directly before this statement.\n\nIn the original live video at the 16-second mark, she says: \u201cThis is a framework piece of legislation for which secondary instruments, regulation, will set specifics.\u201d\n\nWoods\u2019 full reply can be viewed here. The question from Stanford that she was responding to can be viewed here.\n\nIn response to the misleading video, a spokesperson for Wood\u2019s office said the legislation \u201ccould enable regulations around the requirement to be vaccinated before returning to New Zealand, however this would be subject to its own legislative process and is not currently law\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe point being made by Minister Woods [during the exchange] is that the legislation (COVID-19 Public Health Response Act) is an enabling framework,\u201d the spokesperson said in an August 25 email.\n\nThe discussed subsection of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill gave powers to the New Zealand Government to create and enforce a specified criteria that individuals must adhere to before re-entering the country.\n\nThe bill was given royal assent and made into law on August 6, 2020.\n\nIt states: \u201cAfter section 11 (1) (a) (ix) insert;\n\n \u201c(x) satisfy any specified criteria before entering New Zealand from a place outside New Zealand, which may include being registered to enter an MIQF on arrival in New Zealand\u201d.\n\nIn the opening 10-seconds of the misleading video, it states: \u201cLabour passed a law change\u2026 They gave themselves the power\u2026 To force citizens to be vaccinated\u201d.\n\nThis claim is misleading, according to a legal expert and New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health.\n\nAndrew Geddis, a University of Otago law professor, told AFP the Covid 19 Public Health Response Act \u201ccannot be used to \u2018force our citizens to be vaccinated\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Health can only make orders under the legislation if satisfied that the order does not limit or is a justified limit on the rights and freedoms in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990\u200b, which then states in S11 that \u2019Everyone has the right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment\u2019,\u201d Prof Geddis said in an August 24 email.\n\nIn response to the misleading video, a New Zealand Ministry of Health spokesperson told AFP that forcing someone to be vaccinated \u201cwould be likely to be contrary to section 11 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile section 11 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 allows orders to be made to require persons to take any specified actions to prevent the risk of outbreak or spread of COVID-19, such as self-isolating, not travelling, reporting for medical examination or testing, it does not expressly compel persons to undergo medical treatment,\u201d the spokesperson said in an August 24 email.", "lang": "en"}
