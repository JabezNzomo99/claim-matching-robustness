(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe could not find any instance of Eastwood saying this statement. It appears to have come from a March 15, 2018, post from the NY Evening News, a questionable website that posts fake news and information about UFOs and conspiracies. We found the article using the web archive tool Wayback Machine as it has since been deleted from the website.\n\nThe post, which is basically one long paragraph, repeats the spurious quote and then goes on to claim Eastwood said it at the Cannes Film Festival during the 25th anniversary screening of his film \"Unforgiven.\"\n\nThat screening took place nearly a year before the post, in May 2017. While answering questions by Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan, Eastwood did speak about how political correctness has changed since his 1971 film \"Dirty Harry\" came out. But he said nothing about leaving Hollywood or that the industry is full of \"traitors and pedophilians.\" Here\u2019s what he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter:\n\n\"It was far-out at that time, so I brought it to (director) Don (Siegel), and he liked it,\" Eastwood recalled Sunday during a visit to the Cannes Film Festival. \"A lot of people thought it was politically incorrect. That was at the beginning of the era that we\u2019re in now with political correctness. We are killing ourselves, we\u2019ve lost our sense of humor. But I thought it was interesting and it was daring.\"\n\nA Facebook post claims Eastwood said Hollywood is \"the place of traitors and pedophilians\" and he\u2019s decided to \"leave\" it to \"fight against traitors with real American patriots with president Trump.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Eastwood ever said this. We tracked the fake quote to a fake news website that referenced an interview the director and actor gave during the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. But he said nothing in that interview about traitors, pedophiles, or leaving Hollywood.\n\nWe rate this bogus quote Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
