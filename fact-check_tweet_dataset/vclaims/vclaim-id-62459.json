An image on Facebook claims the nomenclature for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, translates to \u201csee a sheep surrender.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Ovid\u2019 is Latin for a sheep,\u201d read\u2019s the image\u2019s text. \u201cCOVID starts with a C, which also means \u2018see\u2019 in ancient language. 19 was known as the \u2018number of surrender\u2019 in ancient times. C-OVID 19 = \u2018See A Sheep Surrender.'\u201d\n\nBut the post\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Feb. 11 that COVID-19 stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019,\u201d with the number \u201c19\u201d referring to the year the virus was first detected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website provides the same expansion for the acronym.\n\n\u201cWe now have a name for the disease and it is COVID-19. And I will spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a Feb. 11 press conference. \u201c\u2018CO,\u2019 C-O, stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 V-I stands for \u2018virus,\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018disease,\u2019 so \u2018COVID.'\u201d\n\n\u201cOvid\u201d is not the latin word for \u201csheep,\u201d further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. The English-to-Latin dictionary on the University of Notre Dame website lists the Latin word \u201covis\u201d as one of the words for \u201csheep.\u201d The letter \u201cC\u201d is an abbreviation for the number \u201c100\u201d in Roman numerals, not \u201csee\u201d in Latin.\n\n\u201cOvis means sheep. C is an abbreviation for 100 (centum),\u201d Dr Paul Roche, an Associate Professor in Latin at the University of Sydney, told AFP Fact Check. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard the number 19 as having any significance in this respect.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
