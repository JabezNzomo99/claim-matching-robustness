Sadly, the images of the boy depicted in the hoax video were lifted from a remarkable, real-life young entrepeneur named Jack Bonneau. Jack is a former contestant on the hit show Shark Tank who was once featured in the New York Times for his lemonade stand that turned into a successful business.\n\nThe fake video uses many of the real images of Jack from his 2016 Shark Tank appearance and other media appearances, including a Ted X talk.\n\nHere is the Shark Tank episode:\n\nThe fake video shamelessly uses Jack's images and calls him \"Timmy,\" then hawks what ultimately is a WiFi extender for $45.\n\nThere are many things wrong with this: First of all, you still need to pay for WiFi for an extender to work, so the device doesn't make WiFi free at all. You can easily find WiFi extenders cheaper at stores or online. Also, WiFi extenders don't increase a provider's maximum internet speed -- as the video claims. (WiFi extenders can boost coverage in hard-to-reach spots in your home.) Lastly, \"Timmy\" didn't invent WiFi boosting.\n\nIf that's not enough, alarm bells should've gone off when the so-called \"orphan\" from Detroit is shown wearing a Denver Broncos jersey - instead of a Detroit Lions jersey.\n\nIt should also be noted that the real young man whose images were ripped off in the video is not an orphan at all. In the Shark Tank episode, Jack appeared on TV with his father, who is an employee of his son's company. You can visit Jack's company, Jacks Stands & Marketplaces, here.", "lang": "en"}
