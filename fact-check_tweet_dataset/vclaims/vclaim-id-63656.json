Also, many stock photos and videos related to the same ground can be found on the internet which mention that the ground is in Russia.\n\nTo sum it up, the football ground photo from Russia falsely shared as a football ground at Ukhral in Manipur (Russia).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
