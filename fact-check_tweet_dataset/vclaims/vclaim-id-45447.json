It carries an excerpt from British writer and former communist Philip Spratt\u2019s writings from 1939. \u201cGujarat, though economically advanced, is culturally a backward province\u2026Bengal in contrast is economically backward but culturally advanced,\u201d reads the excerpt.\n\nMany individuals accused the historian of promoting misinformation. OpIndia published an article declaring Guha \u201cgot history wrong\u201d because OpIndia, which wishes to establish itself as a fact-checking organisation, was unable to trace the excerpt quoted in the tweet.\n\nOpIndia further attempted to dismiss Guha\u2019s tweet by mentioning that Gujarat came into existence as a state in 1960. This was an attempt to claim that the word \u2018Gujarat\u2019 could not have been used before 1960. The same was highlighted by several others.\n\nChief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani responded to Guha\u2019s tweet saying, \u201cEarlier it was the British who tried to divide and rule. Now it is a group of elites who want to divide Indians.\u201d\n\nTimes Now covered the historian\u2019s tweet quoting Philip Spratt, ensuring that it crosses the bounds of social media to national television. As of this writing, Times Now put out at least 45 tweets on the topic while attempting to trend the hashtags #LobbyDividesIndia and #GuhaDividesIndia.\n\nTwo separate claims were raised by those who accused Ram Guha of circulating misinformation \u2014\n\n1. No such excerpt was penned by Philip Spratt in 1939.\n\n2. Philip Spratt could not have made a reference to Gujarat in 1939 since the state came into existence only in 1960.\n\n1. Excerpt from Philip Spratt\u2019s book \u2018Gandhism: An Analysis\u2019 published in 1939.\n\nOn page 2 of the book, Spratt wrote, \u201cGujarat accordingly, though economically advanced, is culturally a backward province.\u201d He further wrote that the Kathiawad region was entirely medieval. On page 32, he compared Bengal with Gujarat and wrote that the former is \u201ceconomically backward but culturally advanced.\u201d Present-day Gujarat was part of the Bombay Presidency under British colonial rule when the book was released.\n\nSeeing that the quote even irked politicians holding office, Guha tweeted, \u201cReserve your praise or your anger for the ghost of the person being quoted.\u201d\n\n2. Gujarat was referred by its state name before it came into existence in 1960.\n\nNot only Philip Spratt but Indian revolutionaries have also referred to Gujarat by its state name before 1960. The Indian National Anthem by Rabindranath Tagore was first sung in 1911. It has the word \u2018Gujarat\u2019 in the lyrics.\n\nMahatama Gandhi had penned a letter in 1948 addressed to the \u201cpeople of Gujarat\u201d. The letter can be found among the \u2018Selected Works of Mahatma Gandhi : Vol \u2013 4\u2019 archived on the website of Gandhi Sevgram Ashram.\n\nThere are many such letters where Gandhi had made references to Gujarat. We found a collection of letters on archive.org, written by Gandhi to Sardar Patel before independence. The letters were collected by Navjivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad.\n\nThe Indian National Congress also had a Gujarat committee which was formed in 1920 and Patel was its first president. The letter below can be found on archive.org.\n\nAn official document (1880) of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency under British rule makes several references to Gujarat. So does the 1911 census report.\n\nTherefore, Ram Guha, who was accused of promoting misinformation, was ironically targetted with misinformation. Those offended by his tweet either claimed that he has falsely quoted Philip Spratt or directed their anger at him instead of the original author.\n\n[Update: The reference to the Indian National Anthem was added to the report on June 12, 2020. It was pointed out was Twitter handle @Mediarama2.]", "lang": "en"}
