FactCheck.org called the number \u201cbogus\u201d because the McCain campaign failed to account for taxable income (i.e., the deductions, exemptions and so forth that reduce the amount of income subject to taxes.)\n\nIn reality, the level of taxable income that could be affected was $42,000 \u2014 though that really meant a tax hike of just $15 for a single person; married couples filed joint taxes would not be affected until income reached $90,000.\n\nThe NRSC thus wins some points for at least adjusting the figure to $42,000 (as the McCain campaign eventually did). But this claim still has problems.\n\nFirst of all, the vote in question concerns a nonbinding budget blueprint. There never was a vote on an actual tax plan that year, but the blueprint called for repealing the tax cuts originally enacted by George W. Bush. (Regular readers may recall that the Bush tax cuts were originally designed to expire after 10 years; this blueprint called for ending them earlier.)\n\nBrad Dayspring, NRSC spokesman, correctly notes that Democrats have repeatedly run ads attacking Republicans for voting for a Medicare plan as part of a nonbinding budget resolution. The Fact Checker has regularly criticized the ads, especially over the fact that the GOP Medicare plan has changed significantly over the years and yet the attacks ads hark back to the original 2011 version.\n\nThat\u2019s also the problem with highlighting this particular vote. Eventually, in 2012, President Obama and Congress struck a deal to permanently extend the Bush tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans making more than $400,000 a year. Braley voted for that agreement \u2014 which means that earlier vote is completely irrelevant.\n\n\u201cVoters should be aware of Bruce Braley\u2019s record \u2014 his entire record, be it votes in \u201908, \u201910\u2019 \u201912 or \u201914 \u2014 which includes support for tax increases,\u201d Dayspring said \u201cIt isn\u2019t a secret that Bruce Braley, like Barack Obama, believes that higher taxes are needed to pay for more federal government programs that both they support.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, while the ad says Braley is \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for Iowa, the person he is seeking to replace, Sen. Tom Harkin (D), also voted for the 2008 budget resolution attacked in the ad.\n\nThere should be a statute of limitations on certain votes. The NRSC reaches back six years to cite a vote on a nonbinding budget resolution, without acknowledging that a) the issue is now dead and b) Braley voted for a bill that actually kept the tax cuts in place for people making $42,000.", "lang": "en"}
