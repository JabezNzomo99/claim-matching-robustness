Two Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers and two Chinese H-6 strategic bombers were flying over the Sea of Japan, accompanied by early warning aircraft, a Russian A-50 and a Chinese KJ-2000, when South Korean Air Force jets intercepted them for allegedly violating Republic of Korea airspace near the disputed Dokdo (in Korean) or Takeshima (in Japanese) islands.\n\nAccording to Seoul, the South Korean planes, including F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, fired 360 cannon rounds and ten flares at the A-50, which they identified as the plane that had committed the violation.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry denied such an incident had taken place, saying that the route was pre-planned and over neutral waters. They also denied that any rounds had been fired. While it is difficult to independently verify exactly what happened, the South Korean side would be unlikely to admit to firing warning shots, an arguably extreme response to such a violation, if their planes had not actually opened fire.\n\nJapan claims the islands, which are physically occupied by South Korea, as its own, and lodged formal complaints against both Russia and South Korea over the incident. Japan\u2019s Foreign Minister Taro Kono said that it was Japan\u2019s responsibility to secure the airspace over the islands since Tokyo considers them a Japanese territory. However, according to the Japan Times, the Japanese Defense Force has no air defense identification zone over the islands, since they are \u201coccupied\u201d by the Republic of Korea.\n\nTo make matters ever more confusing, on June 24, South Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Do-Han claimed that a Russian military attach\u00e9 in Seoul had apologized for the incident, blaming it on a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d and promising that they would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to avoid such incidents in the future. However, that same day, Interfax reported that Russia\u2019s military attach\u00e9 in Seoul, Dmitry Bannikov, denied making such an apology.\n\nWith three sides disputing the details of the incident, it is hard to tell exactly what happened. There is strong evidence the South Korean fighters did open fire, given that Seoul officials reported that they had, as did Japan in its complaint against the Republic of Korea. It is unlikely that the South Korean pilots would have fired had they not strongly believed Korean airspace had been violated. However, the severity and duration of that incursion is unknown.\n\nChina has made no official statement in regards to the incident. However, the Xinhua agency reported on July 23 quoted Sergei Kobylash, commander of the Russian aerospace forces' long-range aviation as admitting the incident did take place, and saying the South Korean pilot\u2019s actions were \u201cunlawful and dangerous\u201d and calling them an \u201caerial hooliganism.\u201d Kobylash denied the incident involved a \u201cwarning fire\u201d from the South Korean fighters.\n\nIn an analogous case from 2015, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Su-24 fighter-bomber over Syria after it had allegedly violated Turkish airspace. While, contrary to Russian Defense Ministry claims that their plane hadn\u2019t done so, data showed that it had indeed violated Turkish airspace, but only for 17 seconds. Turkish aircraft engaged and shot down the Russian fighter-bomber afterwards, while it was in Syrian airspace.", "lang": "en"}
