The accompanying text from the person who tweeted it says: \u201cA team of people were paid to produce this\u201d.\n\nThe advert is not real and wasn\u2019t produced by the Conservatives. An artist called Foka Wolf seems to have claimed responsibility for a number of similar mock ads seen on the underground, including the one in the viral tweet. An interview with the artist in Time Out from May says that he\u2019s based in Birmingham and that he describes his work as \u201c\u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018IRL trolling\u2019\u201d.\n\nEagle-eyed readers may have spotted a few other clues that the advert wasn\u2019t all it seemed. For one, Transport for London, which is responsible for the London Underground, doesn\u2019t allow adverts that promote \u201ca party political cause or electioneering\u201d.\n\nOther clues are the fact that the advert clearly isn\u2019t the correct size for the tube car panel it\u2019s stuck to, as well as the unfortunate wording used.
