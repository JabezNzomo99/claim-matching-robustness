FEMA states on its website that it is not currently offering assistance to individuals and families affected by coronavirus.\n\nIn late March, President Donald Trump signed into law a stimulus package that included direct payments of $1,200 to many Americans, a move meant to help alleviate the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers and Americans have called for a second round of stimulus payments, and claims related to such a development have surfaced on social media.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims Americans can apply for a second, $1,000 payment from FEMA through a provided link, saying, \u201cMake sure you guys fill out the application for FEMA assistance so you can get that $1000 check next week. Everyone can get a FEMA Check Follow The Link ASAP.\u201d\n\nBut the supposed application link is a hoax. The provided link directs people to an image of a gorilla with its middle finger extended, not an application on the FEMA website. The image has previously been used in a false claim related to stimulus payments.\n\nWhen asked about the claim, a FEMA spokesperson directed the Daily Caller News Foundation to the \u201cCoronavirus Rumor Control\u201d section of the agency\u2019s website. FEMA states there, \u201cScammers are using COVID-19 to take advantage of people. Don\u2019t trust anyone who tells you they can get you money now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this time, there is no assistance available through FEMA to individuals and families affected by coronavirus,\u201d the agency says in another section of its website. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Won\u2019t Send Coronavirus Stimulus Checks To People Who Tweet \u2018#NotMyPresident\u2019?)\n\nThe House passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, which would authorize a second round of stimulus payments, in May, according to CBS News. It has not passed the Senate at the time of publication.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
