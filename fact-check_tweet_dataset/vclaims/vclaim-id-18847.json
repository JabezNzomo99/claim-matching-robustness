This time, it ensnared a member of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nSome hoaxes are built to last. And one such monument to digital deception has had a resurgence recently, duping several high-profile figures including Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\n\nThe hoax dates back to at least 2012, when the myth-busting site Snopes first debunked it. Then there was a comeback in 2015 and 2016, when the Los Angeles Times and the Guardian wrote about it. And now, again, it\u2019s circulating widely on social media.\n\nThe claim warns Instagram users that the platform will be implementing a new \u201crule\u201d allowing the social network to \u201cuse your photos.\u201d It tells users that if they post a statement rescinding permission, the supposed \u201crule\u201d won\u2019t apply to them.\n\nBut Instagram already has the right to \u201cuse\u201d photos uploaded to the site. The \u201cterms of use\u201d for Instagram state, in part: \u201c[W]hen you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).\u201d\n\nAsked if posting an opt-out statement would have any effect on the site\u2019s \u201cterms of use,\u201d an Instagram spokeswoman told us in an email: \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to this post.\u201d Adam Moserri, head of Instagram, said something similar on Twitter earlier this week.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop users on both Instagram and Facebook (which owns Instagram) from posting the bogus block of text, though. Among them was Perry, who posted the text on his personal Instagram account and highlighted the post on his personal Twitter account. Although the energy secretary apparently took down the Instagram post, he later uploaded a spoof of the hoax.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
