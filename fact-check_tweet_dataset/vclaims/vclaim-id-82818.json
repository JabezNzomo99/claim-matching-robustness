It still had very bad provisions. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So okay, I held my nose. I voted for it,\u201d she said. A final version never emerged that year, but in 2005, when a similar bankruptcy bill neared final passage, Clinton opposed it.\n\nIn her 2001 statement on the floor of the Senate, Clinton acknowledged that she was \u201ca strong critic of the bill that passed out of the 106th Congress because I did not believe it provided a balanced approach to bankruptcy reform.\u201d But she ticked off a number of amendments that she said had been added to protect women, including allowing women to collect child support payments after the father has declared bankruptcy, making it a \u201cfirst priority\u201d during bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear \u2014 I will not vote for final passage of this bill if it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and it is making progress towards reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this amendment may have provided some political cover, it offers virtually no financial help to single mothers, since the overwhelming majority of ex-husbands don\u2019t pay anything in distributions during bankruptcy,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cOf far more importance was the fact that the bill would permit credit card companies to compete with women after bankruptcy for their ex-husbands\u2019 limited income, and this provision remained unchanged in the 1998 and 2001 versions of the bill. Senator Clinton claimed that the bill improved circumstances for single mothers, but her view was not shared by any women\u2019s groups or consumer groups.\u201d\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), for instance, said: \u201cWhile I have concerns over many of this bill\u2019s provisions, I hope they can be dealt with in conference or in future legislation. This bill should be strengthened in conference, not weakened as has happened to other versions of bankruptcy legislation. I will closely examine a conference agreement with this in mind before voting to send this legislation to the President.\u201d\n\nStill, as Warren noted, virtually every consumer group opposed the bill at the time. The news media also portrayed the vote as a triumph for well-heeled financial lobbyists. \u201cMoney interests prevailed over the public interest,\u201d wrote columnist David Broder in The Washington Post. Former senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, at the time head of the Consumer Federation of America, was quoted as saying: \u201cThe cries, claims and concerns of vulnerable Americans who have suffered a financial emergency have been drowned out by the political might of the credit card industry.\u201d\n\nThe bill actually never came back to the Senate for a final vote in that Congress. But Republican victories in the 2004 elections gave the bill new momentum, and when it came up for a final vote in the Senate, Clinton (as well as almost all of the other female Democratic senators) were in opposition.\n\nClinton missed the vote because her husband was in the hospital but she issued a statement decrying it. In particular, she said the bill did not take into account \u201csignificant changes that have taken place in our national economy\u201d since the Senate had last considered the bill in 2001, because Republicans had joined together to reject Democratic amendments. At least one of the amendments she had won in 2001 was also dropped from the bill.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack some of the politics. In 2001, the Senate was evenly split, with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats, so Republicans needed to work with Democrats such as Clinton to advance legislation. After the 2004 elections, Republicans had 55 seats in the chamber, making compromise less necessary. Thus Clinton had less incentive to back a bill that was being rammed through Congress.\n\nOne could suspect, as Warren did in 2003, that contributions made Clinton more sympathetic to the financial industry as a newly elected senator. But Clinton argues that she voted to advance the bill \u2014 \u201cheld my nose\u201d \u2014 as part of an agreement to make the bill better. Warren says the main provision touted by Clinton was only a fig leaf, but we have no idea of how Clinton might have voted on final passage in 2001 because the bill did not come up for a final vote that legislative session.", "lang": "en"}
