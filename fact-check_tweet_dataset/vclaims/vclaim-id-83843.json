The post, which has been viewed thousands of times, is misleading. The footage is almost four years old and was shot after Jokowi was first elected president.\n\nShared to Facebook on December 29, 2018, the post features a clip by local broadcaster SCTV with a caption that translates as: \"Jokowi gives out money in Ngawi, December 25, 2018.\u201d\n\nIt was viewed more than 1,500 times in the week after it was posted.\n\nThe logo of SCTV news program Liputan 6 can be seen at the bottom-left of the video.\n\nThe post was shared by the Facebook page \u201cGerakan Emak-Emak untuk 2019 Prabowo-Sandi\u201d (The Movement of Mothers for Prabowo-Sandi in 2019).\n\nThat page supports Prabowo Subianto, Widodo\u2019s sole rival in presidential elections to be held in April. Sandi refers to Prabowo\u2019s running mate, Sandiaga Uno.\n\nThe footage used for the 1-minute, 11-second clip is real and does show Widodo handing out envelopes with 100,000 rupiahs ($7) each to locals in the town of Ngawi.\n\nBut the post's claim that the event took place on Christmas Day 2018 is incorrect.\n\nThe footage is from a report dated March 8, 2015, which was published in Liputan6.com.\n\nThe original video can be viewed here.\n\nThe clip is titled \u201cPresident Jokowi visits Ngawi and presents envelopes\u201d -- a common local reference to monetary gifts.\n\nIt is not unusual for Indonesian politicians to hand out gifts, such as cooking oil, rice or clothing and sometimes cash, in the communities they visit.\n\n\u201cAfter having lunch in Karangasri village, Ngawi, East Java, President Joko Widodo meets some locals who are waiting for him on the side of the road,\" the clip says.\n\n\"Not only do they shake the president\u2019s hand, but they also get envelopes from the president, each containing Rp 100,000.\u201d\n\nJokowi was elected about five months before the original footage was shot.", "lang": "en"}
