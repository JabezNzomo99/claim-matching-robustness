[1]\n\nMr Barnett told AAP FactCheck his party\u2019s preference deal with One Nation \u201cblindsided\u201d him and ruined the 2017 WA election campaign, which he lost after eight-and-a-half years as premier.\n\nAAP FactCheck investigated his claims the Liberals\u2019 proposed preference deal with the United Australia Party could cost the party a significant number of metropolitan seats.\n\nMr Barnett urged the Liberal Party to learn from his 2017 landslide election defeat - the largest defeat of a sitting government in WA\u2019s history - following the party\u2019s controversial preference deal with One Nation. [2]\n\nThe preference deal signalled One Nation was no longer a political pariah. Former Liberal prime minister John Howard defended the 2017 deal with One Nation saying \u201ceveryone changes in 16 years\u201d. Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos argued One Nation was \u201ca lot more sophisticated\u201d. [3]\n\nABC election analyst Antony Green told AAP FactCheck he agrees with Mr Barnett\u2019s claim that any preference deal would be a distraction, but disagreed it would lose seats.\n\nMr Green said while the 2017 One Nation preference deal \"didn\u2019t help\" the Liberals in WA, they were going to lose office in 2017 anyway.\n\nMr Green also predicts the effect of any Liberal/United Australia Party preference deal on federal lower house seats in the 2019 election would be \u201cneutral\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, the preference deal with Clive Palmer, does it make it more or less likely they\u2019re going to hold on to seats? I don\u2019t think it makes any difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to lose any seats because of the United Australia Party. They\u2019ll lose seats because their vote has fallen since the last election,\u201d Mr Green told AAP FactCheck.\n\nMr Green told ABC TV that preferences rarely change the result, especially for the coalition.\n\n\u201cIn the last three decades, Labor has won 86 seats on preferences after trailing on first preferences. The coalition has won two,\u201d Mr Green told ABC TV.\n\n\u201cThe coalition for three decades has not been able to win seats on preferences.\u201d\n\nHe also said the impact of any Palmer party preference deal would be dependent on voters receiving and following \u201chow-to-vote cards\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the United Australia Party doesn't put a how-to-vote cards in the hand of every voter then it is irrelevant, because people won't follow a card they haven't received.\u201d\n\nMr Green told AAP FactCheck he agrees any Palmer deal would make \u201cday-to-day campaigning more difficult\u201d, but said the United Australia Party\u2019s brand isn\u2019t as controversial as One Nation\u2019s.\n\n\u201cA lot of middle-ground, migrant-background voters just don\u2019t like One Nation but I think Clive Palmer\u2019s party they\u2019re very neutral about. They don\u2019t have any huge antipathy towards the United Australia Party.\u201d\n\nAccording to leading election analyst Mr Green, Mr Barnett\u2019s claims are mostly false because while a Palmer preferences deal could hinder the Liberals, historically preferences don\u2019t win or lose seats for the coalition.", "lang": "en"}
