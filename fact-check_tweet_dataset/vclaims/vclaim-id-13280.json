If this is so (there are no such official statistics thus far), the \u201cwage gap\u201d in the country over the past year has grown even larger. In 2017, according to Rosstat, the average earnings of women was almost 72% of the average for men.\n\nAnd, according to data cited by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a recent report, the average gender wage gap around the world is 25% smaller than the one that exists today in Russia:\n\n\u200bAt the end of February 2019, the World Bank presented a report titled \u201cWomen, Business and the Law 2019 : A Decade of Reform\u201d, which compared 187 countries (out of the 193 countries that are currently United Nations members). The final score for each country was based on eight factors, which the report deemed as \u201cGoing Places\u201d (freedom of movement), \u201cStarting a Job\u201d (employment), \u201cGetting Paid\u201d (wages), \u201cGetting Married\u201d (marriage), \u201cHaving Children\u201d (motherhood), \u201cRunning a Business\u201d (starting businesses), \u201cManaging Assets\u201d (financial and material asset management) and \u201cGetting a Pension\u201d (retirement).\n\nOnly six countries received the maximum possible 100 points. Russia was ranked 116th out of the 187 countries, behind all former Soviet republics except Uzbekistan.\n\n\u200bAmong the eight factors in the World Bank rating, Russia did worst in the area of \u201cGetting Paid\u201d - which means that, when it comes to the gender pay gap, it finds itself in the same company as China, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThis fact check is translated from our partner, Factograph.info. https://www.factograph.info/", "lang": "en"}
