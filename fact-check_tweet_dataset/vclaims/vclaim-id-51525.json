One of the reasons this occurred, reportedly, was the calculation that leaving Democrat-run states to their own devices could be politically advantageous.\n\nThis claim originated in a Vanity Fair report titled \u201cHow Jared Kushner\u2019s Secret Testing Plan \u2018Went Poof Into Thin Air.'\u201d\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Vanity Fair reported on the changing approach and strategy of Kushner\u2019s COVID-19 task force to tackling the pandemic. In March and early April, according to a member of the task force, COVID-19 outbreaks were the worst in mostly Democratic-voting states and cities. An anonymous public health expert in contact with Kushner\u2019s team told Vanity Fair that the team member suggested the government hold back from taking charge of COVID-19 testing, and leave the response to the governors of states. That way, the Trump administration or the task force could blame any ensuing damage on the governors instead.\n\nWhile the task force member\u2019s purported sentiment on the political implications may have contributed to the final strategy that the government went with, it is not clear if this was the sole or actual reason behind the aborted national response to testing.\n\nKushner, who is also Trump\u2019s son-in-law and the main decision maker on the task force, could have been swayed by the aforementioned argument, according to the expert who spoke anonymously to Vanity Fair. But other factors, including Trump\u2019s own political concerns that more testing would lead to higher case counts and bad publicity, also played a part, the Vanity Fair report said.\n\nThe government plan that was eventually announced at the end of April was vastly different from the initial nationwide strategy the task force envisioned. That plan dictated that the federal government would act as a facilitator to bring needed supplies to states and approve testing kits. But the bulk of the effort to operate testing sites and find available labs fell to states.\n\nExperts described the federal government\u2019s approach as one where they abrogated responsibility. The rollout of the final plan announced by the administration was ultimately a \u201crecipe for disaster,\u201d according to the report, resulting in an approach that hurt even non-Democratic states, with experts warning that the U.S. testing system was \u201con the brink of collapse.\u201d The number of COVID-19 cases rose along with the demand for tests and dwindling laboratory capacity to turn around test results.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied the Vanity Fair report in a statement, saying, \u201cThe article is completely incorrect in its assertion that any plan was stopped for political or other reasons. Our testing strategy has one goal in mind \u2014 delivering for the American people \u2014 and is being executed and modified daily to incorporate new facts on the ground.\u201d\n\nIn sum, Vanity Fair reported that Kushner\u2019s task force\u2019s approach to nationwide testing may have been influenced by political concerns. However, Vanity Fair attributed this claim to an anonymous source, did not state conclusively that politics played a role in the administration\u2019s final approach, and said it was one of a number of likely factors. For these reasons, and because we were unable to independently corroborate it, we rate this claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
