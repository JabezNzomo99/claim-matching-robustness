This particular Facebook post credits Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, with coining a saying about term limits, though it appears nowhere in his writings, collected quotes or letters. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say,\u2019Freedom Is Lost Gradually From An Uninterested, Uninformed, And Unresponsive People?\u2019)\n\nLisa Francavilla of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs his estate at Monticello, confirmed as much in an email to the Caller, also noting, \u201cWhile TJ had some concerns about the potential for abuse by those we would today call \u2018career politicians,\u2019 he was optimistic that constitutionally mandated term limits would be unnecessary.\u201d\n\nShe pointed the Caller to two letters written by Jefferson that exemplify this \u201coptimism\u201d: a 1788 letter to Edward Rutledge, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and an 1814 letter to Horatio G. Spafford, a lawyer.\n\nIn his letter to Rutledge, Jefferson expressed concern that the \u201ctotal abandonment of the principle of rotation in the offices of President and Senator\u201d would end in \u201cabuse\u201d but went on to say that he had confidence that there would be \u201cvirtue and good sense enough in our countrymen to correct abuses.\u201d\n\nThough Francavilla could not point to the exact source of the falsely attributed quote, she did find it linked to Jefferson in an \u201cinstance of a man who regularly portrays Thomas Jefferson.\u201d\n\nClay Jenkinson, creator of the weekly \u201cThomas Jefferson Hour\u201d radio program, did indeed say the expression while answering questions in character as Jefferson during a 2017 episode titled \u201cTerm Limits.\u201d On the radio program\u2019s website, the saying is credited to Jefferson with the caveat \u201cas portrayed by Clay S. Jenkinson.\u201d This attribution may have led some readers to believe that Jenkinson was directly quoting Jefferson, rather than just basing his character of the \u201cwritings and actions of the great man,\u201d as the website disclaims.", "lang": "en"}
