It was viewed over 1,27,000 times at the time of writing this story.\n\nThe clip was first tweeted by Potion Pictures on July 10. July 10 was also the day the RAF marked its 100-year anniversary making the claim believable.\n\nHowever, the video flew over the Internet after it was shared by Twitter user Billy Cove, a manager at a local football club.\n\nThe studio gave up the gag on July 12 and tweeted a video illustrating how it created the viral clip.\n\nIn India the video was also shared by Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi.\n\nThe refrain 'It's coming home' is from the song \"Three Lions\" (Football's Coming Home)\" by The Lightning Seeds. It metamorphosed into a war cry for English fans and an Internet meme as the team progressed to the semi finals of the tournament. But it was heartbreak for English fans as Croatia beat England 2-1 on Wednesday halting England's march to the World Cup finals since 1966.", "lang": "en"}
