Trump again demonstrated what The Fact Checker has long documented: His rhetoric is fundamentally based on making statements that are not true, and he will be as deceptive as his audience will allow.\n\nThe stage of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was one of the more difficult public settings Trump has allowed himself to be put in. It was the rare national audience outside the friendly confines of Fox News and in a one-on-one, televised interview with a skilled reporter who challenged him repeatedly.\n\nTrump also falsely said the climate will change back again, even though the National Climate Assessment approved by his White House last year said that there was no turning back. He said he did not know whether climate change was man-made, though the same report said \u201cthere is no convincing alternative\u201d posed by the evidence.\n\nTrump did his usual shrug when asked whether North Korea is building more nuclear missiles. \u201cWell, nobody really knows. I mean, people are saying that.\u201d Among the people who are saying that are U.S. intelligence agencies, who have concluded that North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile and is instead working to conceal its weapons and production facilities.\n\nEven when he adjusts his rhetoric, at times contradicting what he has just said, Trump almost always appears to believe firmly in what he is saying. While he quibbled with Stahl over some details regarding North Korea, for instance, he refused to concede error on the big picture.\n\nKim actually has only signed a nonbinding statement of goals \u2014 and the goal to \u201cwork towards complete denuclearization\u201d was listed third. The communique the two men signed was far less detailed than a declaration issued by North and South Korea more than a quarter century ago, with little consequence.\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. The trade deficit just means Americans are buying more Chinese products than the Chinese are buying from the United States, not that the Chinese are somehow stealing U.S. money. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as the relative strength of currencies, economic growth rates, and savings and investment rates.\n\nCuriously, he denied to Stahl that he ever said he was engaged in a trade war with China, even though he has said and tweeted it many times, including on Fox News last week. He insisted he had only called it a \u201cbattle\u201d \u2014 a term he has used at times \u2014 but was now suddenly downgrading it to a mere \u201cskirmish.\u201d\n\nHe also falsely said that \u201cthe European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade.\u201d That\u2019s a misreading of history, at best. The E.U. got its start shortly after World War II as the European Coal and Steel Community \u2014 an early effort to bind together bitter enemies such as Germany and France in a common economic space to promote peace.\n\nWhen it was pointed out that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former general who served in the military for 44 years, says he believes NATO had kept the peace for 70 years, Trump sniffed, \u201cI think I know more about it than he does.\u201d\n\nQuestioned about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump conceded that \u201cthey meddled.\u201d But he added, \u201cI think China meddled, too.\u201d When Stahl said he was \u201cdiverting the whole Russia thing,\u201d Trump insisted he was not. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d he demurred. \u201cI\u2019m saying Russia, but I\u2019m also saying China.\u201d\n\nHe also falsely claimed that \u201cObama had the same thing\u201d as Trump\u2019s controversial family separation policy on the border. This is wrong. There is a collection of policies and court rulings spanning Democratic and Republican administrations, but none required the Trump administration to separate children from their families, as Stahl correctly noted.", "lang": "en"}
