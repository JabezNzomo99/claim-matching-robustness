If revenues are bigger than spending, you have a surplus. If spending is bigger than revenues, you have a deficit.\n\nAccording to the , the federal deficit -- the amount by which the government has been spending more than it has been taking in -- has been declining since peaking in 2009:\n\nSo, the deficit trendline has been generally downward, both in raw dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product. And the that the deficit will continue to go down for two more years:\n\nIf CBO is on target, then by 2015, the deficit will be roughly a quarter of what it was in 2009.\n\nIn other words, Cantor is wrong about what has been happening to the deficit, and what is projected to happen in the near future.\n\nAfter 2015, however, Cantor has a point -- the deficit begins growing again, according to CBO projections:\n\n\"The current baseline has deficits growing again in 2016, and even with his proposed tax increases, deficits are set to begin growing again in the out-years under President Obama\u2019s own budget proposals,\" said Rory Cooper, Cantor\u2019s spokesman. Cantor, he said, \"is equally concerned with this long-term deficit trend\" as he is with the shrinkage of the deficit in recent years.\n\nWe should also note that, despite the recent progress in shrinking the deficit, the federal debt continues to grow -- just more slowly than before. The debt refers to the accumulation of all prior yearly deficits, offset by any yearly surpluses. So until there\u2019s a surplus -- and there hasn\u2019t been one since fiscal 2001 -- the debt keeps growing.\n\nThe public debt is projected to grow from $11.3 trillion in fiscal 2012 to higher than $19 trillion in 2023. As a percentage of GDP, the rise is more modest, from 72.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to 72.9 percent in 2023, according to CBO.\n\nCantor said that the federal deficit is \"growing.\" Annual federal deficits are not growing right now, and they are not projected to grow through 2015, a point at which the deficit will have shrunk by three-quarters since 2009. By this standard, Cantor is wrong. However, unless policies are changed, deficits are projected to grow again in 2016 and beyond, according to the CBO. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
