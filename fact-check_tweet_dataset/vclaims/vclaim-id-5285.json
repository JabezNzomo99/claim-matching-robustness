So it\u2019s entirely true the results on the field for the FIFA World Cup host were \u201csurprisingly successful.\u201d", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "July 20, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5285", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-football-successful-world-cup/29380042.html", "vclaim": "Five days after the FIFA World Cup final in Moscow, the TASS Russian News Agency recounted what it called Russia\u2019s \u201csurprisingly successful performance\u201d on the field \u2013 quoting from a promotional story on FIFA\u2019s Web site and an interview with Coach Stanislav Cherchesov.\n\n\"A quarter-final is a pretty good result for us, if we analyze the performances,\u201d TASS and FIFA quoted Cherchesov as saying.\n\nGiven the expectations of international experts and sportswriters, the obvious verdict on this statement, and Cherchesov\u2019s comments on the FIFA Web site, is \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\nThe Russian team not only survived the early round to reach the \u201cknockout\u201d phase, but made the quarterfinals. And it took a penalty shootout on July 7 for Croatia to beat Russia and advance to the semifinals.\n\nPrior to the FIFA World Cup competition, expectations for Russia were not high. In a pre-Cup analysis in early June, the Washington Post wondered whether Russia\u2019s dreams would die early, \u201cgiven its dearth of success in major competitions since the Soviet Union collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe Local, a European English-language daily news Web site, gave Russia a 1.6% chance of winning while predicting Germany would be the eventual winner. Germany was eliminated before the knockout round.\n\n\u201cRussia qualified automatically as the host nation, playing a bunch of friendlies while its rivals were busy with competitive action,\u201d Sheedutta Chidananda of The Hindu wrote in the publication\u2019s team analysis. He and a number of analysts pointed out that Russia enjoyed \u201ca favorable draw.\u201d\n\nEven Polygraph.info joined in the litany of low expectations, writing in mid-June about Russian comedian and singer Semyon Slepakov\u2019s satirical song on \u201cmany of the issues surrounding Russia\u2019s preparation for the World Cup,\u201d including low expectations for Russia\u2019s football team.\n\nWe subsequently reported that Slepakov followed up with an \u201capology song\u201d after facing after receiving \"joke threats\u201d from Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov during the tournament.\n\nCherchesov admitted in the FIFA article that Russia\u2019s performance before the World Cup had lowered expectations. \u201cWe were criticized for our results in the warm-up matches against Argentina, Spain, Brazil and France,\u201d he told FIFA. \u201cBut those matches gave us a lot to ponder and helped us to prepare for the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThis fact check is limited to the happy results for Russian soccer team fans. There are other elements of the host country\u2019s performance off the field that have resulted in more sober questions. These include allegations of racism in the Russian sport, Russian media\u2019s rosy portrayal of the atmosphere surrounding the tournament and the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s claim that \u201cRussophobia\u201d was behind the publication of a handbook for journalists produced by a human rights watchdog that cited humanitarian abuses in the run-up to the tournament.", "lang": "en"}
