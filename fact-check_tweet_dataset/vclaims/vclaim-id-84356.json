In a latest turn of events, the student was arrested by the Special Investigation Team earlier this week, after the politico brought extortion charges against her.\n\nThe edited newspaper clip is viral on Facebook with a similar narrative.\n\nBOOM ascertained that the headline of the newspaper report has been photoshopped with the font of the word 'maulvi' different from the rest of the text in the headline.\n\nWe also observed that a black line running through the top of the newspaper clipping was not present where the word 'Maulvi' was written.\n\nThe excerpt of the article stated that the incident happened in Yasinganj, Uttar Pradesh where the girl students were rescued and sent to a women's rehabilitation centre.\n\nA Google search, using relevant keywords from the excerpt of the article, led us to the original news report that published in Amar Ujala on December, 2017. The word 'Manager' in Hindi had been carefully replaced with 'Maulvi' in the fake news clipping.\n\nAccording to news reports, the manager of a madrasa in Yasinganj, Uttar Pradesh, Kari Taiyab Zia, was arrested after it was alleged that 52 women between the age group of 5-24 years had been sexually assaulted and tortured.\n\nMultiple girl students of the madrasa were kept under house arrest in the institute and sexually assaulted. The incident came to light after the women allegedly threw paper chits from the terrace narrating their ordeal, reported the Indian Express. All the young girls and women were later rescued and sent to a welfare home. Zia, on the other hand, claimed that he was framed.", "lang": "en"}
