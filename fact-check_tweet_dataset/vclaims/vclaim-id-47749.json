In the original picture, it can be seen that the people are holding a banner with the text \u2013 \u2018We want Azaadi\u2019. Also, the photo was taken in Kashmir. When the similar edited image went viral in another context, FACTLY has written a fact-check article, which can be read here.\n\nThere are some media reports claiming that Pakistan has asked India for Hydroxychloroquine supplies, which can be read here and here.
