The posts, shared in 2019, claim the emergency vehicle was stopped to allow the motorcade of the head of the opposition Indian National Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, to pass. The claims are false; the video was originally recorded in 2017 and shows an ambulance delayed by a motorcade while then-Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was visiting Delhi.\n\nThe video was posted here on Facebook on May 3, 2019, and has been viewed more than 4,300 times.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has a Hindi-language caption that says: \u201cDelhi Police stopped an ambulance to let Rahul Gandhi\u2019s motorcade pass. A baby girl was fighting for her life in the ambulance and in the end she died.\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi is an Indian MP and president of the main opposition Indian National Congress (INC) party. Here is his official Twitter page.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same video has also been shared with similar claims here, here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, and here on YouTube.\n\nThe exact same video was debunked last month by AFP when it was circulated online alongside claims that the ambulance had been stopped for a motorcade belonging to a politician with India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. That fact check can be seen here.\n\nThe video actually shows an incident where an ambulance was blocked by police in central Delhi in April 2017.\n\nA journalist in AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau analysed the 1:37 video and translated part of the audio.\n\nThe person filming can be heard saying in Hindi: \u201cThey are not letting an ambulance pass because of VIP culture. There is a child bleeding inside the ambulance. Would you guys allow an ambulance to pass or are the politicians the priority, not the patient?\u201d\n\nA police officer then says: \u201cPlease wait, wait for a few minutes.\u201d\n\nPeople standing around the ambulance can be heard shouting: \u201cLet this ambulance go.\u201d\n\nThe person recording the video can then says: \u201cWho would be responsible if the child dies?\u201d\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the video obtained using digital verification tool InVid returned this NDTV news article published on April 5, 2017.\n\nThe report, part of which is shown below, says the ambulance is forced to wait while the convoy of Malaysia\u2019s visiting Prime Minister goes by.\n\nThe Times of India newspaper also reported on the incident here in an article published on April 5, 2017.\n\nBoth the NDTV and the Times of India cited an April 1, 2017 live stream video of the incident from the Facebook account of a user named Preet Narula, which can be found here.\n\nBelow is Narula\u2019s original April 1, 2017 livestream video, which has been viewed some 1.3 million times:\n\nThe video in the misleading posts is the same as Narula\u2019s original live stream, though Narula\u2019s video includes an additional 21 seconds of footage at the end.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and Narula\u2019s video (R):\n\nBoth videos feature a yellow blockade with the words \u201cDelhi Police\u201d written in red. Below is a screenshot of the blockade:\n\nTo confirm the location of the videos, AFP compared Narula\u2019s Facebook live video with Google Street View images of the area.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Narula\u2019s video (L) and this Google user\u2019s image tagged at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Google Street View (R) with the stadium circled in red:\n\nThis press release published by the Indian government on March 2017 announced Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Najib Razak would visit India from March 30 to April 4, 2017.\n\nRazak tweeted this selfie with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi from his official Twitter account on April 1, 2017.\n\nWhen the same video was being circulated last month, Delhi traffic police official Sandeep Shahi told AFP: \"According to official protocol, the only motorcades for which police close roads are those belonging to India's president, prime minister, and those of foreign heads of state visiting India.\"\n\n\"When their convoys pass the designated routes, only then is the traffic halted. It is not applicable for MPs,\" he said, referring to Indian members of parliament.", "lang": "en"}
