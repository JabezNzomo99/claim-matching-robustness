This is false; flu shots contain dead influenza viruses that are not infectious, according to the Canadian Public Health Agency (CPHA) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).\n\nA screengrab of plain text explaining that flu shots turn people into \u201can active live walking virus\u201d was shared at least one thousand times in the past week. One Facebook user added the caption: \u201cYour the carrier. Wake up!\u201d as a warning.\n\nThis myth is widespread enough that several health institutions explicitly debunk it on their websites, including the CPHA, the Harvard Medical School, the CDC, and the University of California, Los Angeles health center.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of this before, but it makes no scientific sense whatsoever,\u201d according to Dr. Ian Gemmill, former chair of Immunize Canada, a coalition of non-government health organizations.\n\nAll influenza vaccines approved in Canada this season are inactivated. \u201cYes the virus was live at one time but it is inactivated, which means it\u2019s dead. It does not replicate, it has no ability to infect anybody,\u201d Gemmill told AFP.\n\nSome vaccines, he added, have not only been inactivated but have also been split, and sometimes even purified down to the protein needed to create the vaccine.\n\nOnce administered, the vaccine and the virus it contains stimulate immune cells that will be ready should the vaccine receiver come in contact with live flu virus.\n\nGemmill compared a vaccinated body to an army that is prepared and knows what the enemy looks like, allowing it to fight the virus before it can take hold. An unvaccinated person\u2019s immune system would not react so quickly and would have to fight the enemy faction, which is the illness.\n\nThe list of flu shots authorized in Canada in 2019-2020 is publicly available on Health Canada\u2019s website. Nine flu shots are authorized in Canada for the current influenza season.\n\nFluMist Quadrivalent is a flu vaccine that is only weakened (attenuated), rather than inactivated. Although it is licensed in Canada this year, it is not commercially available, Gemmill told AFP.\n\nAlthough theoretically possible, chances are slim that a live attenuated virus would be transmitted from the patient to another individual because the dose used in a single shot is so small and the virus so weak, Gemmill said. He added that he has never seen a report of contamination caused by vaccination.\n\nVaccines in Canada must go through a rigorous multi-step evaluation before they can be commercialized or administered in the country, according to Health Canada.\n\nFlu viruses are constantly changing, so, flu shots change annually; the variations in their composition are determined by the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) recommendations for that year, although the composition may be maintained over multiple years. Flu vaccine composition for the entire northern hemisphere is decided by the WHO every January, and manufacturers propose new vaccines in the following months.\n\nThe flu vaccine is a regular source of misinformation. AFP Fact Check has also written about misleading posts about the ingredients in flu vaccines.", "lang": "en"}
