Most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. Those wives knew what their husbands were going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the 9/11 terrorists could have \u2018sent their wives home\u2019 before the attacks because, as you suggest, none of them brought female companions to the United States,\u201d said Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission (and who is not affiliated with any campaign). \u201cAll, or nearly all, of the hijackers were unmarried, as far as we know. We did elaborate a bit about the story of one Lebanese hijacker, Ziad Jarrah [who was on United 93], and his German girlfriend.\u201d\n\nThe report makes a distinction between the \u201cmuscle hijackers,\u201d who were to restrain or overcome crew members or others, and hijackers who trained to pilot the aircraft. Regarding the muscle hijackers, the report says: \u201cThe muscle hijackers came from a variety of educational and societal backgrounds. All were between 20 and 28 years old; most were unemployed with no more than a high school education and were unmarried.\u201d (Page 231 of the report.)\n\nAmong the pilot hijackers, Marwan al-Shehhi (who piloted United Flight 175) was married: \u201cWhen Shehhi, while still in the UAE in January 2000, held a belated wedding celebration (he actually had been married in 1999), a friend of his was surprised to see that he had shaved off his beard and was acting like his old self again.\u201d But again, there is no indication that his wife ever traveled to the United States.\n\nFinally, Jarrah did have a girlfriend of Turkish descent who lived in Germany and with whom he kept in close contact while he was in flight training in the United States. \u201cIn October [2000], he flew back to Germany to visit his girlfriend, Aysel Senguen. The two traveled to Paris before Jarrah returned to Florida on October 29. His relationship with her remained close throughout his time in the United States. In addition to his trips, Jarrah made hundreds of phone calls to her and communicated frequently by email.\u201d (Page 224.)\n\nJarrah visited her several times in Germany, the last time in January 2001. He told her repeatedly he had to return for more training. Senguen said that she visited Jarrah in the U.S. and he flew her to Key West in a small plane. She was also with him when he rented a Boeing flight simulator in Miami in early 2001. Jarrah had urged her not to tell anyone he was in the U.S. \u201cBut I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI often didn\u2019t do what he told me.\u201d Senguen saw Jarrah for the last time in July 2001 in Germany. He told her again he would return soon and they could marry and start their family. He e-mailed and telephoned her almost every day. On Sept. 11, about noon, German time, Jarrah made his last call. They didn\u2019t talk long. \u201cHe said three times, \u2018I love you.\u2019 When I asked, \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 he just answered, \u2018I love you.\u2019 Then he hung up,\u201d Senguen said. She didn\u2019t know it, but minutes later Jarrah boarded Flight 93, ending whatever dreams they had together.\n\nJarrah also mailed her a final letter, which she received after the attacks. He wrote: \u201cThe very first thing I want you to believe and always believe, [is] that I deeply love you\u2026. It\u2019s my mistake, to make you hope that we [would] marry one day and have children\u2026. I did not run away from you, I did what I had to do, you should be proud.\u201d\n\nWhat could account for Trump\u2019s strange notion that the hijackers were married and shipped their wives home just before the attacks? Perhaps he is conflating reports of Saudi nationals leaving the United States after the attacks. But even so, it would have made little sense for such a carefully planned plot to have such poor operational security.\n\nThe report includes a number of references to the hijackers cutting off communication with their families: \u201cThe other operatives had broken off regular contact with their families.\u201d (Page 227.) \u201cThe majority of these Saudi recruits began to break with their families in late 1999 and early 2000.\u201d (Page 233.) \u201cAtta complained that some of the hijackers wanted to contact their families to say goodbye, something he had forbidden.\u201d (Page 245.)\n\nTrump once again is trying to reinvent the well-established history of the 9/11 attacks to serve his political needs. There is no evidence that the hijackers had wives in the United States, shipped them home or even told them of the plot in advance. In fact, virtually all of the hijackers were unmarried. So there is no way the alleged wives could have known what was going to happen. He earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
