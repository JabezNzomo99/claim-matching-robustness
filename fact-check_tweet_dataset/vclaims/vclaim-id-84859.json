Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) on May 23 released a report, written by Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, that says the NFL backed out of funding a $16-million study after a grant was awarded to a Boston University specialist in neurodegenerative disease who had been critical of the NFL. Moreover, it says a group of NFL officials sought to derail the grant and instead redirect the fund to researchers associated with the league\u2019s committee on brain injuries.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the commissioner insisted that the $30 million commitment still stood and said that the report described a \u201cnormal practice\u201d of \u201cdiscussions back and forth with the NIH.\u201d He added that \u201cit is very important to continue to have that kind of dialogue through appropriate channels\u201d by advisers on NFL committees \u2013and then faulted the congressional staff for not \u201ceven talking to any of our advisers.\u201d\n\nThe $30 million commitment was struck in 2012\u2014with grant making authority residing with NIH\u2013 and four research plans had been implemented and proceeded smoothly. The problem arose with the fifth plan, estimated to cost $17.5 million, to fund a longitudinal study in high-risk adults to collect and analyze data in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts\u2014specifically the progressive degenerative disease of the brain known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The NFL was supposed to provide just over $16 million.\n\nWhen grant applications were reviewed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Council, the highest ranked one was submitted by a group led by Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University. Stern, however, had once filed an objection to an NFL settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by its players. The grant award was about to be issued when on June 17, 2015, Dr. Elliot J. Pellman, the League\u2019s medical director, sent an email to FNIH\u2019s president, saying \u201cthere are many of us who have significant concerns re BU and their ability to be unbiased and collaborative.\u201d\n\nThen, a day later, Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the NFL\u2019s chief medical officer, emailed Dr. Walter Koroshetz, the NINDS director, to express her own concerns. \u201cI hope this group is able to approach their research in an unbiased manner,\u201d she wrote, questioning the peer review process that led to the selection of the BU group. She also suggested there was a conflict of interest because members of the review board had co-written articles with members of the BU group, though that was not considered a conflict of interest under NIH rules.\n\nThe efforts by these two NFL officials is all documented by emails obtained by the congressional staff, and NIH officials found the intervention to be unprecedented. Koroshetz, the NINDS director, said that \u201cthe stipulations in funding agreements have consistently expressed that the NIH scientific process is out of bounds for donors,\u201d the report said. \u201cDr. Koroshetz was aware of no other instance where a donor raised objections to a grantee prior to the issuance of a notice of grant award.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the call, the HNS members raised concerns about bias in NIH\u2019s peer review process and Dr. Stern\u2019s affidavit in favor of former NFL players,\u201d the report said. \u201cThey also raised issue about balance related to money going to only one institution, given that funding under prior research grants had been divided across multiple institutions.\u201d The report said one of the outside NFL advisers on the call, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, had been involved in a grant that had not been selected.\n\nThe call included discussion of compromise plan to have two studies funded, but ultimately that idea was rejected by the NINDS Council; it recommended funding only the BU proposal in part because none of other proposed studies scored high enough to justify funding. Once that decision was made, the NFL money faded away and NIH officials had to fund the study out of taxpayer funds.\n\nBut what Goodell is focusing on is a procedural foul in developing the report\u2019s second finding: \u201cThe NFL\u2019s head, neck and spine committee members played an inappropriate role in attempting to influence the outcome of the grant selection process.\u201d That\u2019s because although the outside advisers are named \u2014 and Ellenbogen is especially criticized on page 27 of the report \u2014 the committee staff made no attempt to seek their side of the story.\n\n\u201cThe briefings with the principals and the documents provided us more than enough information to complete our investigation, develop findings and make recommendations in the hopes of preventing something like this from happening again,\u201d said Andrew Souvall, spokesman for the Democratic staff. He acknowledged the committee had contact information for the doctors but chose not to use it.\n\nEllenborgen has written a letter to the committee strongly disputing he tried to influence the NIH grant process. He also told the media that he did not know his name had been submitted as part of grant application \u2013 though NIH officials say he was listed as co-investigator. An interview might have cleared up this discrepancy.\n\n\u201cThe point he was making is the staff report leveled a series of charges about contacts between our outside advisers and the NIH, the people who raised concerns about the process, without ever bothering to contact them,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president for communications. \u201cWe know they knew how to reach them because we gave them their contact information as they requested. If they were genuinely trying to get to the bottom of this, it stands to reason they would have picked up the phone and put their questions directly to them. If, on the other hand, they were only trying to document a predetermined point of view, or a one-sided point of view, they would not reach out to everyone involved.\u201d\n\nBut the role of the outside advisers is a secondary finding in the report. The key finding was that NFL tried to steer impartially awarded funding away from a NFL critic. The NFL depicts this is a normal process but clearly upset NIH officials say it is anything but normal. And, contrary to Goodell\u2019s suggestion, the NFL was given an opportunity to respond to allegations concerning its own staff.", "lang": "en"}
