Some of the figures are correct and others aren\u2019t, as we\u2019ll explain.\n\nLooking at figures for all MPs across a single year (2008/09), we can see that Mrs May\u2019s expense claims for her second home were on the lower end of the spectrum, and her work-related expenses claims were about average.\n\nUp until 2009/10 MPs were allowed to claim a number of expenses relating to the costs of running their office and maintaining a second home either in London or their constituency (the rules were changed in May 2010).\n\nIn 2009/10, inner London MPs could claim a \u00a37,500 allowance for living in London. All other MPs could choose between receiving this and claiming over \u00a324,000 relating to the additional cost of running a second home. This \u00a324,000 could cover things like rent or the interest payments on a mortgage (up to \u00a31,250 a month), hotel expenses, food, utility bills, service charges and council tax.\n\nOther things that MPs could claim for included just under \u00a3104,000 in staffing costs, around \u00a322,000 in office costs and over \u00a310,000 on communications.\n\nSo what about Theresa May\u2019s expenses?\n\nThe documents referred to in the infographic are now publicly available on the official parliamentary website and the website of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. They date back as far as 2004 and were published along with details of the expenses claimed by all MPs following the expenses scandal of 2009.\n\nThe documents were leaked to and published by the Daily Telegraph in May of that year, ahead of their officially scheduled publication date in July.\n\nIt is correct that Mrs May claimed expenses for cleaning as part of the Additional Costs Allowance MPs could claim for their second homes at the time, although it\u2019s wrong to say that these amounts were \u201cper month\u201d. \u00a3520 was claimed covering April-October 2006 and another \u00a3400 was claimed covering July 2006-March 2007.\n\nWe\u2019ve not been able to find an exact charge for \u00a31.59 (or for a single paperclip, as suggested here) in Theresa May\u2019s expenses for paperclips, but she did have paperclips included in her expenses, along with lots of other items of office stationery.\n\nFor the period covering June to September 2006, Mrs May claimed expenses of around \u00a31,800 for the interest charged on mortgage payments on her second home (not the entirety of the mortgage payments as the meme states). For the period October 2006 to March 2007, she claimed around \u00a32,700 for mortgage interest payments.\n\nThe average monthly payments were always around \u00a3450-500. She consistently claimed for her monthly mortgage repayments between June 2006 and January 2008. She also made claims covering June to December 2005 and in mid-2008.\n\nThere are a number of claims within Mrs May\u2019s expenses for payments to a company called MP Services between 2005 and 2007. These generally vary from around \u00a3500 a time to just under \u00a33,000. The payments are usually for the printing of Mrs May\u2019s annual report as an MP, newsletters, and outdoor banners.\n\nThere is a company called M P Services Ltd registered in Hornchurch, Essex. It was incorporated in June 2002 for the purpose of \u201cother telecommunications services\u201d. In the year ending March 2017 it had net assets of \u00a3262, that\u2019s looking at everything the company has and has made in the year minus any payments and debts. We haven\u2019t been able to establish if this is the same company which was mentioned in Mrs May\u2019s expenses as all details, other than the company name, were redacted from the published expenses.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008 Mrs May claimed a number of expenses relating to the hire and purchase of mobile phones. These ranged from around \u00a340 for a month\u2019s sim-card hire, to around \u00a3235 for the purchase of a mobile phone. The expenses forms don\u2019t specify if these phones and sim cards were for the use of Mrs May herself or for members of her office staff.\n\nMrs May also expensed a number of utilities bills for her second home over this period. For example she expensed a gas bill of around \u00a370 in 2006 and one for \u00a359 in 2008.\n\nHow does that compare to other MPs?\n\nIn comparison to other MPs at the time, Mrs May\u2019s spending is not out of the ordinary.\n\nBack in 2010 the Guardian collated and published the full data on MPs expenses. Based on the sample year of 2008/09 we can see that Theresa May\u2019s expenses were at the lower end of MPs\u2019 claims in terms of second home costs, and roughly average for her work-related costs.\n\nThe system of MPs expenses has changed since 2010, it is now overseen by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, rather than by committees of MPs. There have also been changes to the rules around what MPs can claim. For example, MPs can no longer claim for the mortgage interest on a second home\u2014they have to use rented accommodation. The \u201cLondon area\u201d has also been widened, \u201creducing the number of MPs eligible for accommodation expenses\u201d (although this still does not include Mrs May\u2019s constituency of Maidenhead) and limits have been placed on the number of family members an MP can employ, and on the travel expenses they can claim.", "lang": "en"}
