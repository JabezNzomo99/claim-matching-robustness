{"title": "FALSE: Kadamay placard demanding regular salary for rallyists", "subtitle": "The photo was altered and Kadamay did not make such a demand", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jun 12, 2020 3:46 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-46305", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/kadamay-placard-demanding-regular-salary-rallyists", "vclaim": "A photo being circulated online by at least two users shows a placard at a rally which reads: \"Sweldo ng ralehista gawing regular (Make rallyists' salaries regular).\" The placard bore the name of Kadamay.\n\nPosts containing this claim were spotted by Rappler's fact check team on Facebook.\n\nThe facts: The photo was altered, and Kadamay did not make such a demand.\n\nThis photo initially circulated in 2017 and was reshared in June 2020.\n\nA reverse image search showed that the original photo was tweeted by DZMM Teleradyo on May 1, 2017, capturing a Labor Day protest. The actual placard read: \"Direktang kabit ng tubig at kuryente ngayon na!\" (Direct connection for water and electricity now!)\n\nMoreover, Kadamay media officer Michael Beltran said that the organization did not make such a demand.\n\n\"Lahat po ng miyembro ng Kadamay, [mula] national office at sa bawat balangay, walang anumang suweldo o sahod. Mass organization kami at voluntary ang membership,\" he told Rappler. (All Kadamay members, from the national office to each group, don't have any form of salary or wage. We are a mass organization and membership is voluntary.)\n\nIn the past, Rappler debunked a false statement attributed to Kadamay chairperson Gloria \"Ka Bea\" Arellano, wherein she allegedly asked for a house with free Wi-Fi. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
