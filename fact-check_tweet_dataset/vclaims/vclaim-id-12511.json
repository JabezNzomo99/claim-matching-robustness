One such post says: \"hawai hamle ki pilot Surat ki #Urvisha_Jariwala bhi thi (Urvisha Jariwala from Surat was one of the pilots who carried out air strikes).\"\n\nAnother similar post states, \"Suratwasiyo_ke_liye_gaurav_ki_khabar hawai hamle ki pilot Surat ki Urvisha Jariwala thi (Proud news for people of Surat. Air strike pilot was Urvisha Jariwala).\"\n\nOne such Facebook post can be seen here\n\nWhen we reverse-searched both these posts, we found that none of the pictures are of Urvisha Jariwala.\n\nThe picture is of a UAE pilot, Major Mariam Al Mansauri.\n\nThe New York Times reported about her on September 25, 2014.\n\nSimilarly, the other picture is of Squadron Leader Sneha Shekhawat.\n\nShekhawat became the first woman to lead an IAF contingent during a Republic Day parade. It was reported by rediff.com on February 2, 2015.\n\nIn most of the top-secret operations conducted by defence forces, names of those who take part in such exercise are always withheld. In Tuesday's operation too, the names were not declared. Hence, the names of the pilots doing the rounds on social media have nothing to do with the recent air strikes on Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
