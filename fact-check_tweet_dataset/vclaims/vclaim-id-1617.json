In 2011, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that the top 1% owned about 13% of the UK\u2019s wealth.\n\nMr Banks may be referring to Credit Suisse\u2019s estimate for the world as a whole. It estimates that 1% of the world\u2019s population own over half the world\u2019s wealth. We\u2019ve looked into this before, and found that a surprising number of households in the UK would fall into the top 1% globally.\n\n\u201cWealth\u201d in these estimates isn\u2019t just money in the bank. It also includes the value of property, physical possessions, and private pensions.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find out who owns what, and one recent report concluded that our view of wealth in the UK was \u2018seriously incomplete\u2019.\n\nResearchers can make estimates based on what\u2019s paid in death taxes and income from investment, as well as household surveys.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find out about about the wealth of the very rich from surveys because they\u2019re less likely to respond. Some estimates, such as those produced by Credit Suisse, try to account for this by using information from \u2018Rich Lists\u2019 like the ones produced by Forbes and the Sunday Times.\n\nSince each kind of source has limitations, researchers tend to say that they should be used to complement each other.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, wealth isn\u2019t the only measure of inequality that\u2019s available. Inequalities of wealth are higher than inequalities of income, and shouldn\u2019t be taken as a perfect measure of all types of inequality. For example, a recent university graduate may have a relatively high level of opportunity, despite having taken on more debt.", "lang": "en"}
