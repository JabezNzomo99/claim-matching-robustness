For fiscal year 2019, the cap is set at 30,000, which is the lowest it has been since 1980.\n\nAnd the picture in the meme actually shows refugees at the border of Syria and Iraq in 2013. It does not show refugees in the U.S. (The United Nations estimates that nearly 5.7 million people fled Syria during the civil war, which began in March 2011.)\n\nThe meme\u2019s other claim about Social Security benefits is also false.\n\nWhen the meme was posted in 2016, there was no cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security recipients that year. Although, it wasn\u2019t because the government didn\u2019t have \u201cenough\u201d money to raise Social Security benefits, as the meme says. Instead, there was no COLA because the rate of inflation didn\u2019t trigger an automatic increase.\n\nThe COLA is determined by the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which is tabulated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There have been three years \u2014 2010, 2011, and 2016 \u2014 when that index hasn\u2019t yielded an automatic increase in Social Security benefits because there was a decline in the CPI-W.\n\nFor 2019, however, there was a 2.8 percent increase in benefits. So, Facebook pages still posting the meme are misinforming their followers. One recent post, which has been shared 117,000 times, caused a Facebook user to leave this comment: \u201cThere is so much said about about [sic] taking care of refugees an [sic] sending money to other countries. What about taking care of deficit and the people of the UNITED STATES.\u201d\n\nSince the Syrian civil war began in March 2011, the U.S. has accepted 21,334 Syrian refugees \u2014 but only 41 of them came to the Unites States last year, according to the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cLaw Does Not Provide for a Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment for 2016.\u201d Press release.
