The differences weren\u2019t all statistically significant when looking at test scores by the end of Year 2, but were \u201cpositive and significant\u201d for pupils in Year 6. The report said that it was equivalent to two months\u2019 expected progress at this stage.\n\nThat said, the researchers noted that the reasons for this aren\u2019t clear. So they recommend caution, albeit not very prominently, when reading the results:\n\n\u201cThe results presented in this chapter must be interpreted with some caution, however, as the mechanisms underlying these improvements in attainment are not clear. The universal pilot did not appear to significantly improve children\u2019s behaviour or absence rates from school, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause of the improvements in attainment and thus which elements of the universal entitlement pilot are key to its success.\u201d\n\nThis caveat was reiterated recently by one of the report\u2019s authors, Lorraine Dearden. She told the BBC that \u201cit would be overstating it quite a bit\u201d to say that this study justifies a nationwide roll-out of free school meals for all pupils.\n\nAnother co-author told the Guardian a few years ago that \"from the pilot evidence, we cannot definitely conclude that attainment will be raised through the universal provision of free school meals to reception, year one and year two children\" [universal provision for these years has since happened].\n\nThe Liberal Democrats pointed us to other studies showing the benefits of free school meals, although they aren\u2019t as directly focused on attainment.\n\nThey include an evaluation of a 2004 pilot in Hull, after which teachers reported improvements in their pupils\u2019 \u201creadiness to learn\u201d and some other studies from the last decade that point (sometimes tentatively) to the educational benefits of improved pupil diets.", "lang": "en"}
