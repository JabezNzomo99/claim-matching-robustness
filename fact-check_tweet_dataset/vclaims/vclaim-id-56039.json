However, she is not related to Nanavati Hospital in any way.\n\nThe confusion started after some users added \u201cdaughter of Dr Nanavati\u201d while sharing her post. This gave a false impression that she is related to Nanavati hospital.\n\nDr Saloni Suchak is a Mumbai-based gynaecologist and obstetrician associated with several hospitals and nursing homes such as Suchak Hospital, Cloudnine Hospital and Benzer Nursing Home. Her father, Dr Nanavati Murari Suresh, is also a gynaecologist and obstetrician.\n\nDr Suchak told AFWA that the viral Facebook post on safety precautions against Covid-19 was originally posted by her on June 22. It was later circulated on Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\nShe said the viral post was tweaked by people who have circulated it on social media.\n\nDr Suchak said, \u201cI never mentioned in my original post that I am the daughter of Dr Nanavati. It was added to my post by people who have circulated it, and which in turn has created confusion. I am not connected to Nanavati hospital.\u201d\n\nIn general, the content of the long viral message which Dr Suchak had originally posted is a list of prescribed precautionary measures which she thinks one should follow during the pandemic.\n\nBut her message presses the panic button in the very first sentence when she says: \"13,000 + recorded cases in the last 24 hrs. Please note \u201crecorded\u201d. I would multiply that by 10. Now do the math.\"\n\nDr Suchak defends her point, saying, \u201cThere are so many unaccounted, untested symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of coronavirus around us, I think the original number is much higher. This is my assumption.\u201d\n\nTherefore, her estimate is not based on any data.\n\nDr Suchak also advises people for \u201csteam inhalation and warm water gargles with turmeric and salt\u201d. Though she mentions this home remedy as a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure against coronavirus, these claims were debunked by fact-checkers earlier as there is no scientific evidence about its effect on Covid-19.\n\nThese fact-check articles can be read here and also here.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Dr Suchak\u2019s viral Facebook message on precautions against coronavirus was tweaked by social media users, linking her to \u201cNanavati\u201d, which gave the impression that she\u2019s related to Mumbai\u2019s famous Nanavati hospital.", "lang": "en"}
