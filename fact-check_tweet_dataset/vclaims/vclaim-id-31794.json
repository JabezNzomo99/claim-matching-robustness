The report, however, does not name any of the Ukrainian generals who allegedly participated in conspiring, or provide any details about the place or time of the alleged meeting.\n\nThe alleged Ukrainian security services member claimed he was attached to a special medical group called \u201cEmergency Care and Resuscitation,\u201d purportedly supervised by Roelofs, which set up centers in Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk, Ukraine, where all of the wounded Ukrainian soldiers were sent.\n\nAt these centers, an organ transplant expert -- identified as Elisabeth De Br\u00fcck or Ellis -- allegedly introduced the practice of removing the organs of wounded soldiers without their permission. Polygraph.info was unable to establish the identity of the said \u201cElisabeth De Br\u00fcck.\u201d\n\nThe NTV report claimed the organs of dead Ukrainian soldiers were harvested and sent off to Europe.\n\n\"The army was turned into a private business. A business where you profit from the officials. It is the business of selling the bodies of our soldiers, which are supplied from Ukraine to Europe,\" the alleged Ukrainian army officer said.\n\nThe report referred to similar claims made against Roelofs in Georgia. In 2016, for example, a website calling itself \u201cGeorgia and the World\u201d leaked what it claimed were SMS messages between Saakashvili and Roelofs showing that the pair were working in conjunction with Bilal Erdo\u011fan, son of the Turkish president, to harvest organs in territories controlled by Islamic State. No evidence was provided to back up those claims.\n\nWe find the claim of organ harvesting to be false. Our verification, below is a complicated and interesting story that requires digging into the source of the report and organ transplant procedures.\n\nNTV boasts that 39.1 million Russians tune into the channel every week, saying it has ranked among Russia\u2019s top three television channels for more than 20 years. The channel further claimed it is \u201chighly regarded in Russia and abroad,\u201d with its correspondents, commentators and anchors regularly honored with \u201ctop journalistic and government prizes for their work.\u201d\n\nHowever, parts of the NTV report alleging the organ harvesting conspiracy (including the interview with the alleged Ukrainian security services member) were lifted from a fabricated video posted on the SLOVO.net.ua \u201cinformation agency\u201d channel in September 2015 without attribution.\n\nIn 2016, Georgia\u2019s Media Meter, which receives funding from the United States Agency for International Development, debunked the claim that that video had been published by the head of Ukraine\u2019s State Security Service.\n\nThat report tracked down the source of footage used in the video montage, including scenes depicting human corpses and surgeries spliced in for dramatic effect.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s USAID-funded fact-checking website Myth Detector likewise debunked a report that appeared on the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s Zvezda TV (and was later reprinted in the Georgian newspaper Asaval \u2013Dasavali), which also used footage from the SLOVO.net.ua video.\n\nThat report relied on yet another false claim -- that the lawyer for former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was involved in a black market organ transplant scheme -- which was later debunked by the Ukrainian fact-checking website StopFake.org.\n\nMyth Detector poked the biggest hole in the claim about the organ-harvesting scheme: it is logistically not viable.\n\nAccording to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Division of Transplantation (DoT), donated organs have a short shelf life, including:\n\nThere are also numerous compatibility issues with the organ donor recipient, including but not limited to blood type, body size and severity of medical condition.\n\nJoel Newman, the Senior Communications strategist at the United Network for Organ Sharing, told Polygraph.info the accusation of illicit organ harvesting often springs up in war zones.\n\n\u201cThis accusation has been thrown against U.S. forces with Iraqi war dead, Israelis and Palestinians, and [during the war] in the Balkans,\u201d Newman said.\n\n\u201cBut the reality of using organs from deceased persons [illicitly] is small.\u201d\n\nNewman said that the conditions under which organs are recovered and transported would require people who are very skilled in the purposes of transplantation.\n\n\u201cOrgans cannot be frozen. They have to be kept very sterile and are kept in a wet-ice solution with a chemical preservative that they flush the organs with,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile organs with longer viability periods like kidneys have been transported across international borders for the purposes of organ transplant (from Canada to the United States, for example), \u201clots of the pre-work is done before the organ is recovered,\u201d Newman said.\n\n\u201cThis is all carefully determined and arranged beforehand.\u201d\n\nFor example, Newman said immune system markers are collated to see how genetically similar donors and recipients are.\n\n\u201cThe level of match is very important and needs to be well-documented,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is necessary to keep organ rejection from happening. A final serum test is conducted before a kidney is delivered to the hospital.\u201d\n\nAs for more sensitive organs like hearts and lungs, he said much of the simultaneous work is done before the transplant takes place.\n\n\u201cThey may go ahead and crack the chest and have the patient ready to receive the organ if time is of the essence,\u201d Newman said.\n\nTorsten Trey, executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, shares that view.\n\n\u201cGiven the logistics of identifying a soldier [in eastern Ukraine] who is eligible, has no close family that could expose the act, and given transportation needs, it appears unlikely that this could apply for heart or liver transplants,\u201d Torsten told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cWith regards to kidney transplants, one might have the time to solve logistics.\u201d\n\nBut even the potential viability of kidneys does not cover the regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S. if Dr. Johnson books the OR [Operating Room] there is going to be a large paper trail as to why he did that, including the primary surgeon, nurses and anesthesiologist involved. This process involves immense documentation,\u201d Newman said.\n\nTorsten noted that Europe has a transparent donor system, with most countries prohibiting transplant tourism.\n\n\u201cIf an organ is being imported, it would be known,\u201d he said.\n\nThen there is the issue of payment, as the European donation system \u201cis based on altruism.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransplant tourism bypasses this by offering incentives to donors abroad. It is unlikely that transplant centers in Europe would permit transplants after paid organ donations, which would be revealed if traced back,\u201d Torsten said.\n\nNewman said that in places like the People\u2019s Republic of China, where the government has been accused of harvesting the organs of political prisoners, the accusations are viable because the state apparatus itself is being harnessed to that end, helping overcome the logistical, technical and regulatory hurdles any such illicit practice would confront.\n\n\u201cIf you compare [Europe] with China, it is more \u2018domestic organ trafficking\u2019 [in the latter], because the organs are transplanted inside the country which bypasses problems of passing the border. It is an open secret in China that organs are transplanted for money; that would be a problem in European countries,\u201d he said, adding the scheme alleged in the NTV report \u201cis not feasible.\u201d\n\nThat opinion was shared by Newman.\n\n\u201cThe actual viability of [illicit organ transplants] from deceased donors with all of the level of administrative scrutiny and medical viability \u2013 recovering the organ in a time frame from which it can be used, moving it from a place of unrest to a more settled area \u2013 those hurdles would be immense. I cannot see that it would be possible,\u201d Newman said.\n\nThe NTV report fits into a broader pattern of Russian disinformation, which has produced accusations that Saakashvili and Roelofs, along with Ukrainian public figures, have been involved in harvesting organs since the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine broke out.\n\nBesides the false claim directed at Tymoshenko\u2019s lawyer, StopFake.org reported in August 2014 on an on-line post depicting the bodies of five men whose organs were allegedly harvested to be sold in Europe \u201cfor a handsome sum of money to make [Ukrainian businessman] Igor Kolomoiskii and [former Ukrainian president] Petro Poroshenko richer.\u201d\n\nHowever, the image used in the post had appeared in another publication three years earlier.\n\nIn 2017, after Ukraine\u2019s Health Ministry sought to introduce a pilot kidney donor transplant program, Russian media claimed it would turn Ukraine into a supplier of organs for sale.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Oleksander Lynchevskyi told StopFake.org that such claims were part of a broader Russian disinformation narrative that Ukraine is setting up an organ transplant black market.\n\nEarlier in 2017, Russian media reported a fake story alleging French customs had confiscated a shipment of organs from Ukraine.\n\nAs for the alleged facilities in eastern Ukraine, the list of all Severodonetsk\u2019s medical facilities does not include an organ transplant center.\n\nIn Kramatorsk, there is a regular emergency medical care station.\n\nWhen Polygraph.info contacted medical centers in Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk to determine if any specialized organ transplant facilities had been established in Ukraine during the time the alleged organ-harvesting scheme was underway, representatives from those centers replied that no such centers have ever existed.\n\nDue to the lack of viability of the alleged black market organ transplant scheme, the recycled nature of previously debunked materials the NTV report relies on, and systematic failure to provide evidence to back up its claims, Polygraph.info finds the NTV report to be false.", "lang": "en"}
