The song had been copied word for word from a song written for Pakistani armed forces. It is a song released by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan Armed Forces, on March 23rd for Pakistan Day. Singh replaced \u2018Pakistan\u2019 with \u2018Bharat\u2019 and called it a song for the Indian army on the occasion of Ram Navmi.\n\nHere is a comparison with the Pakistani version\n\nSingh\u2019s musical release was immediately recognised by Pakistanis who called out the plagiarism and posted the original version.\n\nBy the end of the day, even the official spokesperson of Pakistani Armed Forces joined in to mock the BJP MLA\n\nIronically, Singh was in news in the past for calling the old-city area in Hyderabad as Pakistan. The BJP MLA has so far failed to delete his tweet.", "lang": "en"}
