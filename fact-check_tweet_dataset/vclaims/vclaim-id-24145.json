The picture shows the woman buried up to her neck, sipping a spoonful of water.\n\n\u201cAt some places on this earth, women\u2019s rights are limited to getting a spoonful of water before stoning,\u201d the image claims.\n\nThe picture, taken in Colombia, not Iran, shows a woman buried in the ground voluntarily as a form of protest, not as a precursor to execution.\n\n\u201cStill want to tell me that Islam is worthy of being part of our civilization?\u201d the image asks.\n\nThe woman in the photo, though, is neither about to be stoned, nor does she live in Iran, nor any other Muslim-majority country. Taken in Colombia, the image depicts a protest that took place in July 2003. The woman, identified as Maria Gabriela Ruiz by Reuters, participates in the protest voluntarily.\n\nAccording to one photo caption, \u201cThree people, two men and a woman, buried themselves three days ago in protest against the government because 150 displaced persons have not been relocated to a safe sector of Cali.\u201d\n\nThough rarely carried out today, Iranians can be sentenced to death by stoning. Under this practice, women are buried up to their chests and then stoned, while men are buried up to their waists. Stoning in Sharia law is a punishment often associated with adultery or sex outside of marriage.\n\n\u201cAlthough stoning has become more rare in Iran, such sentences are still being issued by Iranian judges. The probability of a stoning sentence to be carried out is slim due to the international sensitivity of the issue,\u201d human rights activist Maryam Nayeb Yazdi told Fox News in 2015. Speaking about a woman who had just been sentenced to death by stoning, Yazdi said \u201cthere is a great chance her sentence may be \u2018converted\u2019 to death by hanging.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported in 2013 that at least 70 people had been stoned to death in Iran since 1980.", "lang": "en"}
