The post was a joke, the man told AFP, adding that he had not sold a kidney; many people missed the humour, he said, adding that he still receives requests for information on how to sell your organs.\n\nIn his Facebook post on July 24 user Phillip Hill wrote that he had sold his kidney to help buy a car. It has been shared more than 40,000 times.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cWhen you need lots of money for a new cruiser, just sell a kidney. They give you $60000 in Thailand. I've got one left so all good.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe same photo montage and caption appear here and here on Facebook, as well as on Twitter here.\n\nHill told AFP via phone that the post was just a joke. He said two of the photos were from when he had surgery recently -- but not to remove a kidney. The two photos at a car dealership were taken when he was buying a new vehicle for work, he added.\n\nHill, who works as a butcher, said the kidney shown in a blue bowl in one of the photos was taken from a lamb.\n\nThe appearance of the kidney in Hill\u2019s post is similar to a photo of a sheep\u2019s kidney, which can be seen on science supply company site Science Resource Box here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had 300 people on Messenger asking me how to sell their kidneys,\u201d Hill told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s just gone ballistic.\u201d\n\nIn a post on the Facebook page for his business, Alpine Mobile Butcher, Hill also states that he did not sell his kidney -- and includes a photo he says shows where he got the original image of the organ from.\n\nHill writes in the post: \u201cHey everyone this is doing the rounds. Fyi I didn\u2019t sell my kidney but yes I got a new cruiser for work. Here is the man I got the kidney off. We all had a good laugh\u201d\n\nThe hoax was written about in articles by Australian news outlets Pedestrian and 7 News, as well as New Zealand website Newshub.", "lang": "en"}
