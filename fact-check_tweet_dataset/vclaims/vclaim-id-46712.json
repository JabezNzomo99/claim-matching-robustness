No, it's misleading: There was no new eruption on Christmas Day 2019 despite a video being shared online that purports to offer an \"update\" on the Hawaiian volcano.\n\nThe story originated from a video published by Fobos Planet on December 25, 2019, titled \"HAWAII UPDATE -- Kilauea volcano eruption (December 25, 2019)\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe video and post are misleading and could be considered clickbait. Off the top of the video, a caption notes the footage is from \"Hawaii 2018,\" when the Kilauea volcano last erupted. At the 51-second mark, a new subtitle over drone video labels the shots \"Hawaii, December 2019.\"\n\nHowever, at the 1:28 mark, the footage again shows lava flow and fires, which are from last year. There is no on-screen caption to note that the shots have reverted to video from 2018. This could imply that the eruption is new and part of the \"update\" the poster is sharing.\n\nThe headline also adds \"December 25, 2019\" in parentheses, which might suggest there is a new eruption.\n\nThe video contains a mashup of various shots, but the source of the footage is not credited. The description for the post has been completely lifted from a Gizmodo article posted on December 11, 2019.\n\nLead Stories contacted the USGS, which referred us to its most recent status update on Kilauea:\n\nLead Stories also reached out to Fobos Planet to inquire about the source of the video, but we did not receive a reply.", "lang": "en"}
