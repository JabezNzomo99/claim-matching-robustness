The claim is false; the photo has previously circulated in Egyptian media reports about animal sacrifice during Eid al-Adha.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on August 26, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared more than 99,000 times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe latest situation in Kashmir, only valiant Muslim will share , the terrorist Modi should stop ongoing atrocities in Kashmir, O Allah help the oppressed Kashmiris Ameen\u201d\n\nIndia revoked Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s special status on August 5, 2019, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe same photo was also published on Facebook here and here, where it has been shared more than 7,200 times, and on Twitter here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false.

Let\u2019s not cover it with animals blood and slaughter waste. Practice you religious rites in the places intended for such purposes (by the law).\n\n\u201cWhat we see in the photos is an arbitrary behavior. They enjoy, with their children, scenes of blood and they delight in seeing the streets polluted.\n\n\u201cI, myself rejoice the EID, not these scenes.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s higher quality version of the photo shows people standing over animals\u2019 bodies. Below is a screenshot of the photo, with a some of the animals\u2019 bodies circled in red by AFP:\n\nEgyptian authorities recently vowed to crack down on the outdoor slaughter of animals on the eve of Eid al-Adha. Here is an AFP story about the developments.\n\nAFP could not independently verify the location of the photo.\n\nThis report about Eid al-Adha celebrations in Egypt published by VOA on August 11, 2019, states animals were slaughtered next to the Sultan Hassan mosque in Cairo.", "lang": "en"}
