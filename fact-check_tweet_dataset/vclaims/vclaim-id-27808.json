There is also no known medical condition named \"Pokicardial Disaphasia\". Selleck did star in \"Runaway\" and in \"Quigley Down Under\" (notice the slightly different spelling).\n\nSelleck is also not a Trump supporter: he wrote in a candidate during the last election:\n\nThere is also the huge satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page if you still needed it after all that:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
