Be sure to tally your vote with the VVPAT slip. Pls forward this to as many people as possible.\"\n\nBOOM searched on Facebook with the same text and found that this message was viral accompanied by a demonstration video of EVM VVPAT.\n\nClick here to view the post and here for an archive.\n\nBOOM contacted Sheyphali Sharan, official spokesperson of the Election Commission of India (ECI), who said that the WhatsApp forward was \"incorrect and baseless\".\n\nBOOM also checked the the fourth Edition of 'Manual on Electronic Voting Machine' and ' manual' on the Election Commission Of India (ECI) website, and found no mention that a voter should not remove their finger from the button until the VVPAT slip comes out.\n\n\"When a vote is cast, a slip is printed on the VVPAT printer containing the serial number, name, and symbol of the candidate and remains exposed through a transparent window for 7 seconds. Thereafter, this printed slip automatically gets cut and falls in sealed drop box of the VVPAT,\" states the manual on the VVPAT.\n\nRead the 4th Edition of Manual on Electronic Voting Machine and VVPAT here.", "lang": "en"}
