One quote \u2014 his mocking of a disabled reporter \u2014 is viewed by a person in a wheelchair. Trump certainly said this, and we have written extensively on this case before.\n\nAnother quote concerns Trump\u2019s assertion that he didn\u2019t think Sen. John McCain was a war hero because he had been captured. This scene features an elderly man wearing a veterans cap. The ad, which will run in the battleground states of North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Iowa, ends with the words: \u201cDonald Trump: Unfit to be President.\u201d\n\nTrump made this statement in 1994 during an interview with ABC News, after saying he had made a mistake by allowing his first wife, Ivana Trump, to take a management role at one of his casinos. Here\u2019s the context in which he made this statement. The ad melds two separate parts of an interview, in which he talks about the employment of Ivana and also his second wife, Marla Maples.\n\n\u201cI think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in business for yourself, I really think it\u2019s a bad idea to put your wife working for you. I think it\u2019s a really bad idea. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana.\u201d He said that after he noticed a change in her demeanor while she was working for him, that changed his feelings toward her. \u201cIvana would get angry at somebody over the telephone, all of a sudden, who was at the casino, and she\u2019d start shouting. And I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want my wife shouting at somebody like that, I really don\u2019t want that,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd a softness disappeared,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere was a great softness to Ivana, and she still has that softness, but during this period of time, she became an executive, not a wife.\u201d\n\nTrump also expressed mixed feelings about allowing Maples to take a job. \u201cI have days where I think it\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I have days where, if I come home \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to sound too much like a chauvinist \u2014 but when I come home and dinner\u2019s not ready, I go through the roof.\u201d\n\nDuring a May 26 appearance in North Dakota, on the day he secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, Trump focused on energy policy and crime rates, and how he would make the United States great again. At one point he said:\n\nAs can be seen, this attack ad takes Trump\u2019s statement out of context. He\u2019s talking about making the country wealthy \u2013 not an individual\u2019s wealth. One could argue that Trump is too focused on associating wealth with greatness, but listening to the rest of his speech, it\u2019s clear that he was talking about increasing incomes for all Americans.\n\nOnce again, we are puzzled why this pro-Clinton group feels the need to push the envelope with Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Two of the quotes are quite damning, but are rendered accurately. The quote about a wife working is missing some context but the essence of Trump\u2019s attitude is captured. But the quote about how you need to be wealthy in order to be great is simply devoid of context", "lang": "en"}
