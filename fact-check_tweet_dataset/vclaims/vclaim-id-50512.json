Experts told the Daily Caller that lifeboats were not restricted to only white women and children.\n\nMore than 1,500 passengers and crew died on the Titanic after the passenger ship hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic on its maiden voyage in 1912.\n\n\u201cTitanic victim Malinda Borden was drowned at sea as she was working aboard the Titanic,\u201d claims a Feb. 27 Facebook post. \u201cLife boats (sic) were made available to white women and white children only. The Black workers were not listed among the passengers or victims. They were only listed among property that was lost.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of a woman with the surname Borden on any Titanic passenger or crew list. A search of the Titanic records housed in the British National Archives and the Library of Virginia turned up no matches.\n\n\u201cThe only blacks on board were Joseph Laroche and his two children,\u201d said historian Don Lynch of the Titanic Historical Society in an email to the Caller. \u201cHis wife was white.\u201d\n\nLaroche, a French-educated Haitian engineer, perished on the Titanic but his French wife, Juliette, and their two children escaped the sinking ship on a lifeboat, according to the Titanic Historical Society. Their names appear on the Titanic\u2019s second-class passenger list.\n\nThere were, according to Lynch, no black crew members on the ship. (RELATED: When Did Black People Get The Right To Vote?)\n\n\u201cThe Titanic carried passengers who were black, white, Hispanic, Asian, etc. Some of each survived,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cLifeboats were not reserved for only white women and children.\u201d\n\nAndrew Lound, author of the book \u201cRMS Titanic: Made in the Midlands,\u201d also confirmed in an email to the Caller that the post\u2019s claim that about lifeboats doesn\u2019t hold up, saying, \u201cIt is clear from the passengers who did get off that the crew did not discriminate on grounds of race, color, nationality, sex or age.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
