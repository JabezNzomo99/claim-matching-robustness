Let\u2019s ask the experts.\n\nStartup research is a niche field that experts say is only addressed in detail by one group \u2014 the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.\n\nOlivia Hwang, a spokeswoman for Wachs\u2019 campaign, said that is the research the candidate was referring to in the radio appearance.\n\nThe foundation, one of the country\u2019s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations, has put out an annual report for years ranking each state\u2019s \"startup activity.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a customized metric that combines number of startup firms per capita, percentage of the adult population that become business owners in a given month and percentage of new entrepreneurs starting businesses because they saw market opportunity (i.e. that weren\u2019t previously unemployed).\n\nTheir , released in May 2017, ranked Wisconsin dead last for the .\n\nNevada, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California and Texas topped the list, while New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Alabama joined Wisconsin at the bottom.\n\nWe should note other measures of Wisconsin\u2019s business climate place Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack, as we noted in a on Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s claim that Wisconsin was a \"Top 10\" state for business.\n\nWisconsin is 15th among all states in business survivability, with 51% of businesses remaining in operation at least five years. And Kauffman rated Wisconsin second in the nation for Main Street Entrepreneurship, another combined metric that looks at the survival rate and the per capita number of businesses and business owners.\n\nWachs, a member of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. , is one of 16 Democrats vying for a spot on the November general election ballot opposite Walker. Major include state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state firefighter union President Mahlon Mitchell; Sen. Kathleen Vinehout of Alma; former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew Flynn; Madison Mayor Paul Soglin; former state Rep. Kelda Roys; and political activist Mike McCabe.\n\nWachs said Wisconsin is last in the nation in startups.\n\nThe go-to national research on the subject shows Wisconsin is indeed last \u2014 and has been for the last three years.", "lang": "en"}
