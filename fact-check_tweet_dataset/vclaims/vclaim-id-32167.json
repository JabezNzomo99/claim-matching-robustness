And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\n\nImmediately after her speech, Thunberg became a target of criticism, with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump among her critics. Macron called Thunberg\u2019s speech and a legal complaint against France and four other nations \u201cvery radical\u201d and said it was likely to \"antagonize societies.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism came in a sarcastic tweet, in which he posted a video of Thunberg\u2019s address to the U.N. and wrote: \"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\"\n\nThunberg responded by putting Trump\u2019s words in her Twitter profile.\n\nVox, a left-leaning American news and opinion website, described the criticism of Thunberg from the U.S. president and some of his supporters as \u201ca torrent of often misogynist and ableist abuse hurled at Thunberg since the speech, with conservatives attacking her demeanor, her looks, her mental health (she has autism), and above all her autonomy, claiming she is \u2018brainwashed\u2019 or a victim of child abuse. Several have compared her speeches to Nazi propaganda.\u201d\n\nRussian state media also joined the criticism of Thunberg, with RT.com accusing the young activist of \u201cdeliberate fearmongering\u201d and Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti state news agency calling her a \u201clab infusoria\u201d \u2013 an obsolete term used to identify a group of fresh waters microorganisms.\n\nThe website of the Russian weekly \u201cArgumenty i Fakty\u201d (AIF.ru, translated into English as Arguments and Fact), which is owned by the Moscow city government, went even further, placing Greta Thunberg on the same level as the Islamic State terrorists and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\n\nAIF.ru, which claims a leadership position among \u201call Russian print media\u201d with a readership reaching \u201chalf of Russia\u2019s adult population,\u201d has received a praise from President Vladimir Putin for \u201cpublishing deep, interesting polemical articles.\u201d\n\nIn a front-page article in its world politics section, which was not marked as an opinion but as a news report, AIF.ru analyzed every aspect of Thunberg\u2019s short biography, speculating about her mental health and her parents\u2019 \u201cmishandling\u201d of their duties towards their child.\n\nAIF.ru designated an entire section of its piece to drawing parallels between Thunberg and the teenage girls making accusations of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts in the 17th century. The Salem girls displayed psychiatric symptoms similar to those \u201cevident\u201d in Thunberg\u2019s behavior, the Russian newspaper claimed.\n\nAIF also said Thunberg\u2019s activities are funded and supported by George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and that the emissions-free yacht on which Thunberg sailed to New York was \u201cbuilt under the order of one of the representatives of the Rothschild clan.\u201d\n\nAllegations of ties to George Soros and the Rothschilds are common in Russian disinformation campaigns and are used to claim a deep worldwide conspiracy.\n\nAIF also attempted to discredit Thunberg\u2019s environmental activities as irrelevant to the real problems of the earth. Others, including environment scientists, have praised Thunberg\u2019s activism and its impact on the global environmental movement.\n\n\u201cI have been working in climate science and advocating for climate action for most of my working life. Even so, Greta has inspired me to do more to reduce emissions and share the latest science, with Greta\u2019s words always in mind,\u201d wrote Brenda Ekwurzel, a U.S. senior climate scientist and director of climate science for the Climate & Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Ekwurzel was writing in reaction to a speech Thunberg delivered before the U.S. Congress on September 18.\n\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists magazine listed two dozen environmental science reports published between the 1960s and 2018 that are consistent with the data Thunberg presented in her speeches.\n\n\u201cLike most people on Earth, Greta Thunberg is not a climate scientist,\u201d wrote Ethan Siegel in Forbes magazine. \u201cShe has no formal scientific training of any type, nor does she possess any expert-level knowledge or expert-level skills in this regime.\u201d Still, Siegel noted, she \u201crecognizes the unparalleled value that scientific expertise brings to our world\u201d and \u201cher starting point for how to move forward in the world is to begin from a position of scientific consensus.\u201d\n\nThe Forbes report described Thunberg as inspiring a new generation of girls to become \u201ceco-warriors\u201d moving ecofeminism to new levels.", "lang": "en"}
