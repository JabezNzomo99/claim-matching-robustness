{"title": "Is 'Fortnite: Battle Royale' Ending?", "subtitle": "Rumors that a popular game was ending due to a copyright infringement lawsuit were based on a single fake tweet.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-04-13T09:28:05+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10334", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fortnite-battle-royale-ending/", "vclaim": "In April 2018, the gaming community was concerned by an image purportedly showing a message from the official Twitter account of Fortnite (published by Epic Games), announcing that they would be ending their popular \u201cBattle Royale\u201d because of a copyright infringement lawsuit:\n\nDue to a law suit against PubG on copyright infringement. We are sorry to inform you that Fortnite Battle Royale Will be coming to an end May 20 2018. Save the world will still be in development and we will roll out ASAP. Thank you all for the support.\n\nThis is a hoax tweet. This message does not appear on the timeline for Fortnite\u2019s official Twitter account; Epic Games has also not made any announcement about Fortnite\u2019s reported termination; and finally, Fortnite\u2019s Twitter has been posting about future updates to the game, not about ending it.\n\nMany gamers may have been fooled by this hoax tweet because of its timing: it was posted shortly after Bluehole Studio \u2014 the creator of PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds \u2014 filed an actual copyright infringement lawsuit against NetEase, a studio that makes battle royale-style games such as Rules of Survival and Knives Out. Bluehole Studio has not, however, filed a lawsuit over Fortnite: Battle Royale.\n\nThe hoax also coincided with a server issue that temporarily took Fortnite: Battle Royale offline. In other words, it was the perfect time to post a fake message from the company about the game\u2019s termination.", "lang": "en"}
