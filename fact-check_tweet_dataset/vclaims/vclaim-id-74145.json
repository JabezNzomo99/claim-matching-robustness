The audio of the footage has been muted.\n\nThe clip is being shared with a false caption which claims that an Indian Air Force pilot was taken captive after the aerial skirmish. It is doing the rounds in the backdrop of the standoff between the two countries over redrawing of maps and disputed territories.

India contacted an airstrike in Belahiya. In the resulting, we've shot down one Indian HAL Rudra and captured one Indian pilot. Now We'll not return pilot to india (Sic)'.\n\nNetizens further claim that the Indian media has not been reporting on the incident.\n\nThe video has been shared on Facebook with the same claim.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the frames of the viral video and found several web portals carrying the same video. We checked several websites where longer version of the same clip has been uploaded.\n\nWhile the clip shared with the false claim is muted, in the original clip one can clearly hear a group frantically chanting 'Allah hu Akbar' as the chopper catches fire. The video shared above was uploaded on the website Military.com on October 17, 2012.\n\nThe description with the video reads 'Syrian rebels shoot down a Syrian Army helicopter over the capital causing it to explode in midair'.\n\nWe also found the same video uploaded on the YouTube page of the English daily, The Telegraph on October 17, 2012.\n\nBelow is a frame by frame comparison of the same.\n\nThe description with the video reads 'Syrian rebels shoot down helicopter'.\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph YouTube channel further stated, 'The moment a Syrian military helicopter was apparently shot down by rebels has been recorded by an amateur cameraman. Rebels downed a helicopter on Wednesday as troops fought to take back a key Syrian town, a watchdog said, as international peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warned the conflict risks setting the region ablaze'.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph news report, the incident appeared to have happened when the helicopter was reportedly flying over Idlib, in Syria's north, when it was gunned down.\n\nAlso read Was Modi's Visit To Leh Hospital Staged?
