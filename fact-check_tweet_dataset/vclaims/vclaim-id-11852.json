The viral posts insinuate the incident happened after Congress came to power in the recently held elections in Rajasthan.\n\nThe post is viral with text in Hindi that loosely translates to, \"In Utambar Rajasthan, Muslim workers entered Rajput households and molested sisters and daughters (women) and attacked homes. If this the case in five hours, then how will it be in in five years?\"\n\nA Twitter user by the handle @Ashok65 tweeted the video on December 15, 2018 with the same caption but deleted it soon after many netizens pointed out that the video was not from Rajasthan. BOOM was able to get a screenshot of Ashok's tweet.\n\nScreenshot of the tweet claiming the video was from Rajasthan.\n\nThe above tweet went viral compelling Rajasthan police to verify the claim who confirmed that the video was not from Rajasthan.\n\nBOOM analysed the video and ran a reverse image search of keyframe from the video and found the same photo used in a new article published in the Hindi daily Jagran. The article in Jagran was published on June 13 and had screenshots from the same video that was viral.\n\nThe screenshot of the story that states the incident happened in Ranchi, Jharkhand\n\nAccording to the article published by Jagran, the incident happened after protests broke out during a motorcycle rally organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) workers in Ranchi in June this year to mark the completion of four years of Bharatiya Janata Party coming to power in the centre.\n\nBOOM contacted Ranchi police who confirmed that the video was from an incident from June in the Daily Market area of Ranchi city. Sujata Kumari Veenapani, Superitendent of Police, Ranchi city told BOOM that it was an old incident. \"There were clashes between two groups about a motorcycle rally being organised in the city. On the day of the rally, a police officer from the Lower Bazaar police station who was passing by was caught in the protests and beaten up by the crowd. We had also registered an FIR in the case,\" Veenapani said.\n\nBOOM also spoke to Santosh Kumar, Station House Officer (SHO) of the Lower Bazaar police station who confirmed the incident and said that the attacked police officer was one Anil Kumar Gupta, Sub-inspector. \"The incident broke out due to some sloganeering at the motorbike rally but soon turned communal. SI Gupta was not the only policeman to be attacked. Many civilians and uniformed policemen from various police stations who were trying to control the crowd were attacked by the unruly mob. At least three to four FIRs were registered and many people questioned,\"Kumar said.\n\nMeanwhile, the website Op-India, published a story claiming that the Rajasthan police had \"declared a true incident as \u2018fake news\u2019 on Twitter\".\n\nOpIndia alleged that Rajasthan police had declated a true incident as fake.\n\nOpIndia claimed that the Rajasthan police declared the Utambar incident as fake\n\nThis story was later updated by OpIndia to say, \"The Twitter user who had deleted his tweet appeared to have attached a wrong video, however, the screenshot used by Rajasthan police in their warning did not include thumbnail of the video, in absence of which, a real incident (as seen in the text part of the screenshot used by Rajasthan police) was being tagged as \u2018fake news\u2019 by Rajasthan police and believed so by many users.\"\n\nBOOM checked Rajasthan police's tweet to ascertain whether Rajasthan police had indeed \"declared a true incident as false\" and found OpIndia's claim to be misleading. Genuine images or visuals shared with a false or incorrect context comes under the definition of fake news.\n\nOn the left is the viral now deleted tweet and on the right is Rajasthan Police's tweet", "lang": "en"}
