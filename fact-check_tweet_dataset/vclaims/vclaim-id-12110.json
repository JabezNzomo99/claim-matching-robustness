It does, through diplomatic channels, encourage other countries to adopt certain policies,\u201d former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told Polygraph.info.\n\nPifer believes it is \u201centirely plausible\u201d that in recent months the United States has urged the Hungarian government to take steps to protect itself against Chinese cyber espionage and to support Ukraine against Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cHungary has been weak on those issues,\u201d Pifer said.\n\n\u201cBut a senior Hungarian official said Mr. Orban strongly objects to U.S. pressure aimed at curbing the influence of Moscow and Beijing in Europe,\u201d the WSJ reported, still falling well short of Ria Novosti\u2019s assertion that the U.S. 'ordered' the Hungarian government to take action.\n\nAs for the RIA Novosti\u2019s mistranslation of the WSJ article, Pifer calls it \u201cdeliberate\u201d and intended \u201cto support a Kremlin propaganda line\u201d that the United States controls its NATO allies and other European partners.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has told U.S. diplomats that he wants his country to be \u201cneutral, like Austria,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported. However, it also quoted unnamed close allies of Orban as saying \u201che wants to remain a troop-contributing member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and values the security Hungary gets from the alliance.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
