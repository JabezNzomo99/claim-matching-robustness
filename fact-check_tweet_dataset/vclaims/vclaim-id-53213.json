Chavhanke played a video and asserted that the Hyderabad MP danced on October 19, a day after Tiwari was murdered.\n\nChavhanke shared the broadcast from his personal Twitter handle and linked the AIMIM chief to the murder \u2013 \u201cOwaisi, who mourns the death of thieves and terrorists, is dancing with such joy after Kamlesh Tiwari\u2019s sacrifice. It seems as if he has accomplished some mission. Yogi Adityanath, Amit Shah, Narendra Modi, one never knows how many Kamlesh Tiwari will be murdered if this man roams freely.\u201d\n\nThe broadcast tweeted by Chavhanke showed barely a minute and a half of the nearly one-hour-long show. The complete broadcast was uploaded on Sudarshan News\u2019 official YouTube page on October 21 titled, \u201c\u0915\u092e\u0932\u0947\u0936 \u0924\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0927\u092e\u0915\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0913\u0935\u0948\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0917\u093f\u0930\u092b\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u094b Arrest the one who wished devastation for Kamlesh Tiwari.\u201d\n\nThis video of Asaduddin Owaisi was taken a day before Kamlesh Tiwari was shot dead. The clip was uploaded by ANI on October 18 and the news agency clearly mentions that it was shot on October 17 \u2013 \u201cMaharashtra: AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi performs a dance step after the end of his rally at Paithan Gate in Aurangabad. (17.10.2019).\u201c Tiwari was murdered on October 18.\n\nThe AIMIM chief\u2019s video was taken during a rally in Aurangabad ahead of the Maharashtra polls. As reported by Zee News, Owaisi was not really dancing but promoting his party\u2019s symbol, a kite, by performing a kite-flying move.\n\nOwaisi can also be heard stating the same to the media. Saying that he was imitating pulling the string of a kite, the Muslim leader alleged that a song was morphed into the video, \u201cI was far way from Music and will remain far away\u2026\u201d\n\nSudarshan News, therefore, ran a provocative broadcast using a piece of misinformation. The news channel and its editor-in-chief have often been found circulating misinformation along communal lines. Earlier, the organisation played a video morphed with slogans calling to kill RSS workers. The channel also spread the false news that a \u2018decree\u2019 was issued by a mosque against the UP police.", "lang": "en"}
