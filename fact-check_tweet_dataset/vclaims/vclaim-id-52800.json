Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once said, \u201cOwning guns is not a right\u2026 If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post.\n\nThe viral image features two panels: one of Ocasio-Cortez overlaid with the alleged quote and another of a scene from the movie \u201cThe Cat in the Hat.\u201d That panel includes text that says, \u201cYou\u2019re not just wrong, you\u2019re stupid.\u201d (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Say, \u2018Jesus Was A Lot Like Trump, Both Con Artists\u2019?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made such a statement about gun ownership. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for media outlets attributing the quote to her but only found other fact-checkers debunking it. The statement also does not appear on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter accounts or in ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets.\n\nFurther adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledges the Second Amendment on her campaign website. In one section, she advocates that the \u201cFounding Fathers did not have assault weapons in mind when they wrote\u201d the Second Amendment, and she states that cities and states \u201chave managed to cut gun violence significantly without running afoul\u201d of it in another section.\n\nThe congresswoman has been a popular target for misinformation since getting elected to Congress, with this misattributed quote circulating since at least January 2019, according to the fact-checking website Snopes.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
