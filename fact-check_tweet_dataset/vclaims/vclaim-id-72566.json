But other states beefed up, Stekler said, adding: \"The biggest program is in Louisiana \u2014 so big that they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled \u2018Don\u2019t Mess With Texas\u2019 in New Orleans!\"\n\nBy phone, Stekler told us his conclusion about the Louisiana incentives causing the movie centered on Texas to be made in the Crescent City was just \"common sense. If it\u2019s a Texas-based film, why would you film in Louisiana \u2014 unless they were getting a much better deal?\" he said.\n\nHe urged us to consult the Texas Film Commission, which is part of Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office.\n\nAbbott\u2019s office did not address our inquiries, but we spotted a summary of the Texas program\u2019s declared effects in a January 2015 by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Development Incentives. By offering rebates to successful applicants with confirmed in-state expenditures, Texas had awarded nearly $147 million in rebates through October 2014, the report said. In turn, awardees spent more than $1 billion in the state over the years, it said.\n\nNext, we turned to checking on the Louisiana parts of Stekler\u2019s statement.\n\nAn online search landed a May 2014 New Orleans Times-Picayune saying \"Don't Mess With Texas,\" an action-comedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, was to be filmed in Louisiana starting that month. For Witherspoon, the story said, the production marked a return to New Orleans: She was born there in 1976 while her father was in school.\n\nThe story made no mention of incentives causing the film not to be shot in Texas.\n\nBut incentives are in play. Christopher Stelly, who oversees the state\u2019s film outreach, confirmed the film\u2019s producers submitted an application for incentive credits and anticipated spending about $34 million in Louisiana. As of February 2015, Stelly said by email, the state hadn\u2019t fielded an audit to validate any related spending so credits had yet to be awarded.\n\nWe asked if Louisiana has the nation\u2019s biggest film incentives program, as Stekler wrote.\n\n\"We have one of the more popular programs,\" Stelly said by phone. A state spokesman, Ron Thibodeaux, forwarded an written for a state agency indicating that in 2012, $218 million in incentives were awarded to producers who spent $717 million making movies in Louisiana (up from $677 million spending the year before).\n\nBy a recent news account, the Louisiana program is bigger than other states\u2019 programs. The Dec. 2, 2014, in the Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper, called the state\u2019s film tax incentive program \"one of the state\u2019s most popular and fastest-growing giveaways, and thanks to its industry-friendly provisions, the Pelican State has eclipsed Hollywood as the feature film production capital of the nation.\" Of 107 projects shot in the state in 2013, the story said, 49 were feature films \u2014 more than were filmed in any other state. Also, the story said, Louisiana\u2019s program is the \"richest of its kind\" in the country, covering \"between 30 and 35 percent of in-state production costs, including eight-figure actor salaries, as long as a film\u2019s local costs top $300,000.\"\n\nA graphic with the story, attributed to , which vends payroll services to productions, indicates each of the states touching Texas offers greater tax incentives for making movies:\n\nSource: News story, , the Advocate, Dec. 2, 2014 (Map information attributed to Cast and Crew Entertainment Services)\n\nWe asked Stelly if the movie singled out by Stekler was made in Louisiana due to its incentives outpacing incentives available in Texas.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know. But generally, Stelly said, \"the way the business works today, incentives do play a major part in the decision-making process. But again, at the end of the day, you have to look at what the area has to offer. How is the crew base? What is the infrastructure? Do you have what it takes?\" Louisiana, he said, has hosted projects set \"anywhere from New York to outer space,\" including a 2011 crime drama.\n\nWe asked a publicist for the film itself about whether Louisiana\u2019s incentives caused the movie to be made there. Jayna Zelman, representing MGM, declined to comment though she emailed a web link to stating the movie, set for release in May 2015, is lately named \"Hot Pursuit.\" Plot summary: \"A police officer and a prisoner are on the run in Texas.\" A says the movie\u2019s previous working title was \"Don\u2019t Mess With Texas.\"\n\nStekler said Louisiana\u2019s film incentives program is so big, \"they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled \u2018Don\u2019t Mess With Texas\u2019 in New Orleans!\"\n\nLouisiana has a strong incentives program and a chase movie set in Texas was filmed there; its makers are primed to receive incentive aid. However, we see no confirmation Louisiana\u2019s incentives explain why the movie was shot on the not-Texas side of the Sabine.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
