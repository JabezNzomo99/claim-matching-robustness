Damon\u2019s supposed relocation was reported by the New York Post\u2019s \u201cPage Six\u201d celebrity gossip column, which cited an unnamed \u201ctop Hollywood source.\u201d\n\nBut Jennifer Allen, Damon\u2019s publicist, categorically denied that her client was \u201cheaded Down Under,\u201d as the Post declared in a photo caption, or that he was purchasing property to be near fellow actor Chris Hemsworth in Byron Bay, New South Wales, as Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported based on speculation.\n\n\u201cMatt has visited Australia several times recently, but he has not bought a house there nor is he moving there,\u201d Allen wrote in an email to the Boston Globe for a March 15 article.\n\nLast month, the false story about the actor was recirculated on Facebook as a meme stating, \u201cMatt Damon is moving his family to Australia because of Trump.\u201d As of Oct. 4, that meme has been shared more than 5,600 times since it was posted Sept. 8.\n\nDamon supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and he has been critical of Trump. He\u2019s just not moving out of the country because of him.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nSmith, Emily, and Mohr, Chris. \u201cIs Matt Damon taking family to Australia because of Trump?\u201d New York Post. 15 Mar 2018.\n\nHansen, Jane. \u201cMatt moves in: Welcome to my neighbourhood.\u201d Daily Telegraph (Australia). 4 Mar 2018.\n\n\u201cSpokeswoman: Damon not fleeing to Australia in Trump huff.\u201d Associated Press. 17 Mar 2018.\n\nRothman, et al. \u201cMatt Damon on Donald Trump Possibly Being President: \u2018It Makes Me Nervous.'\u201d ABC News. 28 Jul 2016.", "lang": "en"}
