It is something many readers have asked about this week in light of the FBI\u2019s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton. So we are highlighting Brown\u2019s comment as an example.\n\nRegarding Brown\u2019s quote in the ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d interview, his spokeswoman Jennifer Donohue said the senator was comparing Clinton\u2019s track record of releasing records \u2014 email and otherwise \u2014 compared to her Republican rival, Donald Trump. In the context of the entire interview, during which Brown highlighted policy differences between Clinton and Trump, Brown was making the point that Clinton has been more forthcoming about federal tax returns and policy details than Trump, and was citing her email release as an example, Donohue said.\n\n\u201cIt has been widely reported that Secretary Clinton released thousands of pages emails and former Secretaries of State did not. The fact is the public, the press and historians will have information available about Secretary Clinton\u2019s work at the State Department that is not available for past Secretaries,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cBut the most important point Senator Brown made on Sunday is that when it comes to transparency, the American people know far more about Hillary Clinton than they do about Donald Trump. \u2026 Donald Trump has relied largely on rhetoric in the absence of substantive policy proposals.\u201d\n\n[Update, Sept. 8, 2016: House Democrats released a new email that shed a new light on Clinton\u2019s comparison to one predecessor: Colin Powell. On Jan. 23, 2009, Clinton emailed Powell to ask about the restrictions he had on his BlackBerry, and whether he used it as a personal device. Powell\u2019s answer suggests he set up his private email to evade public records disclosure. Powell explained he had a \u201cpersonal computer that was hooked up to a private line \u2026 so I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. \u2026 Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d\n\nThis email shows that the comparison to her predecessors may not just be a matter of political spin, but rather rooted in this conversation. Clinton consulted Powell, a predecessor, about his personal email use, and sought advice as to \u201chow to bring along State Dept.\u201d to keep her BlackBerry. However, Clinton went beyond Powell\u2019s advice and set up a private server, which remains unique to Clinton. This new evidence does not warrant a change in rating, which will remain at Three Pinocchios.]\n\nThe only person who regularly used emails is a singular predecessor, Powell. Powell did use his personal account on the job, and by his own admission no longer has access to the account he used then. So while Clinton did turn over more email records than he, she was the only one uniquely in position to do so upon the State Department\u2019s request. This does not absolve Powell for not being able to locate his records a decade later, but the rules for private email retention and non-department email use in general were less clear under Powell.", "lang": "en"}
