Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \u201cLet\u2019s begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating from the NRA. Let\u2019s also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we\u2019ve got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers.\u201d\n\nSanders: \u201cNumber one, just to set the record straight, I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. OK? \u2026 So anyone who says, \u2018Oh, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut,\u2019 you know, that\u2019s just nonsense. Number two, I come from a state which has virtually no gun control. None. And you\u2019ve had liberal Democratic governors, conservative Republican governors, who supported that position. I went to Washington, I voted to ban certain types of semi-automatic weapons. That was a pretty tough vote. I cast that vote. I cast a vote for instant background checks. I want to see them strengthened. So count me in as somebody who believes that we need to bring about a situation where we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not get them.\u201d\n\nSanders: \u201cWell, I think we are all disgusted and horrified by these mass killings. And as the president indicated, we\u2019re tired of sending condolences and we know that it could happen tomorrow, it could happen again a month from now. I have voted, as I said a moment ago, for what I think is the most important provision \u2014 and that is strong instant background checks to make sure that people who should not have guns do not have guns. And I have voted to eliminate this gun show loophole, which is what we have got to do.\u201d\n\nThe problem was that the technology for such an instant check did not exist. Gun control advocates argued the Staggers bill would kill the Brady bill, rendering the background check provision ineffective. Criminal court and prison records were incomplete and not computerized in about half the states, the Miami Herald reported in 1991. So that meant the information could not be incorporated into the FBI\u2019s criminal identification system to be checked with a phone call, as the Staggers bill required. This technology was projected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars over several years.\n\n\u201cHe can give you all the lofty reasons he wants for opposing Brady \u2014 but it was strictly a survival vote,\u201d maintains a source close to Vermont politics. \u201cHe wants to get reelected next year. Period.\u201d Sanders dismisses the notion that he \u201ccaved to the NRA.\u201d He offers a multitude of vague reasons for opposing the bill, not surprisingly ending with lofty principle. \u201cI have a problem with a Congress and media that spend an enormous amount of time talking about the Brady bill, which even the strongest proponents know will not have a major impact on crime. I view it as hypocritical.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed in 2013 about his gun policy votes, including on the assault weapons ban, Sanders offered little explanation beyond his standard response: \u201cThis is not one of my major issues. It\u2019s an issue out there. I\u2019ve told you how I feel about it. If there\u2019s anything else you want to ask me about, I\u2019m happy to answer. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d He said even if Congress \u201cpassed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don\u2019t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.\u201d\n\nEric Davis, Middlebury College professor emeritus of political science who has followed Sanders\u2019s political career, said: \u201cGuns are not an issue that\u2019s really ever been something that he\u2019s placed emphasis on. \u2026 I think he\u2019s realizing this now, and he\u2019s growing in this as he deals with voters that are more diverse, in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. He\u2019s hearing more about African Americans, Latinos and other diverse voters \u2026 in a way that he didn\u2019t have to in Vermont because those voters didn\u2019t make up much of his constituency.\u201d\n\nHe voted in support of several amendments seeking to expand background checks through the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 after the Newtown, Conn., shootings. There is an important distinction here between the \u201cinstant background checks\u201d he supported in the Brady bill. The background check provision in the post-Newtown legislation was to require a check through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for all firearm sales and to prohibit straw purchase firearms. Sanders supported this. The provision in the Brady bill essentially would have rendered background checks moot, because the technology did not exist at the time. Sanders also supported this.", "lang": "en"}
