All three are active in the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe report describes the various types of intelligence operatives Russia has in the Britain -- for example, declared operatives working in the Russian embassy, undeclared operatives working under diplomatic cover who typically pose as embassy staff, and \u201cillegals,\u201d who are undeclared spies living under false identities. It also explains the difference between case officers, who manage agents, and the agents, who gather intelligence to report back to the case officers. It mentions informants, who are ordinary Russian expats that case officers or their agents can call upon for information when the need arises.\n\nIn the executive summary, the Henry Jackson Society report claims \u201cwell-placed intelligence sources\u201d estimate that Russia has 200 case officers in Britain, who manage as many as 500 agents. It does not estimate the number of informants (who are much harder to identify), but estimates that 150,000 Russian expatriates live in London alone.\n\n\u200bAccording to the report, during the Cold War the Soviet Union had an estimated 39 case officers in Britain \u2013 a number that remained the same in 2010. It quotes, Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB officer who was a double agent for Britain\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, as having claimed that Russia increased its number of case officers in the Britain to 51 in 2013. However, when it comes to the claim of 200 case officers running as many as 500 agents in the U.K., the only sources cited are an ex-British intelligence official and a current one. The report also cites a story in The Guardian newspaper about a Royal Navy submariner who claimed in court to have met with Russian agents. In fact, the \u201cagents\u201d were working for the British government as part of a sting operation to catch the defendant, who offered to sell them classified information. Nothing is mentioned in the article about actual Russian informants.\n\nThe statement about half of the Russian expat community being informants comes from interviews with Russian expats, and is based on their opinions. Here is how the claim actually appears in the Henry Jackson Society report:\n\n\u201cPerhaps reflecting the level of paranoia within London\u2019s Russian community, interviewees and interlocutors suggested that anywhere between a quarter and a half of Russian expats were, or have been, informants.\u201d\n\nThus, even the report itself acknowledges that the estimates of some Russian expats may reflect \u201cparanoia.\u201d However, the report itself makes no specific claims about the number of informants. This is particularly important to note, because shortly after the report was released, another British newspaper, The Telegraph, reported on it in an article headlined: \u201cHalf of the Russians in London are spies, claims new report.\u201d This is not what the report claims.\n\nBut while some media outlets may have sensationalized the Henry Jackson Society report\u2019s findings, it is clear the report has flaws. In addition to the above-mentioned problems with citations and anonymous sources, the estimate of 200 case officers currently working in Britain seems dubious. In March of this year, the British government expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the Skripal poisoning, the largest expulsion in 30 years. At that time, the British government listed 58 Russian diplomats in the country. Therefore, after the expulsion, Russia would have been left with approximately 35 diplomats in Britain, and since the ambassador cannot be a case officer himself, that would have left 34 potential case officers with official diplomatic cover. Since the report doesn\u2019t provide more details about its sources and claims, it\u2019s difficult to say whether the figure of 200 case officers in Britain, which is considerably higher than the number during the Cold War, is accurate.", "lang": "en"}
