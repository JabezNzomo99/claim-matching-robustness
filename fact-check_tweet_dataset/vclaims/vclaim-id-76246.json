Bernie Sanders\u2019 surging campaign.\n\nHere\u2019s what Fallon said in full:\n\n\"There\u2019s an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucusgoer universe in Nevada,\" he said to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on Feb. 9, 2016. \"But it\u2019s still a state that is 80 percent white voters. You have a caucus-style format, and he\u2019ll have the momentum coming out of New Hampshire presumably, so there\u2019s a lot of good reasons he should do well.\"\n\nGiven Nevada\u2019s population diversity, that \"80 percent white\" claim has struck several observers, including , as highly questionable. Clinton herself has even addressed the claim, saying in that Nevada is \"one of the most diverse and exciting states in our country.\"\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no official state office that collects the ethnicity of registered voters, so any claims related to demographic turnout rely mainly on aging exit polls from elections four to eight years ago. And due to Nevada\u2019s recent emergence as an early state in the primary season, only the competitive 2008 contest stands as a valid comparison to the upcoming caucus.\n\nWhite voters made up around 65 percent of the vote according to , with black and Hispanic voters each taking around 15 percent of the vote. About voters, or 30 percent of registered Nevada Democrats, participated in the 2008 caucuses.\n\nThe Clinton campaign pointed to comments it that some caucus modeling \"showed an 80 percent turnout in Nevada come Feb. 20\" for white voters.\n\nBut there\u2019s little evidence that increasing minority participation in Nevada elections would suddenly reverse itself. Joe Lenski, an executive with , said there\u2019s no indication that massive growth in white voter turnout is coming in Nevada.\n\n\"The three times we\u2019ve measured either caucus or general turnout in the last eight years has given us no number that high,\" he said.\n\nDemographic trends in Nevada don\u2019t seem to favor the Clinton campaign\u2019s position.\n\nNevada is poised to become one of a handful of states with a majority-minority population within the next five years . Nevada\u2019s population has trended to slightly older and more Hispanic since 2008, state demographer Jeff Highcastle said.\n\nAccording to from the U.S. Census Bureau, whites make up a slim majority of the state\u2019s population, while Latinos make up more than a quarter at 28 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge difference from Iowa and New Hampshire, where census data shows close to 90 percent of the population in both states is white.\n\nIt\u2019s important to clarify that the state\u2019s population diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into diversity at the polls, especially with low-turnout caucuses.\n\nScant polling and the wild-card of same-day voter registration makes predicting caucus turnout difficult.\n\nBut Hispanic voters do make up a sizable portion of the Nevada electorate. The nonpartisan Pew Research Center finds that around 17 percent of eligible Nevada voters are Hispanic , which ranks sixth nationally.\n\nA Clinton campaign spokesman claimed that Nevada is a state with \"80 percent white voters.\"\n\nEven looking at the best-case scenario, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a sudden reversal in the trend of increasing minority voter participation in Nevada elections. Given past turnout levels and the ethnic makeup of the state, the claim of \"80 percent white voters\" deciding the state\u2019s caucus doesn\u2019t hold up.", "lang": "en"}
