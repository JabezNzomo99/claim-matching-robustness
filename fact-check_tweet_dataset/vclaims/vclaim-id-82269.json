There was never any such agreement \u2014 though Reagan convinced himself there was, based on a misunderstanding.\n\nIn the end, Congress actually held up its end of the bargain pretty well \u2014 and the failure to make certain cuts was the fault of the Reagan administration itself. (In particularly, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger simply refused to comply with the agreement.)\n\nAnyone who utters this claim at the table gets an instant Four Pinocchios!\n\nReagan\u2019s tax cuts produced \u2018more revenue\u2019 and \u2018tens of millions of jobs\u2019\n\nThis fact check examined a specific claim by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who asserted that the Reagan tax cuts paid for themselves \u2014 and then some.\n\nBut we checked the historical record, and Reagan never claimed that would be the case; the Treasury Department confirmed that the Reagan tax cuts reduced revenue.\n\nMoreover, Reagan repeatedly boosted taxes during his term as president, in part to make up for lost revenue from his original tax cut. In other words, the tax cut itself was a money-loser for the government \u2014 and it was not the sole reason for \u201ctens of millions\u201d of jobs.\n\nPaul ended up with Three Pinocchios for this making this claim.", "lang": "en"}
