Among the many unfounded claims about a possible vaccine is this one: that it will \"come with the ID \u2014 a mark.\"\n\nNot just any mark.\n\n\"The ID tells everyone you are free of COVID, and ultimately where you spend eternity,\" says the April 11 Facebook post with an image of a finger pointing to a tattoo. \"I suggest you resist this if you plan to go to heaven someday. That\u2019s what everyone should be scared about #BillGates #MarkoftheBeast Certification of Vaccination ID (COVID) #NotWorthGoingToHellFor.\"\n\nThe post then quotes a Bible verse, Revelation 14:11: \"And the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever. Day and night there will be no rest for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Here\u2019s what we know about vaccine tattoos: More than three years before the first novel coronavirus cases were reported, in July 2016, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started studying how using an invisible ink that could be injected into children along with vaccines could address vaccine tracking challenges in developing countries. The dye would be visible under near-infrared light for up to five years and provide a quick, affordable way of helping health providers know if a child\u2019s vaccinations were current. The Gates Foundation contributed funds for this research.\n\nBut Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study, told Reuters that, to his knowledge, \"there are no plans to use this for coronavirus.\"", "lang": "en"}
