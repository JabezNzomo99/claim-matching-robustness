Can he back that statement up?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-12-08T12:31:01Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82723", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/08/harry-reids-claim-that-the-current-senate-is-the-most-unproductive-in-u-s-history/", "vclaim": "Reid was responding to what he described as constant legislative crowing by Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the new Majority Leader, who he said \u201ccomes to the floor virtually every day and talks about this great new Senate.\u201d In Reid\u2019s view, the current Senate is simply passing legislation now that had been previously blocked by Republicans when they were in the minority.\n\nIt turns out that Reid\u2019s staff only had data going back to 1987, drawn from a report by the Congressional Research Service. The notion that this is the worst Senate in U.S. history was apparently the result of overenthusiastic, extemporaneous speaking. We try not to play gotcha at the Fact Checker, but it\u2019s hard to see how just 28 years of data can be so easily stretched to two centuries, unless you\u2019re Donald Trump.\n\nNevertheless, let\u2019s look at the evidence. Reid is focused on two facts\u2014number of bills passed and number of nominations confirmed. Those are supposedly the \u201cproducts produced over time\u201d by the Senate. His staff asked the CRS to compare those metrics for the first year of each Senate, up to Dec. 5. The details are in the graphic below.\n\nBut in term of confirmations, the McConnell Senate certainly lags. As of Dec. 5, confirmations have totaled 136 (though another three took place on Dec. 7), compared to 213 for the 113th, 279 in the 112th and 426 in the 111th (the start of Obama\u2019s first term). So that\u2019s a total of 293 for the 114th Congress, slightly lower than 312 for the 113th Congress\u2014and well below the average of 569 over this time period.\n\nBut experts we consulted were not impressed by Reid\u2019s combined metric. First of all, it treats every bill equally, when they says it\u2019s silly to equate huge pieces of legislation that change the course of the economy with a run-of-the-mill renaming of a post office. As for confirmations, a lot depends on how many nominees are submitted by an administration\u2014and we are in final two years of President Obama\u2019s term.\n\u2022 None \u201cNumber of bills passed\u201d is a terrible comparative measure. That is for two reasons, at least. 1) Some bills are vastly more important than others. Enacting TARP [Troubled Assets Relief Program] in 2008, e.g., is in a different league from approving a resolution to build a post office or to establish national petunia week. It is not even apples and oranges. It is mice and buffalo. 2) Since the 1940s, Congress has drifted toward grouping provisions into thick omnibus bills. That is true of budget measures but also otherwise. So comparisons of \u201cN bills passed\u201d with especially past decades like the 1940s or 1950s are probably worthless. Think of the big stimulus bill passed in early 2009. Somebody has written a whole book about the various stuff included in that. My guess is that those various stimulus provisions would have been enacted as maybe a dozen separate enactments in the 1940s or 1950s.\n\u2022 None Nominations? Maybe that is more promising. At least there we have a sure denominator. Only the executive branch sends up nominations. It makes sense to look at the proportions of them that are approved. Does it make sense to look at the absolute number of nominations that are approved, as an addition or an alternative? Well, maybe. Note that nominations are different from bills. With bills, we do not have any sure denominator. The president proposes things, but so do the congressional parties, individual members of Congress or coalitions, interest groups, the whole society in a sense.\n\nIf we look at confirmations as a percentage of nominations, as Mayhew and other experts suggested, then Reid has a point. According to statistics from Reid\u2019s staff, confirmations are running well behind recent years. Just 39 percent of nominations submitted by the Obama administration have been confirmed thus far in the 114th Congress, compared to 58 percent in the 113th, 77 percent in the 112th, 81 percent in the 111th and 67 percent in the 110th. That\u2019s a significant difference. The 110th Congress, for instance, was the last two years of a presidential term (George W. Bush)\u2013when the Senate was held by the opposing party.\n\nThe Brookings Institution publishes \u201cvital statistics\u201d on Congress and has data on recorded votes going back to 1947. Recorded votes would indicate whether the Senate is not only passing bills and confirming nominees but also whether it is considering amendments on a regular basis, helping to shape legislation. By that measure, as of Dec. 5, the current Senate had 331 recorded votes\u2014already well ahead of the 291 recorded votes in the 113th Congress over its entire two-year period.\n\nMayhew said the number of amendments \u201cis an interesting and important statistic\u201d but he had doubts about relying on recorded votes. \u201cHaving a lot of recorded votes, as with having a lot of deliberation, can contribute to the public interest even if it doesn\u2019t have much or anything to do with \u2018productivity\u2019 in the sense of the actual generation of new laws,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Binder of the Brookings Institution pointed to a series of metrics designed by the Bipartisan Policy Center that looked at the \u201chealth\u201d of the Congress as another possible measure. This measures such items as working days and amendments considered, and bills ordered by committees. The current Senate thus far \u201chas increased the number of days working in Washington and considered a high number of amendments on the floor,\u201d compared to previous Congresses, the center concluded. But some might say \u201chealth\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cproductivity.\u201d\n\nUltimately, experts said, there is no good measure of productivity for the Senate. \u201cIn the case of legislating, we would see a Congress that enacts nothing at all is not doing its job, but we would probably also see a Congress that uses as its standard \u2018the more laws the better\u2019 as being crazy,\u201d Mayhew said. \u201cIn the sense of serving the public interest in a heterogeneous society where different views exist and solutions to problems are unclear, a Congress may be doing its job by deliberating about a matter, considering it, and then adding nothing at all to the statute books.\u201d\n\nOn balance, we\u2019d say his claim would be worthy of Two Pinocchios\u2014but then Reid gets another Pinocchio for asserting this is the \u201cmost unproductive\u201d Congress in U.S. history. That\u2019s a pretty extreme statement, given there are other metrics that indicate this Senate is operating at a better or faster pace than the last Senate when Reid\u2019s party headed the majority. Reid needs to be more careful with his rhetoric.", "lang": "en"}
