His U.K. Critics Say He Got the Message.\n\nLONDON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s cancellation of a visit to London to open a new United States embassy was welcomed by his many critics in Britain on Friday, even as it deepened the diplomatic problems confronting a British government struggling to forge closer ties to Washington without offending opinion at home. The decision averted the risk of public protests that had threatened to embarrass both Mr. Trump and Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, who has recently squirmed to distance herself from statements made by an American president seen by many Britons as deeply divisive. The announcement, which came in a Twitter post by Mr. Trump that included a false jab at former President Barack Obama, is the latest reverberation from a hasty and ill-judged invitation made around a year ago, when Mr. Trump was offered, and accepted, a state visit to Britain. Such an honor is normally bestowed only much later in a presidency. With Britain to leave the European Union in 2019, Mrs. May hopes to negotiate a new trade agreement with the United States, and the state visit was partly seen as a way of cementing ties with Mr. Trump.\n\nBut while Britons may pride themselves on their \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States, that does not appear to extend to its president, whose statements on a range of topics have provoked widespread anger in the country. A petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn was signed by more than 1.8 million people, the issue was debated in Parliament and, with large-scale protests threatened, the state visit plan was quietly put on the back burner. Last year the United States ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, said that he hoped Mr. Trump would visit in early 2018 and dedicate the new embassy, providing the opportunity for a symbolically important, but lower-key, visit to a close ally. No official statement had been made about the visit, and no formal invitation had been issued, although diplomats were known to be trying to organize a meeting, and the embassy opening was an obvious moment at which to do so. Then, late on Thursday night, the president took to his favorite medium, Twitter, and announced that he had scrapped his trip because he was unhappy with the new building, and the decision to quit the old site in central London, which has been taken over by the Qatari royal family\u2019s property company, which plans to convert it into a luxury hotel.\n\nThe old United States Embassy, in a famous square in the exclusive Mayfair neighborhood, was deemed to be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The new one, which includes a small moat, is a high-tech construction in a former rail yard on the South Bank of the Thames. Though Mr. Trump blamed the Obama administration for the move, the first announcement of new embassy site had been made in 2008 during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nBut the furor illustrates the extent to which any potential visit by Mr. Trump to Britain has become politically polarizing, even as the country\u2019s establishment grapples with the question of whether to invite the president to the wedding of Prince Harry and the American actress Meghan Markle. Mr. Trump visited several continental European countries last year, including France, where President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s handling of his American counterpart appeared to make the British look fumbling. \u201cMacron treated Trump with respect and warmth on the one hand,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute, \u201cbut on the other hand was principled in defense of French interests, and didn\u2019t give an iota on the substance.\u201d By contrast, Mrs. May was \u201call over the place,\u201d Mr. Leonard added. \u201cThere was the attempt to rush over to the U.S. to embrace him, then she became implicated in the things he was doing, and then she had to pull back, so she\u2019s been zigzagging,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain then gets the worst of all worlds because it has confused everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile Mrs. May is keen to create closer ties with Washington, on many global issues her approach is more closely aligned with the positions of the European Union. She has expressed support both for the Paris climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal, for example. And at home, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements have caused her problems. Last year Mr. Trump denounced Mr. Khan after his response to a bombing in June, misconstruing a call for calm as lack of concern about terrorist threats. And his tweets about a bombing in London in September suggested that the police had been monitoring attackers but had done nothing. Mr. Trump\u2019s retweets of a far-right group\u2019s anti-Muslim videos in November stirred criticism from across the political spectrum in Britain, and prompted Mrs. May to criticize him. Mr. Khan said the president\u2019s Twitter postings made clear that Mrs. May had been mistaken to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump so quickly. \u201cIt appears that President Trump got the message from the many Londoners who love and admire America and Americans but find his policies and actions the polar opposite of our city\u2019s values of inclusion, diversity and tolerance,\u201d he said Friday in a Twitter post.", "lang": "en"}
