A representative for the golfer refuted the claim.\n\nWatson is a professional golfer who plays on the PGA tour and is a two-time winner of the Masters title.\n\nSome social media users have been sharing a long statement, allegedly authored by the golfer, that criticizes the Black Lives Matters movement, as well as touches on other political topics. For instance, the post attempts to compare the reactions to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations to responses following protests against COVID-19-related restrictions.\n\n\u201cJust 45 days ago protests weren\u2019t \u2018essential\u2019 and were considered criminal, selfish and a murderous activity,\u201d Watson allegedly said. \u2018Today they are gloriously critical and celebrated. All of the obvious criminal and murderous activities are simply ignored. If you protest about lock downs for freedom, you are selfish and you will spread a virus. If you protest, loot, and riot for social justice, you are a warrior and the virus fades to the background.\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of Watson writing such a statement. When professional athletes take a political stance, it typically makes headlines, yet no media outlets attributed the statement to Watson. Nor could a similar statement be found on any of the golfer\u2019s social media accounts.\n\nFurther adding to the attribution\u2019s dubiousness, versions of the statement previously circulated online without being linked to Watson. His name started being attached to the long statement in late June, according to fact-checking website Snopes.\n\nCaty Kusma, a representative from Watson\u2019s agency, Pro Sport Management, told the Daily Caller in an email, \u201cNo, Bubba Watson did not write this.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A Protester Pointing A Weapon At An Armed Homeowner?)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have erroneously linked a lengthy statement to a public figure. The Daily Caller recently debunked the claim that radio host Dave Ramsey authored an essay advocating against a \u201ccashless society.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
