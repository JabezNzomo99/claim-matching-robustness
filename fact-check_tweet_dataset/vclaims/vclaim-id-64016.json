This makes it misleading to say that these are cases where people necessarily died \u201cof\u201d the disease, or were \u201ckilled by\u201d it, because in many cases influenza and pneumonia are only mentioned as factors in a death where the underlying cause was something else.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how many people are dying of flu at the moment\u2014meaning that \u201cflu\u201d is the underlying cause\u2014but it is almost certainly far fewer than these reports suggest.\n\nWith pneumonia included, the total number of people dying of pneumonia or flu is probably higher than the number dying of Covid-19 at the moment, but not by the margin that these headlines suggest.\n\nDeath certificates give doctors space to record several different diseases or conditions that contributed to someone\u2019s death, but only one can be recorded as the underlying cause. The underlying cause in this context means \u201cthe disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death\u201d.\n\nFor example, someone might develop cancer, which leads to other conditions, from which they ultimately die. All of these conditions might be mentioned by a doctor on the person\u2019s death certificate, but the cancer would be listed as the single underlying cause. It would be right to say that this person \u201cdied of\u201d or \u201cdied from\u201d cancer, and it would be misleading to say that they died of or from something else.\n\nIn its bulletin on the number of deaths being registered in England and Wales each week, the ONS reports the number of \u201cdeaths involving COVID-19\u201d, which means the number of death certificates that mention Covid-19 somewhere, whether or not it was the underlying cause.\n\nThe ONS also reports in the bulletin the number of \u201cdeaths in England and Wales [that] mentioned \u2018Influenza and Pneumonia\u2019\u201d. Again, they didn\u2019t have to be the underlying cause of death.\n\nThis matters, because when Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, it is much more likely to be the underlying cause of someone\u2019s death than when pneumonia or influenza is.\n\nUp to the end of June 2020 in England and Wales, Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death on about 93% of the death certificates that mentioned it. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, however, influenza or pneumonia were listed as the underlying cause of death on just 28% of the death certificates in England that mentioned either of them.\n\nAnother problem is that the reporting often summarised these deaths involving \u201cinfluenza and pneumonia\u201d as being deaths from \u201cflu\u201d, which is incorrect.\n\nThe phrase \u201cinfluenza and pneumonia\u201d used by the ONS may have caused confusion here, because it sounds like it refers to death certificates that mention both, and so could be simplified to just \u201cflu\u201d. In fact, it refers to any mention that belongs in the \u201cinfluenza and pneumonia\u201d category.\n\nThis means that a death counted in the \u201cInfluenza and pneumonia\u201d category could be someone who died after having pneumonia, or after having flu, or after having both.\n\nPneumonia is usually caused by a bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by a virus such as flu or the one that causes Covid-19. It\u2019s worth noting that many people who die with Covid-19 have pneumonia as well, so the ONS explains that \u201cdeaths where both were mentioned have been counted only in the COVID-19 category\u201d.\n\nWhat does this mean for flu?\n\nAs we have seen, most of the people with influenza or pneumonia mentioned somewhere on their death certificate probably did not die with either as the underlying cause. And among those who did, the underlying cause was especially unlikely to be flu.\n\nFlu is an important factor in many deaths. Estimates from the FluMOMO model suggest that there have been between 4,000 and 22,000 deaths associated with flu in England in each of the past winter flu seasons.\n\nHowever, it is not often considered to be the underlying cause of death by doctors.\n\nIf we look at the underlying cause of death data for 2019, we can see that 1,213 people died specifically from flu, which is just 4.6% of the 26,342 who died from either influenza or pneumonia.\n\nIn other words, on average, about 23 people died each week last year and had flu identified as the underlying cause of death (although this is likely an undercount and the disease may have been an important factor in many other deaths).\n\nFlu levels are unusually low right now, even for the summer. And the number of death certificates mentioning influenza or pneumonia is currently below the five-year average, as the ONS graph reveals.\n\nSo what are the latest figures?\n\nIn the week ending 7 August, which is the latest reported by the ONS at the time of writing, 152 death certificates mentioned Covid-19.\n\nIf the proportion actually caused by Covid-19 is the same as it was in June (a more recent figure isn\u2019t available), then about 93% of these deaths will have Covid-19 as their underlying cause, meaning about 141 of them.\n\nOver the same period there were 1,013 deaths registered with influenza or pneumonia, but not Covid-19, mentioned on the death certificate. If 28% of these had influenza or pneumonia as their underlying cause, which was the rate from 2015 to 2017, then this will make a total of 284 deaths from either cause.\n\nIf we\u2019re looking just at flu and 4.6% of those people who died had flu as the underlying cause identified on the death certificate, that would make just 13 people \"killed by flu\u201d in the same week. Though, as mentioned, this is likely an undercount.\n\nThese numbers are rough estimates. But they show that while pneumonia is probably killing more people than Covid-19 at the moment, there isn\u2019t evidence that flu itself is killing more people than Covid-19.", "lang": "en"}
