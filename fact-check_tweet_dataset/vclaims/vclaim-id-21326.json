According to the police, in the backdrop of Ganesh Chaturthi, the state police had organised a mock drill at the bus station in the evening. \u201cPolice cordoned off the area around the terrorist bus. The passengers were taken down, causing confusion among them. In the meantime, police climbed onto the roof of the bus. Some went on the bus through the window. One by one, four terrorists were taken out of a bus and slept on the ground. They were then arrested and taken to the police van. Until all this happened, the passengers at the bus station knew nothing. Upon completion of the mock drill, the passengers were informed that it was a mock drill,\u201d said the report.\n\nA Facebook page \u2018\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0935\u093e\u0926\u0933\u2018 shared a video of the same mock drill taken from a different angle.\n\nA video of a mock drill was thus shared on social media as explosive recovered by the police in Maharashtra\u2019s Ahmadnagar Maliwada bus stand.
