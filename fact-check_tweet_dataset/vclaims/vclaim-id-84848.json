Migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa continue to arrive in droves in European Union nations, fleeing war and poverty in their home countries or seeking economic opportunities.\n\nTrump may be referring to the earlier flows of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 data on arrivals by sea (the most commonly used route) show migrant and refugee flows in 2015 mainly were made up of men.\n\nThe number of sea arrivals peaked in October, after a steady rise starting around April 2015. As of June, 74 percent of the people arriving in Greece and Italy were men. The gender imbalance began to change after June. As of this March, 47 percent of people arriving in Greece and Italy were men, 34 percent were women and 19 percent were children.\n\nIn Greece, the main entry point into Europe, there are now more women and children than men arriving. In June, 73 percent of sea arrivals in Greece were men. This March, 38 percent were men, 22 percent were women and 40 percent were children. But male arrivals continue to far outweigh female or child arrivals in Italy, another entry point to Europe.\n\nHowever, the number of children arriving by sea \u2014 especially unaccompanied \u2014 has been increasing. In June, 16 percent of sea arrivals were children. That increased to 35 percent last month. The proportion of unaccompanied children has increased in recent months, the majority of them from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the European Commission.\n\nAre the arrivals \u201cyoung\u201d men? UNHCR\u2019s age breakdown for all migrants and refugees classifies adults as those 18 to 59 years old, and there is no further breakdown. But recent surveys of people who arrived in Greece give us an idea of how \u201cyoung\u201d the men are. Among Syrians, the biggest group arriving in Greece, 17 percent were 15 to 24 years old and 20 percent were 25 to 59 years old, as of February. Among Afghans, the second-biggest group arriving in Greece, 26 percent were 15 to 24 years old and 21 percent were 25 to 59 years old.\n\nSo, while Trump makes it seem as if it\u2019s mostly \u201cyoung, strong men\u201d arriving, there is actually no such massive influx of Syrian or Afghan men 15 to 24 years old; they make up 17 to 26 percent of the most recent arrivals.\n\nFirst-time asylum applicants in 2015 were mostly male. Among those 14 to 34 years old, asylum applicants were disproportionately male (about 80 percent), according to asylum statistics by Eurostat. The share of male applicants dropped to about two-thirds for those in the 35-to-64 age group. But this is a smaller group of the overall population, because not everyone who arrives files an asylum claim. Eurostat statistics for the first quarter of this year are not yet available publicly.\n\nGenerally speaking, unauthorized arrivals (via seaboat, for example) are dominated by men, particularly young men \u2014 because the journey is dangerous and women and children are especially vulnerable to exploitation. After men arrive, they tend to seek refugee status so that they can bring family members over in authorized, less dangerous ways, such as the reunification process, said Susan Fratzke, policy analyst and program coordinator at the Migration Policy Institute\u2019s International Program.\n\nThe overall flow of migrants and refugees into Europe was dominated first by men, including younger men, when the numbers began spiking last year. But since the middle of 2015, the demographics began to shift and more women and children started making trips across the Mediterranean Sea. Of note is the sharp increase in unaccompanied children in 2015.\n\nIn particular, the breakdown of men, women and children arriving in the main entry point of Greece has shifted dramatically. This March, there were more women and children (62 percent) than men \u2014 a reversal from June, when 73 percent of arrivals were men. But Italy continues to see far more men (73 percent) than women and children. Trump says there are \u201cso many young, strong men.\u201d Among recent arrivals in Greece, there wasn\u2019t a clear massive influx of Syrian or Afghan men ages 15 to 24. For Syrians (the biggest group of arrivals), 17 percent fit in that age range. For Afghans, 26 percent fit in that category.", "lang": "en"}
