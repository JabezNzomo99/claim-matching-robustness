It even attracted attention in Kuwait. We examined a tale that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told at the Conservative Political Action Conference about a boy who supposedly did not want a government-provided school lunch but \u201cwanted his own lunch, one in a brown-paper bag just like the other kids.\u201d The story quickly collapsed under scrutiny and earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n2: Ted Cruz\u2019s \u2018biggest lie in politics:\u2019 Is it actually the truth?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) repeatedly tells audiences that it is the \u201cbiggest lie in politics\u201d that Republicans are \u201cthe party of the rich.\u201d In his speeches, Cruz never really explains why he believes this is the \u201cbiggest lie.\u201d So we looked at the available data on voting patterns, voter perceptions, and income growth \u2014 and found his assertion wanting. Without more evidence, Cruz simply can\u2019t make a sweeping statement that saying Republicans are the party of the rich is \u201cthe biggest lie\u201d when decades of economic data show the poor do better under Democrats, that the rich tend to vote Republican, and that most Americans believe Republican policies favor the rich. Needless to say, readers divided sharply on the merits of this fact check.\n\n3: Julie Boonstra\u2019s claim her Obamacare plan is \u2018unaffordable\u2019 gets downgraded to Three Pinocchios\n\nOur original column on an Americans for Prosperity ad featuring a Michigan cancer victim, Julie Boonstra, was one of the most read columns in February. But then new information came to light about her medical plan under the Affordable Care Act, indicating that rather than the plan being \u201cunaffordable,\u201d as the ad asserted, she actually had a savings of more than $1,200 a year. So we switched the rating from Two to Three Pinocchios.\n\nThe Russian president earned Four Pinocchios for a series of iffy statements he made in a lengthy speech accepting the Ukrainian province of Crimea as part of Russia. For instance, he said a rushed and unbalanced referendum that violated the Ukrainian constitution was held \u201c in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms.\u201d This column also featured a Truth Teller video.\n\nIn the wake of the Russian seizure of Crimea, we took a trip down memory lane and looked back at a celebrated 2012 exchange between President Obama and his GOP rival, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, during the third presidential debate. \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years,\u201d Obama jabbed at Romney. This also featured a Truth Teller video.\n\nHere, we presented our list of the biggest presidential deceptions in the past 55 years, from Dwight Eisenhower to Barack Obama. Every president ended up on the list except Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter \u2014 and Richard Nixon received a double mention. A Truth Teller video accompanied this column, which showed not only the deceptions but the mea culpas that came after the truth emerged.", "lang": "en"}
