The posts were shared after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, had become a pandemic, prompting panic buying in some countries. The claim is false; several manufacturers told AFP that the post is a hoax; the leading industry association noted that official guidelines forbid the donation of formula to the public.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on March 16, 2020.\n\nThe post features a text graphic that reads: \u201cFor parents who can\u2019t find formula in stores. Call the number on the back of formula can and they will send you a case during this time! Childcare providers share this information!!!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nA similar claim was also published on Facebook here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. Many of the posts circulated in Australia, while others were shared in North America.\n\nInfant formula manufacturers Nestl\u00e9, Danone and A2 Milk all told AFP the claim is a hoax.\n\n\u201cThere is not a phone number to ring for free infant formula product (case or can),\u201d an A2 Milk spokesperson said via email on March 17, 2020.\n\nThe Infant Nutrition Council, an industry group representing infant formula and toddler milk drink producers in Australia, also said that infant formula cannot be donated by its members to the general public.\n\n\u201cAs a signatory to the [Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula Agreement (MAIF)], companies will never directly market infant formula to the general public and they also cannot donate infant formula to the general public,\u201d Jan Carey, the organisation\u2019s CEO, told AFP via email on March 17, 2020.\n\nCarey added that the MAIF is the Australian government\u2019s response to the World Health Organization\u2019s Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, which aims to promote safe and adequate nutrition for infants by protecting and promoting breastfeeding worldwide.\n\nA list of companies who are signatories to the MAIF agreement can be found here.\n\nUS infant formula brand Enfamil also refuted the claim on its website: \"Please also note, that contrary to rumors in some online social networks, we are not distributing free cases of formula. We are instead focused on ensuring equitable availability for every baby based on what we know and in anticipation of what might develop in the coming weeks.\"", "lang": "en"}
