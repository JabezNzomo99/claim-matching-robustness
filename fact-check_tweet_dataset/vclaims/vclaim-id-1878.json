In the 70s and 80s, 40% of pensioners in this country lived in poverty, that was disgraceful. We've got that figure now right down to 14%.\u201d \u201cThere are still 2 million of them that live in pensioner poverty\u201d\n\nBoth politicians are talking about the relative measure of poverty and are largely correct, although Damian Green is slightly underestimating the current rate.\n\nRelative poverty compares households\u2019 income to the national average. Anyone who falls below 60% of the median income is defined as in poverty.\n\nAn estimated 1.9 million pensioners were in poverty on this measure in 2015/16, out of a total 12 million across the UK. That\u2019s a rate of 16%, and includes the costs of housing, which is the measure preferred by the government and analysts.\n\nThat also compares to a rate of 22% for the population as a whole.\n\nYou could instead look at absolute poverty, which compares people to a fixed standard of living, adjusted for inflation over time. It puts pensioner poverty slightly lower at 1.6 million and 14%, still including housing costs. Again, that\u2019s lower than the equivalent overall poverty rate of 20%.\n\nOver the long term, pensioner poverty has fallen. Relative pensioner poverty\u2014the preferred measure for long-term trends\u2014hit 40% at various points in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, according to analysis of official estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s been falling almost constantly year on year. The latest estimate puts it at 16%. Damian Green might have been referring to last year\u2019s estimate of 14% when he spoke on the programme.\n\nBack in the 1990s, the absolute and relative poverty rates for pensioners were higher than the average for all households working age households without children; now the opposite is the case, according to the IFS.\n\nWhy those huge shifts in the 1980s? Pensioner poverty tends to increase in times of high economic growth, according to past research. That\u2019s because the incomes of people in work can rise a lot faster than prices during these periods, while pensions tended in the past to track prices more closely. That means that, on the relative measure, pensioner poverty can go up simply by virtue of everyone else pulling ahead.\n\nWork and benefits have been drivers of the recent fall\n\nDamian Green mentioned on the programme that the \u2018triple lock\u2019 on pensions has been a key driver of falls in pensioner poverty.\n\nThe government has actually said as recently as last year that it can\u2019t draw a direct link between the triple lock and pensioner poverty, but that it expected it had an impact.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a big part of the general trend is down to pensioner benefits faring better than benefits for working-age people over the last decade, so the triple lock is likely to play a part. The average income from pensioner benefits was down 2.5% in real terms from 2009/10 to 2014/15, compared to a 10.3% fall for working-age families, for example.\n\nPensioners are also increasingly in work, which is often a way out of poverty. 10% of people over the page of 65 are in work, according to the latest figures from the start of 2017. That was about 7% a decade ago and about 5% back in 1997.", "lang": "en"}
