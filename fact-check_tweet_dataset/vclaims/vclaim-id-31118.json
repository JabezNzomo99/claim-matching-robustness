The claim is false; the image actually shows a journalist who was assaulted while covering unrest on the outskirts of Colombo in 2009.\n\nThe image was published on Facebook here on August 25, 2019, and has been shared hundreds of times since, alongside similar claims.\n\nThe image includes a photograph of a man who is bleeding heavily from a head injury. Police and army officers can be seen in the background.\n\nSinhala text across the image says: \u201cJournalist who entered the Podujana Peramuna youth convention was assaulted upon showing his press ID card. This is all we ask: if this is how this type of leader, who is showcased in your media daily and promoted, behaves before coming into power, how will it be after he comes into power? Journalistic brothers, think wisely for a moment.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala caption translates to English as: \u201cWhat happened to the journalist who came to the Youth Convention of the Pohottuwa\u2026 Got his head cracked open.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala phrase \u201cpohottuwa\u201d means flower bud and is the logo of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) -- a new political party led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nOn the bottom left corner of the picture, there is also a headshot of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, SLPP\u2019s presidential candidate. Here is his Twitter account.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna held a convention on August 24, 2019, at the Nelum Pokuna theatre. Here is a live stream of the event, to which local media were not invited, according to local media reports.\n\nPosts with the same image and similar captions have been published elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here.\n\nThe claim is false. The man in the photograph in the misleading image is a journalist but the photo was actually taken on August 13, 2009.\n\nA Yandex reverse image search of the picture led to this article on a blog on Freedom of expression in Sri Lanka published on August 13, 2009, titled: \u201cPolice station attacked by people; journalist injured.\"\n\nAccording to the article, the individual in the image is a journalist who was injured in Angulana when police and residents clashed in the area.\n\nAngulana is a small coastal town on the outskirts of Colombo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nA keyword search on Google led to this article published on August 16, 2009, titled \u201cAngulana atrocity, youth pranks vs police brutality\u2019.\n\nAccording to the article, unrest broke out on the night of August 12, 2009, when Angulana residents protested against local police over the deaths of two youths in police custody.\n\nSocial media posts indicated that the man in the photograph worked at a local television channel. AFP contacted the channel, and found that that man in the image was Jaanaka Hettiarachchi, a video journalist attached to Derana, a leading media outlet in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn a phone conversation with AFP on August 26, 2019, Hettiarachchi confirmed that he was the man in the photograph that has been used in the recent misleading posts.\n\nHettiarachchi said he was in Angulana, accompanied by a camera assistant and a journalist, on August 13, 2009, to cover the unrest in the area.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived at the site, the Angulana Police station was surrounded by protestors and police officers were held under house arrest ... A few minutes later, a vehicle from a nearby police station arrived to extract the officers held under house arrest ... When the police vehicle exited with the officers trapped inside, the villagers attacked the vehicle with rocks and stones and I was hit by one,\u201d Hettiarachchi said.", "lang": "en"}
