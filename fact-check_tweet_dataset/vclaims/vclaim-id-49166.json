Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Kerala has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore to deal with COVID-19. Fact: While it is true that the Kerala Government has announced a financial package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the pandemic, they have not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore. They have requested for a special line of credit of Rs 2000 crore from NABARD under RIDF. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn the official Twitter handle of Kerala Chief Minister\u2019s Office, it can be found that the Kerala Government has announced a special package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn the post, \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article was given. So, when searched with the keywords, \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article related to the NABARD loan was found. While the title shows \u2019loan of Rs 20,000 crore\u2019 in the Google search results, the article (when opened) shows \u2019loan of Rs 2,000 crore\u2019. So, on looking at the cached version of the article, it was found that the title of the article was updated. The archived cache version of the original article can be found here. Also, Dhanya Rajendran (Editor-in-Chief of \u2018The News Minute\u2019) has tweeted that it was a typing mistake. So, the Kerala Government has not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nAlso, in the letter sent by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan to Chairman of NABARD, it can be read that the Kerala Government has requested \u2018a special line of credit of Rs. 2000 Crore under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) for Kerala State at 2 per cent per year, 190 bases points less than the prevailing 3.9 per cent per annum\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the Kerala Government has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 2,000 crore, not Rs 20,000 crore.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
