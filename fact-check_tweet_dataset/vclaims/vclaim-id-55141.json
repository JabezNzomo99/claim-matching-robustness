(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Neither Hanks\u2019 name nor his initials appear in the flight log documents.\n\nEpstein used the plane to entertain guests and transport young women to his Caribbean Island, Little Saint James.\n\nThe flight logs, which became public through civil lawsuits by women who said they were sexually abused by Epstein, were handwritten by his pilots. The logs can be found online in a few places, and Business Insider compiled a searchable database for subscribers of every known flight made by his private planes. There are certainly some noteworthy names, such as Naomi Campbell and President Bill Clinton (who issued a statement about the plane rides shortly after Epstein\u2019s arrest), but Hanks\u2019 name is not there.\n\nOther fake lists of alleged passengers have included President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, former U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and even Pope Francis, to name a few.\n\nAs for this claim, we rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
