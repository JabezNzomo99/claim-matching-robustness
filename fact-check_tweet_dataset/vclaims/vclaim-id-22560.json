The outcome of the 2018 bust was announced on June 28 \u2014 it netted 601 arrests.\n\nBut the misleading story circulating online is about the 2017 bust. Those defendants \u2014 including 115 doctors, nurses and medical professionals \u2014 were arrested for their alleged involvement in a scheme that bilked Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE (a health insurance program for veterans) out of $1.3 billion.\n\nCharges were filed in 23 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nA total of about 30 people were charged in Michigan; the state with the highest number of arrests was Florida.\n\nThe charging documents don\u2019t mention the religion of the defendants, but the misleading story dedicates its first two paragraphs to expressing an opinion about the effect of Muslim immigrants on the state of Michigan.\n\nIt says: \u201cNow thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another \u2018accomplishment\u2019 on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the \u2018largest scam in United States history.'\u201d\n\nMichigan has a reputation for having a large Muslim population, but Muslims make up about 1 percent of the state\u2019s adult population, according to a 2015 study from the Pew Research Center.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201c412 Michigan Muslims Arrested In Fed\u2019s \u2018LARGEST BUST IN U.S. HISTORY\u2019 After Uncovering Deadly Hidden Secret.\u201d TopAlertNews.com. 24 Aug 2018.\n\nDepartment of Justice.
