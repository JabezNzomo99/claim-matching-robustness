As per the excerpt below from Business Insider, Maria is 34-35 years old while Katerina is 33-34 years old. The girl in the video, however, looks younger than both of them.\n\nFurther, we also ran the keyframes of the video through Google Reverse Image Search. Upon extensive research, we came across an article by Mirtesen, a Russian media platform, from July 14, 2020. The article shows the same video, even though Putin announced the vaccine on August 11, 2020.\n\nThe article quotes a volunteer for the vaccine trial as Natalia. It also says that three weeks before the publication of the article, the first component of the vaccine was administered to the volunteers.\n\nHence, it is clear that the video of the girl in the red t-shirt is of a volunteer. Further, the girl\u2019s appearance does not match Putin\u2019s daughter. Thus we can conclude that the woman in the video is not his daughter.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
