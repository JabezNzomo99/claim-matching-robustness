The alleged Cuba connection was laid out in an intelligence report provided last year to U.S. government officials and sent by secure cable to the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, according to the former official and a second person with close ties to Menendez who had been briefed on the matter. The intelligence information indicated that operatives from Cuba\u2019s Directorate of Intelligence helped create a fake tipster using the name \u201cPete Williams,\u201d according to the former official. The tipster told FBI agents and others he had information about Menendez participating in poolside sex parties with underage prostitutes while vacationing at the Dominican Republic home of Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor, donor and friend of the senator. A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which functions as the island\u2019s U.S. diplomatic outpost, did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
