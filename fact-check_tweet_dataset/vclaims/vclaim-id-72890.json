The image has been doctored, original pictures and videos of the event show no banner with this message was hung at the venue.\n\n\n\nThe photo, which can be seen here and here on Facebook, shows a packed event with a banner hanging over a stage, above a poster bearing the faces of the senatorial candidates.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one of the Facebook posts:\n\nThe text in the banner at the top of the photograph says: \u201cREMINDER: Always check your belongings, there are many thieves here\u201d.\n\nThe status here when translated to English, says: Dear Fellow Filipinos: THERE ARE MANY! You may say \"WE WERE NOT INFORMED! STUPID VOTERS BEWARE! #Nothingtosay #Weknowthis #SilentNoMorePH\n\nIn the misleading posts, the banner was circled, as were the faces of several senatorial candidates including (from left to right): former special assistant to the president Christopher Lawrence \u201cBong\u201d Go, former senator Jinggoy Estrada, Imee Marcos, incumbent governor of the northern province of Ilocos Norte, and former senator Bong Revilla.\n\nAll the candidates are endorsed by Hugpong Pagbabago, the political party of Duterte\u2019s daughter.\n\nGo faced a Senate probe in 2018 for allegedly meddling in a $310 million-navy frigate deal.\n\nEstrada faces a plunder case for allegedly misusing at least 180 million pesos of a Priority Development Assistance Fund when he served as senator from 2004 to 2012.\n\nRevilla also was charged with plunder but was acquitted on December 1, 2018 by the country\u2019s anti-graft court. The ruling said however, that the accused in the case must return some 124.5 million pesos in public funds. Revilla has said he will not return the money.\n\nMarcos is the daughter of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Her mother, Imelda, was convicted of graft by the Philippines\u2019 anti graft court on November 9, 2018 for funneling $200 million to Swiss foundations when she was still governor of Metro Manila in the 1970s. The court verdict said that her children had benefited from these foundations.\n\nBut a video of the February 12, 2019 campaign event showed that no such banner was hung at the venue.\n\nThis video was shot by CinEmotion Digital Films, a production company which has shot videos of events and programs of the Duterte government.\n\nBelow is a screenshot taken from the video:\n\nHere is a different video of the campaign event taken from Revilla\u2019s official Facebook page. The stage can be seen 22 seconds into video:\n\nPictures shared by CinEmotion and tweeted by one of the senatorial candidates in the lineup, Cynthia Villar, also showed that there was no such banner at the venue.\n\nA reverse search found the doctored photo first appeared on a satirical Facebook account called Malaca\u00f1ang Events and Catering Services, where it had been shared more than 4,000 times.\n\nComments like the one below indicate that many Facebook users believed the banner had been placed at the event:\n\nThis one, when translated to English, says: Ahahahaha, what, they intentionally put it there because they know the administration candidates will come?", "lang": "en"}
