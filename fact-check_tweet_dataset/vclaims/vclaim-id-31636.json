For instance, former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to see all these Bloomberg ads suggest Obama has endorsed him, especially considering how\u2026 perfunctory his endorsement of Obama was back in 2012.\u201d\n\nOne viral Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,800 times, claims that Obama has formally endorsed Bloomberg, appearing to reference the fact that Obama has not endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, who is also vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. (Biden has said he asked Obama not to endorse his campaign.)\n\nBut the post\u2019s claim that Obama endorsed Bloomberg\u2019s bid for the White House doesn\u2019t hold up.

If Obama had endorsed Bloomberg for president, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it, and neither has issued a press release.\n\nObama has not formally endorsed any Democratic candidates to date in the 2020 election cycle, according to Politico. He has, however, given advice to Bloomberg and other Democratic candidates in private meetings, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe Office of Barack and Michelle Obama and the Bloomberg campaign did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
