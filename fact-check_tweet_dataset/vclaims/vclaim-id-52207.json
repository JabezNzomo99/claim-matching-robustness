No, that's not true: the story was just a piece of clickbait spread by a network of foreign websites. The \"leader\" in question wasn't even identified in the story and the website peddling the claim was riddled with so many ads it made the actual article quasi unreadable.\n\nThe story appeared in an article published by a site named TrumpMAGA 2020 on September 17, 2018 titled \"Muslim Leader Threatens \"I Swear All The Muslim Will Leave U.S If Trump Ban Sharia Law\". Do You Support This??\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe picture used with the story comes from a video that's been online since at least 2013 about a protest against attacks on monks in India, well before Donald Trump was even president.\n\nThe rest of the article completely fails to identify who this supposed \"muslim leader\" is and consists mostly of advertising and sentences copied from news articles about the 90-day travel ban Trump issued against several muslim-majority countries last year.\n\nThe site trumpmaga2020.blogspot.com seems to share several advertising network ID's and other properties with a number of other sites that are part of a network of clickbait sites posting political stories for monetary gain. Based on the domain names of some other sites in the network we suspect the owners probably hail from the Balkan region in Europe, probably Serbia or Macedonia.", "lang": "en"}
