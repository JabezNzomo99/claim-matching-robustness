Wade. But this was long before abortion was a national social policy matter, before there were such terms like \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life.\u201d The circumstances were a lot different then. Reagan did evolve on his abortion views, but it was less stark of a transition than Trump\u2019s. It\u2019s time for a history lesson for the Republican front-runner.\n\nIn 1999, Trump publicly said he was a supporter of abortion rights as a matter of women\u2019s choice. In an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump was asked whether he would ban abortions, or at least \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortions. He said he would not, and that he is \u201cpro-choice in every respect.\u201d (Note: This shows he was indeed asked the question, despite his statement to CNN that \u201cas a businessman I\u2019m not sure I was ever even asked the question.\u201d)\n\nBut now on the presidential campaign trail in 2016, Trump is a vocal opponent of women\u2019s rights to abortion \u2014 even to the point of saying that women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to \u201csome sort of punishment.\u201d Trump explains that he hadn\u2019t given it much thought from a policy perspective when he was a businessman. And now that he is a presidential candidate, he says he is decidedly antiabortion.\n\nReagan was torn. He had not given abortion much thought and had no strong opinion prior to taking office \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a leading social issue at the time \u2014 but he was faced with a decision that could set the tone for the rest of the country. Not helping with Reagan\u2019s indecision, his staff were split along religious lines on the issue and had no clear consensus on which direction the governor should go. For instance, his legal affairs secretary, Edwin Meese, urged Reagan to sign the bill.\n\n\u201cMy answer as to what kind of abortion bill I could sign was one that recognized an abortion is the taking of a human life. \u2026 Therefore, an abortion is justified when done in self-defense. My belief is that a woman has the right to protect her own life and health against even her own unborn child. I believe also that just as she has the right to defend herself against rape, she should not be made to bear a child resulting from the violation of her person and therefore abortion is an act of self-defense. I know there will be disagreements with this view, but I can find no evidence whatsoever that a fetus is not a living human being with human rights.\u201d\n\nAs readers can see, it clearly was a different point in history. By the time the Supreme Court considered Roe v. Wade in 1973, legalizing abortion nationally, almost half the states had followed the decisions of states like California to open up abortion laws with exceptions. Back then, even supporters of abortion rights were skeptical of Roe v. Wade decision or opposed it. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon, has even criticized it for empowering the antiabortion movement, and cutting off a gradual move among states to legalize abortion along with courts and state legislatures.\n\nIn a rare instance, the Republican front-runner is not glaringly incorrect. He accurately cites a controversial decision by Reagan that allowed abortion in California in cases of rape, incest and physical and mental health of the mother \u2014 one of the first states to do so. Reagan was torn on the decision; he believed the fetus was a \u201cliving human being with human rights,\u201d but was presented with evidence of thousands of women in his state already seeking abortions illegally. Reagan\u2019s view of allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother is actually consistent with what many people with \u201cpro-life\u201d views believe.\n\nReagan signing the law was not necessarily a reflection of his support for women\u2019s right to choice, as it was long before the terms \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life\u201d existed. Rather, his decision resulted from a confluence of a grass-roots movement among women and doctors, political maneuvering from legislators in the State Assembly, and his own lack of direction on exactly how he stood on the matter. Looking back now, it is clear Reagan had \u201cpro-life\u201d tendencies, as we now use the term.\n\nWe take issue with the historical comparison Trump makes. His evolution is not analogous with Reagan\u2019s, when considering the historical context. Trump said he was \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d and now he identifies as \u201cpro-life.\u201d But he is identifying with such labels after the battle lines in the abortion debate long had been drawn. In contrast, Reagan\u2019s evolution took place when he deliberated whether to legalize abortions for specific circumstances that he believed were appropriate: rape, incest and physical and mental health of the mother. When the last provision was interpreted far beyond what he had intended, he regretted his decision and became even more strongly antiabortion.", "lang": "en"}
