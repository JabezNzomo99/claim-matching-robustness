The video is being erroneously identified as shot in the oilfield (managed by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) in the backdrop of the lockdown that was announced on March 24, to prevent the transmission of the novel Coronavirus.\n\nFollowing the lockdown and the ensuing restricted movement in the country, multiple unrelated photos and videos of animals have surfaced with narratives that the wildlife is reclaiming their habitats.\n\nThe video is viral on both Facebook and Twitter with the caption, \"Whales spotted at Bombay high oil rig!!!'' One such Facebook post is archived here.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, an article by India TV's web desk erroneously identified the location as Bombay High as well. The article is headlined as, \"Whale-Like creature spotted in Bombay High Waters.\" The article however states that the ONGC has clarified that it is not the oilfield.

According to the caption, the video is from Nusa Penida, an island located in the southeast region of Indonesia's Bali.\n\nUpon further keyword searches, we found another video that was tweeted by BBC Indonesia on August 29, 2019. The caption, when translated to English, reads, \"Video, A group of humpback whales are seen crossing the Karimunjawa sea, even though Indonesian waters are not part of their annual migration path.\"\n\nAn excerpt from the BBC feature, when translated to English, reads, \"A bunch of humpback whales, caught on camera crossing the Sea of Karimunjawa. The humpback whale commonly migrates from the Seltan hemisphere to the north for breeding. However, Indonesian waters are not part of the humpback whale migration path, which is more commonly found in Australian waters. It is also their annual migration path. Humpback whales generally migrate up to 10,000 km every year from cold waters in Antarctica into warmer waters in Asutralia.\"", "lang": "en"}
