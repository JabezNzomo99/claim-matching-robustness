Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was at an event to celebrate black women in Congress as part of CBC (Congressional Black Caucus) Week. At one point during the night, Omar and other attendees were filmed dancing. This video was shared by Adam Green, the co-founder of the group Bold Progressives, and was then retweeted by Omar herself:\n\nThis rather innocuous video became the focus of online outrage a few days later when Twitter user Terrence K. Williams falsely claimed that it showed Rep. Ilhan Omar partying on the anniversary of 9/11:\n\nThis inaccurate claim was then promoted by President Trump. The commander in chief tweeted the video, as well as Williams\u2019 false claim that it showed Omar partying on 9/11, with the message: \u201cIlhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nThis video was not filmed on the anniversary of 9/11.\n\nThis video was actually taken on September 13, 2019. Bold Progressives, the group co-founded by Adam Green, the person who took the video, also posted on Twitter that this video was taken on the 13th:\n\nThis video was filmed at the nonprofit venue the Culture House in Washington D.C. The morning after the event, the Culture House posted several photographs of Omar and other representatives:\n\nSeveral other videos and photographs from this night can also be found on Twitter. Ilhan Omar\u2019s spokesperson confirmed that the video was filmed on Friday, Sept. 13: \u201cFriday night is correct. It was filmed at a CBC event we hosted to celebrate black women in Congress.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
