{"title": "Analysis | Recidivism Watch: Trump administration again blames others for its own family separation policy", "subtitle": "Trump and his advisers keep saying the law forces them to separate immigrant families at the border. No law requires this.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-06-14T22:21:03Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20876", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/14/recidivism-watch-trump-administration-again-blames-others-for-its-own-family-separation-policy/", "vclaim": "A federal judge in California ruled in 2015 that the Flores settlement covered all children in immigration officials\u2019 custody, regardless of whether they were apprehended at the border alone or with family members. The judge\u2019s ruling also covered any accompanying parents. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the latter part of the ruling and said the Flores settlement required only that children, not parents, be released. Therefore, the government is required to keep immigrant children and their parents together only for a limited time.\n\nAfter this fact-check was published, a White House official expanded on Sanders\u2019s comments. The law requires U.S. officials to prosecute offenses, and entering the country illegally is an offense that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration largely declined to prosecute as hundreds of thousands of Central American immigrants entered the United States beginning in 2013, the official said. The Flores settlement gives special dispensation to children, requiring that they be placed with relatives or in \u201cleast restrictive\u201d settings, but it doesn\u2019t cover their parents. Moreover, even if the Trump administration did not separate families, there is not enough space to detain families together, the official added.\n\nThe Fact Checker doesn\u2019t make it a habit to go around quoting Bible verses. But since Sessions and Sanders brought it up, the Bible also says: \u201cWhen a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt\u201d (Leviticus 19:33-34). And it says that \u201ceach of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body\u201d (Ephesians 4:25).", "lang": "en"}
