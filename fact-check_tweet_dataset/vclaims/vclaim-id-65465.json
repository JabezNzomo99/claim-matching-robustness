The code allows some users, depending on their service provider, to see their call forwarding status.\n\nThe video, originally uploaded to TikTok, begins with someone holding up an iPhone, saying, \u201cHow to know if your phone\u2019s been tapped.\u201d The person then dials \u201c*#21#.\u201d Moments later, an automated message can be heard letting the caller know that the number dialed is incorrect.\n\n\u201cTapped,\u201d the person declares, suggesting that response to dialing \u201c*#21#\u201d indicates the device is being monitored. She then suggests that the displays on other iPhones showing various functions \u201cdisabled\u201d in the video indicate those phones aren\u2019t wiretapped.\n\nIn reality, the results of dialing \u201c*#21#\u201d do not show whether or not an iPhone has been compromised in such a manner. The featured sequence of special characters and numbers is one of several interrogation codes, also known as feature access codes, that allow users to quickly check iPhone functions, according to USA Today.\n\nOther interrogation codes allow users to check their data usage, see call waiting settings and block caller ID, among other functions.

The websites BGR and iPhoneTricks.org also list the interrogation code as that for viewing call forwarding settings.\n\nApple has also commented on the rumor about the interrogation code, confirming it has no relation to wiretapping.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a phone being tapped is totally irrelevant from (call forwarding settings,) aside from social media memes making it relevant,\u201d Alex Kirshner, senior public relations manager for iPhone at Apple, told USA Today.\n\nNot all service providers use the same interrogation codes, resulting in some users getting recorded messages about the number being incorrect. Interrogation codes can typically be found on the service provider\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cNot all carriers support the same feature access codes or abilities so when dialing these codes on an unsupported carrier, like Verizon for example, a customer may get a prerecorded message informing them that they have dialed an incorrect number,\u201d Kirschner explained to USA Today.", "lang": "en"}
