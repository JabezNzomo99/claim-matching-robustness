An article claiming that the Kenyan government is planning to fly the carcass back to Finland at a cost of 10 million Kenyan shillings (equivalent to nearly 90,000 euros) has since circulated widely online. However, this is false; the Kenya Wildlife Service said its veterinarians have disposed of the remains.\n\nThe article, which we've archived here but has since been taken offline, claimed that the Kenyan government planned to spend 10 million Kenyan shillings (equivalent to nearly 90,000 euros) to transport the bird\u2019s carcass back to Finland.\n\nIt has received more than 5,000 interactions in total on social media, according to the monitoring platform Crowdtangle. It was shared on multiple Facebook pages, some of which have hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nIn an official statement released on January 23, 2020, the Kenya Wildlife Service confirmed that it had rescued an Osprey bird that had migrated from Helsinki, Finland to Siaya County, located in southwestern Kenya. A reference ring on the bird\u2019s leg indicated its provenance.\n\nAfter it died a few days later, the state wildlife organisation released another statement on January 27, 2020. The Kenya Wildlife Service described the bird\u2019s cause of death as \u201clong term starvation which precipitated systemic organs failure\u201d.\n\nThe misleading article about the bird\u2019s burial was also shared multiple times on Twitter here, here and here.\n\nIn the comments, some online users expressed disbelief that the government could allocate a huge amount of money for such a purpose, while others wondered why the carcass could not be disposed of in Kenya. But some dismissed the claim as false.\n\nPaul Udoto, a communication official at the Kenya Wildlife Service, told AFP that the claims were inaccurate, explaining that the carcass was disposed of in Nairobi on January 26, 2020, and that the Finnish authorities had been informed.\n\n\u201cFake news. Carcass already disposed of. Information shared with the Finnish authorities. It was disposed of on Sunday in Nairobi by the KWS veterinarians and the Raptor Rehabilitation Centre experts,\u201d Udoto told AFP via a Twitter message.\n\nUdoto was among the online users who shared the misleading article. When asked why he did so, he replied: \u201cfor fun to show how creative Kenyans are [at] creating false narratives\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
