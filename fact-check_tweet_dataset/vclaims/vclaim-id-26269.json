{"title": "Analysis | Did racially motivated voter suppression thwart Stacey Abrams?", "subtitle": "South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested there is no dispute. But the evidence is murky, with enough material for both sides to claim they are right.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-10-30T07:00:29.182Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26269", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/30/did-racially-motivated-voter-suppression-thwart-stacey-abrams/", "vclaim": "Buttigieg\u2019s remark caught our attention because he specifically said that the voter suppression was racially motivated and that it tipped the balance toward Republican Brian Kemp \u2014 who was directly responsible for overseeing the voting because he retained his post of secretary of state while he sought the governorship.\n\nBut it turns out this is a difficult situation to fact-check, and not quite as easy as the case when we gave Four Pinocchios to Hillary Clinton for claiming she lost Wisconsin in 2016 because of voter suppression or Four Pinocchios to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) for claiming Russian efforts to suppress African American votes led to Clinton\u2019s loss of Michigan.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the election were dominated by questions of voter suppression, in part because of the unusual circumstance that Kemp refused to recuse himself from overseeing the election, so his every move was viewed with suspicion by the Abrams camp. In the closing days of the race, Kemp without evidence accused the Democrats of cybercrimes, apparently to distract from his office\u2019s own voter-registration problems.\n\nKemp, in urging his side to sign up voters, in 2014 even framed the battle with Democrats in racial terms. \u201cYou know the Democrats are working hard, and all these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines, if they can do that, they can win these elections in November,\u201d he was recorded as saying.\n\nHis remarks illustrate how it is sometimes difficult to separate out race from efforts to win partisan advantage. In a state where virtually all blacks are Democrats \u2014 and many Democrats are black \u2014 can one reasonably separate efforts to reduce votes by Democrats from an effort to reduce votes by African Americans? In other words, what is politically motivated vs. racially motivated?\n\u2022 None Kemp oversaw an aggressive effort to purge voters before the election, with nearly 700,000, or 10 percent, removed from the rolls in the year before the election. \u201cFor an estimated 107,000 of those people, their removal from the voter rolls was triggered not because they moved or died or went to prison, but rather because they had decided not to vote in prior elections,\u201d according to a report by American Public Media\n\u2022 None Kemp placed 53,000 voter registrations in electoral limbo in October, with the Associated Press estimating that 70 percent were black voters. The move was the result of an \u201cexact match\u201d policy in which even a single digit or a misplaced hyphen could derail the registration. No one knows how many of those voters turned up to vote.\n\u2022 None More than 200 polling places across the state were closed, primarily in poor and minority neighborhoods. Voters reported long lines, malfunctioning voting machines and other problems that delayed or thwarted voting in those areas. \u201cResearch shows that for every tenth of a mile that a polling station is removed from the black community (up to 4 miles), that black voter turnout declines by .5%,\u201d said Carol Anderson , a professor of African American studies at Emory University who has written extensively on voter suppression. \u201cLong lines cause people, whose paychecks are getting nibbled away waiting in the queue, to leave and not vote.\u201d (The Atlanta Journal Constitution found that precinct closures and longer distances likely prevented an estimated 54,000 to 85,000 voters from casting ballots on Election Day.)\n\u2022 None A still-unexplained 4.2 percent undervote in the lieutenant governor\u2019s race, especially prevalent in minority precincts , could indicate serious problems with paperless, touch-screen voting machines in those areas. (The undervote rate in the race was just 1 percent on mail-in or absentee paper ballots.) A federal judge in August ordered the state to have new voting machines in place by the 2020 primary election in March or have plans to provide voters with paper ballots, but advocacy groups have not been able to determine whether the machines properly recorded the governor\u2019s race.\n\u2022 None Even if every provisional ballot not counted and every rejected absentee ballot had been awarded to Abrams, it would not have necessitated a runoff, much less overcome Abrams\u2019s vote deficit.\n\u2022 None The 2018 turnout was far greater than any previous midterm, according to FiveThirtyEight , and more African Americans voted in 2018 than in 2016.\n\u2022 None Even if 54,000 to 84,000 had not voted because precinct closings, \u201cAbrams would have had to have won between 82% and 100% of those additional votes to close the gap,\u201d the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said\n\u2022 None Georgia purges lots of voters because of death, moving or not voting in recent elections, but it also makes it very easy to register because of automatic voter registration (AVR) when people obtain driver\u2019s licenses. Registration has grown 94 percent in Georgia because of automatic voter registration, according to the Brennan Center\n\n\u201cAbrams was very effective in mobilizing her supporters, but in the end \u2014 perhaps due to a narrowing of the enthusiasm gap following the [Brett] Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 lots of Republicans also turned out,\u201d said Charles S. Bullock III, political science professor at the University of Georgia. \u201cThe claim is not based on fact but will continue to be articulated by Abrams since it helps mobilize her supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe turnout was so high not because of Kemp, but despite Kemp\u2019s efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Georgia/Kemp don\u2019t get credit for AVR when he had the legislature put in place the Exact Match program that a judge had already ruled was racially discriminatory because it privileged anglicized names. Kemp doesn\u2019t get credit for the high turnout when his office recommended a consultant who went around to poor and minority counties recommending numerous poll closures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Georgia in general and Brian Kemp in particular took steps to make it harder for people to register and vote, and that those people tended to skew Democratic,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cI have seen no good social science evidence that efforts to make it harder to register and vote were responsible for Kemp\u2019s victory over Abrams in the Georgia gubernatorial race. That seems to me to be beside the point: The question is whether Georgia had a good reason to put these suppressive measures in place, and for the most part, the state did not have good reasons.\u201d\n\nThis is the political version of a Rorschach test \u2014 where you land depends on how you view the wide range of pertinent evidence. Buttigieg suggested his statement was a factual claim, not in dispute, though it\u2019s really more of an opinion. As we noted, there\u2019s a fine line, especially in Southern states, between efforts to thwart votes by Democrats vs. suppressing minorities, making it especially difficult to untangle.\n\nAbrams fell short by 55,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast, in a case filled with election mischief and fierce disputes. Buttigieg should not be so definitive in his assertion that Abrams would have won if not for racially motivated measures. But at this point, we think it prudent to leave this without a Pinocchio rating, though we may revisit this fact check if more definitive evidence emerges in the future.", "lang": "en"}
