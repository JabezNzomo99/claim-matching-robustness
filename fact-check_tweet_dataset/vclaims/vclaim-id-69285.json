So what\u2019s going on?\n\nWhen we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger.\n\nThe law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.)\n\nHowever, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion.\n\nSo the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say.\n\nPatrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure \"is misleading if it\u2019s the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill \u2014 $1.5 trillion.\"\n\nHe noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bill\u2019s provisions.\n\nOn that web page, the White House wrote that the bill \"provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts\" but that it will also \"raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts.\"\n\nTrump said the recently enacted tax law includes \"$5.5 trillion in tax cuts.\" Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
