They actually left because the wait time was too long.\n\nFonda, star of award-winning films like \u201cComing Home\u201d and \u201cKlute,\u201d has been politically vocal through her career, publicly opposing the Vietnam War during the 70s. In 2003, the story of Fonda being thrown out of a Montana restaurant as a result of her activism began circulating online and eventually migrated to Facebook. (RELATED: Is US Defense Spending At Near-Historic Lows?)\n\nShe and her then-husband and CNN founder Ted Turner tried to use their celebrity status to get seated before other diners at Sir Scott\u2019s Oasis Steakhouse in Montana, according to the Facebook post. The owner, identified in the post as a Vietnam veteran, allegedly denied them service due to her anti-war activism.\n\n\u201cI am the owner of this restaurant and I am a Vietnam Veteran,\u201d the owner supposedly told Fonda and Turner. \u201cNot only will you not get a table ahead of my friends and neighbors who have been waiting here, But (sic) you also will not be eating in my restaurant tonight or any other night.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that this interaction ever took place. An internet search revealed no credible sources reporting that she was denied service, only those debunking the story.\n\nFonda and Turner did visit the restaurant and leave without being served, according to Snopes, but not due to her war protests. Owner Scott Westphal, who is not a Vietnam veteran, told Belgrade News that they left by choice because the wait time was too long without reservations.\n\nThe couple returned to the restaurant numerous times after their initial visit, according to a Vietnam Veteran News podcast.", "lang": "en"}
