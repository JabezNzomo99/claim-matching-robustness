An EFCC spokesman confirmed to AFP that this is false and that the agency has made no such arrests. There is no record of the agency ever arresting a former president.\n\nOne of the posts, which appear predominantly as a \u201cbreaking news\u201d message on WhatsApp, claims the two former leaders were detained as part of incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption campaign.\n\n\u201cBUHARI GOVT HAS DONE IT AGAIN.......... EFCC ARRESTS OBASANJO AND FORMER PRESIDENT GOODLUCK JONATHAN BOTH TO FACE TRIAL NEXT WEEK MONDAY,\u201d part of the post reads.\n\nThe claim also appears on Facebook, including via a post which we\u2019ve archived here. The post claims that Obasanjo was arrested at Lagos\u2019 Murtala Muhammed International Airport \u201con his way out of the country\u201d and that Jonathan was detained at Abuja\u2019s Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport on arrival from a foreign trip.\n\nWe\u2019ve archived some other versions of the same post here, here, here, and here.\n\nThe posts allege that Obasanjo was arrested over the Halliburton bribery case, a corruption scandal dating back to the early 2000s -- you can read the background here. Jonathan was meanwhile said to have been arrested over a $2.1-billion arms deal scandal from during his time in power in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of the two prominent politicians is due to President Mohammadu Buhari's zero tolerance for corruption and his determination to fight corruption not minding whose ox is gored,\u201d the post reads.\n\nThe EFCC has never arrested an ex-president\n\nAFP checked EFCC public records detailing the agency\u2019s activities and found no information on either ex-president being arrested. EFCC spokesman Tony Orilade told AFP by email that he was \u201cnot aware of such arrests\u201d. There is no record of a former Nigerian head of state ever being arrested by the EFCC since the agency was created in 2003.\n\nCredible local media also have not carried any reports on either of the former presidents being arrested.\n\nKehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo\u2019s spokesman, told AFP by phone that \u201cBaba\u201d, as Obasanjo is fondly called, \u201cis in his room right now\u201d. He said the former president was not arrested as the claims suggest. Mails sent to Ikechukwu Eze, spokesman to former president Goodluck Jonathan, were not returned. But on August 14 Jonathan\u2019s official Twitter account said that he was in South Korea\u2019s capital Seoul for the International Leadership Conference.", "lang": "en"}
