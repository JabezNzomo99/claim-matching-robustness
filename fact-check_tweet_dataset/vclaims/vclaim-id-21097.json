That includes a 2.9 percent increase in the third quarter of 2016, which the Trump campaign dismissed at the time as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nAlso, the 2.6 percent rate of growth in the second quarter was not unexpected. Some economic models forecast higher growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, for example, initially forecast in May that the second quarter GDP growth would be 4.3 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s GDP puffery came during a Cabinet meeting on July 31 in which he boasted about an array of economic accomplishments since he took office.\n\nTrump, July 31: We have a GDP, on Friday \u2014 it got very little mention, although I guess in the business areas it did. But it got, I think, very little mention. 2.6 is a number that nobody thought they\u2019d see for a long period of time. Remember, I was saying we will hit three at some point in the not-too-distant future, and everybody smiled and they laughed and they thought we\u2019d be at one. And 2.6 is an unbelievable number, announced on Friday.\n\nTrump was referring to an \u201cadvance\u201d estimate announced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on July 28 that real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter of 2017. That\u2019s up from a revised estimate that the GDP rose 1.2 percent in the first quarter of the year.\n\nAlthough Trump claimed 2.6 percent quarterly growth \u201cis a number that nobody thought they\u2019d see for a long period of time,\u201d it is actually substantially lower than what the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow forecast model initially predicted for the second quarter \u2014 4.3 percent \u2014 back on May 1. That forecast was subsequently revised down over time, but was at 2.8 percent on the day before the BEA announced its advance estimate.\n\nOn March 3, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initially projected a 2.91 percent GDP growth in the second quarter, although the projection fell to around 2 percent during the last month.\n\nSimilarly, the Blue Chip Consensus on March 15 estimated the real GDP growth in the second quarter at 2.5 percent \u2014 almost exactly where it ended up. That forecast rose to 3 percent on June 13. Wolters Kluwer\u2019s Blue Chip Economic Indicators reflect the forecasts of 50 economists.\n\nMark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told us his firm\u2019s October 2016 outlook for the U.S. economy projected 2017 second quarter real GDP growth at 2.9 percent.\n\n\u201cThe actual gain of 2.6 percent is not materially different,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cWe also had assumed that Clinton would win the election.\u201d\n\nOne caveat: The BEA \u201cemphasized\u201d that its second quarter advance estimate was based on \u201csource data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency.\u201d Harvard professor Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, told Politico that the advance estimate is \u201cnotoriously volatile\u201d and \u201chas a substantial guess component to it.\u201d BEA said its \u201csecond\u201d estimate for the second quarter will be released on Aug. 30 and will be \u201cbased on more complete data.\u201d\n\nFurman also warned that it is a mistake to \u201cread too much into any one quarter\u2019s GDP data.\u201d\n\nAs Politico noted, \u201cIn recent years, the U.S. economy has often started off slowly, improved in the middle of the year, only to sag again toward the end. \u2026 It grew at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014 before sputtering out.\u201d\n\nAccording to BEA data, real GDP grew at a higher rate than 2.6 percent in eight of the last 18 quarters, as the chart below shows. (Click on the chart to see a larger image.) From 2013 to 2016, real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent. That\u2019s identical to the annual growth the Blue Chip Consensus forecast in March for the entirety of 2017.\n\n\n\n \u201cNo, 2.6 percent is not an unbelievable number that no one thought we\u2019d see for a long time,\u201d Zandi told us. \u201cWhat few believe is that we will see 3 percent growth on a sustained basis, not for a quarter or two or three.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that real GDP growth in the first quarter was only 1.4 percent,\u201d Zandi said. (It was actually revised down to 1.2 percent in the BEA\u2019s recent advance estimate.) \u201cThus real GDP growth during the first half of the year was 2 percent, almost precisely the growth the economy has experienced since this economic expansion began eight years ago.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
