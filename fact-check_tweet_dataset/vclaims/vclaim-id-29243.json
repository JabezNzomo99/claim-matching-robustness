The Jobs Fund has created 170,148 permanent jobs (and 55,654 short-term jobs) but has under-spent its budget.\n\u2022 None Conflicting data meant there was no way to prove the textiles incentive would help workers keep 35,500 existing jobs. \n\n\n\npeppered with biblical quotes and many tales about plants, finance minister Tito Mboweni outlined his budget for South Africa on 20 February 2019. He said it would push the country towards renewal and growth.\n\n\u201cI am here to speak about hard facts and figures,\u201d Mboweni said. But did he get his numbers right about employment, a critical issue for South Africa?\n\nDescribing the ETI as \u201chighly successful\u201d, Mboweni said the government had raised how much a person employed under the scheme could earn and still benefit.\n\naims to encourage employers to hire young job seekers, as sustained high unemployment would hurt the economy for years to come. It started in January 2014.\n\nFirms that hire qualifying young work seekers aged 18 to 29 pay less PAYE (pay as you earn) tax,\n\nSome \u201c1.1 million young people are supported\u201d by this plan, Mboweni said.\n\nThe national treasury\u2019s most recent and publicly available data on the scheme is from the 2015/16 financial year, according to its\n\nIn 2015/16 about 31,000 employers claimed the incentive for 1.1 million employees, at a cost of R4.3 billion. This was an increase from\n\nin 2014/15 claimed by 32,368 employers at a cost of R2.26 billion.\n\nNewer data was on its way, Catherine Macleod, the chief director of macroeconomic policy at the treasury, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cWe have taken on board some new financial years worth of PAYE data and we will be releasing those reports, but I don\u2019t have a firm date for when they are going to be ready,\u201d she said.\n\nMacleod said the treasury \u201cfrequently and rigorously\u201d evaluated the scheme as a benchmark for other job creation incentives in South Africa.\n\nBut is it \u2018highly successful\u2019?\n\nThat would depend on how the success was measured,\n\n\u201cIf the question is whether the ETI has improved the employment rate of youth,\n\n. If the measure of success is whether the policy created the jobs that it had intended then perhaps the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nUnu-Wider is one of three organisations commissioned to review the scheme, the treasury told Africa Check. (Note: Ebrahim's research on the ETI was from a Unu-Wider grant and is independent of treasury, she clarified.)\n\nThe scheme doesn\u2019t cost as much as other job-creating policies, Ebrahim said.\n\nNewer data will be welcome, but the available numbers do back up the minister.\n\naims to support business activities that directly create jobs in South Africa. It was established by the treasury in 2011.\n\nBy December 2018 the fund had created 225,802 jobs,\n\nin March 2019. Of these,\n\nof the jobs. Women held 60% of the jobs and youth 57%.\n\nHow are these jobs created?\n\nBoth public and private sector employers can submit online proposals that \u201cshow development potential linked to job creation\u201d, the fund\n\nThe proposals are assessed by an investment committee. When a proposal is approved, the organisation then estimates how many new permanent and short term jobs, internships and traineeships it will create.\n\nAfter this, the project \u201creports separately against each indicator\u201d, fund spokesperson Lerato Seko said. Africa Check was however unable to collaborate the fund\u2019s numbers.\n\nis responsible for evaluating the fund, chairperson Yvonne Phosa told Africa Check.\n\nThe committee was dissatisfied with a\n\non the programme\u2019s effectiveness and asked for a second, more detailed report, Phosa said. This took place\n\nOne concern was under-spending, as the fund had paid out less money than it was given. In 2011, R9 billion was allocated to the fund.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t understand how if we\u2019ve got this dire need for job creation there is under-expenditure,\u201d Phosa told Africa Check.\n\nThe treasury explained that the system works on a match-funding basis. This means employers have to match the amount of money provided by the fund.\n\nEmployers must also develop a project plan that clearly states what they intend to do and and the funds needed every three months \u2013 a quarter of the year. If the plan isn\u2019t delivered by the end of the quarter, the fund withholds its half of the grant.\n\n\u201cThey then linked that to the under-expenditure,\u201d Phosa told Africa Check.\n\nThe committee found the newer level of detail \u201cpleasing\u201d, she said. \u201cWe actually see it as a shock absorber for unemployment but not only that, as an enabler for job creation.\u201d -\n\nMboweni said that out of the R19.8 billion allocated to manufacturing incentives, R600 million would go to the clothing and textiles competitiveness programme. This would support 35,500 existing jobs and create another 25,000 over three years.\n\nand is run by the\n\nunder the department of trade and industry.\n\nGovernment incentives are designed to offer \u201ca little extra\u201d to achieve specific objectives, Prof Anthony Black told Africa Check. The clothing and textile incentive aims to support employment and competitiveness in the industry.\n\nBlack is the director of the\n\nHow many jobs does the plan support?\n\nIn a November 2018 report to parliament, the department said the programme had \u201csupported\u201d\n\njobs - over two times the minister\u2019s figure - since its launch, with R4.2 billion paid out.\n\nWe have repeatedly asked the department how these were defined and calculated. Programme manager Lucky Testa would only say the specific numbers were with the industry associations.\n\nThe incentive largely helps firms buy new equipment and increase productivity to remain profitable and globally competitive, Prof\n\n\u201cis not a strategy meant to expand the number of jobs, but to prevent firms from shutting down\u201d, she said. Only\n\nBut investing in new technologies could also lead to job losses, said\n\n\u201cThese subsidies will protect the jobs of a small number of more skilled workers but may destroy some less skilled jobs in the very same firms and do nothing to protect workers in the most vulnerable firms,\u201d he said.\n\nNattrass also questioned if the programme was an \u201cefficient or effective\u201d way of supporting jobs, using the minister\u2019s figures.\n\n\"R600 million is the equivalent of about 350,000 one-month jobs in South Africa's public works programme (which currently pays\n\nGiven the conflicting data, we rate this claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
