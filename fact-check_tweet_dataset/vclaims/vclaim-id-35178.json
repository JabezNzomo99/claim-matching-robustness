However, Namibia Fact Check has ascertained that president Geingob attended the ceremony of the 4th International Anti-Corruption Excellence Award, in Kigali, Rwanda, on 9 December 2019. Also present at the event was the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nHere is a video of president Geingob speaking at the 4th International Anti-Corruption Excellence Award.\n\nPresident Geingob made three (3) specific claims during his Cabinet meeting opening statement:\n\nThis was with reference to a conversation president Geingob said he had with the Emir of Qatar at the Kigali, Rwanda, event during which he stated that Qatar-based Al Jazeera aired its Anatomy of a Bribe documentary, about the Fishrot corruption scandal, during the Namibian elections of 27 November 2019.\n\nThis is false. The Al Jazeera Fishrot documentary was broadcast on 1 December 2019, after the 27 November elections and after the results of the elections had officially been announced on the evening of 30 November 2019.\n\nThis is clearly a reference to the 2019 CPI.\n\nThis is mostly false. Namibia didn\u2019t go one step up, but went one point down (from 53 in 2018 to 52 in 2019) and four places down (from 52 in 2018 to 56 in 2019). However, the president is correct that Namibia is in the top ten of African countries on the 2019 CPI, coming in at joint fifth with Mauritius out of 49 African countries ranked on the latest CPI.\n\nThis was also with reference to a conversation at the Kigali, Rwanda, event during which the president alleged someone said that the Fishrot corruption scandal, which was exposed in mid-November 2019, did not influence Namibia\u2019s ranking on the 2019 CPI.\n\nThis is mostly false. A country\u2019s ranking is determined by an assessment of various data sources. The 2019 CPI document states on page 26:\n\nAdditionally, a country\u2019s ranking is determined by assessing at least three (3) of the data sources.\n\nWhile the 2019 CPI document does provide a brief overview of the Fishrot Files corruption scandal on page 24, it does not follow that the Fishrot scandal influenced Namibia\u2019s ranking as most of the surveys and other data sources used by the CPI to determine country rankings were conducted and released well before the Fishrot Files became public in mid-November 2019.\n\nThe 13 different data sources used to calculate the CPI are the following:\n\nIn Namibia\u2019s case, seven (7) of these sources were used to determine the country score and ranking. These sources are:\n\nIn the final assessment, based on the evidence available, Namibia Fact Check finds that president Geingob\u2019s corruption-related claims made during the Cabinet opening speech of 4 February 2020 were mostly false.\n\nUPDATED: To include seven sources used to determine the country score and ranking.", "lang": "en"}
