ToG, for instance, followed up this claim with several \u201cFACTS\u201d about the alleged incident. ToG claimed that Gombell\u2019s mother had an audio recording of \u201cher daughter the night before she was killed saying, \u2018If something happens to me it was Donald.\u2019\u201d ToG claimed that Officer Bernard Kerik had written in his autobiography that he had made \u201ccertain inconvenient facts disappear\u201d for a \u201ca certain well-known real-estate magnate.\u201d And ToG claimed that Gombell\u2019s roommate, Michelle White, died of \u201csuicide\u201d just two weeks after Gombell\u2019s death.\n\nBut the coup de gr\u00e2ce, a fixture of so many conspiracy theories, was the claim that verifiable information regarding Gombell\u2019s death had been mysteriously scrubbed from all of the usual places as part of a cover-up.\n\nTaken at face value, these \u201cfacts\u201d paint a damning picture: The President of the United States killed a woman in 2000. Even for readers with a slightly more discerning eye, this thread still \u201craised questions\u201d and suggested that Trump was likely involved in some sort of nefarious activity.\n\nBefore we start pulling apart this set of claims, let\u2019s make something clear: Donald Trump did not murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000. Carolyn Gombell never existed.\n\nThis thread was posted on May 26, 2020, the same day Twitter announced that it would not remove Trump\u2019s tweets pushing a debunked conspiracy theory about MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough supposedly killing an intern named Lori Klausutis, despite her widower\u2019s pleas that the platform do so. ToG created a conspiracy theory that mirrored this and others pushed by the president, except that ToG\u2019s conspiracy theory was directed at the president himself.\n\nWhile some may disagree with ToG\u2019s tactic, it does give us an opportunity to pull apart a conspiracy theory to show just how it was put together. ToG\u2019s first \u201cfact\u201d claims that there\u2019s an audio recording of Gombell naming Trump as her potential killer. However, saying something exists does not make that thing exist. As you\u2019ll notice, this viral thread does not actually link to an audio file of Gombell making this statement.\n\nToG\u2019s second \u201cfact\u201d makes a similarly baseless claim. While this account says that forensics first \u201cmatched the residual thumbprints found on Carolyn\u2019s neck as \u2018matching\u2019 Trump\u2019s own (small) hands,\u201d they provide no supporting evidence to back up this claim.\n\nIn ToG\u2019s third fact, we finally have something that we can truly investigate. Not only does ToG claim that \u201cKerik\u201d (referring to former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik) wrote about the incident in his 2009 autobiography \u201cOne Good Cop,\u201d but ToG also provides the alleged page number.\n\nAt first glance, this detail makes it seem like this rumor is valid and verified. ToG, after all, just provided a source for his claim and most readers are not going to take the time to look up this passage. If they did, however, they\u2019d see that this book does not actually exist.\n\nKerik has written two autobiographies about his experiences as police commissioner and as the minister of the interior of Iraq, and his jailing for fraud and lying to authorities, but neither of these books was titled \u201cOne Good Cop.\u201d The first, published in 2001, was titled \u201cThe Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice,\u201d and the other, published in 2015, was titled \u201cFrom Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #84888-054.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kerik did not write a book entitled \u201cOne Good Cop\u201d in which he admitted to \u201cdisappearing evidence\u201d for a certain \u201creal estate mogul,\u201d we imagine that his name was included in this thread for a reason. It grounds this conspiracy theory at least partly in reality \u2014 Kerik, after all, was a real and controversial figure \u2014 and provides interested parties an opportunity to ask some suspicious questions: Why did Trump issue a full pardon to Kerik? Was it because Kerik helped him cover up a murder?\n\nWhile ToG did not make this specific accusation, the account did provide just enough information to let people start drawing their own conclusions.\n\nThe fourth \u201cfact\u201d provided by ToG insinuates that not only did Trump murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell, supposedly, but he also had her roommate killed to cover up the crime. ToG does not directly make this accusation, either. Rather, they put the words \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d in quotation marks to imply that while this is the official narrative, it may also not be the truth. This is another common tactic used by purveyors of misinformation (notably those spreading the similar \u201cClinton Body Bags\u201d conspiracy theories for the past quarter-century).\n\nWe searched Newspapers.com for articles reporting that a woman named \u201cMichelle White\u201d threw herself in front of a train in New York in 2000, but again, we came up empty-handed.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t we able to find any information about a woman named Carolyn Gombell? According to ToG, it\u2019s because all of the information regarding her death has been scrubbed from the internet as part of a massive cover-up to protect Trump. While this certainly sounds suspicious \u2014 damning, even \u2014 it also provides convenient cover to hide a baseless claim.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that searching the internet for articles on the death of Carolyn Gombell doesn\u2019t yield many results, not because these articles were deleted as part of a cover up, but because they never existed in the first place.\n\nWhen we first came across ToG\u2019s thread on May 26, 2020, we thought it was obvious that this Twitter account was using the language of conspiracy theorists to make a point about how easy it is to start a baseless rumor, and also to challenge social media platforms to enforce their content policies. Soon thereafter, however, we started to receive queries from people who thought that there might be some truth to the claim that Trump killed a woman in 2000.\n\nThe day following ToG\u2019s thread, fake obituary pages were published for \u201cCarolyn Gombell\u201d on websites such as DeadDeath and Ever Loved. The hashtag #JusticeForCarolyn also trended on Twitter as social media users spread the baseless claim. While this may seem an obvious ruse now, in May 2020, it\u2019s easy to imagine people being taken in by this claim if they were to encounter it for the first time a week or a month afterward.\n\nThis conspiracy theory was invented in May 2020 as a criticism of President Trump for spreading baseless rumors, and of the social networks that allow him to do so.\n\nDid Joe Scarborough Murder an Intern in 2001?\n\nIn May 2020, President Trump repeatedly insinuated that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had murdered a woman. The president, just like the ToG Twitter account, made outlandish and evidence-free claims, asked leading questions, and provided just enough detail to let his followers start connecting imaginary dots:\n\nThe biggest difference between Trump\u2019s tweets and those of TheTweetofGod is that Trump\u2019s accusations deal with the death of real woman, Lori Klausutis, who died in 2001, reportedly as a result of a heart condition. But this is not a \u201ccold case,\u201d as Trump claims, and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough is not a murder suspect. In fact, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away at the time of Klausutis\u2019 death.", "lang": "en"}
