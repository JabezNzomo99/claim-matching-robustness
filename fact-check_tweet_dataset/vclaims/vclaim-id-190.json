Some versions of the photograph include two other people: Biden\u2019s wife Jill Biden and Meet the Press producer Chris Donovan.\n\nThis claim is false. The photograph has been altered, moving Biden\u2019s hands higher than they were in the original photograph. A bottle of Wild Turkey whiskey has also been added to his jacket pocket.\n\nThe original photograph shows Biden's hands on Parnes' waist. It was taken at a holiday party in 2013 and posted on Parnes' Facebook page ( here )\u200b.\n\nThe altered photograph appears to come from satire news website World News Bureau in a fake article dating back to 2013 ( here ). The photograph has continued to circulate online with many users believing that it is real. \u200b\n\nComments on the altered photograph include: \u201cWhat is the old creep putting his hands on her anywhere. He shouldn\u2019t have been touching her at all. Try that at work in a corporation, as Trump would say \u201cyou\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d, \u201c Dirty old man, nothing to laugh about!\u201d and \u201cFeely Joe been on the news alot... says alot bout the dems choices.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden has faced allegations that he has made women uncomfortable with his use of physical contact. Biden told reporters in July 2019 that he was taking the complaints about his personal conduct seriously, but stopped short of apologizing ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked posts claiming Joe Biden had inappropriately touched a young boy, which actually shows him comforting his grandson at the boy\u2019s father\u2019s funeral ( here ), and a photograph claiming to show Biden kissing a young girl, which actually shows Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ( here ).\n\nFalse: A photo of Joe Biden allegedly groping a reporter has been altered.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
