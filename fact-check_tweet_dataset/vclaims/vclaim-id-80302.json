However, another Google video reveals it was a joke timed for April Fool\u2019s Day.\n\nThe video with the caption \u201cSelf Driving Bike By Google!\u201d was widely shared on Facebook including on the accounts I Friggin Love Technology and Brainy is the New Sexy.\n\nThe video, which received more than 11 million views on those two accounts alone, shows a self-driving bicycle cruising through an urban area with no rider.\n\nThe bicycle appears to propel itself through busy streets including stopping at traffic signals.\n\nAt one point, a woman is shown riding the bicycle while working on a laptop and taking calls as the bicycle steers itself on the road.\n\nThousands of people commented on the video, with many appearing to believe it was true.\n\n\"I just can't believe how revolutionary this could be. Imagine if you will: Solar powered base stations around the city where these bikes return to after circling a route on the main thoroughfares (weather permitting). You could summon one and pay with your phone,\" one user wrote.\n\n\u201cEveryone is going to get fat with all these self driving bikes and electric skateboards,\u201d wrote another Facebook user.\n\nOthers realised it was a joke. One Facebook user wrote: \u201cWow, can't believe there's people out there who believe this is real!\"\n\nGoogle Netherlands released the original version of the video on YouTube on March 31, 2016 on the eve of April Fool\u2019s Day, about four months before the version was posted on the I Friggin Love Technology page.\n\nThe original post also attracted millions of views and many comments from people believing it was true.\n\nBut pasted in the description of the post was a link to another YouTube video that said: Find out how this project was created in this 'making of' video.\n\nThe second batch of footage shows how a special-effects team created the original video.", "lang": "en"}
