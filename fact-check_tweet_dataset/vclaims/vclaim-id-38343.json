Let\u2019s check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Delhi police trying to hit a child with the baton. Fact: The image isn\u2019t from India. It shows a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton during protests in their country in 2010. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nEver since riots have erupted in Delhi, the internet is flooded with many images and videos claiming them to be of those riots. While a few of them were true, most of them were found to be old and unrelated. The image in the post was found in the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 photo library. As per this information, the image is of a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton during clashes with garment workers in Dhaka on 30 June 2010. So, the image is an old one and is not even related to India. In 2010, workers of garment factories in Bangladesh had protested against low pay and poor working conditions in their factories. When the protests became violent, clashes broke out between the garment workers and the police. More information about those protests can be read here and here.\n\nTo summarize, the image of a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton is being shared as that of Delhi Police.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
