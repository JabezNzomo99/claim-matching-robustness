It may be a version of an expression written by American fantasy author P.C. Hodgell.\n\nAn award-winning astronomer and popular science writer, Sagan helped establish, among other scientific contributions, that a strong \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d likely caused the high temperatures experienced on Venus today.\n\nSagan is perhaps best known for writing and hosting the 1980 space documentary series \u201cCosmos: A Personal Voyage.\u201d The Emmy Award-winning series explored topics ranging from the origins of the universe to the possibility of extraterrestrial life. In 2014, 21st Century Fox released a follow-up called \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\u201d hosted by astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Pass It On\u2019?)\n\nThough Sagan was a proponent of scientific inquiry throughout his career, there is no evidence he made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post.\n\n\u201cI never heard of that quote, and it does not look at all like something Carl would have said,\u201d Steven Soter, an astrophysicist and co-writer of \u201cCosmos,\u201d told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator suggests that the quote may actually be derived from a line in Hodgell\u2019s fantasy novel \u201cSeeker\u2019s Mask\u201d in which a character states, \u201cThat which can be destroyed by the truth should be.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
