The About section at the bottom of this site states, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\" (The poor grammar is how it appears on the page.)\n\nThe main page of www.breakingnews365.net gives users the option to \"prank your friends now\" and create his or her own article. It also gives users the option to add a photo and suggests that he or she should make titles that would \"make your friends curious.\"\n\nThere is also an identical website called www.breakingnews247.net that PolitiFact has reported on before.\n\nBut if you missed the warning at the bottom of the page and the grammar mistakes within the article, there are other ways to disprove the validity of this article.\n\nGeorge Soros is the founder of Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization devoted to strengthening democracy and protecting marginalized communities. In the past, he advocated for Georgetown University to offer financial aid for African-American students \"whose forbears were slaves.\"\n\nBut unlike what the story claimed, Soros does not have any apparent history of trying to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe breakingnews365.net article does not specify when the special session was that would have approved the name change. The Washington State Legislature adjourned its last special session July 20, 2017.\n\nThe Washington State Legislature\u2019s report of all the bills passed in 2017 contains no mention of a bill that changes the name or a recent special session.\n\nThe statement that Washington state changed its name is made up, so we rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
