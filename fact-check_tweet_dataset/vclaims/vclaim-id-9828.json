Business Insider: SURPRISE: Earth has two moons.\n\nBut other websites covered the story more accurately. Slate\u2019s headline hinted that details matter: Another Moon for Earth? Well, Not Really, but It Depends on Your Point of View. Gizmodo also explained the nuances in a story headlined: Earth's New 'Quasi' Moon Will Stick Around for Centuries.\n\nNASA has not confirmed that Earth has a new moon, as smartmindmag.com claimed.", "lang": "en"}
