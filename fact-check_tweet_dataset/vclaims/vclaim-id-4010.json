Van der Meij previously worked as a legal adviser for NATO.\n\nVan der Meij was quoted as saying he and his colleagues at the CCDCOE do not agree with the British government\u2019s claim that the strikes were legal under international law if they were carried out \u201cto alleviate overwhelming human suffering\u201d -- in this case, resulting from the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical attacks on civilians.\n\nA representative from the CCDCOE later told Polygraph.info that Van der Meij\u2019s comments \"were taken out of context\" -- that Van der Meij\u2019s spoke of the concepts without specifically speaking of the Syrian conflict. The newspaper has not responded publicly yet, but even considering the CCDOE assertion, the Polygraph.info \"verdict\" does not change. ,\n\nAccording to Van der Meij, there are only three formal legal justifications to use military force -- in self-defense, in accordance with a U.N. Security Council resolution, and at the invitation of a recognized government. He also clarified that while there was much discussion about formalizing the use of humanitarian intervention as a justification for military action, nothing has been adopted yet because different parties disagree on what constitutes legitimate \u201chumanitarian intervention.\u201d\n\nAn official with the U.S. State Department responded with a statement Monday calling the strikes \"justified, legitimate and proportionate\" stating that Russia was complicit in the Assad regime's \"use of chemical weapons in violation of international law.\"\n\n\"This is a problem that has only been exacerbated by Russia's persistent refusal to use its influence with Syria to bring an end to the regime's continuing, unacceptable use of chemical weapons, and by Russia's vetoes of U.N. resolutions on Syria,\" the U.S.official said.\n\nAnd U.N. officials, in the past, have directed accusations of war crimes at Syria and Russia.\n\n\"Let us be clear: Those using ever more destructive weapons know exactly what they are doing. They know they are committing war crimes,\" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said at the time of attacks on Aleppo in 2016.\n\nThe Sputnik article also cited Christine Chinkin, a professor of international law at the London School of Economics, and Mary Kaldor, a professor of global governance also at LSE, who jointly criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s justification for the attack in an open letter to the publication Open Democracy.\n\n\u200bThe two authors noted that while a number of international law experts support the concept of humanitarian intervention, it has not been formally recognized. Furthermore, they pointed out that while the attacks on Syria may be considered a \u201clegitimate\u201d response to the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons, not only were they in violation of international law, it is also difficult to argue they alleviated human suffering since they were extremely limited strikes.\n\nThe arguments put forward by Chinkin and Kaldor in their open letter have been echoed by other experts. For example, Craig Martin, a security fellow at the Truman National Security Project, wrote an article stating that while the so-called \u201cResponsibility to Protect\u201d has been invoked to justify interventions like the one in Kosovo in 1999, it has not yet been codified as international law. Martin writes \u201cthere is little doubt\u201d the Assad regime in Syria \u201chas committed war crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d in the last two years.Yet, he argued that if military intervention is \u201cnot lawful, then it represents nothing more than vigilante justice.\u201d\n\nDuring his announcement of the strikes, U.S. President Donald Trump explained the United States' rationale behind the strikes.\n\n\"The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons,\" the president said.\n\nAt the U.N. April 14, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley repeated the rationale.\n\n\"The targets we selected were at the heart of the Syrian regime\u2019s illegal chemical weapons program. The strikes were carefully planned to minimize civilian casualties,\" she said.\n\n\"We did not give diplomacy just one chance. We gave diplomacy chance after chance.\" she added in her statement.\n\nStill, experts on international law do not agree with U.S. and British. assertions of legality, though they acknowledge that this is a separate issue from the question of whether such a strike is morally justified.\n\n\u201cThere is no UNSC no resolution; it\u2019s a sovereign state; it\u2019s an internal matter- there\u2019s no conventional justification,\u201d Tom Ginsburg, who teaches International Law at the University of Chicago, told Polygraph.info. \u201cThe responsibility to protect is a doctrine of uncertain status. It\u2019s been invoked on a couple of occasions. The U.S. position on it has been uneven. I can\u2019t really see how it would be legal. That\u2019s all separate from whether it\u2019s moral or a good idea. We have to separate positive law from these other issues.\u201d\n\nWilliam Partlett, an associate professor of law at the University of Melbourne, also criticized the missile strikes\u2019 lack of legality, noting that the failure of Western countries to abide by international law sets a bad example.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it becomes far harder - if not impossible - for the United States, the UK, and France to condemn the use of force by other countries when they themselves grossly flaunt it,\u201d Partlett wrote. \u201cSo if we care at all about the \u2018rules-based order\u2019, we should worry about ignoring international law constraints on the use of force. Otherwise we are admitting that [the] international legal regime on the use of force has completely broken down.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
