That's a lie.\u201d\n\nThe outward appearance of the envelopes and the contents of the explosive devices are similar, according to law enforcement. None of the devices detonated.\n\nThe identity of the perpetrator and their motive is not known, and a spokesman for the FBI said the bureau has no comment.\n\nDespite an absence of evidence, Jones of InfoWars laid the blame on the so-called \"deep state,\" a supposed cabal of anti-Trump government bureaucrats, who loom large in the minds of conspiracy theorists.\n\nWe asked InfoWars for evidence, and they did not respond to our request.", "lang": "en"}
