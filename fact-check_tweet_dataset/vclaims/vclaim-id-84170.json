The claims are false; the images are actually photographs by the AFP and AP news agencies from 2006 and they show funerals for dozens of people killed after a bus hit a landmine in northern Sri Lanka.\n\nOne photograph, shared here on Facebook on April 24, 2019, shows a huge crowd of people carrying a long line of coffins down a road.\n\nThe caption says: \"Funeral procession In Sri Lanka Murderer Victims by ISIS Their memories be eternal !!!\"\n\nA series of bombings at Sri Lankan churches and hotels on Easter Sunday April 21, 2019, left more that 250 people dead in attacks later claimed by the Islamic State group.

A powerful land mine ripped through an over crowded bus 15 June, killing 64 people including 15 children, and wounded 80 others in an attack blamed on Tamil Tiger rebels, who have denied involvement.\"\n\nHere is an AFP report on that incident.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original AFP photo:\n\nA similar photo was posted on Facebook here on April 23, 2019, two days after the Sri Lanka Easter Sunday bomb attacks, and has since been shared more than 2,800 times.\n\nThe post's caption says: \"Funeral Of Victims - Sri Lanka. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same photographs and claims have been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nBoth of the photographs in the second post also show the same June 16, 2006 funerals in Sri Lanka for victims of the landmine attack.\n\nA reverse image search for the top image found it was an AFP photo from 16 June, 2006.

With each side blaming each other for the rising tensions, some 10,000 mourners prayed at a funeral for 61 of the victims, 15 children among them. The bus bombing was Sri Lanka's worst single act of violence since the government and Tigers signed a cease-fire in 2002, and it renewed fears of a return to war.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that photo.\n\nUPDATE: This fact check was updated on May 16, 2019 with a revised death toll.", "lang": "en"}
