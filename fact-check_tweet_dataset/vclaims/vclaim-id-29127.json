And I said, it\u2019s funny, he lied about so many things, and yet he could have said \u2014 he might as well lie about that one, too. But he said no collusion. And everybody said no collusion. Richard Burr, Senator Burr, said no collusion. Senate Intelligence. The House has come up, as you know, the committee, Devin Nunes and all, they said no collusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust in the public domain, there are literally reams and reams of evidence of Russian outreach to Trump officials and clear interest from Trump officials, including the president\u2019s own son, welcoming the opportunity to get dirt on Hillary,\u201d Warner said March 3 on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d On NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d the same day, Warner mentioned \u201cthe ongoing negotiations about Trump Tower [Moscow], well into the campaign,\u201d \u201cthe dump of the WikiLeaks material,\u201d \u201cthe president\u2019s campaign manager sharing information, polling information, with the Russians,\u201d and a meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nEllis, who presided over one of Manafort\u2019s trials and sentenced him last week, was describing the facts of that case. The judge said Manafort \u201cis not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election,\u201d CNN reported. Ellis later restated this: Manafort \u201cis not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018colluding,\u2019\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWas there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President Putin? Yes, but I\u2019m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. I was not part of the campaign. I don\u2019t know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals. There is just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not accurate to say these comments \u201cproved no Collusion,\u201d as Trump tweeted. Cohen said he had \u201csuspicions\u201d and noted that he wasn\u2019t part of the campaign and wouldn\u2019t know of some conversations Trump had with others. Cohen said the \u201cback-and-forth praise\u201d between Trump and Putin seemed odd and suggestively threw in that there were \u201cjust so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
