The World Health Organization (WHO) and experts say evidence indicates the coronavirus originated in animals and was not engineered in a lab.\n\nThe internet has become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus since it first emerged in China in late 2019. In this case, the Facebook post credits O\u2019Reilly with writing an essay that claims the virus is a biological weapon created by the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cKnowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox,\u201d O\u2019Reilly allegedly wrote. \u201cIn my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone but kills \u2018enough,\u2019 especially the elderly and in-firmed.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence O\u2019Reilly authored the essay. It appears nowhere on his website or his social media accounts. An internet search also turned up no credible sources attributing the essay to him.\n\nA spokesperson for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s website confirmed to Snopes that O\u2019Reilly \u201cdid not write a single word of the essay in question,\u201d adding that the political commentator \u201cdoes not traffic in conspiracy theories.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Image Show Blankets Infected With Coronavirus Being Shipped From China To Africa?)\n\nThe essay, debunked by Snopes in April, appears to have originated with Facebook user Tim Besmer, who posted it with a copyright notice and the words \u201cPermission given for public sharing.\u201d The fact-checking website Lead Stories rated his post false.\n\nThe exact origin of the new coronavirus remains unknown, but experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post, \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered.\u201d\n\nThe WHO has also said the available evidence indicates the coronavirus originated in animals and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory, according to USA Today.", "lang": "en"}
