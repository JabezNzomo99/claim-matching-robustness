As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers.\n\nThis article was just another fabrication from TMZ Hip Hop, a fake news site that is not affiliated with the celebrity gossip web site TMZ. TMZ Hip Hop does not carry a disclaimer identifying their content as fictional in nature, but a quick survey of their previously published articles reveals that they deal almost exclusively in fake stories. In addition to the above-quoted article, TMZ Hip Hop has also published fabricated stories reporting that Jordan had purchased the Chicago Bulls basketball team (he hadn\u2019t), that he had released a Black Lives Matter shoe (he didn\u2019t), and that he was dead (he in\u2019t).\n\nWhile Jordan didn\u2019t say that he would stop selling sneakers until all black people unite, the NBA legend did release a statement on 25 July 2016 about gun-related violence by and towards police. Jordan also donated $1 million to the Internal Association of Chiefs of Police\u2019s Institute for Community-Police Relations and another $1 million to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.", "lang": "en"}
