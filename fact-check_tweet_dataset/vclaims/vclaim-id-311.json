This is untrue.\n\nThe post makes the further claim that Biden\u2019s remarks put the lives of SEAL Team Six at risk of retaliation by \u201cthe Taliban\u201d, \u201cjihadists\u201d and \u201cal Qaeda sympathizers\u201d and implies he is responsible for the attack against U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in August, 2011 that killed 31 personnel, including 25 Navy SEALs. Examples of the post can be seen here , here .\n\nThere is no evidence to corroborate that Biden publicly revealed the names of SEAL Team Six members or of their families.\n\nOn the late evening of May 1, 2011, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), then President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. had killed Osama bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan ( here ). In his remarks, Obama noted that the attack, which occurred in the early hours of May 2, Pakistan Standard Time, had been carried out by \u201c[a] small team of Americans\u201d who worked \u201cwith extraordinary courage and capability.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported in an article carrying a May 1 date stamp that the operation had been executed by \u201cmembers of the Navy Seals and C.I.A. operatives\u201d after approval from the President ( here ).\n\nThe following day, the Washington Post identified the operatives who had carried out the mission as an \u201celite team of Navy SEALs\u201d known as \u201cTeam 6\u201d ( here ).\n\nOn May 3, Vice President Joe Biden provided the Distinguished International Leadership keynote address at the Atlantic Council Awards Dinner. This is presumably the \u201cnational event\u201d the posts on social media refer to at which Biden supposedly revealed the identities of the SEAL Team Six members.\n\nDuring his remarks, Biden praised the operation against bin Laden and one of the dinner\u2019s honorees, James Stavridis, at the time a United States Navy Admiral.\n\n\u201cHe could tell you more about and understands the incredible, phenomenal, just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last Sunday,\u201d Biden said referring to the attack against bin Laden ( here ).\n\nLater that evening, Biden said that he was in: \u201cabsolute awe [\u2026] of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs, it just was extraordinary.\u201d Biden also noted that despite the briefings with members of Congress that occurred prior to the operation, not a \u201csingle, solitary thing leaked\u201d. ( here )\n\nDuring his address, however, Biden did not provide further details about the identities of the team\u2019s members.\n\nOn May 5, Reuters reported that al Qaeda had vowed revenge against the West for bin Laden\u2019s killing ( here ).\n\nOn May 12, then Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed concern about the safety of the members who participated in the raid and their families. At a town hall meeting in Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps base in North Carolina, Gates said: \u201cThere is an awareness that the threat of retaliation is increased because of the action against bin Laden.\u201d ( here ).\n\nAccording to the Christian Science Monitor, when Gates met with SEAL Team Six he said, \u201cteam members expressed concern for their continued anonymity and their safety, \u2018particularly with respect to their families.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the time Gates also expressed frustration with information leaks: \u201cFrankly, a week ago Sunday, in the Situation Room, we all agreed that we would not release any operational details from the effort to take out bin Laden,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat all fell apart on Monday \u2014 the next day.\u201d ( here ).\n\nHis remarks made clear that the spread of information about the raid made future operations more difficult: \u201cMy concern is that there were too many people in too many places talking too much about this operation. And we [had] reached agreement that we would not talk about the operational details,\u201d he told reporters at a Pentagon briefing, according to Politico. \u201cI am very concerned about this, because we want to retain the capability to carry out these kinds of operations in the future.\u201d ( here )\n\nOn August 6, 2011, Taliban fighters shot down a helicopter transporting U.S. military personnel on a mission to capture or kill a senior Taliban leader ( here ). Among the crew onboard were members of SEAL Team Six, according to Newsweek ( here ). The attack became known as Extortion 17, after the helicopter\u2019s call sign.\n\nThe parents of Aaron C. Vaughn, a Navy SEAL killed in the incident, publicly criticized the Obama administration\u2019s handling of information related to the bin Laden operation, and filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Biden and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta along with the parents of three other servicemen also killed in the attack ( here ).\n\nThe complaint alleged that Biden and Panetta prompted the August attack by revealing the SEAL team\u2019s role in the raid against bin Laden, according to a local media outlet. Vaughn was not part of the operation that killed bin Laden, but belonged to the same military unit.\n\nIn 2014, Garry Reid, then a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, provided a statement to Congress on Extortion 17 and stated: \u201cWe do not believe Extortion 17 was the victim of a pre-planned enemy ambush, nor do we believe the enemy had advance knowledge of our flight route and landing zone location.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe lawsuit against Biden and Panetta was dismissed without prejudice by Judge James E. Boasberg in December 2013 ( here ).\n\nIn August 2012, Reuters reported that the real name of one member of the SEAL Team Six who participated in the raid against bin Laden had been revealed. Matt Bissonnette\u2019s name came to light shortly after news broke that he would publish a first-hand account of the daring operation in Pakistan in 2011 ( here ).\n\nA second member\u2019s identity was revealed in 2014. Former Navy SEAL Robert O\u2019Neill publicly spoke about shooting bin Laden in an exclusive interview with Fox News ( here , here ).\n\nOn May 1, 2011 Obama reported that the U.S. had killed bin Laden. In the following days, the press reported that the team behind the raid that killed bin Laden consisted of Navy SEALS operating in secrecy.\n\nOn May 3, 2011 Biden publicly praised the SEAL team that executed the mission against bin Laden, but did not reveal the identities of its members.\n\nThree months later, a Taliban fighter shot down a military helicopter, killing 31 personnel, including Navy SEAL Team Six members. There is no evidence linking information leaks related to the May 1 operation and the ambush by the Taliban against U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nTwo of the SEAL Team Six members\u2019 identities have come to light since the 2011 raid in Abbottabad, while the others\u2019 remain secret ( here ).\n\nFalse. There is no evidence supporting the claim that Vice President Joe Biden revealed the identities of Navy SEAL Team 6 members, nor that this leak resulted in retaliation against U.S. forces on August 6, 2011 in Afghanistan.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
