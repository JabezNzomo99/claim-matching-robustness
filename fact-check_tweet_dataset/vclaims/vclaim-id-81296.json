But then a day after the article appeared, Walsh\u2019s campaign issued a combative statement that dismissed that explanation and twice referred to his \u201cunintentional mistake.\u201d A comment from campaign spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said \u201che\u2019s not a classroom academic\u2014the Senate already has plenty of those.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, the statement focuses entirely on the idea that the paper\u2019s citations were not done correctly \u2014 what it suggests is a single \u201cmistake.\u201d But this is not a simply a matter of not using the \u201cElements of Style\u201d properly.\n\nWhole sections of the paper are lifted verbatim or near-verbatim from other published works, but without any quotation marks. Thus, academic research might have been cited in the endnotes, but there were not quotation marks around the words that were borrowed. (In other instances, Walsh uses the language from a paper but does not even bother to include attribution.)\n\nBut most disturbingly, the paper\u2019s recommendations are lifted word for word from a 2002 paper titled \u201cDemocratic Mirage in the Middle East,\u201d which was written by four scholars at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In this case, there is no attribution offered at all, although this work is cited in other parts of Walsh\u2019s report.\n\nWalsh\u2019s paper was submitted in order to get a master\u2019s degree, but just about every high school student is taught that the conclusions of a research paper are supposed to reflect your own ideas. So this is not a matter of simply failing to include a footnote \u2014 in fact, conclusions are generally not supposed to have footnotes \u2014 but about theft of intellectual property. It\u2019s about plagiarism.\n\nOn top of that, the campaign statement scolds the media for incorrectly referring to the paper as a \u201cthesis,\u201d as if that is even an important issue. Instead of acknowledging the plagiarism, the statement suggests Walsh\u2019s military career somehow trumps academic errors.\n\nThe Web site Plagiarism.org offers useful descriptions of types of plagiarism, which it describes as \u201can act of fraud\u201d that \u201cinvolves both stealing someone else\u2019s work and lying about it afterward.\u201d Two key examples of plagiarism are demonstrated repeatedly through Walsh\u2019s paper: \u201ccopying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\u201d and \u201cfailing to put a quotation in quotation marks.\u201d\n\nBy claiming this was merely a case of incorrect citations, Walsh\u2019s campaign seeks to minimize the extent of his academic transgressions. But it is clear he engaged in blatant and extensive plagiarism, in apparent violation of the academic code of the War College.\n\nWalsh told the Times he would \u201cconsider\u201d apologizing to the authors whose work he stole, but this news release suggests he and his campaign have not yet come to grips with the extent of the problem. This simply cannot be shrugged off as a simple \u201cmistake.\u201d (We obviously cannot determine whether it was an \u201cunintentional mistake,\u201d as the statement claims, but on the face of the evidence that one quarter of the report was plagiarized, that seems like a stretch.)\n\nPresumably a lawyer or two advised the campaign that a clear admission of plagiarism would open the senator up to liability or military discipline. But that\u2019s no excuse, especially given the fact that the paper\u2019s conclusions were stolen from other authors.", "lang": "en"}
