We have decided not to include the actual video.\n\nThe clip is also being shared widely on Twitter with netizens from India demanding that the woman be identified and arrested.\n\nThe video of nearly three minutes shows the woman first stamping on each leg of the child and then proceeding to stamp her face, chest, pelvic region and also sit on the child's face. One can hear music playing in the background and the child crying in pain. The woman's face cannot be seen. But a prominent tattoo can be spotted on her ankle.\n\nA reverse image search for one of the keyframes of the video led us to news reports which said the video was first viral in social media groups in Texas, United States of America.\n\nCorpus Christi Police Department in Texas started investigating the video after it was notified by local residents, according to a news article by The Mirror.\n\nWe also found a Facebook post dated November 8, 2019 by the official account of the Corpus Christi Police Department asking people to come forward and report any information about the video.\n\nWhile the video uploaded by the Corpus Christi Police Department has the same woman and child, it shows a slightly different sequence of events with the woman crushing the child by sitting on her.\n\nThe police also uploaded a photo of a tattoo visible on the woman's ankle as an identification mark.\n\nRead the post by the Corpus Christi police here. NOTE: The Facebook post contains the video, discretion is advised.\n\nA few days later, on November 11, the Corpus Christi Police Department put out another statement saying that the video is likely from Mexico.\n\n\"At this time all indications are that the incident did not occur in our jurisdiction and that it occurred in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. We have also received information that this incident may have happened over a year ago. We are working to identify the specific location of occurrence in Mexico so that the Child Protective Services equivalent in Mexico can be notified, and an investigation can be performed.\" - Corpus Christi Police Department said in a statement.\n\nCorpus Christi Police Department did not immediately respond to voice messages and an email from BOOM.\n\nBOOM also looked for news articles in Spanish and found several news reports about the video.\n\nA Spanish news outlet Agencia El Universal also reported the story on November 11, and said, \"The General Directorate of Investigations and the Civil Force Cyber \u200b\u200bPolice of the Secretariat of Public Security of the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, initiated an investigation into facts that involve mistreatment of a minor, disclosed through a video that has become viral on social networks and that has caused outrage among users. Likewise, he gave part of the case and its inquiries to the State Attorney General's Office.\"\n\nSeveral other local newspapers carried the story citing that the Corpus Christi Police Department had informed the local Nuevo Le\u00f3n police about the video. Read here and here.\n\nThe video has sparked outrage among social media users in Mexico.\n\nA few Spanish websites claim the cyber police in Nuevo Le\u00f3n have identified the woman. However, BOOM could not independently verify the same.\n\nGiven that the video was first viral in Texas and Corpus Christi police stated it could be from Mexico, it is unlikely that the video is from India or involves individuals from the North East part of the country.", "lang": "en"}
