The review was updated on 2 March, but broadly contains the same information.\n\nWithin the summary, the authors refer to some findings produced by the China/World Health Organisation (WHO) joint commission: \u201cNotably the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult\u201d.\n\nNews outlets reported this finding, out of context, as the overall result of the review.\n\nWhilst the review did not document any specific cases where a child to adult transmission occurred, it described several studies that offer contradictory evidence on the potential for transmission.\n\nThe review did not conclude that adults cannot catch the virus from children. It stated (at the time that the news articles were written) that \u201cthe role of children in passing the disease to others is unknown, in particular given large numbers of asymptomatic cases\u201d.\n\nDr Alasdair Munro, one of the authors of the review, told us that \u201cthe quote is taken from the China/WHO joint commission and ignores all the other subsequent evidence which is completely consistent with child to adult transmission, albeit seemingly less than adult to adult transmission.\u201d\n\nThe Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health have issued a statement to stress that the news reports \u201chave incorrectly suggested that children cannot transmit COVID-19. This is not the RCPCH position, nor is it based on evidence.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
