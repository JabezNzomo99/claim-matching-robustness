Steve Bullock \u201csteered 14.3 million Montana dollars to his brother\u2019s company.\u201d\n\nWilliam Bullock sold his shares in Pioneer Technical Services four years before his brother became governor in 2013, the company\u2019s CEO told us.\n\nAlso, a spokesperson for Montana\u2019s Department of Administration told FactCheck.org that the governor had \u201cno involvement\u201d in state contracts awarded to the Butte-based firm. The company\u2019s CEO said it has consistently been selected for state work in Montana, dating back long before Steve Bullock became governor. Those contracts with the state go back to 1992, he said, a year after the company was co-founded by William Bullock.\n\nSince Aug. 1, though, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has spent thousands of dollars running six-second ads on Facebook that give a different impression.\n\n\u201cBullock steered 14.3 million Montana dollars to his brother\u2019s company. Shady Steve Bullock. Wrong for the U.S. Senate,\u201d the ads say. Bullock, a Democrat, is running to unseat Republican incumbent Steve Daines in one of this year\u2019s closest Senate races.\n\nAccording to ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics, the NRSC spent almost $500,000 to run a TV ad that made a similar claim about Bullock. That ad, which aired in Montana TV markets over 1,900 times from Aug. 14 to Aug. 22, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind that Steve Bullock smile? An ambitious governor who exploits Montana taxpayers. Like the $14 million in state contracts paid to his brother\u2019s company.\u201d\n\nThe ads cite data from the state\u2019s online checkbook portal for fiscal years 2013 to 2019.\n\nPioneer Technical Services \u2014 an engineering and environmental services firm \u2014 has been paid more than $14 million by the state since 2013, according to data provided to us by the state. But the NRSC\u2019s evidence that the contracts financially benefited William Bullock is thin, and disputed by the company.\n\nIn late July, Brad Archibald, the CEO of Pioneer Technical Services, and Karl Englund, a lawyer for the firm, asked Montana TV stations to stop broadcasting other NRSC ads that referred to state money that went to the company.\n\n\u201cTo imply any sort of nepotism at play is not only offensive but downright false,\u201d Archibald wrote in his July 24 letter to station managers. In a follow-up letter three days later, Englund said: \u201cThe contracts [Pioneer] has to perform work for Montana were awarded through the normal state competitive process because of Pioneer\u2019s track record of excellent work and its sterling reputation.\u201d\n\nBoth Archibald and Englund said William Bullock resigned as CEO of Pioneer in 2004 and sold all of his shares in 2009.\n\nIn response, the NRSC has pointed to a 2015 corporate filing in Alaska that indicated Bullock still owned 0.5% of the company. Archibald, however, told us that was a mistake.\n\n\u201cPaperwork has been submitted to the State of Alaska to correct an error in previous filings with respect to William Bullock,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cHe is not a shareholder or a vice-president of Pioneer Technical Services. I cannot tell you why he was incorrectly listed that way, but it appears to be an error that first occurred after he sold his shares in 2009 and has been perpetuated since.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Archibald told us that Bullock is not an employee of the firm, which has been 100% employee-owned since 2009, but has remained a member of its board of directors and became the board\u2019s chairman in 2017. He said that in 2018 the company began paying board members $1,500 per board meeting to cover time and expenses. Those meetings are held about four times a year, and that\u2019s the only compensation Bullock receives, he said.\n\nArchibald also argued that Pioneer has consistently been selected for state work in Montana since 1992, a year after the company was founded. The company has done environmental cleanup work and engineering work on construction projects for the state, for example.\n\nThe Department of Administration was able to provide us with data on state payments to Pioneer going back to fiscal year 2007. The data show the company was paid more than $29 million by the state from Aug. 4, 2006, through Aug. 13, 2020. More than $7 million of that was paid before Steve Bullock was sworn in on Jan. 7, 2013.\n\nHe had no say in awarding state contracts the company received, officials told us.\n\n\u201cThe Governor has no involvement in the procurement or contracting process for the State of Montana,\u201d Amber Conger, communications director for the Department of Administration, told us in an email. \u201cThat authority is granted by statute to the Department of Administration. There are no circumstances where the Governor has or would have any involvement.\u201d\n\nConger explained that state laws and rules require contracts of certain amounts to be competitively bid, and prohibit state departments from being partial or showing favoritism in granting awards or contracts.\n\nThe NRSC argued that Steve Bullock technically has authority because Montana\u2019s Constitution states that \u201cthe governor has full powers of supervision, approval, direction, and appointment\u201d over state agencies, including those that contracted with Pioneer Technical Services. An NRSC press release about one of its TV ads also said that a post on the website of the Montana Department of Justice that says \u201cthe Governor makes all final decisions on all restoration plans and associated funding.\u201d\n\nWhile the press secretary for the governor\u2019s office, Erin Loranger, acknowledged that the governor does approve restoration plans, she told us that is done before state contracts are offered or awarded.\n\n\u201cGovernors in Montana are required to sign off on restoration plans developed through settlement monies to restore natural resources acting as the trustee under federal and state superfund laws. The governor\u2019s formal approval of a restoration plan occurs well before any competitive bidding or state contract process begins,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nBullock campaign spokesman Sean Manning also pushed back on the NRSC\u2019s allegation, noting that William Bullock had resigned and sold his shares in the company years before Steve Bullock became governor. \u201cIt is absolutely false that the Governor \u2018steered\u2019 contracts to this Montana business \u2014 all contracts are issued in compliance with state procurement laws,\u201d Manning said.\n\nIn short, the NRSC has provided no actual proof that Pioneer received state business because Steve and William Bullock are brothers, or that Steve Bullock directed over $14 million in state money to the company after he became governor.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
