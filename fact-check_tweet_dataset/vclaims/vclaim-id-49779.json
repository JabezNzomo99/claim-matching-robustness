Vaccines that the govt forced them to take did and they are repeating the same pattern now.\u201d It ends with the claim, \u201c50 million dead from 1918 flu vaccine\u201d.\n\nThe July 12 post has attracted more than 17,000 views and more than 300 shares.\n\nThe Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 was the most severe pandemic in recent history, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With \u201cgenes of avian origin\u201d, the virus infected an estimated 500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population and killed around 50 million people.\n\nMortality from the pandemic was high in children under five and people aged between 20-40 and 65 and older. Efforts to control the spread were limited to isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings.\n\nIn 1918, Smallpox, Rabies, Typhoid, Cholera and Plague were the only vaccine-preventable diseases, according to a CDC report (see table 1). Influenza was first established as being caused by a virus in the 1930s and the first flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s in the US.\n\nDr Peter Hubbins, a medical historian and expert on the history of the Spanish Flu in Australia, said there were several vaccines created in Australia and overseas to protect against the Spanish Flu using bacteria drawn from the lungs of people infected.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with all 1918-19 vaccines is that they were developed against bacteria. Therefore the vaccines were technically created against the \u2018wrong\u2019 organism and theoretically had no protective value,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck in an email.\n\nDr Hubbins said many victims also suffered from secondary bacterial infections and it was possible bacterial-based vaccines potentially reduced the severity and mortality of the Spanish Flu among those who were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cVaccines in those days were rather crude and people may have felt unwell after receiving them, but it is completely wrong to suggest that there would have been 50 million deaths worldwide due to their use,\u201d he said.\n\nVariations of the post have been in circulation since at least 2009 and have previously been debunked here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. There is no evidence to support the claim a flu vaccine killed 50 million people during the 1918 Spanish Flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first influenza vaccine was developed in the 1940s. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate.
