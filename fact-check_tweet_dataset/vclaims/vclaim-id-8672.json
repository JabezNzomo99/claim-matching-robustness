This picture was also shared on Twitter.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nSeveral reports with the similar image came up on the search results. Among them was an article by Aaj Tak.\n\nThe report published by Aaj Tak on September 23 revealed the original image where the women can be seen holding placards that say \u2013 \u201c\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0928 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f \u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u093e\u201d(Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana).\n\nThe image pertained to the inauguration of \u2018Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana \u2013 Ayushman Bharat\u2019 by PM Modi in Ranchi, Jharkhand on September 23. According to Aaj Tak\u2019s report, \u201cThe economic groups of people who will be included in this initiative are the poor, deprived rural families and city labourers. According to the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), there are at least 8.03 crore such families in villages and 2.33 crore such families in cities. About 50 crore people will be benefitted from this program.\u201d\n\nWe have observed several times in the past that morphed images are circulated with altered narratives. It is a common practice to manipulate pictures that include posters or boards. For instance, a photoshopped image of a madrasa teacher preaching to his students that Islam was superior to Hinduism was viral in June this year. Another morphed image was circulated to portray Muslims demanding the release of the Mandsaur rape accused. It is pertinent that viral images on social media are verified before further sharing them online.", "lang": "en"}
