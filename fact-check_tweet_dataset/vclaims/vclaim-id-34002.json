Footage of police brutality on students of the varsities have been flooding the internet. The crackdown on the universities have triggered protests across educational institutes.\n\nBOOM found that the video is five years old and is not linked to the recent CAA protests happening across the country. We broke the video into its key frames and performed a reverse image search on its frames. We were directed to the same video that was uploaded in a news report by Dailymail in January, 2014. The article was titled, 'Beaten and robbed of his wallet by the police: Brutality caught on camera as man is forced to grip railings as he is whipped'. According to the news report, the video documents police brutality on a pickpocket, who was caught red handed. The article also reports that three of the policemen involved in the brutal act were later identified by the department and suspended.\n\nThe description in the video says the incident took place on January 12, 2014, when the Delhi police had brutally hurt the man and extorted money from him. According to a report in Times of India the original video was 20 minutes long, shot by one Kapil Kumar. Read the article here Also read Assam Police Beating Up People Not Included In The NRC?
