But this is false; the images show roads in other countries and stock photos.\n\nThis Facebook post published on April 12, 2020, includes several photos of roads under construction, accompanied by the claim that they show a new road linking South Sudan\u2019s capital Juba with the northwestern region of Bahr El Ghazal.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cCongratulations to our able government of South Sudan. Soon or later, we will witness the fruits of our struggle. The road from Juba to Bahr el Ghazal is on progress (sic)\u201d.\n\nThe same photos have been shared here, here and here with the same claim.\n\nA second Facebook post featuring the same claim, but with different photos of roads, was published here on December 10, 2019.\n\nThe Arabic caption translates in English to: \u201cJuba-Bahr El Ghazal road. Thanks to his excellency president Salva Kiir for the achievements. We wish you continued progress.\u201d\n\nIn February 2019, the government of South Sudan announced its \u201cOil for infrastructure project\u201d, in which it would pay 10,000 barrels of crude oil per day - later upped to 30,000 barrels - to the Export Bank of China in exchange for the construction of roads linking Juba to Rumbek in the Greater Bahr El Ghazal area, and to the Nadapal belt on the Kenyan border, over the course of an estimated 36 months. Construction is currently underway.\n\nImages of roads in other countries\n\nHowever, reverse image searches show that none of the photos in the two Facebook posts are of the Juba-Bahr El Ghazal road in South Sudan, as claimed.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first post, which has three images.\n\nThe first picture first appeared here in an article on the NigerDel Star news site on June 26, 2017, long before the South Sudanese roads project was announced. According to the article, the photo shows the Niger Delta East-West road in Nigeria.\n\nThe second photo first appeared in an article on the Nigerian news site Premium Times on January 14, 2018 -- more than a year before the South Sudanese roads project was announced. The photo caption reads: \u201cPersonnel of Mothercat Nigeria Limited at work during the Hon. Minister's inspection tour of the ongoing construction work on the Potiskum Bypass which is part of the Dualisation of Kano-Maiduguri Road Section III in Yobe State on Saturday 18, March 2017\u201d.\n\nThe road in question is located in north-eastern Nigeria.\n\nThe third photo appeared in an article published on the Iranian economic news site Financial Tribune on April 18, 2017 -- again, long before the South Sudanese roads project was announced. The photo caption reads: \u201cIranian Bitumen Producer Targets Indian, UAE Markets.\u201d\n\nThis image has also been used as a stock photo on multiple websites, including news sites and engineering and construction company websites.\n\nThe fourth photo was published here on DepositPhotos, a stock photo platform, on November 9, 2015 \u2014 more than three years before the Juba-Bahr El Ghazal road project was announced.\n\nThe second Facebook post includes two photos.\n\nThe first one appeared in this article on the Ugandan news site New Vision on March 15, 2019 -- a month before construction started on the Juba-Bahr El Ghazal road project. According to the article, the image shows the Kampala-Entebbe expressway that connects Uganda\u2019s capital to the Entebbe international airport.\n\nThe second photo was published on the Ugandan website ChimpReports here on November 27, 2017 -- once again, long before the South Sudanese roads project was even announced. According to the article, this photo, like the previous one, shows the Kampala-Entebbe expressway.", "lang": "en"}
