They drove by children getting out of school and offered them chocolates. Kubassi is from Qatar and had brought some chocolates with him on his visit to India.\n\n\u201cThese types of videos and images were being circulated to create panic,\u201d Rajeshwari said. \u201cThere was this state of mass hysteria in many parts, because these villages saw these videos and really believed that yes, there is a gang out there that is going to take their children.\u201d\n\nWe visited this village in Karnataka to find people who witnessed the events that took place that day. According to eyewitness accounts, adults working in the fields saw the visitors handing chocolates to the children and believed they were kidnappers. The villagers approached the visitors and started deflating the tires of their car. Quickly realizing they were in danger, three of the men, Kubassi, Salman and Azam, escaped in the car, leaving Afroz and Mohammad behind.\n\nBefore the men escaped, villagers sent video of the friends and their car to a WhatsApp group in the neighboring village of Murki. The videos identified the men as child kidnappers and warned the people in Murki that they were on the run.\n\nIn 2018, one viral video claimed to show a child being kidnapped by a motorcyclist. But the video had been deceptively edited and was missing key context. It excluded information that the video was produced as a child safety campaign by Roshni Helpline, a group in Pakistan.\n\nPratik Sinha, the editor of Alt News, a fact-checking outlet in India, blames a lack of media literacy and government inaction for the uncontained spread of fake news. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge section of population which is getting access to mobile and Internet services for the first time in their lives, and they do not have the capacity to figure out what is authentic and what is not,\u201d Sinha said.\n\nThe closed nature of WhatsApp means most people are using it to communicate with friends and family, people who are considered trustworthy. The ability to forward to large groups of people also increases the chances for false information to be misinterpreted as fact.\n\n\u201cDisinformation can readily find a home and exacerbate a lot of those long-standing problems that societies are currently grappling with,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cMisinformation on these platforms is a critical threat in that sense, because it's serving to further incite violence or hate and further inflame the preexisting divisions.\u201d\n\nAfter the spike in rumors and violence in 2018, WhatsApp took action. The app labels when a message has been forwarded and limits forwarding to five group chats. According to WhatsApp, that move reduced forwarded messages in India by more than 25 percent. The platform also worked with local expert groups to create digital literacy training to teach users how to spot fake news.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp cares deeply about the safety of our users in India and around the world. WhatsApp has made significant product changes and worked with partners across civil society, engaged with relevant government authorities and other technology platforms to help address the harmful consequences of misinformation. While there is no single action that can resolve the complex challenges contributing to misinformation, we are committed to helping do our part to ensure that WhatsApp continues to be a force for good in India,\u201d a WhatsApp representative wrote as an official response.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at these rumors on social media, we know that they are not dying down,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cThey keep circulating. It is not the speed at which the rumor is traveling, it is the sustained nature of it, which is a bigger problem.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
