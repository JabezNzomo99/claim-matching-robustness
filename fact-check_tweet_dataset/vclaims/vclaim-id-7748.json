Many people shared this video, mistaking the officer to be Major Prafulla. This video was also posted by AAP MLA Alka Lamba on her Twitter timeline. This video was also shared by Telangana Today and Siasat Daily websites.\n\nIs the video really that of Major Prafulla? It cannot be because this video has been around on YouTube for over seven years. In January 2017, CRPF posted this video on their verified Twitter account and identified the soldier as Assistant Commandant Satwant Singh.\n\nSome time back, when two Indian army soldiers were beheaded by the Pakistani army, a video of a Brazilian bank robber\u2019s beheading was made viral, claiming that it is the Indian soldiers being beheaded. Such fake videos are often made viral after tragic events. Kindly, be careful and do not fall for such videos. We don\u2019t need fake videos to be proud of the heroics of our armed forces.\n\nThis article has been published in an arrangement with the ALT News.", "lang": "en"}
