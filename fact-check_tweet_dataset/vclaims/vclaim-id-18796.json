It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on August 6, 2019 titled \"New Jersey brother and sister allowed to marry after 10-year-long court battle\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA New Jersey brother and sister have won the right to marry after a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nIn a 5-to-4 ruling, five judges unanimously granted the appeal by James Banes, 41, and Victoria Banes, 38, today after a ten-year-long battle.
