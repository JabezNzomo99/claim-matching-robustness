In October 2014, that one comment crossed over and began appearing on high-profile blogs, prompting interest in its veracity.\n\nThe original story was indeed compelling. The 911 dispatcher who posted it (Reddit user Crux1836) related a tale of a domestic violence victim\u2019s subverting her attacker by pretending to order a pizza after calling emergency services:\n\nI had a call that started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious: \u201c911, where is you emergency?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to order a pizza for delivery.\u201d (oh great, another prank call). \u201cYeah, I know. Can I have a large with half pepperoni, half mushroom and peppers?\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, you know you\u2019ve called 911 right?\u201d \u201cYeah, do you know how long it will be?\u201d \u201cOk, Ma\u2019am, is everything ok over there? do you have an emergency?\u201d \u201c\u2026 And you can\u2019t talk about it because there\u2019s someone in the room with you?\u201d (moment of realization) \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. Do you know how long it will be?\u201d \u201cI have an officer about a mile from your location. Are there any weapons in your house?\u201d \u201cCan you stay on the phone with me?\u201d \u201cNope. See you soon, thanks\u201d As we dispatch the call, I check the history at the address, and see there are multiple previous domestic violence calls. The officer arrives and finds a couple, female was kind of banged up, and boyfriend was drunk. Officer arrests him after she explains that the boyfriend had been beating her for a while. I thought she was pretty clever to use that trick. Definitely one of the most memorable calls.\n\nIt\u2019s not precisely clear why or how that user\u2019s story crossed into news reports five months after it was posted. In the same discussion thread, the man who posted it came back to acknowledge he\u2019d seen his comment published on news sites but didn\u2019t know why it was picked up as new.\n\nBuzzFeed profiled the story in a 29 October 2014 article and interviewed an individual claiming to be the original poster. The man, Keith Weisinger, provided additional details about the 911 pizza call and said he had no information about the woman\u2019s fate following the incident:\n\n\u201cThis call occurred almost 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked the graveyard shift, 6pm-6am, and I remember this call being pretty late \u2014 close to midnight.\u201d\n\nWeisinger said the woman \u2014 who he believed was in her 30s \u2014 was calm at first, but gave short, hurried responses. \u201cI remember feeling relieved we had an officer close by who could respond quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nWeisinger said he never found out what happened to the woman after she called:\n\nWhile Weisinger hasn\u2019t been widely acknowledged in circulated accounts of the 911 pizza call, he was awarded \u201cReddit gold\u201d by fellow site users for his contribution to the thread. It\u2019s very likely Weisinger is the individual responsible for sharing the tale on Reddit, but it\u2019s difficult to verify whether or not the incident in question occurred as relayed by him without additional detail.\n\nOthers have expressed skepticism about the veracity of his story, however, noting that the very same scenario was used in a public service announcement for the Norwegian Women\u2019s Shelter Association back in 2010:\n\nWoman: Yes, hi. This is Monica Andresen. I would like to order a pizza for 74 Church Street. Police: (interrupts) This is the police emergency line. Police: This is the emergency line for the pol \u2026 Woman: Yes, that\u2019s right. The address is 74 Church Street. We would like to order a large pizza no. 11, with ham and mushrooms. Woman: Yeah. And it would be really great if could get here as quickly as possible. Police: Yeah. Yes, I understand. We\u2019ll be right there. Voice-over: More than a quarter of Norwegian women are exposed to violence from their partners. Get help before it\u2019s too late. Read more at WomenShelter.no.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, another public service announcement inspired by the story was published to YouTube with the following description:\n\nIn December 2017, we came across a new version of the pizza/911 story:\n\nIF YOU NEED TO CALL 999 BUT ARE SCARED TO BECAUSE OF SOMEONE IN THE ROOM, dial and ask for a pepperoni pizza. They will ask if you know you\u2019re calling 999. Say yes, and continue pretending you\u2019re making an order. They\u2019ll ask if there\u2019s someone in the room. You can ask how long it will take for the pizza to get to you, and they will tell you how far away a patrol unit is. Share this to save a life!!! Dispatchers are trained to ask specific yes or no questions..dont hang up!\n\nThe source of this message was unclear, but its use of \u201c999\u201d instead of \u201c911\u201d suggested that the forward originated outside the United States. What began as a story of ingenuity in the face of danger evolved into a purported code by which anyone caught in a dangerous situation was able to summon help safely, and the \u201cshare to save a life\u201d suggestion incited users to spread the dubious directive on social media.\n\nLike other bits of lore promising a clever way out of an otherwise potentially hopeless situation, the \u201cpepperoni pizza\u201d advice is problematic. It makes a sweeping claim that \u201cdispatchers are trained\u201d to understand the purported code in the message, an assertion quite likely based solely on inferences drawn from the original story.\n\nWe have not been able to determine whether dispatchers are aware of the original legend or trained to recognize cloaked pleas as something other than a prank call, so we cannot at this time endorse it as a course of action if any other options for calling for help are available to you. However, we hesitate to endorse doing nothing if you are in immediate danger.", "lang": "en"}
