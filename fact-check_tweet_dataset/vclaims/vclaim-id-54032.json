In these photos, it can be seen that the boy is holding the baby deer with one hand on his head. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: A Bangladeshi boy named Belal, rescued a baby deer from drowning into the river during the floods in Noakali district of South Eastern Bangladesh. These photos were shot during that incident. The boy in these photos does not belong to the Assam state of India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the photos shared in the post, similar photos were found in an article published by \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 news website on \u201806 Feb 2014\u2019. In the article, they mentioned that a brave boy called Belal, fearlessly risked his own life to save the helpless baby deer from drowning into the river. This incident took place in Noakhali district of South Eastern Bangladesh. It is also mentioned in the article that wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab shot these photos while visiting on a photo trip during Noakhali floods. On reverse search of a different image, another article published by \u2018The Huffington Post\u2019 was found explaining the incident with similar context.\n\nOn searching with relevant keywords, it is found that few more images of the incident are shared on posts published on a Bangladeshi blog and a Facebook page.\n\nTo sum it up, old photos of a Bangladeshi boy rescuing a baby deer are falsely portrayed as the young Bahubali of Assam.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
