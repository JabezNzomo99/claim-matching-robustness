The logo on the side of the plane is that of Cameroonian airline Camair-Co. However, the picture has been photoshopped and was in fact taken in Congo-Brazzaville, a country Camair-Co doesn\u2019t fly to.\n\nPosts featuring the image have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook -- we\u2019ve archived some of them here, here and here.\n\nThe image shows a man in a suit boarding a plane using a wooden stepladder. The Camair-Co logo is clearly visible on the side of the aircraft.\n\n\u201cOnly in Africa,\u201d said one post in Ghana-based Facebook page \u2018Celebritiesbuzz.co News\u2019, which has more than one million followers.\n\nAnother Facebook user shared the photo alongside the caption, \u201cMORE CARPENTERS NEEDED AT CAMAIRCO,\u201d claiming the airline was \u201cin dire need\u201d of workers following the production of a \u201cladder of death\u201d at Yaound\u00e9-Nsimalen International Airport in Cameroon\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Cameroon,\u201d says another post by French comedian Dieudonn\u00e9, which has been shared more than 350 times.\n\nSocial media users in Kenya shared a different version of the photograph, this time featuring a Kenya Airlines logo on the side of the plane.\n\n\u201cEven if there are problems, what is this?!\u201d tweeted one user in Swahili.\n\nHowever, both Camair-Co and Kenya Airlines denied the plane was one of theirs.\n\n\u201cIt is not a Camair-Co plane,\u201d a representative from Camair-Co told AFP via telephone. \u201cThe registration of the plane in the photograph doesn\u2019t match our airline\u2019s IATA code. The position of the logo on the photo does not correspond to our graphic charter\u201d.\n\nAn IATA code is attributed to each airline by the International Air Transport Association. According to its website, the code for Camair-Co is QC.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, AJY doesn\u2019t seem to belong to any carrier we currently have registered,\u201d an International Air Transport Association representative told AFP via email.\n\nHe added that the logo on the plane in the photograph was smaller than the logos on Camair-Co\u2019s aircraft.\n\nKenya Airways said on Twitter that the plane in the photograph was \"not an aircraft belonging to or operated by @KenyaAirways\".\n\nAFP ran a keyword search on Facebook and found a post (in French) from August 4, 2019 by a passenger at Ewo airport in Congo-Brazzaville, which showed a photograph of the plane and wooden steps from a different angle.\n\n\u201cThis morning, I was on a flight from Tac to Ewo (Cuvette-Ouest), but at Ewo airport, the ground technicians couldn\u2019t find an appropriate staircase for passengers to get on and off the flight,\u201d reads the caption.\n\n\u201cA carpenter had the ingenious idea of making a wooden staircase.\u201d\n\nThe post features a photograph of the plane with a wooden staircase, taken from a different angle than the other pictures circulating on social media.\n\nThe plane bears the AJY code, but not the Camair-Co or Kenya Airlines logos seen in other posts.\n\nAFP contacted Adrien Wayi Lewy, the man who posted these photographs on Facebook. He said the photos were his and sent us the original images.\n\nAFP analysed the photographs using Metadata2Go, which confirmed that they were taken on July 30, 2019. The GPS position was indeed that of Ewo, in Congo-Brazzaville.\n\nContacted by AFP, Chancelle Gangonno, head of marketing at Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s airports authority AERCO, said that Camair-Co did not operate in the country.\n\n\u201cCamair-Co ceased activity in Congo on February 19, 2017,\u201d she said via email.\n\nLewy told AFP the plane belonged to Trans Air Congo. In a Facebook post in January 2019, the airline said it had a plane with the registration code AJY.\n\nAFP has contacted Trans Air Congo but has not yet received a reply.", "lang": "en"}
