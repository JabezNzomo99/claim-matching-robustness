The chairperson of the\n\nJosphat Nanok, reported on their progress in his June 2018\n\nWe checked some of the claims he made in listing the counties\u2019 achievements.\n\nthat no less than 15% of the revenue collected by the national government must go to the counties.\n\nNanok\u2019s figure is half Kenya\u2019s most recent budget of\n\n. The 47 counties receive money from the national government following approval from the\n\nThe money is split into an equitable share of the national revenue and grants. The payments are listed in the agency\u2019s\n\nNanok said the counties were working to raise their own revenues. Counties raise funds from property rates, entertainment taxes and charges for services provided. Other levies are approved by parliament.\n\nthe Office of the Controller of Budget shows that the counties\u2019 revenue collection largely improved from 2012 to 2016. There was a dip in the 2016/17 financial year.\n\nBut the counties are yet to meet their revenue collection targets.\n\nOut of the 189,087 deaths Kenya provisionally registered in 2017, the three diseases accounted for 29.7%. This is\n\nThere were 21,584 deaths from pneumonia, 17,553 from malaria and 16,953 from cancer. HIV/Aids was the fourth leading cause of death. The figures are sourced from the\n\n, which is under the\n\nBut some 48% of deaths - 90,949 - were recorded as caused by \u201cother\u201d. Asked for more information on this, interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can break down \u2018other\u2019 further than \u2018other\u2019\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, not all deaths were registered. The national statistics office\n\nthat only 41.9% of all deaths that occurred in 2016 were captured.\n\non mortality trends shows different leading causes of death in Kenya. Released in March 2018 by the health ministry, it reviewed medical records of causes of death in 168 public hospitals from 2012 to 2016.\n\nIt also recertified some of these records by looking at the medical files and not the death certificates, which may have been inaccurately filled. This is according to the head of the ministry\u2019s civil registration and vital statistics unit, Samuel Cheburet.\n\n\u201cSometimes you just see \u2018pulmonary arrest\u2019 as the cause of death. We have to find out exactly what caused it,\u201d he said. In some instances local officials recorded causes of death based on what the families said, without evidence, he added.\n\nOf the 252,000 deaths in this period, 102,000 were recertified. The survey listed HIV/Aids (12%), lower respiratory tract infections (9.1%) and malaria (5.7%) as\n\ncauses of death. It gave no further details on the types of respiratory infections. Cancer accounted for about 5.5% of deaths.\n\nThe study shows that other causes of death, apart from disease, include falls, surgical mistakes, poisoning, fire, drowning, animal bites and crime. In some cases no one really knows, so the cause is entered as \u201cundetermined\u201d. Together, these account for 29.1% of deaths.\n\nThe study also notes that Kenya only registers 40% to 50% of deaths. Given this and the new study data, we rate the claim as unproven.\n\nThis ratio was \u201cnecessary to deliver maternal and child health services\u201d, Nanok added.\n\nBut the World Health Organisation has\n\nthat it does not have a predetermined ratio for healthcare workers.\n\n\u201cThere is no current recommendation for a predefined physician to population ratio,\u201d Dr Mathieu Boniol, a statistician with the WHO said.\n\nMeshack Ndolo, a senior health adviser at the council of governors, told Africa Check that the ratio had been used to show how many more doctors were needed in Kenya.\n\nThis was \u201cbecause we were one of those countries that were designated as human resource for health crisis countries in 2006\u201d, Ndolo said. He conceded that there was no prescribed ratio per se, citing WHO\u2019s\n\nWhile Kenya\u2019s healthcare staff numbers are still short, experts have told Africa Check that the\n\nIn 2013 Kenya\u2019s forest cover was 7.2%, and grew to 7.29% in 2017, according to the Economic Survey 2018.But an April 2018 resource assessment report from the environment ministry shows forest cover was at 6.99% in 2013, and 7.4% in 2016. Both reports cite data from the Kenya Forest Service , the state agency tasked with protecting and managing public forests.The discrepancy in official data is because there has not been a detailed study on forest cover, Monica Kalenda, the chief conservator of forests, told Africa Check.The most recent study was done in 2010 and its final report released in 2013, she said. This showed forest cover was 6.99% in 2010.\u201cWe normally do a wall-to-wall mapping which is supposed to be done after every five years, but we have not done so because of resources. It is quite expensive,\u201d Kalenda said.As such, forest cover is based on projections from the 2010 data, she said. (Note: A 0.1 percentage point increase would be about 58,037 hectares, larger than the Kenyan county of Migori.)https://africacheck.org/reports/uhuru-kenyattas-2018-state-of-the-nation-address-fact-checked/https://africacheck.org/reports/as-help-from-cuba-arrives-is-there-only-one-kenyan-doctor-for-every-16000-people/", "lang": "en"}
