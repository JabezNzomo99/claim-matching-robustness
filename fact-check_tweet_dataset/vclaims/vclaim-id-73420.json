A similar claim was debunked just days ago.\n\nTimek ti Cagayan\u2019s July 31 post surfaced shortly after UP issued its July 29 advisory, which reported 118 positive COVID-19 cases of UP and non-UP constituents from inside and outside Barangay UP Campus. The data recorded, however, was only as of July 28, merely a day after the protest that was held hours ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA).\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s incubation period -- or the time it takes for symptoms to manifest after a person has acquired a disease -- ranges from one to 12.5 days, according to the Department of Health (DOH) citing the World Health Organization (WHO). The global body further recommends the monitoring of symptoms for up to 14 days.\n\nA day before Timek ti Cagayan shared its unproven post, site Filipiknow Times published a related claim saying activist Renato Reyes Jr. and other protesters during SONAgkaisa contracted COVID-19. This was debunked by VERA Files Fact Check. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Story claiming activist Renato Reyes, protesters in UP got COVID-19 NOT TRUE)\n\nApart from the unfounded claim, Timek ti Cagayan, which publishes posts mostly critical of leftist groups, made a baseless assumption in its graphic that Kabataan Party-list Rep. Sarah Elago \u201cwill blame the government for how the protesters whom she fooled got COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe post also put together eight different images lifted from various sources, and bore stamps that red-tagged Elago and protesters in the photos, such as \u201cTatak CPP-NPA-NDF (Signature Communist Party of the Philippines - New People\u2019s Army - National Democratic Front)\u201d and \u201cTatak Terorista Komunista (Signature Terrorist Communist).\u201d\n\nThe unproven post came a day after the DOH reported over 38,000 recovered COVID-19 patients in its July 30 case bulletin. This sudden spike in recoveries drew flak from unbelieving netizens and a few government officials. The number of COVID-19 cases in the country reached over 139,500 on Aug. 11.\n\nTimek ti Cagayan\u2019s baseless post already got over 3,300 reactions, 1,400 comments, and 5,300 shares from FB users. Social media monitoring tool Crowdtangle shows there are at least 37 posts by pages and in public groups carrying the viral photo, collectively accumulating over 16,000 interactions from netizens.", "lang": "en"}
