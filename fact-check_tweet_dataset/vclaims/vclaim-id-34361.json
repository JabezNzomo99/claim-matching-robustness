Perhaps missing in some of the internet outrage, though, was the fact Champion was eventually allowed inside.\n\nChampion told local news station WESH that he and his girlfriend went to the resort on Nov. 1, 2019, to enjoy the park\u2019s new \u201cHalloween Horror Nights\u201d exhibit, but that he was stopped at the entrance by security guards, who told him he couldn\u2019t go in wearing anything that said \u201cpolice officer\u201d on it. In addition to the words on the shirt\u2019s front, the back of Champion\u2019s shirt had a picture of a skull over an American flag with a blue stripe through the middle and the words, \u201cMy time in uniform is over but my watch never ends.\u201d\n\nPark policy states that guests aren\u2019t allowed inside while wearing anything \u201cthat represents someone as emergency personnel,\u201d although Champion countered that he didn\u2019t believe his T-shirt could be mistaken for an on-duty uniform. He also told WESH that even if it was mistaken, he is still a reserve officer and could help in the event of an emergency. Staff let him in.\n\nWe contacted a spokesperson for the park, who confirmed Champion\u2019s own statement that he was briefly stopped but eventually admitted into the park wearing the shirt.\n\nAlthough the park issued a statement that said the policy was intended to avoid confusion, Champion told WESH that he believed he was \u201cprofiled as law enforcement, properly so, and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want me in there.\u201d\n\nA statement from a park spokesperson to WESH said the intent of the policy is not to pick on guests with law-enforcement backgrounds: \u201cWe want our guests and team members to be able to easily identify active, working, law enforcement. We do not permit guests to wear clothing or items that could cause confusion.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
