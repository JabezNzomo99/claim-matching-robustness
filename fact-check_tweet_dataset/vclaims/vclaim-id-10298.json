Both media outlets claimed the book is more popular in Latvia than Harry Potter, but iBook is nowhere near to being a top shopping site in Latvia.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 13, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10298", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-harry-potter-hitler-latvia/29166375.html", "vclaim": "On April 2, Zvezda TV and Sputnik published the false claim that Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d is more popular in Latvia than Harry Potter, the fictional school child who is the main character of a popular series of books and movies. Sputnik labeled the story \u201cViral.\u201d\n\nZvezda based its conclusion solely on the rankings of a single Latvian website, iBook, referencing a widget in the left bottom corner of that website reading: \u201cThe Most Current Books in 7 Days.\u201d\n\nThe Russian government news agency Sputnik also cited iBook as the source of its own list of Latvia\u2019s\u201ctop four books,\u201d which put Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf near the top and ahead of Harry Potter. Sputnik went on to point out, somewhat incongruously, that a yearly march in Riga commemorating World Two-era Latvian Nazi SS members has been condemned internationally.\n\niBook is a small online platform for individuals to sell and exchange their used books. The website describes itself as a \u201cportal for book exchanges, sales and purchases.\u201d\n\nPolyraph.info ran the site through SimilarWeb, a tool for measuring site traffic, and found that iBook ranks 338th in Latvia in terms of popularity, and 219,504th in the world. It is Latvia\u2019s 149th most popular shopping site. Therefore, it is not even close to the top in any category.\n\n\u201cAlexa,\u201d the Amazon-owned web tool, ranks ibook\u2019s Web traffic even lower \u2013 878th in Latvia and 407,609th in the world. 6.6% of the sites recent traffic came from Russia -- possibly due to the fact that TV Zvezda linked to the site in its story.\n\nThe four copies of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d featured on the website are used 1995 editions of Hitler\u2019s book, and are being sold by individual users.\n\nAccording to Latvian readers on \u201cGoogle Reads,\u201d while travel guides and books on Latvian cuisine tend to be best sellers in Latvia, the top selling book in the country is Epif\u0101nijas (Epiphanies), a collection by the poet Imants Ziedonis.\n\n\u201cWords Without Borders,\u201d a non-profit organization that promotes global literature, says the 2017 grand prize at the Annual Latvian Literature Award went to Jana Egle\u2019s short story collection \u201cLight.\u201d\n\nThe Web site \u201cLatvian Literature,\u201d created by Baltic writers and publishers, focuses on Latvian national literature and Web sites that sell it. Neither iBook, not the \u201cMein Kampf\u201d are not represented.", "lang": "en"}
