With House legislation in limbo, Sanders is calling on the Federal Reserve to take action \u2014 similar to what it did for the big banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Sanders says he plans to propose legislation in the Senate after the election, to help Puerto Rico.\n\nAs a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico can\u2019t declare bankruptcy or restructure its own debt like states can under U.S. bankruptcy laws. So Sanders\u2019s proposal is to get the Fed to help Puerto Rico \u2014 after all, it did so for the big banks.\n\nSanders cited Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which says that in \u201cunusual and exigent circumstances,\u201d the Fed can lend to \u201cindividuals, partnerships and corporations\u201d that are \u201cunable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.\u201d Sanders wants the Fed to use this authority to lend to Puerto Rican public corporations and restructure the debt through a \u201creverse Dutch auction.\u201d Through this process, Puerto Rico\u2019s public corporations would buy back the debt they owe and force creditors to compete against each other to sell back the debt, according to Sanders\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Sanders campaign pointed to an October 2014 report on potential policy options for Puerto Rico, written by Arturo Estrella, economics professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who worked for the New York Fed for two decades. \u201cIn certain episodes of acute perceived risk, the Federal Reserve has shown an inclination to interpret its powers fairly broadly,\u201d Estrella wrote, and the Fed broadened its interpretation of Section 13(3) throughout the financial crisis.\n\nLoans under Section 13(3) were intended to go to solvent entities, and made with the expectation of a full repayment. But in June 2015, Puerto Rico declared it could not repay its debt and likely would default on its payments. Since then, it has missed hundreds of millions of dollars in payments \u2014 and the island would now be considered insolvent and ineligible for the loan.\n\n\u201cIf you look at my study, it is very hopeful because it was written in October 2014. With the governor\u2019s announcement in June of the following year [about the government\u2019s inability to repay the debt] \u2014 I was there in Puerto Rico \u2014 and I thought, well, this changes everything,\u201d Estrella told The Fact Checker.\n\nMoreover, in November 2015, the Fed adopted new regulations downsizing its emergency lending powers \u2014 a requirement under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which Sanders voted for. This took effect January 2016. (Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said since June 2015 that Puerto Rico debt \u201cisn\u2019t a matter in which I have an opinion. It\u2019s something the Federal Reserve can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be involved in. I think it\u2019s appropriate for Congress to consider what\u2019s best to do in this case.\u201d)\n\nEstrella said 13(3) is now probably the least likely regulation to be used for Puerto Rico: \u201cI agree with what he\u2019s [Sanders] saying, I think the Fed should and could do more. The question is, now with the perception of insolvency, is 13(3) applicable? If I were at the Fed, I would be hesitant to use 13(3) at this point.\u201d\n\nIn his policy memo, Sanders offers another section in the Federal Reserve Act as an alternative. That section allows the Fed to purchase \u201cbonds and notes of the United States\u201d with a maturity date of six months for states, or with no limitation for maturity for foreign countries. But since Puerto Rico is neither a state nor a foreign country, it\u2019s not clear whether this regulation would apply.\n\nCampaign spokesman Warren Gunnels pointed to this as a more promising option, pivoting from the authority that Sanders cited in the speech. \u201cSenator Sanders has been calling on the Fed to use its authority right now to facilitate an orderly debt restructuring in a way that is fair and just,\u201d Gunnels said.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, the Fed moved heaven and earth to provide trillions in low-interest loans to big banks and corporations when they were hurting. \u2026 We believe the Fed needs to be just as creative in helping to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico as it was when it rescued Wall Street financial institutions,\u201d Gunnels said.\n\nSanders calls on the Fed to use its emergency lending authority to help Puerto Rico, just as it had used the same authority to rescue failing firms during the financial crisis. But this is quite misleading. The Fed has now adopted limits to its lending authority after the financial crisis, consistent with requirements under Dodd-Frank. Interestingly, Sanders \u2014 who supported such restrictions under Dodd-Frank \u2014 now wants the Fed to get creative in interpreting its authority to help Puerto Rico.", "lang": "en"}
