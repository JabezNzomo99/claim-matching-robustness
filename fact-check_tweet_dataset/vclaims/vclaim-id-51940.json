Crowded subway cars may have accelerated the spread. New York\u2019s governor says FEMA gave the state 400 ventilators. To that he said this: GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: \u201cWhat am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000? You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\u201d NARRATOR: The governor now projects that the state will need up to 140,000 beds, with an additional 40,000 ICU beds. Across the river from New York, at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey, the chief infectious disease specialists says his hospital has just ten ventilators. Barely enough for now.\n\nHowever, some sharp-eyed viewers noticed that one of the brief hospital scenes used in the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d report on New York coronavirus cases was identical to footage that had been aired by Sky News three days earlier and shot at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy:\n\nCBS News acknowledged the error. A spokesperson said, \u201cIt was an editing mistake. We took immediate steps to remove it from all platforms and shows.\u201d\n\nA week later, however, CBS News apparently used a very brief bit of that Italian footage again while referencing coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania:", "lang": "en"}
