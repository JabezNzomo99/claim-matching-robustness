Limbaugh specifically alleged that his speech \u201chad to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together.\u201d The Biden acceptance speech was one continuous shot, and, as reported by ABC\u2019s John Verhovek, Biden delivered his speech in front of \u201croughly three-dozen reporters, a skeleton camera crew, a handful of Secret Service agents and a smattering of campaign staff.\u201d (Verhovek was one of the reporters in attendance and live-tweeted lines from it as well as images and video he captured on his cell phone.) After his speech, Biden interacted with supporters who were video-conferenced in.\n\nBuzzFeed\u2019s Ruby Cramer attended the speech as well, and reported \u201cabout 30 members of the press and a skeleton production crew\u201d in attendance. She also tweeted images from the event, as did the Washington Post\u2019s Annie Linskey, the New York Times\u2019 Katie Glueck, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas, the Daily Beast\u2019s Hanna Trudo, and CBS\u2019 Bo Erickson, who also shared images of Biden\u2019s teleprompter.\n\nOne tweet from John Cardillo claims that a missing pin and watch between \u201cshots\u201d proves the speech was prefilmed in segments and cut together.\n\nHowever, the tweet does not actually compare images from Biden\u2019s acceptance speech: while the first two are from his speech, the last \u201cgotcha\u201d picture shows Biden some time later with a completely different background, on a stage outside for the fireworks. Again, Biden\u2019s speech was one continuous shot, and the images Cardillo used were misleading as the positioning of Biden\u2019s arms obscured his watch and pin. Twitter users pointed out that Biden\u2019s watch could have easily slid beneath his shirt sleeve, and video of the pictured interaction between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris shows he was still wearing the pin at the time.\n\nIn short, there is a plethora of evidence that Biden\u2019s speech occurred live, thanks to video of the speech and the journalists who were there in person to cover it. Claims that the acceptance speech was prerecorded are, as Biden would say, complete malarkey.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
