Details were sparse at the time. On Sept. 22, Pompeo appeared on several Sunday shows as the face of the administration. Asked about Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky and about a whistleblower complaint from a member of the intelligence community, Pompeo claimed ignorance.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (In making this request, Trump falsely claimed that Biden as vice president stopped Ukrainian prosecutors from pursuing a case involving his son.)\n\nAug. 12: An intelligence community whistleblower files a complaint based on Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and related issues. It reads in part: \u201cAccording to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia: initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nJohn Roberts, Fox News: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the exact substance of the complaint, but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And we have heard from reporting in the Wall Street Journal that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cWell, John, you\u2019re asking me to comment on an IG report I haven\u2019t seen and some reporting \u2014 I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.\u201d\n\nRoberts: \u201cAgain, I assume that you\u2019ve seen the transcript. Is it as described in the Wall Street Journal?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t seen the Wall Street Journal piece, John. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world.\u201d\n\nUsually a secretary of state is up-to-date on major topics in the news and prepares for obvious questions before speaking on national television for the administration. But Pompeo didn\u2019t need to read news reports or a transcript of the July 25 phone call to remember what was discussed. He was on the phone call.\n\nRaddatz: \u201cAnd I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary, the complaint involving the president and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general \u2014 that\u2019s where the complaint was launched by the whistleblower. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. What do you know about those conversations?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cSo, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistleblower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nRaddatz: \u201cYou say you know nothing about this, but let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me ask you this question. The Ukrainian presidential readout of the conversation said they discussed, quote, \u2018investigation of corruption cases which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u2019 The president tweeted Saturday, \u2018It was a perfectly fine and respectful conversation.\u2019 Do you think it\u2019s, quote, \u2018perfectly fine\u2019 to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cI think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Pompeo is asked squarely about the July 25 conversation, and once again, he bobs and weaves. Pompeo referred selectively to comments from the Ukrainian foreign minister when he could have volunteered direct knowledge of the phone call and Trump\u2019s request to Zelensky. Combined with his other answers, the effect is misleading.\n\nOct. 2: During a visit to Italy, Pompeo confirms the reports that he was on the July 25 phone call. \u201cAs for, was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo says in Rome. \u201cThe phone call was in the context of \u2014 now, I guess I\u2019ve been the secretary of state for coming on a year and a half \u2014 I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It\u2019s been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
