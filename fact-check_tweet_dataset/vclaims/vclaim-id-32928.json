This is false; voters who participated across the state outnumbered the US president\u2019s supporters, according to a venue spokesman and a crowd estimate.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump had more people at his rally last night than the entire voting total for Democrats of Nevada. Maybe Trump will really win all 50 states,\u201d says the article, which has been shared here, here and here.\n\nNevada has been won by the Democratic Party in the last three presidential elections but it is often a closely fought state and remains a target for Republicans in November 2020.\n\n\u201cReally? yay! flip Vegas. back to red!!!!\u201d a user commented on one of the posts, referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in Nevada in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cTrump 2020 by a landslide!!\u201d another said.\n\nThe Nevada Democratic Party said that almost 105,000 people took part in the recent caucuses, which were comfortably won by Senator Bernie Sanders -- far more than attended the Trump rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center, an enormous facility with many halls and rooms offered to those who hold events there.\n\n\u201cThe convention hall that was used for Friday\u2019s rally has a capacity of 8,000 people. Since there were people viewing the rally on a big screen outside, it is safe to say they reached the 8,000 person capacity inside,\u201d Koby Stover, the communications coordinator of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, told AFP by email.\n\nCanvassing by the Trump campaign identified \u201c15,079 voters\u201d during the rally, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted after the event ended. The president retweeted a video of people at the event prior to his arrival.\n\nHowever, no Trump official claimed that more people attended the president\u2019s speech than took part in Democratic Party voting the following day.\n\nAFP used pictures and videos -- accessible here, here, here, and here -- that were posted on social media by Trump staffers and Republican supporters to determine the area where the crowd was standing outside.\n\nAccording to Mapchecking, a crowd estimator tool, the maximum number of people who could have been in the area without causing a safety hazard -- five people per square meter -- was slightly less than 27,000.", "lang": "en"}
