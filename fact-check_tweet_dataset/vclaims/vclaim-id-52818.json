His campaign website does not list defunding the police as part of Biden\u2019s platform.\n\nSome activists have called to \u201cdefund the police\u201d following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May.\n\nTrump has attempted to link Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, to the growing movement, according to USA Today. For instance, Trump claimed on Twitter that \u201cSleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to \u2018DEFUND THE POLICE\u2019. I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!\u201d\n\nHowever, Biden and his campaign have refuted the claim that the former vice president supports calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d on several occasions.

And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.\u201d\n\nIn a June 10 USA Today op-ed, Biden also reiterated his position, writing that the \u201cbetter answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.\u201d\n\nOn Biden\u2019s campaign website, he proposes a criminal justice reform agenda that, among other things, includes investing $300 million into the existing Community Oriented Policing Services Program. He also pledges to expand the Justice Department\u2019s authority to investigate \u201csystemic police misconduct\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional or unlawful policing,\u201d according to his campaign website. Nowhere on Biden\u2019s website does it advocate for defunding police departments.\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
