This is misleading; the photo shows a supermarket in the US city of Atlanta in 2014, and local officials said the main concern in the Maritimes is a propane shortage.\n\nA meme making rounds in Canada shows a photo of a masked protester next to a photo empty supermarket shelves. Above the photos, a caption states: \u201cIllegal blockades causing shelf shortages in the Maritimes,\u201d in reference to Canada\u2019s Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince-Edward-Island.\n\nThe post was published on February 21 by Nova Scotia Proud, a conservative-leaning Facebook page, and subsequently shared by New Brunswick Proud and Proud To Be A Canadian, two affiliated pages.\n\nHowever, the post is misleading because the photo of the store was not taken in Canada, but in a supermarket in Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia, in February 2014. Shoppers in the southeastern state were preparing for a snow storm dubbed \u201cSnowmageddon 2014,\u201d leaving shelves in this supermarket empty.\n\nCanada\u2019s Maritime provinces have suffered propane shortages due to blockades that have disrupted Canada\u2019s rail traffic for more than two weeks. Protesters are acting in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs, members of a Canadian first nation fighting construction of a natural gas pipeline on their traditional territory in northern British Columbia, Canada\u2019s westernmost province.\n\nBut Patrick Sullivan, president of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, in Nova Scotia\u2019s capital, told AFP, the impact on grocery stores is low because \u201cmost grocery chains have just switched to trucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly there have been shortages, but not as dramatic as this photo shows. I didn\u2019t see any shelves like that when I was in the grocery store this weekend picking up my groceries,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nMike Hammoud, president of the Atlantic Convenience Store Association, also told AFP that \u201cthere are some empty spaces on shelves but they\u2019re not all completely empty like that picture.\u201d\n\nCTV News\u2019 local affiliate also reported some shortages of non-perishable items.\n\nFederal government officials told reporters that the blockades were having a negative impact on Canada\u2019s economy, with freight traffic suspended and 1,000 rail workers temporarily laid off. \u201cIt could even affect our GDP if it continues,\u201d transportation minister Marc Garneau said Sunday.\n\nOne of the main blockades, in Tyendinaga, a township east of Toronto, was dismantled on Monday by the Ontario Provincial Police.", "lang": "en"}
