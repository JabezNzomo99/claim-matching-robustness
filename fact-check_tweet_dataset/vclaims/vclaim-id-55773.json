But, he said, \u201cultimately, I have to make that decision.\u201d\n\nSeveral governors, however, said they would be making those kinds of determinations for their states, not the president. For example, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on April 12, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she\u2019d make any decision about easing coronavirus-related restrictions in her state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make the decisions that safeguard New Mexicans,\u201d Lujan Grisham said. \u201cEverything we do is about protecting lives and first responders or health care workers.\u201d\n\nLujan Grisham said she welcomed \u201cbetter national strategies,\u201d but, she added, \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever is right for New Mexico. And we\u2019ve begun looking at recovery options but we aren\u2019t going to do anything until that peak occurs and we\u2019re clear about not having hospitalizations and reducing the number of people that are positive every day in our surveillance and testing efforts.\u201d\n\nLast month, when Trump said he wanted to have the country \u201copen for business\u201d by Easter on April 12, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said his state would not oblige.\n\n\u201cWhatever messages that are coming out of Washington, we are going to make sure we take care of the needs of New Hampshire first,\u201d Sununu, a Republican, said.\n\nSince then, several news reports have concluded that, constitutionally, those decisions would ultimately be made by state governors, not Trump.\n\nVia Twitter on April 13, Trump criticized the \u201cFake News Media\u201d for \u201csaying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect\u2026. It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, at a press briefing, Trump reiterated that he has the \u201cultimate authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president of the United States calls the shots.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear under what authority Trump is making his claim, and the White House did not clarify when we reached out to the press office. But constitutional experts disagree with him.\n\n\u201cThe president is *not* correct,\u201d Robert Chesney, a professor of law and associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Texas School of Law, told us via email. (The emphasis is his.)\n\nIn a post for the Lawfare blog published on March 24, Chesney noted that the restrictions now in place \u201cflow primarily from rules promulgated by state governors, county commissioners and mayors \u2014 not from the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is wrong as a matter of constitutional law,\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law at the University of California, told us via email.\n\n\u201cQuarantine and stay-at-home orders are entirely the decision of the state governors,\u201d he said. \u201cStates have the police power and the authority to quarantine. The President has no authority to override such orders and order the country open. No federal statute gives the President such authority. Nor did the President order sheltering in place; he can exhort, but the orders come from state and local governments.\u201d\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who served as an impeachment expert for House Republicans in December, told the New York Times, \u201cThere is no authority for a president to order states to \u2018open up\u2019 if the state believes that such an order would be inimical to public health. The president had no authority to order a national lockdown and certainly does not have authority to now order the lifting of such orders issued by governors.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Governors Association, 41 states have issued mandatory stay-at-home orders (in three other states it is a \u201cguidance\u201d; in one, it is a \u201crecommendation,\u201d and in two other states the stay-at-home orders apply only to specific vulnerable populations); all states have closed schools; 41 states have prohibited in-person workforces at nonessential businesses; and almost every state has limited the operations of restaurants and bars.\n\nWhen a reporter pointed out at the April 13 press conference that it was the states \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 that closed schools and ordered the closure of nonessential businesses, Trump responded, \u201cThat\u2019s because I let that happen, because I would\u2019ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up.\u201d\n\nWriting for Politico, Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, explained that states and local governments are authorized to mandate such restrictions based on broad \u201cpolice power\u201d authority which \u201ccan be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Joh wrote, \u201cState and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government,\u201d Joh wrote, in a March 18 article.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on April 13, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association, said that governors would be discussing the wisdom of opening their states with \u201cmultiple smart people at the federal level,\u201d such as Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have the president\u2019s cooperation.\u201d Hogan added. \u201cBut governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their state, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists and I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the president can\u2019t influence things.\n\n\u201cThe president, of course, is entitled to express his views on this point,\u201d Chesney said in his Lawfare post. That would have \u201ca significant practical effect\u201d on \u201cthose who trust him,\u201d and as a result if the president were to speak against things like \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d rules, there\u2019s likely to be a higher rate of noncompliance among \u201ccitizens sympathetic to the president,\u201d he said. It also would likely put pressure on Republican leaders at the state and local level to adopt a similar position.\n\nTrump appeared to reference that political power when he said, during a press conference on April 13, that \u201cif some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election.\u201d\n\nBut if some state and local officials buck the president\u2019s call, Chesney said, \u201cthe president cannot simply order state and local officials to change their policies.\u201d\n\nOn March 16, Trump issued the 15-day \u201cCoronavirus Guidelines for America,\u201d in which he urged, \u201call Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.\u201d\n\nOn March 29, Trump announced that those guidelines would be extended to April 30.\n\nBut those were guidelines, not orders.\n\nDuring a press briefing on April 10, Trump was asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis considering opening Florida schools in May. Trump said governors should make those decisions because \u201cfrom a constitutional standpoint, that\u2019s the way it should be done.\u201d But Trump maintained that he had the right to overrule DeSantis if he disagreed.\n\nChesney says Trump is wrong about that.\n\nArticle II in the Constitution establishes the powers of the president.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Chemerinsky said \u201cno federal law gives the president power to order businesses to close or, for that matter, to open.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump on his own lacks the power to act,\u201d Chemerinsky wrote. \u201cThe president can exhort state and local governments to lift their restrictions. He can try to persuade businesses to open and defy the closure orders. He can ask Congress to pass legislation. But he cannot override state or local law, and he cannot provide immunity from sanctions to those who violate state and local restrictions. The bottom line is that if California, or other states, or cities or counties, feel the need to continue restrictions \u2026 they may do so.\u201d\n\nSix East Coast states and three West Coast states announced that they will work together jointly as regions on their reopening plans.\n\nAt his April 13 press briefing, Trump said he would provide the press \u201ca legal brief if you want\u201d on his \u201cultimate authority,\u201d but none was immediately forthcoming. We followed up with the White House press office, but we got no response.\n\n\n\nIn an April 10 opinion piece published in the New York Times, Elizabeth Goitein and Andrew Boyle of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law discussed classified documents known as Presidential Emergency Action Documents.\n\n\u201cThese documents consist of draft proclamations, executive orders and proposals for legislation that can be quickly deployed to assert broad presidential authority in a range of worst-case scenarios,\u201d Goitein and Boyle wrote. \u201cThey are one of the government\u2019s best-kept secrets. No presidential emergency action document has ever been released or even leaked. And it appears that none has ever been invoked.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential Emergency Action Documents, or PEAD, were first created during the Eisenhower administration in the event of a nuclear war, they wrote. Since then, those plans have expanded to include responses to other national emergencies, including pandemics. They cited one 2004 declassified government memo that said, \u201cPEADs are used to implement extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations.\u201d But the details of these documents have not been revealed publicly, even to members of Congress.\n\nAsked about the comments by Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the April 13 press conference, Boyle told us it is \u201ccertainly possible\u201d they were referring to those Presidential Emergency Action Documents.\n\nFor example, Trump said, \u201cThis is when somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\u201d And, \u201cThe authority of the president of the United States having to do with the subject we\u2019re talking about is total.\u201d\n\nPence said he agreed: \u201cWell, make no mistake about it. In the long history of this country, the authority of the president of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies.\u201d\n\nIf the president and vice president are referring to Presidential Emergency Action Documents, Boyle told us in a phone interview it is \u201chighly questionable that these documents are consistent with constitutional law.\u201d Boyle, counsel for the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty & National Security program, agrees with constitutional scholars who say, \u201cthis is a power given to the states, not to the federal government.\u201d\n\nNor does Boyle think the coronavirus pandemic meets the emergency threshold needed to trigger an attempt at such expanded executive powers. Unlike in a nuclear attack, he said, Congress and the courts are still functioning. \u201cThere really is no legitimate claim in these circumstances,\u201d he said.\n\nChesney, director of the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin, told us the classified memos only amount to a legal opinion from lawyers at the Department of Justice, and that doesn\u2019t make them legal.\n\n\u201cThe executive branch has anticipated various nightmare scenarios, and \u2014 mindful that there wouldn\u2019t be time for the usual drafting-and-vetting process in the teeth of catastrophe \u2014 someone pre-wrote a bunch of orders that a president in such a situation might want to issue,\u201d Chesney told us via email. \u201cWe can assume there is some wild stuff in them, stuff that might be of very questionable legality in general, maybe even stuff that would be dubious even in the worst of circumstances.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that someone has pre-written such documents does *nothing* to make the actions they describe more or less legal,\u201d Chesney added. \u201cAt most, it means that someone at DOJ at some point reviewed the document and decided that, in the right (worst) fact patterns, the thing described in the document could be legal. That doesn\u2019t actually make it legal, and it definitely doesn\u2019t mean that today\u2019s facts even match up with whatever scenario the document author had in mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s assume there is some pre-written emergency memo that purports to assert presidential authority over huge swaths of the economy, and Trump breaks the glass, signs it, and starts ordering various sectors to reopen despite state law to the contrary,\u201d Chesney continued. \u201cDoes the president\u2019s order control? The answer would be the same with or without the pre-written memo. (I think the answer would be no, incidentally).\u201d\n\nBoyle agrees, but says given the possibility that Trump could invoke the documents, \u201cCongress should insist on having full access to them to ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution and basic principles of democracy.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible, Boyle said, the Trump administration, including those who have long held a \u201crobust view\u201d of executive power, would argue that with or without the memos, the president\u2019s powers in certain circumstances are absolute.\n\nIf the administration has a legal argument for that, Boyle said, he\u2019d like to see it. (Both Trump and Pence said the administration could provide such legal briefs.)\n\n\u201cShow us your work,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThen we can have that debate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
