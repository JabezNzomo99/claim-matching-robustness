They\u2019re also rising 0.4% faster than the Office for Budget Responsibility expected before the referendum.\n\nBut by historic standards, the current 1% rate of inflation is still relatively low.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not uncommon for the rate of inflation to rise by 0.4 percentage points from month to month, as it did between August and September. It\u2019s done that in one out of every six months since 1990.\n\nBy most standards, 1% is still a low rate of inflation. The Bank of England\u2019s target is double that, at 2%.\n\nFor the past two years, the inflation rate has been so low that Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has been required to write quarterly letters to the Chancellor explaining why the Bank is missing its target by more than 1%.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s target is \u201csymmetric\u201d, which means that it\u2019s not necessarily better for inflation to be too low than too high.\n\nIt\u2019s also a flexible target. It\u2019s considered okay for inflation to be a little higher or lower, if that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to keep the economy growing and employment high.\n\nAnd 2% inflation might not be the target for ever. There\u2019s nothing magical about the number, it\u2019s just what most central banks judge to be a good target. Some people have argued that central banks should be aiming for higher rates of inflation, like 4%.\n\nNo economic forecast is ever certain, but inflation doesn\u2019t seem set to \u201csoar\u201d in the next year or so either.\n\nOn average, forecasts published in the last three months expected consumer prices to rise about 2.5% in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
