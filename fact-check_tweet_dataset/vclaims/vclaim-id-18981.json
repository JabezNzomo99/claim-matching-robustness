Kashmir 370 removed. Limited stock! For more details call on 9019292918.\"\n\nWhen we called up this number to verify, it turned out to be a customer care number of a Kolkata-based realty firm called \"Eden Realty\".\n\nAccording to the company website, they have collaborated with the West Bengal government and worked on various developmental projects in the state.\n\nA representative from Eden Realty confirmed to us that the viral message about sale of land in Srinagar is a hoax. \"Somebody is playing a prank with us, we have informed this to the cyber cell of police. Please do not believe the viral message,\" said the company representative.\n\nFacebook user Avinash Singh posted a similar message about availability of land near Srinagar's Lal Chowk and put out a contact number.\n\nWe found it to be the number of Avinash Singh himself. Singh, who claimed to be a BJP worker, said this was a joke, but also boasted that the day is not far when we would be able to buy land in J&K.\n\nWith revocation of the 1954 Presidential proclamation through the government Gazette notification, Article 35A now ceases to exist.\n\nArticle 35A is known as the Permanent Residents Law. It deprives the state's female residents of property rights if they marry an 'outsider' or somebody who is not a permanent resident of J&K.\n\nNow after Article 35A is revoked and Kashmir's special status gone, anybody from anywhere in India will be able to buy property and settle permanently in J&K. Details about this can be read here.\n\nBut given the present law and order situation, high security deployment and several restrictions, it is practically unlikely for someone to buy land in Kashmir, immediately.\n\nThe viral messages about sale of land in Kashmir are hoaxes. After the abrogation of special status of J&K, people from any part of the country can now buy land in the state, legally.\n\nHowever, due to the present volatile situation in the state, the new law might take some time to be implemented.", "lang": "en"}
