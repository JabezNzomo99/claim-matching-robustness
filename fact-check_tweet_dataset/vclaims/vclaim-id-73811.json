The post\u2019s claim goes against advice outlined by the World Health Organization.\n\nIn an instructional video (1min14sec) on March 9, Dr April Baller from WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme explains how to wear a medical mask correctly.\n\nDr Baller says the inside of the mask is \u201cusually the white side\u201d, advice she reiterates in another video on June 5.\n\nProviding more detail, Dr Seto Wing Hong, co-director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, addresses the claim in this video.\n\n\u201cYou see it (the mask) has the blue colour on the outside because it is waterproof and then you have white on the inside because it is absorbent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if I cough, it absorbs it\u2026 so, you gotta wear it like this \u2013 blue on the outside, white on the inside.\u201d\n\nIn the same video, Dr Wing Hong also stresses the importance of wearing the mask the correct way up, with the metal wired edge running over the nose.\n\nA WHO infographic details how to wear a medical mask safely with an instruction that says \u201censure the coloured-side faces outwards\u201d. There is no advice that the coloured and white sides are used to indicate the health of the wearer.\n\nVersions of the post have been fact checked here, here, here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The post incorrectly advises people to have the coloured side facing out if they are sick and the white side out if they are healthy. False \u2013 The primary claims in the post are factually inaccurate. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.
