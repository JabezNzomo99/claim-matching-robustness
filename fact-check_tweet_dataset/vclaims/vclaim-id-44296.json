In ensuing years, events such as the publication of multiple books by and about him, the success of the television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and his entry into U.S. politics would multiply his level of national (and international) fame many times over.\n\nBut perhaps the single thing Donald Trump was most famous for at the beginning of the 1990s was his messy divorce from his first wife Ivana, which played out across the headlines of New York tabloids. Amid Ivana\u2019s claims of \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment\u201d at the hands of Donald, and Ivana\u2019s accusations that Donald had raped her and pulled out her hair by the handful, the couple eventually reached a divorce settlement that reportedly left Trump\u2019s ex-wife with anywhere from $14 million to $25 million.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this very public divorce, the August 1990 issue of Playgirl magazine (a publication intended to emulate the success of Playboy magazine but with a female audience) teased its readers with a cover blurb that stated \u201cSleep with Donald Trump\u201d:\n\nThe magazine\u2019s table of contents offered a blurb for the \u201cSleep with Donald Trump\u201d contest that proclaimed: \u201cHe\u2019s rich, almost single and yours for the asking. Here\u2019s how can you get [sic] the Donald out of your dreams and into your bed!\u201d:\n\nThe underlying \u201ccontest\u201d \u2014 which was quite likely a PR effort coordinated and paid for by Trump himself and/or a book publisher \u2014 turned out to be little more than deceptive wordplay, full of flattering remarks about the Donald (even if they were invented ones) and catty references to his divorce. Readers quickly learned that the only \u201cprize\u201d to be won in this contest was a pillowcase with Trump\u2019s face silk-screened onto it:\n\nHe\u2019s tall, good-looking, about the be divorced, and rich beyond your wildest imagination. His every move makes headlines \u2014 even his bedroom moves One woman reportedly called him \u201cthe best sex I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He\u2019s multi-billionaire Donald Trump, and now, if you win our contest, you can snuggle up and get to know him too.
