He was airlifted to a Houston hospital but died of his wound.\n\nThe post actually says nothing about refugees, Muslim or otherwise. The only sentence describing a suspect read, \"Investigators said late Monday they were looking for a suspect described as a white or Hispanic male, approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 6-feet-3 inches tall, with short hair and a medium to stocky build.\"\n\nThere isn\u2019t much more detail on the killer than that. There is no mention of a trio of shooters.\n\nSouthernConservativeExtra.com describes itself as \"conservative news on the cutting edge, from a southern perspective.\" It is registered to an address in Texas. We attempted to contact the site via email but did not receive a reply.\n\nThe story appears to be a truncated version of the same article and headline posted April 3 on TrueTrumpers.com, a known fake news site. The story and the same headline also has appeared on several other suspect websites.\n\nIt looks like all of them copied a real news article from April 3 by the Associated Press. The only difference is the clumsy addition of \"by 3 Muslim refugee\" and the question about deportation.\n\nThis may have been done solely to inflame readers who don\u2019t bother to get past the headline and read the details.\n\nIn reality, the man who killed Greenwood turned out to be William Kenny, an area man who held a grudge against law enforcement. Authorities had conducted a manhunt for a week, but Kenny had killed himself the day after shooting Greenwood.\n\nWhile the post is a real news article posted without attribution, the headline is altered to stoke prejudiced sentiments toward Muslims. It\u2019s a gross misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding a law enforcement officer\u2019s death.\n\nWe rate the headline Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
