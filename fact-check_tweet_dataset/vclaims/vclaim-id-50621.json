The claim is false; the video was taken before the COVID-19 crisis in a different part of the country.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 800 times and the 30-second video has clocked up more than 21,000 views since March 5.\n\nIt shows a troop of monkeys scavenging for food among patients in a hospital ward.\n\n\u201cPretoria hospital wtf and we prepared for the corona virus omf (sic),\u201d the caption reads.\n\nAs the monkeys invade the ward, a startled voice repeatedly exclaims \u201cHaibo!\u201d -- an isiZulu word expressing disbelief.\n\nThe video was again linked to a Pretoria hospital by a Facebook news account with 1.3 million followers. Hours later the post was edited and the word \"Pretoria\" was replaced with \"Durban\", a coastal city in KwaZulu-Natal province more than 500 km away.\n\nAnother post here with a longer version of the video alleged the hospital was \u201csomewhere in Zimbabwe\u201d, but some users instantly rejected the claim in the comments.\n\nWhere was the video taken?\n\nThe clip shows a ward inside RK Khan Hospital, a large government-run facility in Durban. It is not one of the nine hospitals designated to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nNews of the invading primates first made headlines in February 2019. Local media published the video and news coverage prompted former Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi to set up a task team to find ways of keeping the intruders out.\n\nMonkeys are a common sight in Durban and regularly target homes in search of food.\n\nAFP has contacted the hospital for comment but is yet to receive a reply.\n\nAs of March 13, South Africa has had 24 people test positive for the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
