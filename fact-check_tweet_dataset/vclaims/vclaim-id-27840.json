One big selling point: jobs.\n\n\"Expanding Medicaid would bring 40,000 jobs to North Carolina,\" said House Minority Leader Darren Jackson, who represents part of Wake County, in a Jan. 30 tweet.\n\nPolitiFact North Carolina has checked claims about the added coverage Medicaid expansion would give to North Carolinians, but Jackson\u2019s statement is the first we\u2019ve considered that tries to link expansion to more jobs in the state. So we decided to see how it stacks up to the facts.\n\nNorth Carolina has participated in Medicaid, a program that provides health insurance to low-income people, since 1970.\n\nSince 2010, 36 states and the District of Columbia have used a provision in the federal Affordable Care Act to pay for expanded Medicaid coverage for people with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent health care research group.\n\nNorth Carolina has not expanded Medicaid, and the Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in 2013 that effectively prohibits expansion without the legislature's approval. But Democrats say there are economic reasons to expand the program.\n\nThe costs of Medicaid are split between the state and the federal government, with the federal government currently paying 67 percent. But the federal government has pledged to pick up the bulk of the expansion costs, including 95 percent now and 90 percent after 2020.\n\nWe talked to four experts about the economic impact, and they agreed that there would be a large gain in jobs. They said the reason is simple: An influx of new Medicaid money would lead to more spending across the state\u2019s economy.\n\nJackson said the $40,000 estimate came from a 2014 report by the Cone Health Foundation, a Greensboro-based 501(c)(3) organization that supports Cone Health, a nonprofit network of health-care providers in the area.\n\nThe Cone report said that if North Carolina did not accept expansion by 2016, the state would lose an estimated $21 billion in federal money between 2016 and 2020, resulting in 43,000 fewer jobs statewide.\n\nLeighton Ku, director of George Washington University\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research and the lead author of the Cone report, said that he has not updated his analysis since 2014.\n\nBut he said conditions are about the same now and the amount of federal money Medicaid expansion would bring \"ought to be roughly comparable to our earlier estimates.\"\n\n\"The evidence continues to indicate that Medicaid expansion would increase the flow of federal funding into North Carolina, which would improve economic growth and increase the number of jobs,\" Ku said. \"States that expanded Medicaid found that their economies were stronger; the lack of expansion in North Carolina has held the state back.\"\n\nOther experts agreed. David Anderson, research associate at Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said Medicaid expansion would \"turn on a new flow of federal funds into the state without changing the current outflow of funds.\" In other words, there would be lots more money coming in, but not going out.\n\nMichael Walden, professor of economics at North Carolina State University, said that money would turn into spending and jobs both in and outside the medical industry. According to the Cone report, only about half of the jobs would be in the medical industry, with the rest distributed among industries such as construction, retail, real estate and food and beverage.\n\nUsing an economic development model specific to North Carolina and assuming that Medicaid expansion would bring in $13 billion over the next decade, Walden estimated that the expansion would create about 39,000 jobs \u2014 a number similar to the Cone Health finding from 2014.\n\nStill, as PolitiFact Florida noted years ago, it can be difficult to determine to what extent new jobs are the direct result of one program or another. There are lots of moving parts, and expansion could inspire new Medicaid enrollees who are eligible but have not yet signed up to seek their own benefits, adding more costs to the state that could in turn affect job growth.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the Cone Health Foundation calls itself a \"supporting organization\" of Cone Health, which presumably would receive additional money from Medicaid expansion. So we should take its findings with a slight grain of salt, even though Anderson said the report used a \"well-established methodology and tools.\"\n\nJackson said, \"Expanding Medicaid would bring 40,000 jobs to North Carolina.\"\n\nIndeed, economists and health care experts say more money injected into North Carolina would lead to more jobs for its residents, although it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much.\n\nJackson\u2019s estimate fits in line with the available research, and experts we spoke to agreed it was reasonable. But it\u2019s still an estimate \u2014 a fact Jackson did not mention in his tweet.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
