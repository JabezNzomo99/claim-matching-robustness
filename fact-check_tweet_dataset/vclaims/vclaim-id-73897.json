Not Really\n\nBOOM did a keyword search on Google with the words 'man sleeping with cheetah' and found the longer version of the footage which was shared on YouTube by Dolph C Volker. It was uploaded in January last year. Volker has more than 4 lakh subscribers on the platform.\n\nThe description of the video reads, 'Do Cheetahs Prefer Cold Hard Concrete Or Warm Blankets Pillow & A Friend? | Three BIG CAT Night'. From the description of the video, we were able to ascertain that Volker is an animal advocate who spent nights with the cheetahs at a cheetah breeding center in South Africa, Cheetah Experience. In this particular video, Volker films and studies the behavioral changes of the animal when they get human warmth.\n\nVolker shares his experience in the YouTube description as, \"I was granted special permission to spend my nights with the three because I had watched them grow up and built up a relationship with them during past volunteering.\" He further writes, \"I think it is really cool these cheetahs trust and like me enough to share their most vulnerable time at night to snuggle, purr, and share their warmth and sleep with me.\"\n\nWe further looked for Volker on Twitter and found the video which was posted on the platform on the same day.\n\nVolker's Facebook page is called as 'The Cheetah Whisperer', and his about section describes him as an animal advocate with a Zoology degree and talks about his fascination of studying animal life and behaviour. It also mentions about his plans to establish a private cheetah breeding center in South Africa and hence he executed a number of 'cheetah experiences'.\n\nAdditionally, we found a News18 article from June 2020 on the video and how it has created a sensation on social media. The article also mentions about Indian Forest Service officer Parveen Kaswan's tweet confirming that the breath-taking clip was of animal rights advocate Dolph C. Volker from South Africa.\n\nAlso read: Video Of A Flying Billboard Injuring Bikers In Karachi Shared As Hyderabad", "lang": "en"}
