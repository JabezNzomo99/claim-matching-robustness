But Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said during the hearing that the shift will cost an estimated P120 billion in direct costs.

The report was originally posted on the news website on August 9. A report on the Senate hearing was also published on Rappler.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
