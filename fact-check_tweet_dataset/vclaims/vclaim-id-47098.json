So why are we so quick to demolish other statues and monuments around the world?\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cIf we wanted to demolish anything built by slaves around the world we wouldn\u2019t be left with many famous landmarks left [sic] \u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nThe post has been viewed over 35,000 times, been shared over 400 times and commented on over 150 times.\n\nThe death of US man George Floyd in police custody and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed have sparked anti-racism protests around the world including in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nStatues of historical figures associated with slavery became a focus of some protests. In the UK protesters tore down the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, who as the deputy head of the Royal African Company trafficked slaves from Africa to the UK.\n\nDuring a June 12 protest in Sydney police encircled a statue of Captain Cook over concerns protesters would attempt to topple it.\n\nThe targeting of memorials and historical statues has sparked debate, with some commentators and politicians arguing against it\n\nThe June 12 Facebook post sought to present Egypt\u2019s pyramids as an example of something \u201cbuilt by african slaves\u201d and question why they were not targeted.\n\nBut the pyramids were not built by slaves.\n\nErected 4500 years ago, the Pyramids of Giza are relics of Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom. The world-famous structures were erected as tombs for the pharaohs.\n\nHow the pyramids of Giza were built remains one of Egypt\u2019s biggest mysteries but Macquarie University Egyptologist Dr Karin Sowada told AAP FactCheck, that archaeological evidence shows the pyramids were not built by slaves.\n\nThat misconception began with the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus and later continued with Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who both claimed that slaves, Hebrew or otherwise, built the pyramids.\n\n\u201cHowever it has to be remembered that Herodotus was writing 2000 years after the pyramids were built,\u201d Dr Sowada said.\n\n\u201cAnd considering the biblical timeline there\u2019s no possible way, chronologically, that Hebrews were in Egypt when the pyramids were under construction.\u201d\n\nSlavery did exist at certain periods in Ancient Egyptian history and many slaves were likely foreign prisoners of war. Yet archaeological evidence shows that an Egyptian workforce built the pyramids, Dr Sowada said.\n\nOne key piece of evidence discovered in 2013 was a daily journal written by a man called Merer, an official responsible for transporting blocks from stone quarries to the pyramids.\n\n\u201cThe picture painted in the papyrus fragments is of a well-organised, well-provisioned team of about 40 men\u2026 who were not slaves but people well-skilled in their jobs,\u201d Dr Sowada said.\n\nAnother piece of evidence is the discovery of a workers\u2019 settlement at Giza, which showed the accommodations of an Egytpian workforce likely made up of a permanent cohort of elite workers such as stonemasons and labour teams.\n\nFarm labourers were drafted into the project during the yearly flooding of the Nile which inundated farmlands, with the work seen as a period of obligatory public service, not slavery, Dr Sowada said.\n\n\u201cThink of it as the population called in when there wasn\u2019t much work around to help with a large nation-building project \u2013 almost an ancient \u2018work for the dole\u2019 arrangement, except wages were paid in food and lodging,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
