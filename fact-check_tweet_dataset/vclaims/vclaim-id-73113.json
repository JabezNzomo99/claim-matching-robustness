Marchers that day were met and beaten by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as \"Bloody Sunday. \"\n\nIn her comments, Clinton said this:\n\n\"I was the first person who ran for president without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. I\u2019ll tell you, it makes a really big difference. And it doesn\u2019t just make a difference in Alabama and Georgia. It made a difference in Wisconsin, where the best studies that have been done said somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin, because of their age, because of whatever excuse could be made up to stop a fellow American citizen from voting.\"\n\nThe number is vital, since Trump defeated Clinton by 22,748 votes. She also narrowly lost Michigan and Pennsylvania -- and with those states, the presidency.\n\nDo studies show \"somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin\" and other factors?\n\nAnd was the lack of Voting Rights Act protections to blame?\n\nOUR PROCESS: Read how PolitiFact checks everyone.\n\nWe have looked at similar claims in the past -- including one from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and one from Clinton herself.\n\nBaldwin stated turnout in Wisconsin \"was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of\" a new photo ID requirement.\n\nClinton later claimed \"the best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nWe rated both Mostly False.\n\nAnd, though Clinton\u2019s new claim is different, those items provide a good starting point.\n\nThe 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law was fully in effect.\n\nIn making her claim, Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nComparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin.\n\nHad Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin\u2019s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent.\n\nIndependent experts told us the methodology in the study was lacking.\n\nIn a nutshell: The photo ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there were many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump -- or even a belief that Trump couldn\u2019t win Wisconsin.\n\nIn one of our earlier items, we cited the perspective of Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.\n\n\"Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,\" he told us at the time. \"It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement.\"\n\nIn making her new claim, Clinton attributed what happened in Wisconsin to the fact that the Voting Rights Act was no longer in effect. That refers to a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down Section 4 of the Act.\n\nThe problem: Wisconsin was never one of the states covered by that section.\n\nAs our friends at the Washington Post\u2019s Fact-checker noted in their analysis of Clinton\u2019s remarks:\n\nWisconsin was not one of the states covered by Section 4 when the court ruled in 2013, so, right off the bat, Clinton\u2019s claim that this \"made a difference in Wisconsin\" is unfounded. Georgia was covered by Section 4, but Clinton\u2019s claim that total voter registration declined in that state from 2012 to 2016 is false; it increased.\n\nWe could not reach Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill for our fact-check, but he offered several studies and other arguments to the Post.\n\nChief among them: A 2017 study led by Ken Mayer, a political scientist at the UW-Madison. That study involved a survey of 293 registered voters who didn\u2019t vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in the 2016 election.\n\nThe study focuses on those where were \"deterred\" from voting, which it defined as meaning the voters \"lack qualifying ID or mention ID as a reason for not voting. Voter ID could be a nominal reason or the primary reason for not voting.\"\n\nWe should note that Mayer told the Post that 14,000 is \"the equivalent of the most likely number\" of those deterred by the voter ID law.\n\nIn any case, \"deterred\" is different than \"prevented\" or -- as Clinton phrased it -- \"turned away.\"\n\nThe study put a much smaller group in its stricter \"prevented\" category. It also warned against extrapolating the results from Milwaukee and Dane counties to the state as a whole. Yet that is just what Clinton did.\n\nSo Clinton has problems on the low end of the range (40,000).\n\nWhere does her high end number (80,000) come from?\n\nMerrill, the Clinton spokesman, told the Post it was based on the same Priorities USA study that was the basis for her earlier 200,000 estimate (the one we rated Mostly False). Merrill told the Post the 80,000 was a \"conservative estimate well within the range of the two studies.\"\n\nThe Post gave Clinton a \"Four Pinnochio\" rating for its review of her comments.\n\nIn a speech, Clinton said because a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in effect, \"somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in Wisconsin) because of the color of their skin\" and other factors.\n\nShe is wrong about the impact of the Voting Rights Act not being in effect. The provision in question never applied to Wisconsin.\n\nShe also has problems with the numbers on both ends of her range.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the claim -- and others like it -- put all of the blame for people not voting on the state\u2019s photo ID law. That ignores other factors, such as a lack of enthusiasm from voters, or the belief -- one apparently shared by candidate Clinton -- that the state was a safe one for her in 2016.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
