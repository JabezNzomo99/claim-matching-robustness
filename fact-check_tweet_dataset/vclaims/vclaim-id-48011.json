This is false; MTN Nigeria told AFP the company is not running any such promotion, asking Facebook users to disregard the fake Facebook pages.\n\nA Facebook post, on a page named \u201cMTN Promo\u201d has been shared over 208,000 times since it was published about a month ago. We\u2019ve archived the post here. The page shares a screenshot of what looks like a service message from MTN, with the caption: \u201cMTN is giving out 122GB data to Customers for free. All you have to do to qualify is type MTN AWOOF AND SEND US A MESSAGE.\u201d\n\nA similar Facebook page, with the name \u201cMTN Data Promo\u201d, also claims to be giving out 50,000 iPhone XR handsets. The page shared a picture of the yellow version of the iPhoneXR with a caption reading: \u201cWe have more than 50k of MTN customized iPhone in stock to give out. All you have to do to win this phone is to type \u2018MTN IPHONE\u2019 without interrupted then use the \u2018SEND MESSAGE\u2019 button to chat us.\u201d The post, archive here, has been shared over 8,000 times since it was posted on September 28, 2019.\n\nMany more such pages exist on Facebook. We archived some of them here, here, and here.\n\nWe contacted MTN Nigeria to verify the \u201cMTN Promo\u201d page, and we were told the page is not being run by the company.\n\nFunso Aina, MTN Nigeria spokesman, told AFP via mail that the firm advertises and communicates \u201congoing campaigns and activations\u201d via its website and social media channels.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that the FB account does not belong to MTN and we are presently not running a promo like the one you have described,\u201d Aina said.\n\nHere is MTN Nigeria\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nThis sort of scam is common in Nigeria. It is used to attract followers to a new Facebook page and for gathering the names, phone numbers and other personal details of unsuspecting Facebook users, AFP found in August.\n\nThe pages ask that you send a message to retrieve your gift. So we sent them a message, and got an automatic response, saying: \u201cCongratulations Oluwamayowa Tijani, you have successfully applied for MTN Data Promo.
