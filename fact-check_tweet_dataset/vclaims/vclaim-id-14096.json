U.S. Customs and Border Protection has no record of the alleged incident, and the website that first reported it has retracted the story.\n\n\n\nOnce fiction has been presented as fact, it\u2019s hard to take back. Misinformation takes on a life of its own.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened with an unverified claim that was posted last year and, even though it was retracted, is now circulating on Facebook as though it\u2019s true.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: On Nov. 6, 2018, a website called TheBlaze, founded by conservative commentator Glenn Beck, posted a story about a group of women who went to the border between Texas and Mexico \u201cto get a first-hand look at the border and to witness for themselves the effects of illegal immigration on families who live there.\u201d The story quoted one of the organizers of the trip, Kimberly Fletcher, talking about a young girl who had been repeatedly raped.\n\nTheBlaze, Nov. 6, 2018: A few months ago, border security agents found a 6-year-old girl who had been left for dead along a pipeline. The girl was flown to a military hospital where physicians found DNA from 30 men inside her young body. \u201cShe had been raped by 30 men!\u201d Fletcher said, adding that this little girl\u2019s life is worth building a wall to keep violent men from coming into the country.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that happened. Roger Maier, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to FactCheck.org that CBP has no record of such an incident.\n\nFletcher, reached by phone, told us that she had heard the story from someone else and, after looking into the claim and thinking more about it, doesn\u2019t actually believe it to be true. Fletcher regrets having repeated the claim before looking into it, she said, since the story could cast doubt on real tragedies that are happening at the border.\n\n\u201cI should have checked into it,\u201d she said. \u201cDid it really happen? Is there any evidence that it happened?\u201d\n\nFletcher concluded, \u201cI cannot believe that if it did happen, that it wouldn\u2019t have been reported everywhere.\u201d\n\nAfter posting the quote, TheBlaze corrected its story and removed the claim. It now has this editor\u2019s note at the top of the story:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The original version of this story reported a claim made by Moms For America President Kimberly Fletcher concerning a girl who had allegedly been found by border security agents with \u201cDNA from 30 men inside her young body.\u201d This claim has been made by numerous individuals on social media but TheBlaze has been unable to independently verify the factual accuracy of the claim. Its publication does not meed [sic] our editorial standards and it has accordingly been removed, along with an embedded video in this story that made the claim. We regret having published it.\n\nHowever, the claim was still picked up and repeated by a notoriously unreliable website called NewsPunch in a story posted on Dec. 2, 2018.\n\nAlthough that site has now deleted the story, a screenshot of a tweet that promoted the NewsPunch headline has now started circulating on Facebook, where it is prompting angry comments from people who believe it\u2019s true.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.
