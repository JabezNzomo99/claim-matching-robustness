In fact, the study only tested the chemical\u2019s ability to kill this bacterium in Petri dishes.\n\n Imprecise: To state that garlic was 100-times more \u201ceffective\u201d leads the reader to believe that garlic killed bacteria 100-times faster or killed 100-times more bacteria than antibiotics. In reality, \u201c100-times\u201d refers only to the concentration of the garlic chemical tested compared with the concentration of antibiotics.\n\n Overstates the scientific impact of a finding: The study the claim refers to did not use garlic as the title of the article suggests. Rather, it used 98 percent pure diallyl sulfide, a chemical with antimicrobial properties found in garlic. Diallyl sulfide, a chemical found in garlic and other Allium plant species, eliminated the cells of a bacterium known to cause foodborne illness hours faster than two common antibiotics, despite its concentration being more than 100 times lower than the concentrations of the antibiotics. However, these tests were only performed in vitro, so more research would be needed before concluding that the chemical could be applied clinically.\n\n\n\n The article making this claim was published in 2014, but it went viral in December 2019, receiving more than 41,000 interactions on Facebook to date. It states, \u201cGarlic Proven 100 Times More Effective Than Antibiotics,\u201d referring to a study published in 2012 by researchers from Washington State University[1].\n\nIn the study, researchers compared the effectiveness of two common antibiotics and a chemical found in some species of Allium plants, like garlic and onions, to kill the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni in an environmental setting[1]. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. jejuni is a foodborne pathogen that can cause infection when ingested and is the most common bacterial cause of diarrheal illness in the United States.\n\nThe chemical, diallyl sulfide, eliminated two strains of C. jejuni cells grown in Petri dishes faster than either of the antibiotics, but to claim it was 100 times more effective misrepresents the findings. Rather, at a concentration more than 100 times lower than the concentrations of antibiotics, diallyl sulfide eliminated C. jejuni cells hours faster than either antibiotic, especially when the cells were protected by a biofilm. The study did not investigate whether diallyl sulfide could be used in a clinical setting to prevent or treat infection.\n\n\u201cThis work\u2026shows that this compound has the potential to reduce disease-causing bacteria in the environment and in our food supply,\u201d said Xiaonan Lu, lead author of the paper, in a press release from the author\u2019s institution.\n\nThe antibiotics tested, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, are commonly used to treat C. jejuni. However, this bacterium is known to produce a biofilm, a thick protective layer surrounding groups of cells which prevents antibiotics from reaching and killing the cells[2]. This antibiotic resistance has led researchers to investigate alternative treatments, like the chemicals found in Allium plant species, including garlic.\n\nSince the 2012 study, several others have investigated how chemicals found in garlic affect bacteria. In vitro tests have garnered similar results: for example, allicin, the precursor to diallyl sulfide, was shown to be effective against Campylobacter strains[3], including C. jejuni, and biofilms[4]. As chickens are a major source of Campylobacter infection in the developed world[2], there is also interest in using garlic extracts to prevent avian Campylobacter colonization. However, a study examining the effect of allicin in the drinking water of chickens did not show an effect on the formation of C. jejuni bacteria in their intestines[5]. This indicates that more research is needed before the chemical can be applied clinically.\n\nThe article also makes several other claims about garlic that are unrelated to the study\u2019s findings, including that it \u201cis one of the reasons people who eat the Mediterranean diet live such long healthy lives,\u201d that \u201cgarlic increases the overall antioxidant levels of the body,\u201d that it is able \u201cto fight off viruses,\u201d and that \u201cfrom the Middle Ages on, garlic has been used to treat wounds\u2026 to inhibit the spread of infection.\u201d\n\nSuch claims are not fully supported by the scientific literature. First of all, while studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet does increase longevity[6], these studies do not point to garlic as the causal reason. Second, while many studies have shown that certain substances in garlic have antioxidant properties[7,8], most of this work has been performed in cell cultures and animal models, and such properties have yet to be validated in humans. Third, the few studies investigating whether garlic has antiviral properties have been inconclusive[9]. And finally, while garlic extracts have historically been used to treat wounds, only a few studies have investigated their effectiveness[10].\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Lu et al.
