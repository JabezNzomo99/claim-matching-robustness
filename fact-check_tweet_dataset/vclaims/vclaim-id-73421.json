The basis for these claims was a message in the website\u2019s source code that reads: \u201cWelcome to Your New Site Mr. Shapiro Check for your welcome email at bshapiro@dailywire.com.\u201d\n\nThat exact message was, in fact, hidden in the source code of the website. However, it was planted there by a leftist troll named Adam Rahuba, who took credit for the prank shortly after it started going viral:\n\nThe website asked those who are interested in joining to give information such as name, email address, city, and phone number to register as members of Antifa. After it went viral, Rahuba altered the website to link to another tweet in which he took credit for the website:\n\nShapiro, on the other hand, suggested another website which prospective-Antifa members could submit their personal information:", "lang": "en"}
