Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of the largest Blue Whale ever caught on camera. Fact: The image is not a real one. It is digitally created by bringing two different photos together to make it appear like a gigantic blue whale swimming under a suspension bridge. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. While going through those search results, \u2018Reddit\u2019 had the same image but with the watermark of an Instagram account \u2018umutrecberart\u2019. When searched for that account, it was found to be that of a \u2018digital artist\u2019. The account had the image in the post and it was written that the image is digitally created by bringing two different photos together using the \u2018Photoshop\u2019 tool.\n\n\n\nIn another Instagram post, the artist has also put the two photos which were used in the creation of that image. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, a digitally created image is being shared as an image of the largest Blue Whale ever caught on camera.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
