It purportedly shows the Columbia University student ID of Barry Soetoro listed as a \u201cforeign student.\u201d\n\nObama, who was born in Hawaii, used the last name Soetoro, the surname of his stepfather, as a boy in Indonesia but later stopped using it, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet, \u2018Ask Ukraine If They Found My Birth Certificate\u2019?)\n\nHe transferred from Occidental College after two years in 1981 to Columbia University, where there is no record of Obama ever going by Soetoro. In fact, an essay Obama published in the university\u2019s weekly Sundial magazine has the byline \u201cBarack Obama.\u201d\n\nThe student ID card, Snopes reported, actually belongs to a former Columbia student named Thomas Lugert, whose ID number matches that in the post. It was digitally altered to have a photo of Obama and to replace the word \u201cstudent\u201d with the words \u201cforeign student\u201d after being posted online in 1998.\n\nAccording to the Columbia University Record, the school didn\u2019t start using digital ID cards like the one in the post until 1996. Their implementation took place after Obama graduated.\n\nA Chicago Tribune photographer took the photo of Obama featured in the doctored student ID in 1999 while he was an Illinois state senator, according to its caption.", "lang": "en"}
