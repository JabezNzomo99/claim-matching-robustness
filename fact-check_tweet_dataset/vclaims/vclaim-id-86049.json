Cotton, who is in a tight race against incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor (D), has come under fire in the state for being the only Arkansas lawmaker, Republican or Democrat, to vote against the final version of farm bill. So he explained his vote as a matter of principle, blaming President Obama for \u201chijacking\u201d it and turning it \u201cinto a food stamp bill, with billions more in spending.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the explanation offered by Cotton spokesman David Ray: The House of Representatives passed two bills \u2013a farm-only farm bill and a food stamp-only bill, both of which Cotton supported. But then he said that Obama threatened to veto the food stamp bill unless it was \u201cloaded up with food stamps.\u201d Not only that, but Ray said that the level of food stamps has exploded under Obama.\n\nThere is just one problem with this story. Food stamps (now formally called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) have been part of the farm bill for decades. It is a perfect marriage of convenience between urban lawmakers (who cared about the food stamps) and rural lawmakers (who cared about the farm bill), who working together could ensure that the benefits important to their constituents were regularly enacted into law.\n\nThe practice actually can be linked to the Great Depression, when legislation in 1935 gave Agriculture Secretary Henry Wallace broad authority to use tariff funds to support American farmers\u2013and he bought crops to distribute to poor people. In the current era, food stamps has been paired with every farm bill since 1973, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nIndeed, it was such a tradition that Obama did not really have to threaten a veto, as the Democratic-controlled Senate made it clear it would not accept separating food stamps from farm programs. That\u2019s why the House ultimately accepted and passed a combined bill earlier this year.\n\nLook at the dictionary definition of hijacking: \u201cto steal or rob\u2026to subject to extortion or swindling.\u201d Is that what Obama did when he said that Congress should continue to do what it did in the past? Or was breaking up the farm bill the more radical step?\n\nThe most problematic aspect of Cotton\u2019s ad is that he suggests that attaching food stamps to the farm bill was a new idea\u2014something that he was fighting against. But that\u2019s invented history. As we have shown, this \u201cbad idea\u201d has been in place since before Cotton, 37, was born.\n\nCotton\u2019s ad highlights the fact that food stamp spending in the bill amounted to $740 billion over 10 years. But the final farm bill contained a relatively modest $8 billion cut (over 10 years) in food stamps\u2014though that was less than the $39 billion reduction contained in the first bill passed by the House.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the increase in food stamp spending started in part because of changes in the food stamp program under President George W. Bush, when Congress overrode his veto of the 2008 farm bill. That law boosted the purchasing power of food stamps by indexing key elements to inflation.\n\nCotton would be on more solid ground if he had looked into the camera and said that, despite a tradition of merging food stamps in the farm bill, he was tired of the politics as usual and took a firm stand against the longstanding practice. Instead, he uses President Obama as a straw man, suggesting the president purposely pushed Congress in a different direction.", "lang": "en"}
