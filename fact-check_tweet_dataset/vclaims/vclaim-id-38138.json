Mattel\u2019s most recent line does not include a Barbie doll that wears a hijab.\n\nFeatured in the photo is what appears to be a Barbie doll wearing a pale blue headscarf. The Facebook post includes a link to a Feb. 16 article alleging that Mattel modeled the pictured doll after Olympic medal winning fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad.\n\n\u201cMattel just released a new Barbie and some people are simply furious,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cTake a look and decide for yourself if it\u2019s worthy of the controversy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the pictured doll is not the Barbie modeled after Muhammad, nor is it in the company\u2019s latest product release.

Nigerian medical student Haneefa Adam created the account several years ago and shared photos of Barbies dressed in hijabs and other clothing that she made herself, according to CNN. The account hasn\u2019t been active since 2017.\n\nUnveiled in January 2020, the newest Barbie product line features dolls that have vitiligo, prosthetic legs and bald heads, as well as new skin tones and body types. A review of that product line turned up no dolls wearing hijabs.\n\nMattel started selling its only hijab-wearing Barbie \u2013 modeled after Muhammad \u2013 in 2018, according to The Associated Press. It was part of the \u201cShero\u201d line that also included dolls of pilot Amelia Earhart, artist Frida Kahlo and mathematician Katherine Johnson.", "lang": "en"}
