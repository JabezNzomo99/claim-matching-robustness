He turned his view of interference in the U.S. election to disputes over Russian state media \u2013 RT and Sputnik. Polygraph has fact checked many similar comments by the president.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 15, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3361", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/newsc-putin-ukraine-election-media/28918925.html", "vclaim": "In his end of year news conference, President Vladimir Putin made claims about Ukraine, Crimea, the Russian state media as well as series of domestic issues \u2013 many of which Polygraph.info, Factograph.info and other news media have fact checked and, in some instances, debunked.\n\nPresident Putin\u2019s assertion the Russian Army is not involved echoes years of Kremlin\u2019s denials of Russian involvement in the Donbas \u2013 despite evidence that \u201c\u2026is overwhelming and has been confirmed by numerous open-source investigations\u2026\u201d As the Polygraph.info fact check states: Key Ukraine separatists military and political leaders were Russian citizens. Foreign and domestic media documented the presence of Russian \u201cvolunteers\u201d fighting for the self-proclaimed republics. International intelligence organizations like Bellingcat published evidence of Russian military presence, including social media posts of Russian soldiers themselves.\n\nIn addition, the presence of Russian tanks in the area has been documented and claims that the weapons were captured from Ukrainian army supply depots have been debunked.\n\nOn the question of whether Russia annexed Crimea legally, Putin cites the 1954 handover of the Crimea to Ukraine, which he said was illegal.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say anything beyond this point. The people of Crimea determined their fate the way they did,\u201d said Putin, apparently referring to the March 2014 referendum that showed 97 percent of Crimeans voted for independence from the rest of Ukraine and to become a part of Russia.\n\nIn October 2016, Putin addressed the All-Russia People\u2019s Front party, speaking of \u201cactive and engaged people in Crimea\u201d who \u201ctook their future into their own hands and decided themselves how and where they want to live.\u201d\n\nThe UN labeled the Crimean vote invalid, in a resolution that cited the \u201cRussian troops and armoured vehicles\u201d that moved into Crimea the month before. Polygraph.info labeled President Putin\u2019s 2016 comments \u201cFalse,\u201d quoting NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasumssen as saying in 2014 that the annexation of Crimea was \u201ca referendum at gunpoint.\u201d\n\nTaking questions on U.S. politics at his marathon news conference, President Putin rejected allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cYou know this is all fabricated by the people who are in opposition to Trump to make his work illegitimate,\u201d said Putin. He went on to compare the political turmoil to the bilateral dispute over Russia\u2019s state-funded news services \u2013 RT and Sputnik.\n\nPutin characterized the Russian involvement in the U.S. media marketplace as \u201cminimal compared to what American global media is doing around the world and here in Russia. And that seems to be a threat,\u201d he said. In Russia, VOA and RFE/RL, U.S. government broadcasters, are banned from television and radio while RT is carried on many U.S. commercial cable TV systems and Sputnik operates openly -- including on a radio station in Washington, DC.\n\nIn November, RT and Sputnik registered as foreign agents, under U.S. government pressure to do so. The Executive Committee of Correspondents at the U.S. Capitol quickly revoked the credentials of the two broadcasters to cover Congress.\n\nIn a series of exhaustive fact checks of RT\u2019s foreign agent filing, Polygraph.info established the official direction to the broadcaster from Putin included \u201cpropagating and promoting the formulation of Russia\u2019s positive image globally\u201d and that the two broadcasters are part of a government-owned \u201cpyramid\u201d of entities.\n\nDuring a Congressional hearing in March, Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican, offered this assessment of RT\u2019s operations: \u201c[The] Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet-era Pravda.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Putin said the U.S. and Russian governments should quit quarreling.\n\n\u201cWe need to learn from it and move on and not attack each other like wild animals. We need to think about it and learn our lessons,\u201d he told reporters in Moscow.", "lang": "en"}
