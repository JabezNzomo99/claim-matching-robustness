You\u2019ll look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate, and you have to arrest people, and you have to try people, and they have to go to jail for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nTrump voiced support for the \u201cvery fine people\u201d he said were at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017. He recently tweeted in support of protesters in Michigan \u2014 some armed with rifles \u2014 who opposed the state\u2019s lockdown measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. \u201cThese are very good people, but they are angry,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president threw his support behind the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests in France, misleadingly tying them to one of his favorite targets, the Paris climate agreement, when they were actually about a gas tax hike and economic inequality. (Trump at one point falsely tweeted that French protesters were chanting, \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d)\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired, he\u2019s fired,\u2019 \u201d Trump said at a 2017 campaign rally in Alabama. \u201cYou have to stand proudly for the national anthem, or you shouldn\u2019t be playing, you shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country,\u201d he told a Fox News interviewer in 2018.\n\nTrump once asked his supporters to \u201cknock the crap out\u201d of protesters at a campaign rally and pledged to cover any legal fees. \u201cSo if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?\u201d he said on the day of the Iowa caucuses in 2016. \u201cSeriously. Okay? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise.\u201d (\u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up,\u201d Trump said about a different protester, who shouted \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d at a rally in 2015.)\n\nTrump once tweeted that the U.S. president should stay out of what was perhaps the biggest peaceful protest at the time. \u201cPresident Obama should stay out of the Hong Kong protests, we have enough problems in our own country!Can\u2019t even properly police White House,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2014 as pro-democracy demonstrations swelled in Hong Kong.\n\nBarring Iran, the Trump administration has given the cold shoulder to protesters in Africa and the Middle East, Foreign Policy magazine reported. Trump has been \u201cunambiguously siding with the region\u2019s autocratic rulers and leaving lower-level [U.S.] bureaucrats in his administration to deliver mild encouragement to the protesters,\u201d the magazine reported. \u201cAsked this fall to comment on Egypt\u2019s most violent crackdown on protesters since the Arab Spring, Trump offered unconditional support for the country\u2019s leader, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom he once described as \u2018my favorite dictator.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCritics say some of the Trump administration\u2019s moves limit the right to peaceful protest. The Transportation Department released a proposal last year to treat some pipeline protests as a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. (Several groups have mounted protests for years against natural gas pipeline projects, which Trump effusively supports.)\n\nBut with Trump, lo and behold, there\u2019s a record belying it. The president seems to show support for peaceful protesters only when their interests are aligned with his. Any others get a cold shoulder or fiery condemnation. Where he stands depends on where the protesters sit, thus earning the president an upside-down Pinocchio for his consistent flip-flopping on the merits of peaceful protests.", "lang": "en"}
