Among those taxes is the 2.3 percent medical-device tax, which has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Lawmakers have attributed all sorts of negative impacts to this law, and we\u2019ve fact-checked some of those claims in the past. A two-year moratorium of the tax, which took effect in 2013, started in December 2015.\n\nThe tax took effect January 2013. The effective tax rate is about 1.5 percent, because businesses can claim a deduction from their federal taxes. Repealing the tax would make little difference in federal revenues \u2014 reducing about $20 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. For context, the federal government is projected to collect $3.4 trillion in revenues in fiscal 2017.\n\nThe figures come from the Census Bureau\u2019s Annual Survey of Manufacturers, for the eight sub-sectors of the medical-technology industry that is affected by the tax. There are some manufacturers in the sub-sectors that are exempt from the tax.\n\n\u201cWe know companies told us their economic behavior would change in the wake of this tax, and even saw some of that before the tax went into effect. We\u2019re not saying the device tax was the lone cause of these losses, but rather the losses occurred during the same time, and their significance is too large to ignore,\u201d AdvaMed spokesman Greg Crist said.\n\nSome companies surveyed by industry groups did cite the tax as one of the factors that contributed to layoffs in their company. But there\u2019s no evidence that it was the sole factor or that the jobs were shipped overseas, as Brady suggests.\n\nIn a January 2015 survey, industry consulting firm Emergo Group found that more than half of 685 executives in medical-device companies in the United States did not make any significant business changes in 2014 in response to the tax. (AdvaMed has criticized the firm\u2019s methods, which allowed more than one response from one company.)\n\nEmergo has not done a more recent version of the survey, but a January 2017 report on the global medical-device market showed that there is confidence in the medical-device markets in the United States and Europe. Emergo spokesman Chris Schorre said the strong U.S. dollar, which began rising in 2014, probably has had more to do with the sluggish growth among U.S. medical-device companies than the tax itself.\n\nHealth-care costs have grown more slowly after Obamacare, especially for people who could least afford it. So what does Brady mean that \u201chealth-insurance taxes and others\u201d drove up health-care costs for Americans? A spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee said Brady was talking about overall costs associated with the law, including out-of-pocket costs, fees, taxes, premiums and other mandates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about all of Obamacare, not just one tax. Our legislation repeals the taxes and mandates (on employers, individuals, providers, etc.) that have affected costs for consumers,\u201d the spokeswoman said. She also pointed to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 2016 calculations that the health-insurer tax, for example, will increase premiums for affected plans by between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.\n\nBrady attributes job losses in the medical-device industry directly to the medical-device tax enacted under Obamacare. But there is little evidence that the roughly 29,000 jobs in eight sub-sectors affected by the tax directly resulted from the tax. The tax itself is minimal \u2014 the effective rate is 1.5 percent \u2014 and has been on hold since December 2015.\n\nThe census data that Brady cites showed that jobs in the eight sub-sectors began declining since calendar year 2011, before the medical-device tax went into effect in January 2013. And then in 2015, there was a slight increase over 2014 in the number of jobs, even though the tax was in effect all of 2015. This suggests there were other factors at play in addition to the tax, which was enacted in 2013 and placed on hold at the end of 2015.", "lang": "en"}
