The image and claim come from a satire article published by the Babylon Bee.\n\nIn the image, an alleged Barnes & Noble sign reads, \u201cWe will no longer be selling the Bible due to outdated depictions of humanity all being of one race and made in the image of God. Thank you for your understanding.\u201d\n\nHad the bookstore chain made such an announcement, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The company has not issued a press release to that effect, and a Morgantown, West Virginia, location debunked the claim in a Facebook post on June 14.\n\n\u201cThat is simply not true,\u201d reads the store\u2019s post. \u201cFor our store specifically, Bibles are a top seller. As a company, Barnes & Noble does not discriminate or censor. Rest assured, we will be keeping the Bibles and other books in that section.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018Book of Yeezus\u2019 \u2013 Did Kanye West Publish A Bible That Replaces \u2018God\u2019 With His Name?)\n\nThe Facebook post from the Barnes & Noble store also said that the claim originated with the Babylon Bee, a website that publishes satire about \u201cChristian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life,\u201d according to its \u201cAbout Us\u201d page.\n\nBoth the claim and the image can indeed be found on the Babylon Bee\u2019s website. The image can be seen in an archived version of a June 12 article that appears to have since been updated to show a sign with a different bookstore name. Snopes reported that the image being shared on Facebook was created by superimposing the fake sign over a cropped Shutterstock picture of a Barnes & Noble store in Chicago.\n\nBibles are still available for purchase on Barnes & Noble\u2019s website.", "lang": "en"}
