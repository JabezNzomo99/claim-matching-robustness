He is also head of the State Duma Committee on Eurasian Integration.\n\n\u201cWe should not be shy, we should offer tough resistance,\u201d RT quotes the politician as saying,\u201cresistance not even to such statements, but rather the danger of our country being split up that arises after them.\u201d\n\nIn reality, there has been no NATO proposal to invade or break up Russia. Instead there was just a tweet by a member of the Latvian parliament, Aleksandrs Kir\u0161teins, who belongs to a party that is described as right-wing and nationalist, but clearly in the country\u2019s minority. While the RT article mentions the tweet, the Russian state publication did not embed or link to it.\n\n\u201cOnly when Russia splits into smaller countries, in line with ethnic composition, will military conflicts end, and a lasting period of peace will exist in Europe,\u201d the tweet reads in Latvian.\n\nKir\u0161teins is a member of a minority Latvian political party, the National Alliance of Latvia, nationalist and anti-immigration and only a small part of the country\u2019s ruling coalition.The party holds several seats in the Saeima, the Latvian Parliament. Kir\u0161teins, a member of the Saeima, seems to have no connection to NATO.\n\n\u200bA July 30, 2018 aggregate of polls in Latvia by a non-profit project based in Vienna puts the National Alliance\u2019s support from the country\u2019s electorate at 11%. While his tweet suggests a split of Russia along ethnic lines, even Kir\u0161teins does not suggest Russia be divided by military force.\n\nAnd NATO has made it clear in the past that while it condemns Russia\u2019s aggressive actions toward Ukraine beginning in 2014, it still seeks to maintain dialogue and stability with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia,\u201d an official statement from the NATO summit in Warsaw in 2016 reads.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest. NATO will continue to be transparent, predictable and resolute,\u201d the communique continued.\n\nNATO has also post a page it says corrects myths about its relationship with Russia, pointing out that the alliance has extended invitations for cooperation to Russia that have never been offered to any other non-NATO member.\n\nEven though Kir\u0161teins\u2019 tweet suggests an unrealistic division of Russia, even he does not propose that any division of Russia should be carried out by military action of NATO or any outside force. In general, his tweet appears to be his own opinion and cannot seriously be called a \u201cproposal,\u201d and certainly not one being considered by NATO.", "lang": "en"}
