This claim is false.\n\nExamples of such posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nAs stated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \u201cimmunization is financed through private health insurance, public safety net programs, and patient out-of-pocket spending\u201d ( here ). Private insurance covers 52% of children aged 5 and under for immunizations, while public programs (like Medicaid) cover around 34%. The remaining 14% of children are underinsured and automatically covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe CDC describes VFC as a \u201cfederally funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay\u201d ( here ). As explained here in \u201cFinancing Vaccines in the 21st Century: Assuring Access and Availability,\u201d published by the National Academies Press ( www.nap.edu/ ), the CDC allocates each state a credit balance based on estimated need, which the state uses to order vaccine supplies at a discounted price from the manufacturer. The state then either stores the vaccines \u201cfor distribution to registered providers\u201d or works \u201cwith the manufacturer to deliver the vaccine directly to providers.\u201d\n\nThe claim that children whose families receive Medicaid or do not have insurance receive different vaccines than those covered by private insurance is false. A CDC spokesperson told Reuters via email that while \u201cproviders have to keep the vaccines separate for auditing and accountability purposes,\u201d there is \u201cnot a different vaccine for the VFC program.\u201d The spokesperson added that VFC \u201cpurchases half of all vaccines given to people under age 18 in the country, and they purchase the same vaccines from the same manufacturers as everyone else.\u201d\n\nReuters also received comment via email from Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases ( here ), who said that vaccines covered by VFC and Medicaid \u201care the same vaccines from the same manufacturers as private stock vaccines.\u201d He explained that the \u201cCDC negotiates with contractors for discounted purchase price and then distributes them to individual states. Same formulations.\u201d\n\nFalse. Children covered by Medicaid or the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children program do not receive different vaccines from children whose families are privately insured.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
