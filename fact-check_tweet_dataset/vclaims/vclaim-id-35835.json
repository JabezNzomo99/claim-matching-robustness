Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: In Delhi Elections, the vote shares of AAP and BJP are 47.8% and 46.7% respectively. Fact: In Delhi Elections, BJP got only 38.5 per cent votes. The coalition of BJP, JD(U) and LJP got around 40 per cent votes. AAP got 53.57 per cent votes. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe vote shares of the political parties can be found on the Election Commission of India\u2019s website. Based on the information on the website, it was found that BJP got only 38.5 percent votes. In the Delhi Elections, BJP had a coalition with JD(U) and LJD. While BJP contested in 67 seats, in the remaining three seats, JD(U) contested in two seats and LJP contested in one seat. The coalition of BJP, JD(U) and LJP got around 40 percent votes. But, AAP alone has got 53.57 percent votes. Congress got 4.26 votes and the Left parties got less than 1 percent votes.\n\nAlso, on Facebook, it can be found that some users have posted, on the election day, a photo (archived) of a poll conducted on social media. The poll has got similar vote shares as claimed in the post. So, the vote shares claimed in the post might have been taken from this social media poll. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, there is no truth in the claim that AAP got 47.8 percent votes and BJP got 46.7 percent votes in the 2020 Delhi Elections. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
