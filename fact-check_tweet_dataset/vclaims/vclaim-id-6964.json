But an email from Rizzo disclosed by Senate investigators indicates the Levin proposal played a role: \u201cSen. Levin\u2019s legislative proposal for a 9/11-type outside Commission to be established on detainees seems to be gaining some traction, which obviously would serve to surface the tapes\u2019 existence,\u201d Rizzo wrote to colleagues on Oct. 31. \u201cI think I need to be the skunk at the party again and see if the Director is willing to let us try one more time to get the right people downtown on board with the notion of our destroying the tapes.\u201d\n\nThe facility in Thailand was sent a cable on Nov. 4 essentially explaining it should ask for the videotapes be destroyed, using \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d legal language provided by Rodriguez\u2019s office. A cable was sent back on Nov. 5, with the exact right language, and Rodriguez asked Haspel to draft the cable \u201capproving the action that we had been trying to accomplish for so long.\u201d He added: \u201cThe cable left nothing to chance. It even told them how to get rid of the tapes. They were to use an industrial-strength shredder to do the deed.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Rodriguez in his memoir does not indicate at all he had such a misunderstanding with his chief of staff. Indeed, in an interview with ProPublica published on May 9, he said he told her he would take matters into his own hands. He told her the agency was just going to kick the can down the road and together, he said, they worked out a plan to finally resolve the problem, which included asking the lawyers whether Rodriguez could order the destruction of the tapes.", "lang": "en"}
