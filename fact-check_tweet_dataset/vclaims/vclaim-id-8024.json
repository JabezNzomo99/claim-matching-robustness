Tom Cotton and David Perdue sought to discredit Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin\u2019s account of President Trump using profanity to disparage African countries at an immigration meeting in the Oval Office, saying Durbin has a \u201chistory\u201d of misrepresenting what was said at White House meetings.\n\nThey are referring to a 2013 Facebook post in which Durbin wrongly claimed a GOP leader had told then-President Barack Obama, \u201cI can\u2019t even stand to look at you.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more to that story than Cotton and Perdue presented, and there\u2019s a big difference between what happened then and now.\n\nDurbin was not in the 2013 White House meeting. Rather, he shared a secondhand report he received from White House staffers that turned out to be inaccurate. The White House press secretary at the time said the misquote resulted from a \u201cmiscommunication in the readout of that meeting between the White House and Senate Democrats.\u201d\n\nThis time, Durbin provided a firsthand account of what he heard at the Jan. 11 meeting. Durbin and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham were at the White House to discuss their bipartisan plan to save an Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Trump is phasing out. A day after the meeting, Durbin quoted Trump as saying of African nations, \u201c\u2018Those shitholes send us the people that they don\u2019t want.'\u201d In an interview with Charleston\u2019s Post and Courier, Republican Sen. Tim Scott said Graham told him that the media reports about Trump\u2019s language were \u201cbasically accurate.\u201d\n\nTrump initially issued a vague denial, tweeting on Jan. 12, \u201cThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,\u201d without explaining which remarks he denied making or what exactly he said at the meeting. On Jan. 15, the president tweeted that Durbin \u201ctotally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting.\u201d\n\nOn the Sunday talk shows on Jan. 14, Cotton and Perdue \u2014 who were among the attendees at the immigration meeting \u2013 also claimed that Durbin misrepresented what happened at the meeting. Both suggested that Durbin\u2019s version should not be believed because, they said, Durbin has a history of misrepresenting what had been said in White House meetings.\n\nHere\u2019s what Perdue said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d: \u201cIn 2013, Senator Durbin also made the same accusation against a Republican leader in a meeting with President Obama, and said that it was \u2013 he chewed out the president, it was so disrespectful to President Obama, we couldn\u2019t even have the meeting. That\u2019s what he said in 2013. Later that day, the president\u2019s own press secretary came out and said, and I quote, \u2018It did not happen.\u2019 This is about a gross misrepresentation. It\u2019s not the first time.\u201d\n\nAnd on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Cotton said, \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t hear what Senator Durbin has said repeatedly. Senator Durbin has a history of misrepresenting what happens in White House meetings, though, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by that.\u201d Cotton later repeated the accusation, saying, \u201cSenator Durbin has misrepresented what happened in White House meetings before, and he was corrected by Obama administration officials by it.\u201d\n\nThey are not telling the whole story. (We asked Cotton\u2019s office if there were other instances besides the 2013 example, but we did not get a response.)\n\nBack in 2013, Durbin posted on his Facebook page that during a meeting with Obama during a government shutdown, a \u201cGOP House Leader told the president: I can\u2019t even stand to look at you.\u201d Durbin later clarified that he was not at the meeting, but he said that\u2019s what he was told by a White House staffer who briefed him on the meeting.\n\nThree days after Durbin posted the comment on Facebook, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at a press briefing on Oct. 23, 2013, \u201cI looked into this and spoke with somebody who was in that meeting, and it did not happen.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t Carney\u2019s final word on the matter. At a press briefing the following day, Carney elaborated: \u201cLet me just say that yesterday I was simply saying that the quote attributed to a Republican lawmaker in the House GOP meeting with the president was not accurate. I wasn\u2019t accusing anybody of anything. And what I can tell you is that there was a miscommunication when the White House read out that meeting to Senate Democrats, and we regret the misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nCarney later added that \u201cthe quote attributed to the lawmakers was not accurate, but there was a miscommunication in the readout of that meeting between the White House and Senate Democrats, and we regret that.\u201d\n\nDurbin told reporters at the time that Carney had essentially admitted that the White House had \u201cmisled members of Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey [the White House] gave me a bad quote and then they said it didn\u2019t occur,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nAgain, Carney said there was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d that led to a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d At the time, Durbin said there was no misunderstanding on his part, and that when a \u201cstaffer in the White House\u201d relayed what was said at the meeting, he found the comments so \u201cearth-shattering\u201d that he wrote them down verbatim, the Associated Press reported.\n\nWhether there was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d or the White House staffer relayed incorrect information to Durbin, those circumstances are different from Durbin\u2019s firsthand account of what he says he heard Trump say last week.", "lang": "en"}
