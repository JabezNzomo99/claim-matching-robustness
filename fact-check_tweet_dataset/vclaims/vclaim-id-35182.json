The attacks were retaliation for the killing of six Turkish soldiers and three civilian contractors by Syrian regime shelling a day earlier.\n\nHowever, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had already claimed the strikes killed 30-35 regime soldiers. Moreover, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death count even lower, at 13.\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry denied that such strikes took place. The Russian state news agency TASS quoted a ministry statement that said, \"Turkish Air Force aircraft did not violate Syria\u2019s borders, no airstrikes on the positions of Syrian troops have been recorded.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 4, an independent Syrian journalist Harun Alaswad reported that a Turkish F-16 had crossed the border near Idlib, but did not mention any casualties. Syrian regime media also have not reported any deaths.\n\nIn sum, there is scant evidence from independent sources to support Turkey\u2019s claims that it hit over 50 targets in Syria in attacks that killed 76 regime soldiers.\n\nObservers typically track regime loyalist deaths based on social media posts from family members or community groups.\n\nTrent Schoenborn, of International Review, a volunteer analytical organization which has been tracking military losses in Syria, told Polygraph.info by email the claim of 76 Syrian regime troops killed is doubtful.\n\n\u201cOur observations over the last couple of days have given no indication that that many Syrian government personnel have been killed in action overall in Idlib province, much less by Turkish strikes,\u201d Schoenborn wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no information that we have seen to suggest that any of the casualties inflicted in this time period were caused by Turkish strikes or not, as most reports don't give specifics about the nature of the death.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schoenborn, 16 pro-government personnel were killed in Idlib province over Feb. 2-3, eight on each day. The Turkish attack and Defense Minister Akar\u2019s claim of 76 dead were reported on Feb. 3.\n\n\u201cWe are still getting data in from these two days so the full picture is not yet available, but the current observations suggest the numbers are nowhere near what the Turkish claim was,\u201d Schoenborn wrote.\n\nSince the incident, Erdogan has promised that Turkey will continue its military observation posts in Idlib, the Syrian opposition\u2019s last major holdout. The area has been designated a \u201cde-escalation zone\u201d per an agreement between Russia, the regime, Turkey, and some of the Syrian opposition.\n\nErdogan also said there is \u201cno need to be in collision with Russia\u201d and listed various strategic partnerships between the two countries, including the Turk Stream gas pipeline.\n\nRussian and regime airstrikes continue to hit civilians in the area around Idlib. On Feb. 5, Erdogan demanded that Syrian regime forces pull back from Idlib by the end of this month or face further action from Turkish forces. A day earlier, the U.S. State Department issued a statement in support of Turkey\u2019s intervention.", "lang": "en"}
