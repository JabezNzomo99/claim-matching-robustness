The claim is false; in response to the photo, the New South Wales health authority told AFP on February 6, 2020 there had been no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the cited suburb.\n\nThe image was published on Facebook here on January 30, 2020.\n\nIt shows a purported screenshot of a Snapchat story from an account called @livenews101, which shows a NSW Ambulance vehicle and two people, one dressed in a protective suit.\n\nThe text overlay in the image reads: \u201cHurstville - coronavirus is witnessed by neighbour\u201d and \u201cAny more send it in so we can keep everyone up to date\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads, in part: \u201cSince the post i shared got deleted imma go ahead and post it myself\u2026\n\n\u201cIts funny because if you google where the areas are that people have been confirmed to have the coronavirus, nothing comes up.
