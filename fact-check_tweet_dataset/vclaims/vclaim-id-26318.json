The future is stupid,\" reads the text above the photo.\n\nShared on Facebook more than 74,000 times since Aug. 11, the image garnered over 770 comments.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because the narrative being shared about what is happening in the photo isn\u2019t right. While the van in the photo is diesel-powered (not gas), it is towing a battery pack, not a diesel generator.\n\nA reverse-image search revealed that the yellow van comes from a roadside assistance company in Austria called OAMTC.\n\nThe company initially posted the photo on its Facebook page on May 29, 2019, with the caption:\n\n\"If the battery can't make it anymore, we'll bring you fresh juice! Our \u2018Mobile Power Bank\u2019 for e-cars has successfully completed its first test in practice. After about 20 minutes, the electric Mercedes had enough power to bring our member to the next charging station without any problems. We think this is pretty electrifying!\"\n\nOur attempts to reach someone with OAMTC went unanswered, but we\u2019re not the first to check this claim. An OAMTC member told fact-checkers at AFP that the photo was \"wrongly interpreted, this is not a portable generator, but a mobile power bank for electric cars.\" The power bank, AFP reported, is made of lithium battery packs that can provide electricity for an electric vehicle for about 12 kilometers (or about 7.5 miles).\n\nAFP found that the packs can charge from any energy source in OAMTC\u2019s shops, and according to the World Bank, 76% of Austria\u2019s electricity output came from renewable sources in 2015.\n\nAnd though the Facebook post says the van is gasoline-powered and towing a diesel generator (the lithium battery pack), it is actually the van that is diesel-powered, according to OAMTC officials.\n\nWhile diesel engines do create harmful emissions, they are generally considered more fuel efficient compared to their gasoline counterparts and emit less carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide than gasoline combustion.\n\nAn image shared on Facebook comes with the claim that a gas-powered van is towing a diesel-powered generator that is charging an electric car.\n\nThe only oil-based product in the photo is the van, which runs on diesel. In tow is a mobile lithium battery pack used to charge stranded electric vehicles.", "lang": "en"}
