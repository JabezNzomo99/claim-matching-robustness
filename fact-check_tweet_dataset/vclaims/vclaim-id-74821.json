But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. , former Alaska Gov. and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. .\n\nThe six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year.\n\nHere are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which are available:\n\nThat list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, it\u2019s treated as a county by the Census Bureau.\n\nWe looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.\n\nWe should make a statistical note here.\n\nMedian household income is the midrange point where half of the county\u2019s households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household.\n\nNot all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If you\u2019re wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in Wyoming.\n\nRephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesn\u2019t mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C.\n\nHuckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.\n\nJudged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a county\u2019s wealth -- his statement is correct.", "lang": "en"}
