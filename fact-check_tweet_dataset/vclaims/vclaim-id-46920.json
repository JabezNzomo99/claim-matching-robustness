But it was included in a viral post that displayed a collection of photographs supposedly from Australia\u2019s bushfires. We rated that post Mostly False after finding that many of the images are several years old and weren\u2019t even taken in Australia.\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA reverse-image search reveals the photo isn\u2019t from Australia, nor was it taken during the most recent fire season.\n\nThe photo was taken by photojournalist Jane Tyska on Nov. 11, 2018, in Paradise, Calif., following destruction from the Camp Fire. The Camp Fire started in Northern California in early November 2018, and burned over 150,000 acres, destroyed thousands of residences and killed more than 85 people.\n\nTyska\u2019s caption on the burned cat image reads, \"A burned cat waits for animal control to arrive after they were called by responders who discovered it near Bille Road in Paradise, Calif., on Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.\"\n\nThis is a real image, but it was taken in 2018 and is not from Australia. For that reason, we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
