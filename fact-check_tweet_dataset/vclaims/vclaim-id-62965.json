Chants of \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d can be heard in the background. It is being sarcastically claimed that this was how the PM was welcomed in Bengal.\n\nThe \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d slogan was coined by the Congress against Modi in its general election campaign last year.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is edited. Slogans of \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d have been superimposed in the video. In the original video, people can be heard chanting \u201cJai Shree Ram\u201d and calling Mamata \u201cdidi\u201d. The video was shot when Modi was emerging out of a review meeting on Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal\u2019s Basirhat on May 22.\n\nThe video is quite viral on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of Bangla keywords, we found the same video, posted by some Facebook users on May 22. In these videos, slogans of \u201cJai Shree Ram\u201d can be heard and not \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d. The caption says it is from Basirhat College.\n\nFacebook page \u201cBengal Times 24x7\u201d also went live on May 22 when Modi was leaving Basirhat College after a review meeting on Cyclone Amphan with state officials. This Facebook Live was also streamed from the same location where the viral video was made. In the Facebook Live too, slogans of \u201cJai Shree Ram\u201d can be heard, but not \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d.\n\nA journalist of Bengali news channel \u201cABP Ananda\u201d, Abdul Wahab, was present at Basirhat College on May 22. He too told us that people were raising \u201cJai Shree Ram\u201d slogans when they saw Modi. He didn\u2019t hear slogans of \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d.\n\nWe also reached out to the Superintendent of Police of Basirhat, Kankar Prasad Barui, regarding the video. Prasad confirmed to us that the viral video is fake and no such slogans were raised during Modi\u2019s visit.\n\nThe deadly Cyclone Amphan has claimed at least 72 lives in West Bengal and CM Mamta Banerjee said that the state suffered losses worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore. During his visit to West Bengal, PM Modi announced a rehabilitation package of Rs 1,000 crore for the state. He also said that Rs 2 lakh would be given to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to the injured.", "lang": "en"}
