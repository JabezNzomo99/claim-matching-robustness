The claim originated on a satire website.\n\nThe post alleges three states with Republican governors, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, have decided to take away CNN\u2019s broadcasting license, allegedly because it failed to be truthful.\n\n\u201cCNN is a known peddler of lies and deceit,\u201d Chad Benoit, the alleged Mississippi attorney general, is quoted as saying. \u201cWe can\u2019t have this kind of misinformation ruining the minds of our children here. We have a great education system here, and don\u2019t want to risk losing that to people buying into the fake news media.\u201d\n\nThe post goes on to claim a Mississippi Senator named Joe Barron called his state\u2019s removal of CNN\u2019s broadcasting license \u201cthe best thing for America.\u201d (RELATED: Did CNN Add Greta Thunberg To An Expert Panel About \u2018What It\u2019s Like Being Black In America\u2019?)\n\nBut none of the states appear to have revoked CNN\u2019s broadcasting license or announced plans to do so. Check Your Fact found no credible media reports about CNN being banned from airing in any U.S. state.\n\nIn a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) document, the FCC describes CNN as a \u201cnon-broadcast programming\u201d network, meaning the FCC does not license the network. Even if the network was licensed by the FCC, states would not have any authority to revoke the license, according to the FCC.\n\n\u201cCNN still works on all of our TVs,\u201d Christina Stephens, deputy chief of staff for communications and special Projects in the Louisiana governor\u2019s office, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\nThe supposed government officials quoted in the Facebook post don\u2019t appear to be real, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Lynn Fitch currently serves as Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, and Benoit does not appear in the National Association of Attorneys General\u2019s list of former Mississippi attorneys general. Barron is not a current Mississippi senator.\n\nThe claim appears to come from a satirical article. The post\u2019s text lifts nearly word-for-word from an article published by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that creates \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d A disclaimer on the website states: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post fails to convey the satirical origins of the claim, portraying the information as real, a common way misinformation spreads online.", "lang": "en"}
