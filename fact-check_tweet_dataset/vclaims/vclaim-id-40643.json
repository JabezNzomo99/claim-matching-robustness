In particular, readers asked us about a Dec. 23 meme published by the left-leaning \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d Facebook page.\n\nThe caption that accompanied the meme read: \u201cYes, Trump really DID say this last night \u2026\u201d The meme itself contained the introductory line \u201cFuture generations will look back on Trump\u2019s latest idiotic wind turbines rant in awe and horror,\u201d followed by what was presented as an extended quotation:\n\n\u201cI never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. But they\u2019re manufactured tremendous \u2014 if you\u2019re into this \u2014 tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint \u2014 fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it\u2019s in China, Germany, it\u2019s going into the air. It\u2019s our air, their air, everything \u2014 right?\u201d\n\nThe quotation included in the Occupy Democrats meme was a highly, though not perfectly, accurate presentation of real remarks made by Trump during a Dec. 21 speech at a conference held by the right-leaning youth organization Turning Point USA.\n\nAppearing before a highly partisan, strongly supportive audience, Trump riffed on various familiar topics, attacking and ridiculing Democrats and boosting his own administration\u2019s record, often using hyperbolic language and eliciting laughter and cheers from the crowd. At times, the remarks appeared more like a stand-up comedy routine than an official speech.\n\nAround 30 minutes in, Trump ridiculed the Green New Deal, riffed on the subject of wind power, and attacked wind turbines. The following is a transcript of the most relevant section from his speech, which can also be watched in the official White House video below.\n\n\u2026We\u2019ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I\u2019ve studied it [sic] better than anybody I know. It\u2019s [sic] very expensive. They\u2019re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none. But they\u2019re manufactured \u2014 tremendous, if you\u2019re into this, tremendous fumes, gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So [a] tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything \u2014 you talk about the \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d \u2014 fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it\u2019s in China, Germany, it\u2019s going into the air. It\u2019s our air, their air, everything, right? So they make these things, and then they put them up, and if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters, your house is worth 50 percent of the price. They\u2019re noisy, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go, take a look, a bird graveyard? Go under a windmill some day. You\u2019ll see more birds than you\u2019ve ever seen ever in your life \u2026\n\nThe remarks included in the meme are shown in boldface above. Occupy Democrats did not misquote Trump and quoted word-for-word from his actual remarks, though the creators of the meme made slightly different punctuation choices to those we made.\n\nThey also left out a short section where Trump explained his purported knowledge of windmills: \u201cI\u2019ve studied it [sic] better than anybody I know. It\u2019s [sic] very expensive. They\u2019re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none.\u201d That gap should have been reflected in the quotation with the use of an ellipsis, but the omission did not distort the meaning or sense of what Trump said, and we therefore issue a rating of \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d\n\nAlthough his remarks were somewhat garbled at times, Trump appeared to have been making the point that the construction of wind turbines causes carbon emissions (\u201ctremendous fumes\u201d). For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s true that building and maintaining wind turbines does leave a carbon footprint, but analyses have shown that the overall negative environmental impact of wind power is far outstripped by that of the fossil fuel energy sources that wind power is intended to replace.", "lang": "en"}
