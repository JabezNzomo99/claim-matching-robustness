The child died after the hostage-taking.\n\nThe post included 3 photos of Paray: one with him being arrested, another with him at a child's wake or funeral, and one of him receiving a birthday cake.\n\nSince it was posted on Friday, March 6, it has gotten reactions more than 151,000 times, was commented on more than 23,000 times, and shared more than 80,000 times.\n\nThe page Outlawz Underground was created on May 14, 2019 and has 9,728 followers as of this posting. It describes itself as a personal blog, saying in its \"About\" section, \"this is just for fun.\"\n\nA Google reverse image search shows that the same claim was shared on March 6 by Facebook user Beeybi Maine and the pages YouTube Videos II, Philippines Flash Report, and Isko Moreno Supporters. Together, these have been shared more than 7,400 times.\n\nAfter setting his hostages free, he took a mic and spoke about his bosses' alleged unfair treatment of him and his fellow guards. Paray said a tenant had bribed one of them to have him reassigned.\n\nThis is not the first false claim that has spread about Paray. Rappler previously fact-checked a claim that Paray was found dead in his jail cell. No reliable news website has reported on Paray's death and the claim used a news report from 2018 about a different man who died in police custody.", "lang": "en"}
