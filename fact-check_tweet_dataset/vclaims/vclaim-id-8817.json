{"title": "Obama's 'Sealed' Records", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2012-07-31T14:49:43+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-8817", "url": "http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/obamas-sealed-records/", "vclaim": "A: No. Many records that presidential candidates don\u2019t ordinarily release do remain confidential, but they are not \u201csealed\u201d by a court. The 16 claims in a widely distributed graphic are mostly false or distorted.\n\n\u2026and they want 12 years of Romney\u2019s tax returns? THIS should be on billboards all over our nation! Forward this to others who are interested in re-claiming America and saving our future\n\nThis is an example of mostly old baloney in a new casing. It mainly recycles years-old falsehoods and insinuations, most of which we covered long ago, in connection with an earlier viral email.\n\nBut with President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign heating up, this new graphic has appeared on countless anti-Obama websites and in viral emails like the one we\u2019ve reprinted here. Very little that it contains is new, and the old falsehoods have not improved with age.\n\nThe idea that any Obama record is \u201csealed\u201d is a falsehood, to start. The word \u201csealed\u201d when applied to documents ordinarily refers to records that would normally be public, but that a judge has ruled cannot be released without the court\u2019s permission. Common examples of truly \u201csealed\u201d documents include records of crimes committed as a juvenile or records of adoptions. None of the claims in this message refers to records actually \u201csealed\u201d in that usual sense.\n\nIn some cases, the records this screed claims are \u201csealed\u201d are actually public, and open for anyone to see. Other supposedly \u201csealed\u201d records are normally private documents that Obama hasn\u2019t released \u2014 and that other presidential candidates haven\u2019t released either.\n\nSo as with earlier versions, this is little more than an attempt to raise suspicions by asking for records that aren\u2019t ordinarily made public, without any evidence that those records contain anything derogatory. We\u2019ll take the claims and questions in the order they appear.\n\u2022 None Claims #1, 2 and 4, college records. Obama\u2019s college records are not \u201csealed\u201d by a court order, as this graphic would have you believe. It would be illegal under federal law (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) for Occidental, Columbia or Harvard Law School to give any former student\u2019s records to reporters or members of the public without that person\u2019s specific, written permission. Obama hasn\u2019t released them, but neither have other presidential candidates released their college records. George W. Bush\u2019s grades at Yale eventually became public, but only because somebody leaked them to the New Yorker magazine. Bush himself refused to release them, according to a 1999 profile in the Washington Post.\n\u2022 Claim #3, thesis paper. Obama did write a paper on nuclear disarmament for an honors course in American foreign policy during his senior year, but it wasn\u2019t the sort of \u201cthesis\u201d that some colleges require for graduation and keep on file in their libraries, like those that Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama released. During the 2008 campaign, reporters were told that Columbia had not retained a copy of Obama\u2019s 1983 paper, and that Obama didn\u2019t have a copy, either. NBC News contacted his former professor, Michael Baron, who said he looked for his copy but couldn\u2019t find it, and thought he probably tossed it out eight years earlier in a move.\n\n NBC quoted Baron as saying the paper likely would have disappointed Obama\u2019s critics. \u201cThe course was not a polemical course, it was a course in decision making and how decisions got made,\u201d Baron told NBC. \u201cNone of the papers in the class were controversial.\u201d\n\u2022 None Claim #5, Selective Service registration. Obama\u2019s Selective Service registration is public. A Obama\u2019s Selective Service registration is public. A copy has been posted publicly, and the Selective Service confirmed that Obama registered for the draft on Sept. 4, 1980, and was given registration number 61-1125539-1.\n\n Worth noting is that nobody in the U.S. has been drafted for military service since 1972, the year Obama turned 11. Obama, like other young men turning age 18 since then, was required to register on a standby basis, in case Congress ever resumes an active military draft. Failure to register is technically a crime, and disqualifies a man for federal student aid or from holding certain federal jobs.\n\u2022 Claim #6, medical records. During the 2008 campaign, Obama released summary medical information from his personal physician, who pronounced him to be in \u201cexcellent health\u201d with routine test results for such things as cholesterol all within normal levels. (McCain, who is a cancer survivor and was 71 at the time, let reporters see his records for three hours to show he was cancer-free.)\n\n Since taking office, Obama has followed the practice of earlier presidents. He released results of his first \u201cperiodic\u201d physical exam on Feb. 28, 2010. Results of his second \u201cperiodic\u201d exam were released Oct. 31, 2011. His physician described him as being \u201cin excellent health and \u2018fit for duty.'\u201d\n\u2022 Claims #7 and 8, Illinois state Senate records. Obama\u2019s voting record in the Illinois state Senate is a matter of public record, and about as far from being \u201csealed\u201d as one can imagine. Reporters extensively went over his votes in 2008. Transcripts of Senate debates in which Obama took part while in office (1997 \u2013 2004) can even be found online, at the website of the Illinois General Assembly.\n\n Obama\u2019s personal appointment calendar as a state senator may still be private \u2014 if it still exists \u2014 but we\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest that would add much to what is already public. As president, Obama has released records of visitors to the White House (2.4 million so far). There are some exceptions. Personal information about visitors, such as Social Security numbers are not released. And there\u2019s an exemption for \u201cparticularly sensitive\u201d information, which might include a visit by a potential Supreme Court nominee, for example. But that\u2019s still more disclosure than any previous president has made, by far.\n\u2022 Claim #9, law firm clients. It\u2019s true that Obama has not released a list of the 30 or so clients for whom he worked personally while he was a lawyer with the firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Gallard in Illinois. He did routinely disclose the law firm\u2019s entire client list while he was in the state Senate, however. And his campaign confirmed in 2008 several specific clients that Obama represented personally, when reporters asked about them. For example, he once represented the liberal group ACORN in a 1995 lawsuit against the state of Illinois, to make voter registration easier.\n\u2022 Claims #10 and 11, birth certificates. The claim that Obama\u2019s birth certificate is \u201csealed\u201d is pure nonsense. Copies of both the so-called \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d certificates have been released, and state officials in Hawaii have said repeatedly that Obama was born there in 1961 and is a \u201cnatural born American citizen.\u201d\n\u2022 Claim #12, baptism record. If a paper record exists (and we\u2019ve seen no evidence that it does), it would most likely show only what numerous, undisputed news accounts have stated: Obama was baptized in 1988 in Rev. Jeremiah Wright\u2019s Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. Obama was often seen in attendance at Wright\u2019s church in the 20 years that followed. He was married there, and his two daughters were baptized there.\n\n He remained a member even after some of Wright\u2019s controversial sermons were given national attention in early 2008. When Obama reluctantly severed ties with Wright after weeks of controversy, it was a major news event. Obama and his family now attend St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, near the White House, though not on a regular basis.\n\u2022 Claim #13: Michelle Obama\u2019s law license. It\u2019s simply not true that the first lady \u201ccan no longer practice law as an attorney.\u201d She could resume the practice of law any time she chooses. Both the president and his wife have voluntarily inactivated their Illinois law licenses, thereby avoiding a requirement to take continuing education classes and pay hundreds of dollars in annual fees, which is common for lawyers no longer actively practicing.\n\u2022 Claim #14, first ladies\u2019 assistants. It\u2019s true that the first lady has more than 20 on her staff, but that\u2019s roughly the same as other recent first ladies. The claim that \u201cother first ladies had only one\u201d might conceivably be true of Martha Washington or Dolley Madison, but it\u2019s certainly not true of Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton. Bush had at least 18 that we could count, and probably more with job titles that didn\u2019t make the link clear. The White House has said Michelle Obama\u2019s staff is the same size as Laura Bush\u2019s was.\n\u2022 Claim #15, foreign student aid. The claim that Obama got \u201cforeign student aid\u201d is untrue. That wild falsehood began as an absurd April Fools\u2019 Day hoax in 2009, which we quickly exposed.\n\u2022 Claim #16, Obama\u2019s passport. There\u2019s no reason to think Obama used anything but the then-current version of his U.S. passport when he traveled to Pakistan as a student in 1981. Some who questioned Obama\u2019s birthplace made baseless claims that Pakistan had banned U.S. citizens from visiting in 1981, and speculated that he must have used an Indonesian passport. But they were quite wrong. There was no such travel ban. In fact, the New York Times published a travel piece that year describing the author\u2019s own visit to Lahore, and the U.S. consul later wrote a letter to the Times saying he would \u201cwelcome an influx of Americans\u201d and giving advice on how to make the journey.\n\nBesides the numbered claims, the graphic also states that Obama has been endorsed by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). It\u2019s true that the Communist Party USA supports Obama. It claims to have about 2,000 members. Obama didn\u2019t seek the CPUSA endorsement, nor has he endorsed that group.\n\nThe graphic also attributes three quotes to Obama, all of which are commonly offered on conservative websites. All the quotes are accurate. Here\u2019s the background:\n\u2022 Obama appeared at the Service Employees International Union Sept. 17, 2007, to seek the union\u2019s endorsement for the Democratic nomination, and he said, \u201cyour agenda has been my agenda in the United States Senate.\u201d (The words appear at about 3 minutes and 15 seconds into this video.) And the SEIU eventually endorsed Obama, but not until February 2008, helping him wrap up the nomination battle against Hillary Clinton. The union has endorsed him again for reelection.\n\u2022 At the 2008 National Council of La Raza annual meeting in San Diego, Calif., on July 13, 2008, Obama concluded his remarks by saying, \u201cAnd together, we won\u2019t just win an election \u2013 we will transform this nation. Thank you, and God bless you.\u201d\n\u2022 And speaking to the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 17, 2008, Obama said electricity costs would \u201cnecessarily skyrocket\u201d as a result of capping carbon emissions. However, the cap-and-trade legislation he endorsed provided allowances intended to protect consumers from higher bills.\n\nIn summary, there are bits here that are true. But most is wrong or misleading, and overall the graphic falls far short of getting our seal of approval for accuracy.
