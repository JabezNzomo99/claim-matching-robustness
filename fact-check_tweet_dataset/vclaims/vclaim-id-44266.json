A brief military conflict in 1992 ended in a ceasefire. Most countries \u2013 even Russia \u2013 haven\u2019t recognized Transnistria, but the political skirmishing continues.\n\nIn this case, over license plates.\n\nMoldova and the unrecognized \u201cTransnistrian Moldovan Republic\u201d both issue license plates, a situation that created potential confusion at the borders.\n\n In September 2018, however, the competing sides agreed to a compromise: neutral license plates, with three numbers and three letters. Moldova allowed cars with neutral plates to cross the Ukraine border unhindered.\n\nThis is where First Transnistria comes in. The channel is financed and controlled by a Transnistrian governmental administration in Tiraspol that, among other things, collects taxes and maintains a paramilitary security force.\n\n The headline and intro of the TV report said that all cars, including those with neutral plates or numbers with Moldovan state symbols officially issued in the capital of Chisinau, would not be able to leave Transnistrian territory.\n\nIn fact, officials in Chisinau said they had only begun a temporary program to stop allowing cars with Transnistrian plates into Ukraine, as had been the practice.\n\n\u201cOn January 10 of the current year, the exclusive border crossing procedure, under which vehicles registered by the organs of Transnistria were allowed to cross the Moldovan-Ukrainian border, was suspended,\u201d an official statement of the Republic Reintegration Bureau Moldova said.\n\nThe statement said the goal, in part, was to \u201cinform citizens about the need to properly register their cars and obtain \u2018neutral\u2019 license plates.\u201d\n\nAlexander Flenkya, the Moldovan deputy premier for reintegration, issued a similar statement on Facebook 10 days later.\n\nSome said the First Transnistrian report was aimed at creating hostility toward the Moldovan government.\n\n\u201cIn this news, we see the manipulation of several levels,\u201d said political analyst Andrei Andrievsky.\n\n\u201cThis is a lie \u2013 those who have the documents and \u2018neutral plates\u2019 in order are not affected by the innovation of the Moldovan authorities.\u201d\n\nAndrievsky suggested there was a \u201cdeeper level of manipulation\u201d in the report aimed at perpetuating the notion that Transnistria is a distinct nationality.\n\nRuslan Shevchenko, a historian, noted that the term \u201cTransnistrians\u201d in the report is disputed by the Chisinau government. In this case, he said, the story stokes resentment that Moldova is unjustly restricting freedom of movement.\n\nIn response to Chisinau\u2019s measure, the authorities in Tiraspol passed \u201creciprocal measures\u201d that banned drivers licensed by Moldova in cars with Moldovan plates from entering Ukraine via the Transnistrian border. The decision was taken by the local authorities\u2019 Security Council on Jan. 17 and went into effect on Jan. 24.\n\nAll the travel restrictions have since expired so that drivers from Transnistria with all types off plates can cross the Ukraine border without problems.", "lang": "en"}
