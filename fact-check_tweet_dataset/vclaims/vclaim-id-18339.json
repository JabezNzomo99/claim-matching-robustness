FactCheckNI is another UK member of Facebook\u2019s third party fact-checking programme. The Guardian promptly corrected its article.\n\n \n\n In an article published on Tuesday, 30 July, \u201cCharity urges Facebook to extend fact-checking to Instagram\u201d, The Guardian reported on Full Fact\u2019s suggestion that Facebook expand its fact-checking programme to fully include Instagram. It was one of ten recommendations in a Full Fact\u2019s report, describing their first six months as part of the third party fact-checking programme.\n\nThe article subheader and first paragraph states that Full Fact is the only UK member of the Facebook programme:\n\nAll partners in the programme are independent and are verified fact-checking organisations through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network. FactCheckNI is a verified signatory of the IFCN Code of Principles.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, FactCheckNI joined the Facebook third party fact-checking programme. This allows us to rate the accuracy of claims that are made in Facebook posts. We publish our resulting investigations and conclusions on FactCheckNI\u2019s website as well as tagging them within Facebook\u2019s engine which, if found to be inaccurate, reduces the number of people who will see false claims.\n\nWe contacted The Guardian to ask for this mistake to be corrected, and the online article text was amended, with the addendum: \u201cThis article was amended on 30 July 2019. Full Fact were the first UK member of Facebook\u2019s fact-checking programme, but is not the only such member as an earlier version said.\u201d FactCheckNI is grateful for The Guardian\u2019s prompt attention and action.\n\nImage: Photo by Michele URSI used by licence Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
