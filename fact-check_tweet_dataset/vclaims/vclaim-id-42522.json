But the document is a fabrication, much like the fabled resurrection behind its creation.\n\nThis post here was shared more than 400 times on Facebook and, like others here, here and here, includes an image of what looks like an official \u201cDeath and Resurrection Certificate\u201d issued by South Africa\u2019s Department of Home Affairs.\n\nThe caption says: \u201cJust when I thought I have seen it all \u2026\u201d\n\nA purple date stamp adds a touch of authenticity, as well as a signature at the bottom of the page and a document number at the top.\n\nWe are told the deceased is \u201cBrighton Moyo\u201d, a Zimbabwean man felled by a fatal bout of \u201ccoughing\u201d on February 22, 2019. Two days later, he is said to have risen from the dead after a \u201cmiracle\u201d performed by Pastor Alph Lukao from Alleluia Ministries.\n\nThe document, however, does not exist. \u201cThis is a hoax,\u201d said David Hlabane, the department\u2019s media manager. \u201cThe Department of Home Affairs does not issue such certificates. We became aware of this hoax around February 2019 shortly after a pastor allegedly raised someone from the dead.\u201d\n\nThe video below, which shows the claimed resurrection of Moyo by Lukao, emerged in February last year.\n\nMoyo, in white, is seen being helped from a coffin after sitting bolt upright. He proceeds to wander around a packed auditorium in front of a frenzied congregation, apparently dazed by his return to the world of the living.\n\nMedia reports (here and here) captured the ensuing drama in the months immediately after the event was exposed as a fake. The saga saw criminal dockets opened and charges subsequently dropped.\n\nAnd the man called Moyo? He reportedly died a second time back home in Zimbabwe, although details as to the cause varied.", "lang": "en"}
