Still, when a room was being reserved for a Pickering event, it was Judge Kavanaugh who was consulted. When the White House press office needed materials about Judge Pickering, it was Judge Kavanaugh who asked the Justice Department for the files and relayed them. When a senator\u2019s chief of staff was coming to the White House to discuss Judge Pickering and another nominee, it was Judge Kavanaugh who planned to meet with her. And in May 2003, another White House official told Judge Kavanaugh that she had \u201casked for the Pickering package they are distributing\u201d and was \u201csending it your way to review.\u201d When he asked whom \u201cthey\u201d referred to, she replied: \u201cThe Pickering team. Chip, Chip\u2019s COS and whoever else they are using. You should know them\u201d \u2014 adding \u201chehe.\u201d (Judge Pickering\u2019s son, Charles Pickering, known as Chip, was a Republican congressman at the time, and COS means \u201cchief of staff.\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
