The ICC, through a statement by Bensouda, announced in February it will begin its preliminary examination into allegations of crimes against humanity committed under the Philippine government's war on drugs. The examination is in response to a complaint filed with the court by Filipino lawyer Jude Sabio in mid-2017.\n\nOn March 14, a little over a month after Bensouda's statement, Duterte announced the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC. Goodnewstoday.d30.club's story, which could have reached more than 40,000 people, came out almost three weeks after six minority senators asked the Supreme Court to invalidate Duterte's move because of a lack of concurrence by the Senate through a two-thirds vote.\n\nThe story's biggest traffic generators from social media are Marcos Defenders Worldwide Unlimited and Rody R. Duterte Movement Universal. Goodnewstoday.d30.club has been publishing stories since May 9.", "lang": "en"}
