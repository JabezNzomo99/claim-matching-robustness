Gretchen Whitmer is the niece of billionaire investor George Soros.\n\n\u201cHow many of you are aware that the female governor of Michigan is the niece of George Soros?\u201d reads the post.\n\nThere is no evidence that Whitmer is Soros\u2019s niece. Chelsea Lewis, the deputy press secretary for Whitmer\u2019s office, confirmed the claim was false.\n\nWhitmer gained national attention in March after criticizing the federal government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic and drawing President Donald Trump\u2019s ire on Twitter, according to The Washington Post. Since then, she has been a popular target for misinformation. This particular Facebook post claims Soros, who has been the subject of conspiracy theories for years, is her uncle.\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to corroborate the claim. Soros appears to only have two nephews \u2014 Peter and Jeffrey \u2014 by way of his late older brother Paul, per the biography \u201cSoros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire.\u201d Soros\u2019s brother had one daughter, Linda, but she died in an accident at 18 months old, according to his obituary.\n\n\u201cThis is completely false,\u201d Lewis said in an email to the DCNF.

In 2019, Check Your Fact debunked claims that Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff is his in-law and that Chelsea Clinton is married to one of Soros\u2019s nephews.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
