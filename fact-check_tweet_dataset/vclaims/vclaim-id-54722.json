But the US university\u2019s medical program said it is not the source of the claims, and while some are accurate, experts say others contain false or misleading information.\n\n\u201cEYE-OPENING KNOWLEDGE FROM John Hopkins University,\u201d says one of the posts, variations of which have circulated on Facebook since at least March 23, 2020.\n\nOthers attribute the claims to \u201cIrene Ken,\u201d a physician whose \u201cdaughter is an Asst. Prof in Infectious Disease at Johns Hopkins University,\u201d or to \u201ca Prof in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University,\u201d or to \u201cJohn Hopkins Hospital.\u201d\n\nThe points also appear on Reddit here and here, while versions have been posted on Instagram here, here and here.\n\nJohns Hopkins is tracking the spread of COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- providing statistics on deaths and infections as well as other information for both policymakers and the public, meaning its name lends authority to those who cite it.\n\nBut Johns Hopkins Medicine said it is not affiliated with the points circulating online, posting on its Facebook page that \u201crumors and misinformation like this can easily circulate in communities during a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rumors that we have seen in greater volumes are those citing a Johns Hopkins immunologist and infectious disease expert. We do not know the origin of these rumors and they lack credibility,\u201d it said.\n\nAnd \"we have no information\" on whether Irene Ken or her daughter exist, a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine said.\n\nSome of the points themselves are also problematic. AFP Fact Check breaks them down below.\n\nThe virus converts cells into aggressors and multipliers\n\nClaim: \u201cThe virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.\u201d\n\nSeveral parts of this description are false, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus arrives as an RNA molecule that comes wrapped in lipid and protein -- the first point is complete nonsense as written,\u201d Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThere are no aggressor or multiplier cells -- not sure what that might even be referring to,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Julian Leibowitz, an expert in coronaviruses who is a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M's College of Medicine, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is not true on many levels. The virus is an RNA virus, it contains no DNA, and its RNA genome is encased in a protein and is then enveloped by a lipid bilayer that contains several viral proteins,\u201d he said by email.\n\n\u201cWhen the virus infects cells the virus RNA expresses its genes, it does NOT mutate the genes of the host to convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells,\u201d Leibowitz said.\n\nThe decay of the virus depends on temperature and humidity\n\nClaim: \u201cSince the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.\u201d\n\nThis point is accurate, according to Dr. Wendy Keitel, professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n\u201cAs mentioned, the decay or loss of the viruses\u2019 ability to infect does depend on temperature, humidity and the type of material where it lies,\u201d she said by email.\n\nThe virus is fragile, so soap or detergent is the \u2018best remedy\u2019\n\nClaim: \u201cThe virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam). By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome viruses are very fragile; others are not fragile at all,\u201d said Keitel, with coronaviruses being \u201csignificantly less stable\u201d than smallpox, for example.\n\n\u201cSoap or detergent is a very effective way to help remove viruses from hands,\u201d she said, but \u201cwhile the detergent is important for removing soil and may have some effect on inactivation of the virus, the major effects are friction (rubbing the surfaces) and rinsing off the viruses.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cHEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 77 degrees Fahrenheit for washing hands, clothes and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.\u201d\n\nThis point is misleading; while the virus is sensitive to heat, Keitel said that \u201cit is likely that a temperature high enough to inactivate coronavirus would be too hot for handwashing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHands can be washed in warm or cold water as long as the use of soap and the duration of cleansing is at least 20 seconds,\u201d she said.\n\nNeumen said that \u201cthere are proteins in the coronavirus that do indeed denature with heat, but the virus is used to growing in human lungs and intestines, and it is stable up to temperatures a little above 100 degrees F.\u201d\n\nHe also highlighted issues with the point\u2019s information about heat melting fat.\n\n\u201cThere are fats that melt at different temperatures -- for example, bacteria that live in methane ice and bacteria that live on the rims of... deep ocean volcanoes both have membranes made of lipid molecules (what this person is calling fat), but they have very different melting points,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nUse mixtures with over 65 percent alcohol\n\nClaim: \u201cAlcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.\u201d\n\nThis is \u201cnot too far off from reality,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nKeitel agreed: \u201cAlcohol is believed to destroy the essential viral proteins and may disrupt the lipid (fatty) layer that is part of the coat.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cAny mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.\u201d\n\nThis is true, but excessive, according to Neuman.\n\n\u201cA standard store-bought hypochlorite bleach will indeed kill the virus, but it works at half the specified concentration,\u201d he said.\n\nClaim: \u201cOxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amount of oxygen dissolved in water would have very little effect on the virus. This suggests some kind of sham medical product to oxygenate water for health benefits,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nLeibowitz agreed: \u201cOxygenated water does not generate hydrogen peroxide and alcohol kills the virus after one minute of exposure.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cNO BACTERICIDE OR ANTIBIOTIC WORKS. The virus is not a living organism like bacteria; antibiotics cannot kill what is not alive.\u201d\n\nThis is true, unless it is a product also aimed at viruses.\n\n\u201cMany products are both bactericidal and virucidal (destroying both, physically), but it is correct that a specific bactericide would not be effective,\u201d according to Neuman.\n\n\u201cAntibiotics generally do not inactivate viruses; hence, treatment of a viral infection with a common antibiotic would not be expected to inactivate the virus, and it could cause harmful side effects,\u201d Keitel said, while also noting that \u201ca number of disinfecting chemicals have both antibacterial and antiviral activities.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t shake used clothing or use a feather duster\n\nClaim: \u201cNEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While the virus is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates between 3 hours (fabric and porous), 4 hours (copper and wood), 24 hours (cardboard), 42 hours (metal) and 72 hours (plastic). But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation is accurate if the items in question are contaminated with the virus.\n\n\u201cThe current public health recommendations at this time are to avoid shaking contaminated materials due to the theoretical possibility that the contaminated surfaces could release infectious material,\u201d said Keitel.\n\n\u201cIf your feather duster is covered in large amounts of SARS-CoV-2, then I would agree -- don't shake it. Otherwise, it's fine to dust as usual,\u201d Neuman said, using the official name for the novel coronavirus.\n\nAnd Leibowitz said that the numbers mentioned in this point \u201care not quite right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe virus can survive for at least 8 days on metal (steel) or hard plastic at room temperature but the relative survival on cardboard, paper, or fabric is relatively short and about 3 hours is the number I have seen,\u201d he said.\n\nClaim: \u201cThe virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars. It also needs moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.\u201d\n\nNeuman said the virus \u201cdoes not do well in any of the environments mentioned.\u201d\n\nIt \u201cremains stable almost indefinitely in a specialized -80 degree Celsius freezer, but tends to fall apart eventually at any higher temperature including a regular -20 degree Celsius home freezer,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd according to Leibowitz, \u201cthe relationship between humidity and virus survival shows that it is less stable at both high and very low humidity but it was most stable at 20% humidity, which is actually pretty low. Cold increases survival time.\u201d\n\nUV light can be used to disinfect masks\n\nClaim: \u201cUV LIGHT on any object that may contain it and break down the virus protein. For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect. Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin.\u201d\n\nUV light can \u201cinactivate\u201d viruses, but Keitel said it is not recommended for the general public to use this method.\n\n\u201cAt this time it is not recommended for non-medical personnel to attempt to use UV light to inactivate viruses for the purpose of disinfection of face masks. Cloth masks should be washed frequently in hot soapy water and dried in a drier,\u201d Keitel said.\n\nAs for the effect of UV on the virus, Neuman said that it \u201ccrosslinks nucleotides in the virus RNA -- it can damage protein as well, but that is the mechanism of inactivation.\u201d\n\nKeitel said that \u201cUV light has multiple potential ways of inactivating viruses, including effects on the proteins and on the genetic material.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has addressed the topic of using UV light against the novel coronavirus here.\n\nClaim: \u201cThe virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.\u201d\n\nThis is \u201ctrue but the reasoning is off,\u201d according to Neuman. \u201cThere aren't any cells with the viral receptor in skin, healthy or unhealthy, so it would not be able to infect.\u201d\n\nKeitel said that \u201cat this time there is no evidence that this coronavirus can go through healthy skin,\u201d and that \u201cinjury to the skin is required in order for many viruses to gain entry through the skin.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t use vinegar against the virus\n\nClaim: \u201cVinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.\u201d\n\nIt is accurate that vinegar is not recommended, but that this is because there is \u201cno data to support the claim that it works, and it can be harmful to surfaces,\u201d Keitel said.\n\nClaim: \u201cNO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, work. The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%. Edit: there are a few alcohols more than 65%, and Vodka does come in 50%, but still not strong enough to kill the virus.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cis generally correct, but there is at least one vodka that is 96% ethanol, and would be OK,\u201d according to Neuman.\n\n\u201cThe use of spirits for disinfection is not recommended and has not been studied. Consumption of alcohol for this purpose is discouraged,\u201d Keitel said.\n\nThis is false: \u201cListerine is only 27% ethanol, and would not work reliably,\u201d Neuman said.\n\n\u201cFirst, it has not been tested against the coronavirus. Second, not all Listerine contains alcohol. Third, the alcohol content does not exceed about 20%, significantly lower than the recommended concentration for disinfection purposes,\u201d said Keitel.\n\nAnd \u201cListerine does not contact all surfaces where the virus may be located (e.g., nasal, lower respiratory tract),\u201d she said.\n\nVirus concentrations can be higher in confined spaces\n\nClaim: \u201cThe more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is true, but distance between individuals is much more important. The virus spreads mostly by small droplets (about 10 microns diameter) generated from coughs and sneezes and they do not stay in the air very long and mostly settle out of the air after traveling less than 6 feet,\u201d said Leibowitz.\n\nNeuman said: \u201cThe size of the space doesn't matter so much -- it is a case of whether the virus is in it. Most buildings would have HEPA-filtered air, which is designed to catch coronavirus-sized particles and remove them from what we breathe.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cYou have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom.\u201d\n\nThis is a \u201charmless and a reasonable idea,\u201d Neuman said, while Keitel said that it is recommended to do so after touching \u201cpotentially contaminated surfaces.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cYou have to Moisturize dry hands from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks. The thicker the moisturizer, the better.\u201d\n\nAccording to Neuman, \u201cyou most certainly do not have to moisturize, but if you find it more comfortable, you can. It has no bearing on the virus, and is certainly not protective in the way mentioned here.\u201d\n\nAnd Leibowitz said that \u201cyou may want to moisturize your hands from lots of hand washing but the virus doesn\u2019t hide in the cracks.\u201d\n\nClaim: \u201cAlso keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a game of peek-a-boo -- you are unlikely to get respiratory droplets under your fingernails, and even if you did, the virus is unlikely to go from under your fingernails onto your mucosal membranes,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nLeibowitz agreed, saying: \u201cThis virus is spread by the respiratory route and nail length has nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 350 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
