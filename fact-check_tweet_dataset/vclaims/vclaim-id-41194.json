So to some people, it may not have seemed out of the realm of possibility in October 2019 that he would have lobbed a \u201cdad joke\u201d on Twitter that invoked the past conspiracy theories about his place of birth and a current scandal involving his White House successor and Ukraine.\n\nThe tweet, dated October 4, 2019, was an apparent forgery, as we found no evidence that the 44th president posted it from his account:\n\nThe fake tweet was a play on an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Democratic members of the House of Representatives over allegations that President Donald Trump had attempted to extort damaging information on a political rival from Ukraine by withholding military aid to that country.\n\nAs well, the \u201cbirth certificate\u201d reference riffed on the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory, the discredited notion proffered by some (including Donald Trump) that Obama was born in Kenya and not the United States, thereby disqualifying him from holding the U.S. presidency.", "lang": "en"}
