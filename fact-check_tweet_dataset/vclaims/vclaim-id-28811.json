While being processed for deportation, they are to be held in detention at a center for the temporary placement of foreign citizens in the town of Gulkevichi.\n\nOn March 7, a higher court for the Krasnodar region denied an appeal filed by the two Americans against the Novorossiysk court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWhile the two men are reportedly in good condition and are being treated well, we are troubled by the circumstances surrounding their detention,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nRussian officials have been quoted supporting the claim that the two American Mormon missionaries violated the conditions of their Russian visas.\n\nFor example, the mayor of Novorossiysk said there are no \"Mormon meetinghouses\" in his city.\n\nThe state-owned RIA Novost news agencyi reported last April that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had announced the construction of its first temple in Russia. There are reportedly some 23,000 people identifying themselves as Mormons in Russia, and the group is registered with Russian authorities as a religious organization.\n\nThe head of the missionary department of the Ekaterinodar and Kuban dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Church, Dmitry Kravchenko, said his church is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the Mormon presence in the Krasnodar region.\n\n\u201cThey begin with English lessons. These guys, as a rule, come from the United States; they are native speakers, which is how they attract, but after a few lectures they start including some religious topics in their texts,\u201d Kravchenko said.\n\nYet the Russian authorities accused the two Americans of doing exactly the opposite - of giving English language lessons while their declared purpose for visiting Russia was \u201creligious.\u201d\n\nThe issue, however, is more complex.\n\n\u201cThese guys did not violate either Russian law or the entry/stay regulations,\u201d Alexander Verkhovsky, director of Sova-Center, a Moscow-based NGO, told Polygraph.info in a phone interview. \u201cUnfortunately this story is very typical \u2013 a lot of religious activists have been deported from Russia based on this particular pretext.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe official version was that they violated the declared purpose for their visit, which was religious activity, by giving English language lessons. But per our information, they only participated in an event where English was a working language.\u201d\n\nThe Russian attorney representing the two Americans, Sergey Glizunza, said the official evidence that they were \u201cteaching English\u201d was based on the testimony of a minor girl, who said that the Americans spoke with her in English \u201con various topics.\u201d\n\nVerkhovsky said deporting foreign religious activists on the basis of similar accusations has become a \u201cpersisting practice\u201d in Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is not aimed against any particular \u2018foreign\u2019 religion \u2013 they\u2019ve deported a lot of Protestants, rabbis and others, of course, with the exception of the Russian Orthodox Church,\u201d he said.\n\nAgents of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) are tasked with monitoring foreign religious groups, but they \u201cdon\u2019t really understand what they are doing\u201d so they \u201cjust go after anything they deem suspicious.\u201d\n\nWhile this was reportedly the first recent incident involving the Mormons in Russia, other congregations have been targeted and persecuted.\n\nMost notably, in 2017 a Russian court designated the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as an \u201cextremist organization\u201d and banned them from Russia the following year.\n\nThe main evidence used to accuse the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of \u201cextremism\u201d was \u201cforensic expertise\u201d involving the group\u2019s translation of the Bible into Russian.\n\nThe Russian experts concluded that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 translation of the Bible into Russian amounts to a \u201cjustification for the necessity of overthrowing the constitutional order in the Russian Federation,\u201d since the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cbelieve in the depravity of the existing state of affairs, the coming end of the world, the victory of Jesus over the devil, and the beginning of a new world order.\u201d\n\nThe Russian experts also concluded that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses' translation of the Bible includes \u201ccalls for violating Russia\u2019s territorial integrity\u201d because the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cbelieve in the inevitability of the end of the world and the coming of new rulers.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
