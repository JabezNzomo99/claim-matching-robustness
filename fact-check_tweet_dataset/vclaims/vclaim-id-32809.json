Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThey are three photos in the post. Let\u2019s try to check each one of them:\n\nThe same photo can be found to be uploaded on Facebook in February 2016 with a different claim. The photo can be also found in a blog post written in 2015. The blog has been removed now, but the archived version of the post can be seen here. The photo was also found on the \u2018Medium\u2019 website. While the exact context of the photo cannot be ascertained with the available information, it is not related to the recent Delhi riots.\n\nOn the \u2018Medium\u2019 website, the same photo was found to be uploaded on 9 June 2018. Also, the photo can be found in a YouTube video uploaded in May 2019. So, the photo is an old one. It is not related to the recent riots.\n\nOn doing the reverse image search, the same photo was found in a 2018 Facebook post. Similar photos can be also found in an article published on the \u2018Daily hunt\u2019 news website in 2018. In the article, it can be read the incident happened in Bihar. Also, it was found that \u2018Boom\u2019 has written a fact-check article in 2018 on the same photo when it went viral with another false claim.\n\nTo sum it up, old unrelated photos are falsely being shared as \u2018Hindus killed by the Muslims in the Delhi riots\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
