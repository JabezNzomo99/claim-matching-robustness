We decided it was time to revisit Trump\u2019s takedown of the online giant for accuracy.\n\nTrump made three key claims, so we took a look at each one individually. We found his points lacked important context.\n\n\"Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments\"\n\nThis used to be accurate but is not exactly the case anymore. Amazon pays taxes in most states.\n\nAmazon pays the federal corporate tax and collects taxes in all 46 states where sales taxes exist, plus the District of Columbia. (This excludes Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon.)\n\nAmazon paid $957 million in income tax in 2017, according to regulatory filings. Amazon paid nothing in federal taxes this year thanks to tax credits and, in large part, Trump\u2019s new tax law.\n\nBut the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Amazon is either not collecting local taxes or is charging a lower tax rate than local retailers in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe digital retailer\u2019s decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary, as a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively gave a free pass on state taxes to companies with no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state.\n\nMax Behlke, the director of budget and tax at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told PolitiFact in August it was unfair to single out Amazon, given the many other online retailers that follow the same practice.\n\nAmazon has pushed to have Congress require all online retailers abide by the same state sales tax.\n\nHowever, Amazon does not collect state taxes on third-party sellers who use the Amazon platform to sell their products. Some estimates suggest half of Amazon\u2019s total sales go through third parties.\n\nAmazon uses \"our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.)\"\n\nMuch of the Postal Service\u2019s decline is attributable to the dwindling use of paper, first-class mail, and billions of dollars in operating costs. But growth in their shipping and packages market, which includes Amazon, \"provided some help to the financial picture of the Postal Service,\" according to a 2017 USPS press release.\n\nHowever, Amazon does get a special rate, which is kept under wraps, as the USPS provides discounts to companies for which the postal service does last mile delivery. (Last mile delivery is where the company does bulk delivery and package sorting before a package is delivered to your door by USPS.) A special arrangement is what landed the USPS Sunday delivery.\n\nAmazon uses the United States Postal Service to deliver about 40 percent of its packages, according to PBS Newshour.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely the deal is hurting USPS either, as the independent Postal Regulatory Commission reviews all deals and the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost.\n\nAmazon is \"putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\"\n\nLast year was not a great year for retail. While consumption habits, the over-supply of malls and megastores like Walmart played a role, so did e-commerce.\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that e-commerce is causing brick and mortar stores to close their doors,\" Behlke said. \"Amazon is not the only one, but they are by far the largest share of online sales.\"\n\nThe retail sectors with greater job losses are those that compete more directly with online commerce\n\nIn July 2016, electronics and appliance stores employed 527,500 workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By July 2017, employment shrunk by almost 4 percent, or nearly 21,000 jobs.\n\nRetailers in sporting goods, books and music \u2014 also considered direct competitors of online sellers \u2014 have also seen steep job losses over that same period.\n\nAt the same time, businesses that don't compete as directly with online commerce \u2014 sellers of motor vehicles, gas stations and building materials, for instance \u2014 have seen some of the strongest growth, Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com, told us in August.", "lang": "en"}
