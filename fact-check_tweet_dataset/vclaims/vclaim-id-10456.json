We will update this article if we do.\n\n\u201cAs of now we only have a definitive announcement for one new solar manufacturing facilities since the tariffs were introduced. And even that one is now planned to be smaller than originally intended,\u201d Shayle Kann, a nonresident fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us.\n\nJinkoSolar, a Chinese company, announced on Jan. 29 that it would finalize plans for a manufacturing facility in the U.S. It will be in Jacksonville, Florida, and create 200 jobs, the company said in late March. That\u2019s the only new post-tariff facility that the Solar Energy Industries Association was aware of as well.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump may be including in his count of solar plants. Both Kann and SEIA told us some U.S. manufacturers had announced or discussed plans to expand capacity. \u201cBut to my knowledge, none of those plans are definitive at this point,\u201d said Kann, who is also the senior vice president of research and strategy at Energy Impact Partners, a sustainable energy investment firm.\n\nAlso, SunPower, a solar systems and technology company that imports its solar panels, announced on April 18 that it would buy SolarWorld Americas, one of the companies that had petitioned the International Trade Commission for the tariffs.\n\nTrump made his most recent comments on April 18 at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As we said, they come after Trump put the number of new solar plants at \u201cat least five\u201d on Feb. 26 and the more general \u201ca lot\u201d on Feb. 13.\n\nSEIA, a national trade association, opposed the tariffs, arguing that they would stunt demand and hurt U.S. installers and manufacturers in the industry that made products other than the solar panels themselves.\n\nAbigail Ross Hopper, SEIA\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement in response to Trump\u2019s remarks: \u201cThe President was apparently misinformed about the number of plants that had been operating, the number that are going to be newly built and the status of the plants of the two petitioners.\u201d (SEIA also disputes the president\u2019s claim that 30 solar panel plants had closed before the tariffs, arguing that some made other products or didn\u2019t close because of imports.)\n\nGreentech Media, which is part of the market analysis firm Wood Mackenzie, wrote in January that there were 14 \u201ccrystalline-silicon cell and/or module manufacturers in the U.S.\u201d All of those companies would \u201ctheoretically\u201d benefit from the tariffs, Greentech Media wrote, though \u201cit\u2019s not clear that all of these companies have active factories in the U.S. with the ability to reach any kind of scale.\u201d\n\nSuniva and SolarWorld Americas are the two companies that pushed for the tariffs. They argued that cheap imports were hurting their businesses in a 2017 petition to the International Trade Commission. The ITC agreed last fall, and the Trump administration announced a new four-year tariff on Jan. 22 on imported solar cells and modules.\n\nA 30 percent tariff would be imposed in the first year, but that would decrease by 5 percentage points each year and end after year four. The first 2.5 gigawatts in cell imports are exempt.\n\nAs for whether those two companies are \u201cdoing very well,\u201d Suniva had filed for bankruptcy before making its ITC petition, and it\u2019s still in bankruptcy proceedings. On April 17, a day before Trump\u2019s comment, a bankruptcy judge said Suniva\u2019s largest creditor could sell some of the company\u2019s manufacturing equipment in a public auction, according to Reuters.\n\nSolarWorld Americas, however, is doing much better than that. SunPower announced this week that it would buy SolarWorld Americas, with its CEO describing the move as a reaction to the tariffs in an interview with Greentech Media. SunPower said it would \u201cinject fresh capital\u201d into its acquisition\u2019s facility and implement its high-efficiency solar panel technology.\n\nThe merger is expected to be finalized in several months, SunPower\u2019s press release said.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that another company will buy Suniva or at least its equipment and open or expand a production facility. And a handful of companies have said they are exploring expanding their capacity in the U.S. For instance, Longi Solar Technologies told Greentech Media in late January that it was \u201cactively doing our homework\u201d in considering a U.S. factory, which its general manager called \u201ca big commitment.\u201d\n\nThat article cited other expansions in already operating facilities: an announcement in early January, before the tariffs were implemented, by Solaria Corp. that it would expand manufacturing thanks to new funding it had secured, and a Jan. 23 announcement by Mission Solar Energy that it was \u201cramping up production to meet product demands for 2018.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the president is counting those types of announcements, but they\u2019re not \u201cseven or eight\u201d plants that \u201care going to be opening.\u201d\n\nKann co-authored a Feb. 6 report for Columbia\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy that said: \u201cMany manufacturers will certainly explore building manufacturing capacity in the United States, but a combination of timing, market factors, and the tariffs themselves will put an end to most of these schemes.\u201d\n\nThe report cited two reasons companies would \u201cthink twice before investing tens, or hundreds, of millions of dollars into new US solar panel manufacturing industry.\u201d It noted that the tariff is reduced each year and eliminated after four years, and even with the tariff, the manufacturing costs could still make Southeast Asia solar panels more competitive.\n\nSimilarly, Edurne Zoco, a research director of solar and energy storage for the analytics firm IHS Markit, said that the tariffs could prompt some additional module manufacturing capacity in the United States. But \u201cwe do not anticipate that it will bring a significant number of cell-manufacturing expansions,\u201d Zoco told us in mid-February, when we did some initial research on this issue.\n\nThe \u201ccompetitive advantage of setting manufacturing in the U.S. grows smaller every year,\u201d under the tariff, she said, \u201csince global solar cell prices will continue to fall and the import tariff will be also reduced.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
