The claim is misleading; in his July 27, 2020, address, Duterte banned face-to-face teaching until a COVID-19 vaccine is created, but called for the implementation of online learning as a temporary measure.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on July 27, 2020. The post has been shared more than 23,000 times.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cNO Classes for ALL in 2020-2021. Memorandum Already signed by President Duterte According to His SONA\u2026\u201d\n\nSONA is an acronym for the \u201cstate of the nation address\u201d, an annual speech delivered by the Philippine president to Congress that details the government\u2019s agenda for the coming year. Duterte delivered his fifth SONA on July 27, 2020.\n\nAn identical claim about Duterte declaring there would be \u201cno classes for all\u201d until 2021 were also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA review of Duterte\u2019s SONA video shows that he made no such announcement. Instead, he said that traditional in-class learning would be banned, but stressed the government would provide alternative learning methods.\n\nAt the 50-minute 33-second mark of the official video, Duterte states: \u201cUntil the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face-to-face teaching or learning unless the risk of exposure to the sickness are eliminated ... We must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV- and radio-based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can avail. DepEd will provide the printed modules for those who cannot afford online learning.\u201d\n\nThe misleading claim circulated online hours before Duterte delivered his SONA.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post is timestamped: \u201cMonday, July 27, 2020 at 12:10 PM\u201d.\n\nThis official government Facebook live video of the president\u2019s address was broadcast nearly four hours later. The post is timestamped: \u201cMonday, July 27, 2020 at 3:52 PM\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
