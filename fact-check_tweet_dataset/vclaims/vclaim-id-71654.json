Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is no stranger to fake internet memes. Most claim she said things she didn\u2019t say, one disparaged her financial stability and another doctored an image to make it look like she was in a compromising position.\n\nAnd now we have another, interesting quote that\u2019s been falsely attributed to the New York Democrat on Facebook.\n\nThe post features a photo of Ocasio-Cortez and quotes her as saying:\n\n\"\u2018I\u2019m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said lots of things\u2019 - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on foreign policy.\"\n\nThe July 9 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAlas, she did not say it \u2013 Donald Trump did.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, Trump, then considered the Republican-nominee frontrunner, participated in a phone interview for MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" newscast.\n\nCo-anchor Mika Brzezinski starts off by asking Trump who he consults with on foreign policy issues. Trump replies with the exact statement: \"I\u2019m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said lots of things.\" He goes on to talk about how he wrote about Osama Bin-Laden before September 11, that he knows what he\u2019s doing and listens and talks to \"a lot of people ... but my primary consultant is myself.\"\n\nThis quote belongs to Trump, not Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWe rate this meme Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
