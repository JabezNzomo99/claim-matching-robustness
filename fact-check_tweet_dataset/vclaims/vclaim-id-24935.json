There\u2019s lots of evidence to show that the level of radiation near masts like these isn\u2019t dangerous even if you loitered near one for a while. It\u2019s not clear whether the mast has anything to do with 5G in particular, as the first 5G network launched in the UK just a few days before it was posted, on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe image shows a mobile phone monopole mast with a sign on it, and in tiny font on the sign there\u2019s a link to an official government document on the safety of mobile phone base stations. (Base stations are the stationary radio transmitters that support mobile networks. They have antennas which are mounted on masts like the one in the picture, or on buildings.)\n\nThis sign almost certainly isn\u2019t an official one\u2014for one, it doesn\u2019t include any organisation\u2019s logo. Also, the real government document the poster links to is one from Public Health England, which directly contradicts the claim that the mobile phone antenna poses a radiation risk. Public Health England told us it hadn\u2019t made the poster.\n\nThe document linked to says: \u201cradiofrequency fields at ground level and in places normally accessible to the public are many times below guideline levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere guidelines can be exceeded, normally within a few metres directly in front of the most powerful antennas, exclusion zones are implemented to restrict access.\u201d\n\nOfcom, the communications regulator, has carried out measurements around base stations that consistently show the amount of radiation is well below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection\u2019s (ICNIRP) limits, regardless of how much time you spend there.\n\nDr Simon Mann, Head of Public Health England\u2019s Radiation Dosimetry Department, told us: \u201cMeasurements of exposure levels have been made independently of the network operators at thousands of locations in the UK near to base stations and these have always been well within the [international guideline] levels. There is no convincing scientific evidence that radio signals from mobile phone masts pose a risk to public health when they are below [these] levels.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest 5G is dangerous\n\n5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. One of the many uses of this will be to provide faster web access from mobiles, for more devices at once. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves\u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).\n\nThese radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don\u2019t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe ICNIRP provides scientific advice and guidance on non-ionising radiation (like the radio waves of 5G) and it has guidelines on safe levels of exposure. Public Health England has said that these guidelines should be adopted, and that there\u2019s no \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that exposure below these guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.\n\nAt the time of writing, EE has rolled out 5G in six UK cities and Vodafone has in 15 towns and cities. Three is reportedly due to launch 5G in London in August 2019 and O2 will in October.", "lang": "en"}
