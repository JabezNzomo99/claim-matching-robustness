Because, as per nature, temperature is different in different countries. If it is natural, it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China.\u201d\n\nThe post then claims he said \u201cIt is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China\u201d.\n\nIt then claims that Professor Honjo said he was \u201cfully acquainted with the staff of that laboratory\u201d and then purports he said \u201call their phones are dead\u201d and \u201cit is now understood that all these lab technicians have died\u201d.\n\nThe post finishes with: \u201cBased on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence \u2013 That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck found five separate iterations of the Facebook post, , , , and . In total the posts have been viewed over 100,000 times, shared over 1,950 times and received over 1,200 interactions.\n\nAs unverified claims that COVID-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology continue to circulate, a Facebook post purports to quote Japan\u2019s Professor Tasuku Honjo as saying \u201cChina manufactured\u201d the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe April 26 Facebook post claims Prof Honjo said: \u201cthe Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it,\u201d and that \u201cif (the virus) is natural , it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson from Kyoto University, where Prof Honjo, a researcher in molecular immunology, holds tenure, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the professor did not say any of the things outlined in the April 26 Facebook post. In a statement posted to the the Kyoto University website, Prof Honjo said he was saddened that his name had been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting,\u201d the statement from Prof Honjo reads.\n\nThe April 26 Facebook post claims Prof Honjo said: \u201cI have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory\u201d.\n\nProf Honjo has not worked at any Chinese laboratories, according to his Kyoto University biography. He studied medicine at Kyoto University, graduated with a Ph.D in medical chemistry, then took various posts at higher education institutions around Japan and fellowships in America. In 2018 Prof Honjo shared a Nobel Prize with James P. Allison for developing new immunotherapies to cancer.\n\nThe April 26 post\u2018s mention of \u201cthe Wuhan laboratory\u201d is evidently a reference to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), a research centre in Wuhan, China which opened that country\u2019s first level 4 biosafety laboratory in 2015.\n\nSince February the WIV has become the target of conspiracy theories that claim the coronavirus escaped from a lab or was a manufactured bioweapon.\n\nIn recent weeks opinion articles have reignited the theories, with a claim that circumstantial evidence points to the WIV as the source of the outbreak of COVID-19 and a report that diplomatic cables sounded the alarm about inadequate biosafety procedures at the institute.\n\nAAP FactCheck has checked similar claims about the WIV and to date found there is no evidence that directly links the Wuhan Institute of Virology with the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nA leading Australian researcher has stated there is no evidence to support claims of SARS-CoV-2 originating in a laboratory and in March researchers published in the journal Nature Medicine reported that analysis showed \u201cthat SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus\u201d.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim in the Facebook post to be false. A spokesperson from Kyoto University told AAP FactCheck Professor Honjo did not make any of the claims attributed to him and the Nobel Laureate has never worked in any Chinese laboratory.
