Here's a list of the lowlights.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-11-04T07:00:39Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85150", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/04/the-biggest-pinocchios-of-election-2016/", "vclaim": "Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, ended up with an average Pinocchio rating of 2.2. That put her in about the same range as President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in 2012. (She had a total of seven Four-Pinocchio ratings.) If not for her statements about the email controversy, which earned her lots of Pinocchios, her average rating would have been much lower.\n\nTrump repeatedly made claims that boggled the imagination. He said the unemployment rate was 42 percent when it was actually 5 percent. He claimed there were 92 million \u201cjobless Americans,\u201d which included everyone who did not want to work, such as retirees and students. He even claimed that he could save $300 billion a year from a Medicare prescription drug program that only costs $78 billion.\n\nHillary Clinton earned 24 Pinocchios over the course of the campaign for a series of misleading statements about her private email server arrangement when she was secretary of state. Among other claims, she falsely said the arrangement was permitted, that she had not sent or received classified information, and that the FBI director had said her answers were truthful.\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed things that did not happen. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrate the collapse of the World Trade Center after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton started the \u201cbirther\u201d movement that questioned whether Obama was born in the United States. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a \u201cgenius\u201d when in fact Putin called him \u201ccolorful.\u201d And he suggested that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had a hand in John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nHillary Clinton claimed that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to thwart an anti-gay constitutional amendment; hacked emails later showed that her staff immediately knew the statement was false. She also claimed that she tried to join the Marines on the eve of her marriage in 1975 but was turned down \u2014 a story that did not add up for a number of reasons. And she asserted that Trump opposed the auto bailout in 2009 \u2014 when in fact he supported government action.\n\nIn hindsight, Trump often said he was right. He said he was against the Iraq War, even though the evidence showed he supported it. He claimed he predicted that Osama bin Laden would attack the United States, when Trump made no such prediction. And he said he knew Obamacare would be a disaster when it passed, even though he did not say that at the time.\n\nTrump often hyped statistics concerning minority groups. He claimed that 58 percent of black youths were unemployed, when the real number was less than 20 percent, and he said more Hispanics were in poverty under Obama, when in fact the number has decreased. He also falsely said the murder rate is the highest in 45 years, when it\u2019s really half the peak of the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nBen Carson, making the case for not having any political experience, asserted that the Founding Fathers had no elected office experience. As most junior high schoolers could tell you, the American Revolution was successful because it was led by men with many years in politics, political action and protest, often honed in the debates held in Colonial legislatures.\n\nHillary Clinton loved to say that she was the only candidate in the race who would not raise taxes on the middle class and would raise incomes. But this was rhetorical hooey, as just about every candidate on the right had signed a pledge to never raise taxes (and said they would raise incomes).\n\nWhile campaigning for president, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) loved to tell the story of an elderly man sitting in prison for 10 years \u2014 just for putting dirt on his land. But just about every aspect of Paul\u2019s recounting was inaccurate and misleading. The man was convicted for his role in developing 67 mobile home lots inside federally protected wetlands, building on wetlands without approval and knowingly selling land with illegal sewage systems that were likely to fail.\n\nThe Fox News personality touted the claim that Trump sent his personal plane to rescue Marines stranded after fighting in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. But Trump had nothing to do with it; the jet was provided by the Trump Shuttle, under contract with the military, at a time when it had been seized by Trump\u2019s bankers for failing to pay loans. Hannity continues to display this false claim on his website.", "lang": "en"}
