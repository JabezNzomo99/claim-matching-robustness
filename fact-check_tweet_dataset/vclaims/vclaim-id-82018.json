We looked through television programming from both events using a recording service that chronicles and time-stamps live television programming. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nSmith\u2019s speech, on the first night of the Republican National Convention July 18, 2016, began around 8:24 p.m. ET.\n\nThe speech was aired live by both CNN and MSNBC. It was not live on Fox News, coincidentally. Fox News went to commercial right before Smith took the stage and returned to a phone interview between Donald Trump and Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nLou Dobbs Tonight on the Fox Business channel had footage of the speech, but no audio.\n\nThe broadcast networks, NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX, did not cover any convention programming before 10 p.m. ET.\n\nKhan\u2019s speech aired at 9:13 p.m. ET on July 28, 2016, from Philadelphia. Again, it was aired live by CNN and MSNBC but not Fox News.\n\nFox News was in a commercial when Khan began speaking. The cable network showed pictures of Khan speaking on the side but did not have audio. When Fox News returned from the break, it went to a press conference on ISIS by FBI director James Comey.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nKilmeade said \"nobody\" aired Patricia Smith\u2019s remarks live, but \"almost everybody\" covered Khan\u2019s remarks live.\n\nCNN, MSNBC and C-SPAN covered both speeches live. Coincidentally, Fox News \u2014 of which Kilmeade is an employee \u2014 covered neither live.\n\nPoint being: the speeches were covered the same. Kilmeade\u2019s statement rates Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
