Over 170,000 Wisconsin residents have a legal permit to carry a handgun. They are armed and prepared to defend themselves and others against acts of criminal violence. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Illinois and Chicago, however, have been disarmed for your convenience.\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNo, Wisconsin does not have a welcome sign that warns visitors of its gun-owning residents. The entire message below \"Welcome to Wisconsin\" is photoshopped and attached to the sign to make it appear authentic.\n\nResults from a reverse-image search of the photo reveal the original image \u2014 which doesn\u2019t include the message \u2014 was uploaded to WikiMedia Commons on Nov. 10, 2008. According to the image\u2019s description, the sign is located on U.S. Route 10 on the east side of the state.\n\nKristin McHugh, the director of public affairs for Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Transportation, also told PolitiFact the image is doctored.\n\n\"The Wisconsin DOT did not manufacture, place or authorize such a sign anywhere in the state,\" McHugh wrote in an email. \"This is a doctored image that uses similar language to welcome signs, also deemed fake, in other states. If any such illegal signage were actually installed, it would be removed per state statute 86.19.\"\n\nThat law prescribes where signs may be erected and under what circumstances they shall be removed by authorities. It also specifies fines and other penalties for disregarding the law and defacing existing highway signage.\n\nAs McHugh mentioned, Wisconsin isn\u2019t the only state to have its welcome sign digitally altered to include the fake gun warning. Different variations of the message have been photoshopped on multiple state welcome signs including Idaho, Michigan and Louisiana.\n\nAn old, viral image of a Wisconsin roadway welcome sign warns \"criminals and terrorists\" that over \"170,000\" of the state\u2019s residents have permits to carry handguns.\n\nThe real sign simply says \"Welcome to Wisconsin\" \u2014 the rest is photoshopped.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
