Some members then started jeering and heckling.\n\nDoes the housing minister have her numbers straight?\n\nNo source to back up claim\n\nof Sisulu\u2019s speech shows that she went slightly off script, leaving out the end of the sentence. It reads: \u201cTo sum up our successes, our daily rate is truly amazing, measuring that we build 1,200 houses per day over 23 years\u201d.\n\nIf her claim is true, it would mean that government had built or delivered over 10 million houses in 23 years.\n\nHer spokesman, Vusi Tshose, told Africa Check that Sisulu was \u201creferring to a study that was done by someone else\u201d. He wouldn\u2019t say who but promised to send us a copy of the study.\n\nAt the time of publishing, we had not received it. (\n\nAfrica Check tried to find the study but didn\u2019t have any luck. We asked two experts if they had come across the statistic Sisulu cited.\n\nDirector of research and advocacy at the\n\n(SERI), Lauren Royston, told Africa Check that she was unaware of any study that had reached this conclusion.\n\nAssociate professor at the University of the Witwatersrand\u2019s\n\n, Aly Karam, said the same: he didn't know about any study that put the delivery of housing since 1994 at over 10 million.\n\nwith Professor Marie Huchzermeyer on South Africa\u2019s housing policy between 1994 and 2014, which looked at the department\u2019s housing delivery data.\n\n\u201cTen million is a lot - they are not at that level,\u201d Karam told Africa Check.\n\nStatistics from Sisulu\u2019s department don\u2019t back up her claim. The housing department\u2019s website shows that government built\n\nwere built in 2014/15 and\n\nwere built in 2015/16. Data for 2016/17 - the most recent financial year - is not available yet.\n\nAdd these together and the total number of houses delivered by the South African government since 1994 comes to 3,030,824.\n\nThis works out to an average of 377 houses being built each day over 22 years - a third of the number claimed by Sisulu.\n\nThese housing delivery numbers have not been independently verified, however. Huchzermeyer and Karam advise that the they \u201cshould be read with caution\u201d and viewed as \u201cindicative rather than entirely conclusive\u201d.\n\nSouth African housing minister Lindiwe Sisulu\u2019s claim that her department delivers \u201c1,200 houses per day\u201d is not supported by her department\u2019s statistics.\n\nSisulu\u2019s spokesman said that the statistic was from a study \u201cdone by someone else\u201d. He did not provide the study, although he promised to do so.\n\nGovernment statistics show that South Africa has built 3,030,824 houses for low-income people over 22 years - an average of 377 per day.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Sisulu has previously pointed out that housing delivery is on the decline - in fact, it has almost halved since its peak in 1998/99. That year 235,635 houses were delivered - an average of 645 per day. \n\n\n\n we have data for - the daily average had dropped to 275. \n\n \n\n The South African government also provides another form of housing opportunity called a \u201cserviced site\u201d. These sites are not houses. \n\n\n\n The sites are pieces of land that are connected to water, electricity and sanitation. Recipients are responsible for building their own houses. \n\n\n\n with houses, the number of total housing opportunities provided by the South African government between 1994 rises to 4,060,795. \n\n\n\nOfficial data shows 377 houses per daySouth African members of parliament were sceptical when the country\u2019s housing minister boasted about her department\u2019s service delivery rate.Workers building the Emerald Sky housing project in East London in June 2010.
