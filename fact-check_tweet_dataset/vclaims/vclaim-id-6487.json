Actually this is only correct compared to six years ago, a comparison the Prime Minister stated correctly last month. There were about 1.1 million more attendances at A&E in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\n23.6 million people visited A&E last year. These aren\u2019t all unique individuals: some people visit multiple times and get counted whenever they visit. That\u2019s why we usually call them \u2018attendances\u2019. It\u2019s up from 22.4 million in 2015.\n\nIf you compare back to 2010, when there were about 21.1 million attendances, that\u2019s how you get Ms Perry\u2019s 2.5 million rise.\n\nThis comes off the back of figures leaked this week suggesting that record numbers of patients spent more than four hours in A&E units in England last month. It\u2019s claimed that 82% were admitted, transferred or discharged from A&E within four hours. The target is 95%.\n\nThe longer-term trend shows performance against the 95% target has been deteriorating for several years.\n\nThese figures cover all types of A&E unit across England. The largest \u2018Type 1\u2019 departments have also seen record attendances, and perform worse on waiting times.", "lang": "en"}
