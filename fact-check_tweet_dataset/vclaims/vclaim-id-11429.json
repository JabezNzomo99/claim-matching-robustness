Regarded as the largest Russian-led military exercise since 1981, some 297,000 service personnel took part in that drill.\n\nOn October 29, RT\u2019s Murad Gazdiev said that the simulated enemy in the latest NATO drill is \u201cunsurprisingly exactly as powerful as Moscow,\u201d adding both sides have been \u201cgoing to extremes staging bigger and bigger wargames.\u201d\n\nThe report cited NATO spokesman Dylan White, who said Vostok demonstrates Russia\u2019s focus on exercises simulating a large-scale conflict, which \u201cfits into a pattern we have seen over some time \u2013 a more assertive Russia significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence.\u201d\n\nGazdiev found fault with this claim, saying that \u201cRussia\u2019s military budget has been decreasing, not increasing, year after year,\u201d and noting that Russia\u2019s defense spending has shrunk from $69.2 billion in 2016 to $46 billion in 2018. NATO\u2019s spending during that period, by contrast, grew from $924 billion to $1.103 trillion.\n\nHe said that in spending terms there is no competition between NATO and Russia, adding it has led to a remarkable cycle, whereby NATO ramps up its fighting machine, \u201cforcing\u201d Moscow to respond with its own buildup \u201cwhich NATO then calls Russian aggression,\u201d which the alliance then uses \u201cto justify stationing more tanks and more troops near Russia.\u201d\n\nGazdiev\u2019s report concluded with a rhetorical attempt at dismay, asking how much longer the situation can escalate before a spark is put to \u201cthis trillion dollar powder keg.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the basic point is true: NATO\u2019s defense spending has increased from 2016-18, while Russia\u2019s has declined.\n\nBut the 2017 cut was the first drop in Russian military spending since 1998.\n\nUltimately, the situation is much more complicated than simply inferring intent from outlays. But first, the reasons behind those cuts warrant consideration.\n\nAs noted by several analysts, Russia\u2019s 2016 defense spending was inflated by \u201ca one-off adjustment\u201d to pay off debt that had accumulated over the years.\n\nThat year, the Finance Ministry reportedly provided 792 billion rubles (approximately $12.03 billion at today\u2019s exchange rate) to help pay off defense contractors. Another 186 billion rubles ($2.82 billion dollars) was spent to that end in 2017, making outlays for those years appear higher, wrote Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist with the CNA Corporation.\n\nKofman said a tightening in funding controls had also disrupted \u201cthe continuity of Russian defense-spending data.\u201d Previously the industry had been allowed to hoard advances for armaments that had not been produced as scheduled.\n\nHe also noted it was analytically unhelpful to measure Russia\u2019s defense budget in dollars, as \u201cRussia\u2019s defense sector doesn\u2019t buy much of anything in dollars,\u201d resulting in purchasing parity distortions.\n\nAnother factor concerns the fact that Russian Federal Treasury data only accounts for actual expenditures, not full allocations, wrote Mark Galeotti, a senior non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague.\n\nThen there is the issue of transparency. Galeotti says that in Russia, \u201ceven more so than in the West,\u201d defense and security expenditures \u201coften appear under different budget lines and obscure headings.\u201d\n\n\u201cPre-conscription physical and skills training is outsourced to schools through the revived GTO (Ready for Labor and Defense) program,\u201d Galeotti wrote. \u201cThe cost for this comes out of the education budget, while part of the aid and development budget is likely paying for the mercenaries fighting in Syria.\u201d\n\nOlga Oliker, a senior adviser and director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), mirrored that point. Oliker said different components of Russia\u2019s defense budget have been classified at different times, making them unavailable for analysis. Russia is also not unique in funding some defense-related items, like portions of its nuclear weapons program or military pensions, through sources other than its defense budget.\n\nThat, coupled with the fact that civil defense and paramilitary forces are left out of the budgetary equation, further muddies the funding waters. Underlining that point is evidence that Russian mercenaries with opaque funding sources have been linked to what would normally be regular military operations, including sometimes combat, in eastern Ukraine, Syria and the Central African Republic.\n\n\u201cThis makes year-on-year comparisons a challenge, and comparisons with other countries all the more so,\u201d Oliker said.\n\nThen there is the issue of force size and how it relates to the relative cost of living. As noted by Oliker, \u201cmaintaining a military force of 500,000 high-quality personnel in a country with lower salaries is obviously cheaper.\u201d\n\nFor example, in January it was announced that pay hikes would see a Russian lieutenant now earning 66,100 rubles ($1,006) a month. By contrast, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army earns between $3,496 and $4,839 per month. Higher related outlays will further be seen in military housing, food service medical care and bonuses.\n\nGaleotti said that that any windfalls from rising oil prices, for example, always have the potential of resulting in specially-mandated military allocations.\n\nEven so, from the high-end estimate of 25.5% to a notional cut of 5%, Russia\u2019s military spending did drop between 2016-17. The question is why.\n\nThe narrative Russia is presenting -- that defense spending cuts are part of some natural desire for the Kremlin to scale back its military operations just as it is embarking on a 10-year force modernization plan -- appears counterintuitive.\n\nRather, a drop in oil prices, Western sanctions related to Russia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine and related economic woes, are often cited as the main impetus behind the cuts.\n\nSiemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which carried out a study on Russia\u2019s defense cuts, said that in a time of austerity, the military was not the first thing to be cut.\n\n\"The military budget has been restricted by economic problems that the country has experienced since 2014,\" Wezeman told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, adding that Moscow first implemented infrastructure and education cuts until there was finally no choice but to \"spread the pain.\"\n\nThe other question is whether there really is \u201cno comparison\u201d between Russia and NATO because of the budgetary disparity.\n\nLeonid Bershidsky has argued that, nuclear parity notwithstanding, Russia is much better at getting more bang for its buck when it comes to projecting military force in the modern era.\n\n\u201cToday's wars aren't fought with fat wads of money,\u201d Bershidsky wrote. \u201cThe adversaries are mostly small, agile forces that aren't as well-resourced as nation states. Fighting them requires a combination of local knowledge, brute force applied only at important points in a conflict and ability to shift risks onto the shoulders of irregular fighters. Russia kept cutting its defense budget all through its participation in the Syrian war. Yabloko, an opposition party, earlier this year put the cost of the Syrian operation for Russia at about 140.4 billion rubles ($2.4 billion at the current exchange rate) since September, 2015; that's some 4% of what the U.S. allocated to overseas contingency operations in 2017 alone \u2013 and the outcome is as good as Russia could have expected.\u201d\u200b\n\nSimply put, Russia has proven adept at making due with less.\n\nUltimately, Russia\u2019s de facto annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, its outright annexation of Crimea, its ongoing occupation of Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region and its clandestine war in eastern Ukraine belie the claim that Russia itself is the victim of aggression by its neighbors.\n\n\u200bSo while it\u2019s true that Russia\u2019s military spending has taken a temporary dip, that in itself does not demonstrate a desire for peace with its neighbors.\n\nAnd so we find RT\u2019s report in this case is at best misleading.", "lang": "en"}
