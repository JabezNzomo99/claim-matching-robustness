United States-based manufacturer Remington Outdoor Company won the bidding for the rifle contract in October 2013, more than three years after Aquino took office.\n\nThe rifles by themselves were not worth P1.9 billion. Rather, it is the Joint Philippine Army-Philippine Marine Corps Assault Rifle Acquisition Project, under which the rifles were procured, that is worth an estimated P1.9 billion.\n\nThe defective rifles were also not \"dumped somewhere\" nor ordered repaired by Duterte.\n\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines during Aquino\u2019s term, not Duterte\u2019s, sent the rifles back to Remington to correct the defect.\n\nThe AFP got back all 44,186 repaired rifles in August 2015.\n\nThe News Gear's false story, which could have reached more than 110,000 people, was revived two days after the 9th death anniversary of Aquino's mother, former President Corazon Aquino.\n\nTraffic was largely generated from social media by the website's official Facebook page and News Twerk. The News Gear was created May 17.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
