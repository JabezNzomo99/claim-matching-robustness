While Mueller declined to reach a legal judgment as to whether the president obstructed justice, Barr and his deputy concluded Trump did not.\n\nBut Mueller completed his report without the Trump White House\u2019s full cooperation \u2014 and Barr\u2019s claim to the contrary is simply wrong. Not only did Trump refuse an in-person interview and supply written responses that Mueller found \"inadequate,\" but the president also tried on multiple occasions to shut down or curtail the investigation itself.\n\nBarr\u2019s claim employed some legalistic and rhetorical ju jitsu, and it\u2019s instructive to see his quote in its full context:\n\nBarr: \"The White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.\"\n\nAs the quote shows, after Barr touts the White House\u2019s \"full\" cooperation, he then injects language to narrow the universe of cooperation to something well short of \"full.\" He notes the administration provided \"unfettered access\" to campaign and White House documents, that they \"directed senior aides to testify freely\" and that Trump did not assert privilege.\n\nThose are measures of cooperation, to be sure. But they are far from an exhaustive list of the ways Mueller sought the White House\u2019s cooperation. More to the point, Barr\u2019s selective list overlooks Trump\u2019s explicit non-cooperation.\n\n\"Barr\u2019s statement was brazenly disingenuous and misleading,\" said Bradley Moss, an expert on national security law. \"It is only true in the narrowest of legal framings, and omits the Mueller report\u2019s detailed findings of the president\u2019s consistent and repeated efforts to obstruct or impede the investigation.\"\n\nOne key way in which Trump failed to cooperate was by denying Mueller an in-person interview.\n\nMueller and his team sought for more than a year to personally talk to the president \u2014 but they were ultimately rebuffed. Instead, the special counsel eventually agreed to accept Trump\u2019s written answers to questions.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s written responses were \"inadequate,\" Mueller said, and contained dozens of instances where Trump claimed not to recall the information sought by the special counsel. Mueller also noted that Trump declined to answer questions about obstruction of justice, or questions on events that occurred during the presidential transition.\n\nHere\u2019s how the report describes the back-and-forth with Trump\u2019s personal counsel:\n\nMueller: \"We informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects. We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he \u2018does not recall\u2019 or \u2018remember\u2019 or have an \u2018independent recollection\u2019 of information called for by the questions. Other answers were \u2018incomplete or imprecise.\u2019 \"\n\nBecause the written exchange gave investigators \"no opportunity to ask follow-up questions,\" Mueller\u2019s team again requested an in-person interview. Once again, Trump declined.\n\nUltimately, Mueller concluded, \"We viewed the written answers to be inadequate.\"\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office considered issuing a subpoena for Trump\u2019s testimony, an avenue that would have been fraught with thorny constitutional questions, Mueller said. Rather than risk a protracted court battle on that front, Mueller\u2019s team decided against a subpoena, noting that investigation already \"had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.\"\n\nPerhaps the strongest rebuttal to Barr\u2019s claim is the second volume of Mueller\u2019s report. In it, the special counsel documented some 10 \"key issues and events\" that his team examined as part of its obstruction investigation.\n\nThey included instances of Trump trying to impede the investigation or directing his staff to do so \u2014 including firing Mueller.\n\nIn one dramatic section, the report provides a window into Trump\u2019s distress over the news that a special counsel had been appointed in the wake of his firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\n\"Oh my God. This is terrible,\" the report quotes Trump as saying. \"This is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m f-----.\"\n\nTrump grew more alarmed following media reports that the special counsel\u2019s office would look into whether Trump obstructed justice, according to the report.\n\nIt describes a frantic Trump calling then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and ordering him to say Mueller should be removed due to conflicts of interest. McGahn refused.\n\n\"The president\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful,\" the Mueller report notes, \"but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.\"\n\nBarr said, \"The White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.\"\n\nTrump declined an in-person interview that Mueller\u2019s team sought for more than a year. In response to Trump\u2019s refusal, Mueller\u2019s team agreed to accept written responses. But those contained more than 30 instances in which Trump claimed not to remember the information being sought, and Mueller ultimately concluded the responses were \"inadequate.\"\n\nIn addition, the president tried on multiple occasions to shut down or curtail the investigation itself, including ordering White House counsel to fire Mueller, a directive that was refused.", "lang": "en"}
