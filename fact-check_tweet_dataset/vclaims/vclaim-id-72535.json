Robinson Jr., we thought we would take a look at the claim, which was by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) three days after the shooting.\n\nMadison police were called shortly before 6:30 p.m. when Robinson started jumping in front of cars on Williamson Street on Madison\u2019s east side. Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else.\n\nA police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized.\n\nThe shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. Robinson\u2019s death. One protest, three days after the shooting, drew more than 1,000 people to the State Capitol.\n\nNearly a year before he was killed, on April 25, 2014, Robinson, then 18, was arrested with three other people in connection with an armed home invasion at a Madison apartment. He pleaded guilty to felony armed robbery and received three years of probation.\n\nThe officer who shot Robinson, Matt Kenny, who is white, shot and killed a 48-year-old white man in the line of duty on July 15, 2007, after the man pointed what turned out to be a pellet gun at Kenny. The officer did not know the weapon was a pellet gun, and the district attorney cleared Kenny.\n\nThe Young, Gifted and Black Coalition based its claim on on racial disparities in Dane County.\n\nSo, although the claim was about Madison, the report examined the larger surrounding area.\n\nThe report was done by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group whose research is respected. The report said that in 2012, African-American adults were arrested in Dane County at a rate more than eight times that of whites.\n\nHere are the adult arrest rates per 1,000 adults in 2012:\n\nErica Nelson, the author of the report, told us the figures were developed from an unpublished report of the state Office of Justice Assistance. She said she is working on developing figures strictly for Madison, rather than Dane County, but wouldn\u2019t speculate on how the Madison rate might differ from the county rate.\n\nWhen the coalition first made its claim in the open letter, the police chief responded in a , saying:\n\n\"I have always agreed that the harmful impacts of racial disparity in Dane County are not in dispute. An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community.\"\n\nBut, he added: \"Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community's disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD.\"\n\nWhen we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter \"I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have \u2018rogue\u2019 cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist. There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore \u2018own\u2019 part of this problem.\"\n\nThe chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which \"includes big bedroom communities\" such as Fitchburg and Sun Prairie. Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison.\n\nThe Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said \"black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people\" in Madison.\n\nA report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults. However, the figures were for all of Dane County, not merely for Madison, the county\u2019s largest city.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.\n\nNote: After we published this item, the author of the research report cited above said she generated new figures strictly for the City of Madison, rather than Dane County, and provided them to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Erica Nelson said that based on a preliminary review of the Madison Police Department\u2019s 2013 annual report, black adults are 10.9 times more likely than white adults to be arrested in Madison.", "lang": "en"}
