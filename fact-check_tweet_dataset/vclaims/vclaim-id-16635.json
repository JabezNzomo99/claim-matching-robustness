That story was posted in March 2016. The picture now circulating on social media is a cropped version of the original and \u201cTARRIFF EXEMPT\u201d has been stamped in red on one corner of the box.\n\nBeyond the obvious error that the word tariff is spelled wrong, the shoes aren\u2019t subject to the new tariffs imposed under the Trump administration so far. The increased tariffs on goods from China affect a broad range of goods \u2014 primarily electronics and industrial items \u2014 but shoes are nowhere on the list of imports that would be subject to them.\n\nHowever, shoes are included in a list of additional items the administration proposed in May to be added to those subject to the tariffs. Dozens of U.S. shoe companies signed a letter to Trump asking the president to \u201cbring this trade war to an end.\u201d\n\nBut Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion brand is now defunct and not involved in the recent tariff debate.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
