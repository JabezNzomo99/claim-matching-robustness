Only cats from infected households or where their owners are self-isolating, and only if the cat is happy to be kept indoors. Some cats cannot stay indoors due to stress-related medical reasons.\u201d\n\nThe BBC has since changed the article to reflect this clarification.\n\nA small number of pets around the world have tested positive for the new coronavirus, although there is no evidence that dogs or cats can pass the disease to humans.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the new coronavirus might be carried between people on an animal\u2019s fur, according to the BVA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why our main advice for pet owners continues to be to practise good hand hygiene,\u201d Ms Dos Santos says. \u201cAnd, as a precaution, for pet owners who have Covid-19 or who are self-isolating we are recommending that you keep your cat indoors if possible, during that time.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
