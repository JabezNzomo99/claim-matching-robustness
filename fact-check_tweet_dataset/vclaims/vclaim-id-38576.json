James Inhofe now serves as the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) chief of staff.\n\nInhofe currently serves as a senator for the state of Oklahoma. A spokesperson for the EPA told the Daily Caller that former EPA Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Molina took over the chief of staff role in an acting capacity in late February.\n\nThe viral image, posted Feb. 18, falsely claims that Inhofe, who currently chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, now serves as the EPA\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cSo remember the idiot who brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to \u2018prove global warming is a hoax?\u201d reads the caption. \u201cHe\u2019s now Trump\u2019s EPA\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d\n\nBut a spokesperson for the EPA told the Caller in an email that Molina has actually taken over the role in an acting capacity. (RELATED: Were The First 23 Black Senators Republicans?)\n\n\u201cRyan Jackson\u2019s last day as Chief of Staff at the EPA was February 21st, at which time Michael Molina became Acting Chief of Staff,\u201d Molly Block said.\n\nRyan Jackson, who the EPA still lists as the chief of staff on its website, left the agency to join the National Mining Association as a lobbyist, according to The Hill. He previously served as a top aid for Inhofe and as a staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, according to the EPA website.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Feb. 14 that Mandy Gunasekara, a former top EPA air policy official, has been tapped to return as the agency\u2019s chief of staff, but the EPA hasn\u2019t made any announcements to that effect at the time of publication.", "lang": "en"}
