No, that's not true: The billionaire philanthropist Gates, the immunologist Fauci, and the major pharmaceutical companies have not lost a major high court decision as claimed in articles and videos, which fail to cite the name of the case.\n\nThe claim originated in an article titled \"Breaking News - Vaccine Update\" published by BeforeItsNews.com on April 25, 2020, and later in a video posted on YouTube on May 15, 2020, titled \"VICTORY - Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci & Big Pharma lost a Massive Supreme Court Case in USA\" (archived here). The video's description reads:\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nThe video features a man, who said he is from Georgia, breathlessly reading the BeforeItsNews article, interpreting it as a major victory against those promoting vaccines to guard against diseases. The article reads:\n\nFederal funding for the CDC has not been pulled. The agency continues to be the federal government's chief weapon in the battle against infectious diseases. President Trump did announced U.S. contributions to the World Health Organization would be withheld, but it was not the result of a court case. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gives money to support health programs and it is not dependent on federal funding.\n\nThe article cites what it claimed were \"the huge legal and practical implications\" of the fictional court victory:\n\n\n\nThis means that the US Department of Health and Human Services and all vaccine makers have been deceiving the American people for over 30 years about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; this may ultimately mean that the continuing existence -- at least in their current form -- of five US \"healthcare\" agencies is now in doubt: the CDC, the FDA, the IOM, the NIH and the \"Health\" part of DHHS itself!\n\n\n\nThis may also threaten the existence of state medical boards and exclusive medical guilds like the AMA. This means that vaccine makers have been fraudulently exempt from what all other pharmaceutical drug makers have been forced to do concerning biannual recertification for quality and effectiveness -- meaning that their vaccines have never been tested for quality and have had no proven safety or effectiveness for over 30 years.\n\nSince the Supreme Court decision does not exist, those impacts are not real.\n\nAnother claim in the article could cause a reader trouble if they believe it and act on it:\n\nThis case can now be legally cited by all parents fraudulently mandated by any government/ organizational regulation/ requirements that they must vaccinate their children for school or any other activity to stop the forced vaccination of their children. This case can now be legally cited by all employees being mandated by their employers to be vaccinated in order to retain their jobs. This case can now be legally cited by all those who seek compensation for vaccine injury.\n\nSince the article does not give the case citation, it would be hard for a person to invoke it. Of course, there is no citation to cite.\n\nLead Stories previously debunked a similar claim about a vaccine court case titled Fake News: Courts Did NOT Quietly Confirm MMR Vaccine Causes Autism\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes beforeitsnews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
