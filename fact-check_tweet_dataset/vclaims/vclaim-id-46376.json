It further states that these three elements are present in coffee.\n\nThe post reads, \u2018COFFEE AND ITS BENEFITS. Breaking News from CNN :-*_ *Dr. Li Wenliang*, China\u2019s hero doctor who told the truth about Corona Virus and later died due to the same disease, had documented casefiles for research purposes and had in the casefiles proposed a cure that would significantly decrease the impact of the COVID \u2013 19 Virus on the human body. The chemical *Methylxanthine*, *Theobromine* and *Theophylline* stimulate compounds that can ward off these virus in a human with atleast an average immune system. Whats more shocking is that these complex words that were so difficult for people in China to understand is actually called *COFFEE * in India, YES, our regular COFFEE has all these chemicals already in it. The main Methylxanthine in COFFEE is the stimulant caffeine. Other Methylxanthines found in COFFEE are two chemically similar compounds, Theobromine and Theophylline. The COFFEE plant creates these chemicals as a way to ward off insects and other animals. Who would have known that all the solution to these virus would be a simple cup of COFFEE and that is the reason so many patients in China are being cured. The hospital staff in china has started serving COFFEE to the patients 3 times a day, And the effect is finally in *Wuhan* \u201cThe centre of this Pandemic\u201d has been contained and community transmission has almost stopped. Please Share this message to your friends and family to make them aware about this blessing in the form of COFFEE in your kitchen.\u2019\n\nAs a first step, we checked whether the stated three chemicals are present in coffee. We found an article in the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. According to the articles, these compounds are present in coffee and other beverages like tea but it is difficult to claim that coffee can cure coronavirus at this point of time since there is no evidence.\n\nFurther, we fact-checked if coffee is a cure or a prevention technique for Coronavirus on the WHO website. It did not mention anything along these lines.\n\nSince India, where coffee is a staple drink, has recorded more than 3 lakh cases, it disproves the fact that those drinking coffee will be able to ward off the virus.\n\nHence, the news is fake and cannot be believed.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
