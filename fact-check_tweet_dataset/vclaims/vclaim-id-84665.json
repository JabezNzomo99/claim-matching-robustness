It has been viewed nearly 68,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cOnly in China! #COVID19 coronavirus disinfection rainbow.\u201d Below is a screenshot of the tweet:\n\nThe same video was also shared here on Twitter and here on YouTube, both with a similar claim.\n\nAt least 2,118 people have been killed by the coronavirus and in mainland China alone over 74,000 people have been infected, AFP reported.
