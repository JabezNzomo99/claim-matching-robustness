The report credited a study by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) as the source.\n\nAccording to the ADR report, 33 out of 62 MLAs of Aam Aadmi Party have serious criminal cases against them. The report includes a comparative study of criminal cases declared by candidates in 2015 and 2020. As per the report, since 2015 there has been an increase in the number of candidates who declared criminal and serious criminal cases.\n\nThe subheading \u2018party-wise candidates with criminal cases\u2019 on page 5 states, \u201cAmong major parties, 42(60%) out of 70 candidates analysed from AAP, 26(39%) out of 67 candidates analysed from BJP, 18(27%) out of 66 candidates analysed from INC, 12 (18%) out of 66 candidates analysed from BSP and 3(60%) out of 5 candidates from NCP have declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits.\u201d\n\nPage six states, \u201cAmong major parties, 36(51%) out of 70 candidates analysed from AAP, 17(25%) out of 67 candidates analysed from BJP, 13(20%) out of 66 candidates analysed from INC, 10 (15%) out of 66 candidates analysed from BSP and 2(40%) out of 5 candidates from NCP have declared serious criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits.\u201d\n\nThe same page, under the sub-heading \u2018candidates with declared cases related to crime against women\u2019 states, \u201c32 candidates have declared cases related to crime against women. Out of 32 candidates, 1 candidate has declared cases related to rape (IPC Section-376).\u201d\n\nThe details \u2018Candidates with Declared Criminal Cases\u2019 can be viewed onward page 78 in the report. Page 122 mentions Mohinder Goyal from Rithala who has declared rape charges against himself. Goyal also has charges related to \u2018Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.\u2019 As per the report, Goyal isn\u2019t convicted of any of the charges against him.\n\nAlt News also searched Goyal\u2019s credentials on My Neta and found that one serious case is pending against him.\n\nAccording to the ADR report, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan from Okhla, Prakash from Deoli, Abhay Verma from Laxminagar, Jarnail Singh from Tilak Nagar and Dinesh Mohania from Sangam Vihar have been charged with IPC 354, assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty. But only one case related to rape is stated in the ADR report which is against Goyal.\n\nTherefore, the claim made by Dr Ajay Alok is false. 40 out of 62 AAP MLAs are not accused of rape. Even after the conclusion of Delhi assembly elections, rumours are being spread on social media about AAP. Ahead of the polls, a fake list was circulated to claim that most of the candidates of AAP hail from the Muslim community.", "lang": "en"}
