He suggested pharmacists were gaining billions while the U.S. military reaped an \u201copportunity to test\u201d weaponizing the virus.\n\nThe Russian media reports appeared to be part of a domestic disinformation campaign.\n\nThe coronavirus conspiracies did not appear in the Kremlin\u2019s foreign language news agencies.\n\nAnti-U.S. conspiracies are common in Russia. They include a thoroughly refuted story about the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory, known as the \u201cLugar lab,\u201d in Georgia, the former Soviet republic.\n\nRussian sources claimed the Pentagon was using the lab to create and test biological weapons, causing hundreds of deaths in the local population.\n\nThat conspiracy was proven completely fabricated by multiple investigations and fact checks, including by Polygraph.info. In reality, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the drug company Gilead were working a joint project with Georgian health officials to combat hepatitis C using antiviral medicines.\n\nOther discredited conspiracy theories circulated by Russian media claimed the U.S. created the Ebola virus as a biological weapon and tried to infect Latin American leaders with a deadly cancer virus.", "lang": "en"}
