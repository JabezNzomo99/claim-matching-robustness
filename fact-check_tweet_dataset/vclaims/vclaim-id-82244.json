Bush, only to have it wrecked by his son George W. Bush \u2014 and Barack Obama had to pick up the pieces. As she also said in her speech, Republicans \u201cjust don\u2019t know the theory of original sin, because we wouldn\u2019t have had to have a recovery if we hadn\u2019t had the kind of poor management and bad economic policies that put us into the ditch in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ending of this bubble was the biggest factor turning the surplus into a deficit. The Bush tax cuts were very much secondary in this picture, as were his wars and the Medicare drug plan,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe Bush administration might deserve serious grief for all three of these, but they were not the story of the end of the Clinton-era surpluses. The end of the stock bubble was the end of the budget surpluses and that one cannot be blamed on President Bush.\u201d\n\nIn other words, much of the money that Gore had said he would have saved for paying down the debt, after paying for all of his other projects, would not have been there. Of course, we can\u2019t go back in time and determine exactly what would have happened in a Gore presidency. But the numbers do not add up for Hillary Clinton\u2019s claim that there would have been enough of a surplus to pay down the national debt if a Republican had not won the presidency in 2000.", "lang": "en"}
