This is essentially a weakened version of the virus, patented with the aim of eventually developing it into a vaccine against the disease for birds and other animals.\n\nThis patent is held by the UK-based Pirbright Institute, researchers of viral diseases in livestock.\n\nThe Pirbright Institute is not owned by Jacob Rothschild. We can find no evidence of any link between Mr Rothschild and the Institute.\n\nThe Institute says that in 2018/19 it received \u00a312.6 million from public funds through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and \u00a335 million from grants and commercial activity.", "lang": "en"}
