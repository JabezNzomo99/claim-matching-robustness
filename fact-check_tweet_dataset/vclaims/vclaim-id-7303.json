Ohr is less of a central player, but as a reader service, we will try to disentangle the president\u2019s tweets and explain what is known \u2013 and unknown \u2013 about Ohr\u2019s actions. We will not offer a Pinocchio rating.\n\nOhr\u2019s wife, Nellie (Trump spelled her name wrong), is a consultant and Russia specialist who has done some work for Fusion GPS. (Bruce Ohr\u2019s 278e financial disclosure form lists her as an \u201cindependent contractor.\u201d) The majority report of the House Intelligence Committee said she was \u201cemployed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump.\u201d A court filing by Simpson said Fusion GPS contracted with her \u201cto help our company with its research and analysis of Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nOf course, we now know that the FBI earlier had relied in part on information provided by Steele to successfully obtain a court order to monitor the communications of a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page. But Steele and Simpson did not know that \u2014 and in fact, the FBI had cut off contact with Steele in November 2016 after learning he had been speaking to the media about his findings.\n\nIt turned out also that Steele and Ohr had been in contact before the election, though it\u2019s unclear how much Ohr knew about Steele\u2019s work for Fusion. But on July 1, 2016, shortly after Steele filed the first report for Fusion and only a few days before he met with an FBI agent to discuss his findings, Steele wrote to Ohr: \"There is something separate I wanted to discuss with you informally and separately. It concerns our favorite business tycoon!\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 8, John Solomon of the Hill published portions of Ohr\u2019s notes on his Dec. 10, 2016, conversation with Simpson, which have not been publicly released. Solomon described much of the conversation as second- or third-hand gossip. One puzzling notation by Ohr: \u201cMuch of the collection about the Trump campaign ties to Russia comes from a former Russian intelligence officer (? not entirely clear) who lives in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAs yet, there is little evidence to support Trump\u2019s contention that Ohr helped Steele find dirt on Trump. He appears to be only a messenger. At this point, it\u2019s unclear what Ohr even told his friend at the FBI about Steele\u2019s information and whether any of that reporting ended up influencing the Russia investigation. There is also, as yet, no evidence that senior Justice Department officials were even aware of Ohr\u2019s sideline communications with Steele about the Russian probe.", "lang": "en"}
