The claim is false; the images date back to between 2004 and 2013.\n\nOne photo of rain over a verdant forest and winding river was published in this Facebook post on August 22, 2019. It has been shared more than 42,000 times.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cIt is now raining in amazon. Now tell me there is no God\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Amazon rainforest has been ravaged by fire since early August, as this AFP report explains.\n\nThe same photo was published here on Facebook with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the image dates back to at least 2013.\n\nA reverse image search using TinEye found the photo published here on the website for Brazilian film production company Gullane as part of their 2013 film \u201cAmazonia\u201d about the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe photo appears as the sixth picture in a gallery of images at the bottom of the web page. Below is a screenshot of the picture as it appears on the Gullane website:\n\nAnother misleading post published on Facebook here shared two photos of what appears to be rainfall in a forest. It has been shared more than 12,000 times.\n\nThe post's caption states: \"It's now raining in Amazon!! Now tell me that there's no God!!\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the second misleading post:\n\nThe same images were shared here, here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A reverse image search on Google found the first photo in the misleading post published in this April 2009 article on the website for Pesquisa, a Brazilian magazine which specialises in scientific research.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the article:\n\nThe photo was credited to Margi Moss, who wrote on her Facebook account here that she took the photo in 2004 in Acre, a state in northern Brazil. Her Facebook post is embedded below.\n\nA Bing search for the second photo in the misleading post found this YouTube video published on March 27, 2013.\n\nThe video's caption translates to English as: \"Rain in the PNY forest\".\n\n\"PNY\" refers to the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador.\n\nThe video was uploaded by a YouTube account entitled 'EcuadorianAmazonLastMinute JUNGLE TOURS'. It is embedded below.\n\nThe photo in the misleading post corresponds with the YouTube video taken at the 22 second mark, as shown below.", "lang": "en"}
