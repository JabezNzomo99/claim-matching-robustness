Wolchesky argued (unsuccessfully) during his trial that \u201cpedophiles are a persecuted minority, and that the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice wrongfully makes this conduct a crime.\u201d\n\nIt is true that in January 2020 Wolchesky received a favorable ruling from an appellate panel. However, he didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d an appeal of his conviction, and that ruling had nothing to do with the court\u2019s reconsidering the merits of Wolchesky\u2019s already rejected argument at trial that pedophiles are victims of discrimination, as the meme falsely suggests. Rather, the appeal was granted on narrow grounds related to Wolchesky\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial \u2014 seven years elapsed between his 2009 arrest and the commencement of his trial in 2016, and a lower court was ordered to examine that issue:\n\nThe legal victory was not based on what the court called the defendant\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d strategy of promoting pedophilia but on the constitutional right to a speedy trial. The now-31-year-old Gary Wolchesky was first arrested in 2009 but it took seven years before his trial started. In a 44-page decision released Jan. 28, a three-judge appellate panel said that part of this delay was the fault of Wolchesky, who insisted on representing himself. But part of the delay also was the result of the investigation and new charges that were later added on. The appellate decision said that seven years was a \u201csubstantial period of time, one that requires scrutiny.\u201d The decision orders a lower court to examine in order determine whether any delays in the trial attributed to prosecutors were legitimate. The appellate decision dismissed Wolchesky\u2019s other points of appeal concerning the fairness of the trial and the sentencing, arguing that any errors in evidence, comments by prosecutors or jury instruction were \u201cminimal\u201d considering that he \u201cchose to place his sexual predisposition with respect to young boys before the jury as the foundation of his defense strategy.\u201d \u201cThe child victims in this case presented compelling evidence of the harm defendant inflicted by befriending them, confusing them and ultimately inducing them to engage in perverse sexual acts,\u201d the decision says.\n\nIn short, no legal \u201cprecedents\u201d related to pedophilia are being set by this case, for \u201cHollywood\u201d or anyone else \u2014 just the continued application of the Sixth Amendment\u2018s guarantee that \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
