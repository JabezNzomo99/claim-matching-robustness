The headline: \"Malia Obama suspended after racist anti-white attack goes viral.\"\n\nNeither of these stories are true. Malia is currently attending Harvard University, and Sasha is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington.\n\nThe story was copied from the website America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which self-identifies as a satire site. Conservative Columns does not include a disclaimer on its home page or on the story.\n\nIn addition to the identical content, the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense article appears under the same headline as conservativecolumns.com, and it\u2019s filed in the site\u2019s category of \"You'll have to wait for the Snopes debunk to tell If it's \u2018satire\u2019 or not.\"\n\nThis story was copied from a conservative satire site and then touted as fact.
