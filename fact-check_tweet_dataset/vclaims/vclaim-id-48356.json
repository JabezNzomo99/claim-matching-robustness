They are now hiding behind the names and faces of television host Willie Revillame and Senator Manny Pacquiao.\n\nOn April 22, three FB pages -- Wllie (sic) Revillame. Rxndolgaming, Manyy pacqiauo (sic) cle and Manny pacman Pasa-- each posted they will be raffling off iPhone units and millions-worth of cash. Netizens were instructed to share the post to eight to 15 public groups, send a message to their account, and register through a link, before they could receive their prizes in \u201ctwo or 25 minutes.\u201d\n\nThese giveaways are fake. All three posts employed common tactics used by poser accounts giving bogus prizes.\n\nFirst, the three accounts are not official FB profiles or pages of the personalities they named.\n\nRevillame\u2019s lone official page carries the title of his television show Wowowin, while Pacquaio has three: his own page, his page as a senator, and his foundation\u2019s page. There are no recent announcements of any online giveaway on any of the mentioned pages.\n\nRevillame on April 21 warned about \u201cgroups of FB pages\u201d duping people by posing as the official Wowowin page. The Manny Pacquiao Foundation, on the other hand, issued an advisory last month regarding scams that use the foundation\u2019s name to \u201cphish information\u201d from netizens.\n\nSecond, the imposter accounts\u2019 modus operandi is common among bogus raffles on Facebook: the prize the netizens will get depends on the first letter of their name. They would need to send this letter through a private message, and then register through a link -- which always redirects to a free movie streaming site.\n\nLastly, the posts carry photos swiped from different sources on the Web, in an attempt to add legitimacy to their modus.\n\u2022 A picture of the senator giving away money to Makati residents in December 2019, as shown in a video taken by a netizen\n\u2022 A 2018 photo of Apple products uploaded by a store in Italy\n\u2022 An image of Revillame from Facebook as seen in a 2013 Rappler report\n\u2022 A 2007 photo of a woman who won a local cooking contest in the United States\n\nThe three bogus posts surfaced over a week after Revillame announced that Wowowin is back on air. The show is famous for giving away cash prizes to its viewers.\n\nThese have a combined total of 7,100 reactions, 32,500 comments, and 36,300 shares.\n\nA day before the three fake raffles were posted, three other FB accounts -- Wllie (sic) Revillame Wowowin, Manny Pacquiao Nesa and Financial Planer (sic) -- also published similar bogus giveaways. They took down their posts a day later.\n\nManyy pacqiauo cle was created in 2017, Manny pacman Pasa in 2019, and Wllie Revillame. Rxndolgaming on March 20.", "lang": "en"}
