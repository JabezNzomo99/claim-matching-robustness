The claim was attributed to a \"Taiwanese senior doctor\". The claim is false; health experts warned against using needles to treat stroke victims, saying anyone showing symptoms of a stroke should be taken to a hospital.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on April 26, 2019. It has been shared more than 60,000 times.\n\nThe post's Thai-language caption translates to English in part: \u201cA Taiwanese senior doctor has passed on this method of helping patients with hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n\u201cThe method to conduct first aid (release the blood). If you have a hypodermic syringe, that would be best. If you don\u2019t have it you can use the sewing needles to all the fingers\u2019 of the patient to let the blood out. A few minutes later, the patient will be recovered.\n\n\u201cIf the patient has a crooked mouth, pinch the patient\u2019s ears and inject needles into ear lobes to let the blood out, and then the patient will be recovered\u2026 Wait until the patient is recovered, and then you can send his/her to the doctor.\u201d\n\nA hemorrhagic stroke is a condition that results from a ruptured blood vessel in the brain which can cause \u201clasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death\u201d, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA similar claim was also shared here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nDr. Adichan Chuajinda, a specialist doctor at Thailand\u2019s Phra Nangklao Hospital\u2019s Department of Internal Medicine said the claim was \u201cabsolutely false\u201d.\n\nDuring a phone conversation with AFP on May 26, 2020, he said: \u201cIt is absolutely false. Just because you have symptoms such as crooked mouth, and the weakening of muscles doesn\u2019t mean you have a hemorrhagic stroke. The best thing to do is to send the patient to the hospital immediately and the doctor will need to conduct an X-ray test to diagnose the symptoms and treat the patients accordingly.\u201d\n\nThai Health Promotion Foundation, an autonomous government agency that promotes healthy living also published this report on February 26, 2018 which advises against pricking a hemorrhagic stroke patient with needles.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cWarning signs of hemorrhagic stroke including weakening of legs, inability to walk and talk, severe headache. If you find a close person with similar symptoms, please take him/her to the hospital as soon as possible. Don\u2019t use needles to inject the patient\u2019s body because it could cause death.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check debunked a similar false claim about treating stroke victims with needles here.", "lang": "en"}
