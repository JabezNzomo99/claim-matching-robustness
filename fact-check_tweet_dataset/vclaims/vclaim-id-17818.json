We couldn\u2019t find any credible news report ascribing the statement to Adityanath.\n\nAlt News found that the claim originated from a now-deleted website, Rhumor Times. The statement attributed to Yogi Adityanath first appeared in an article published by the website on April 10, 2018. The archived version of this article can be accessed here.\n\nThe \u2018About Us\u2019 section of the website explicitly mentioned, \u201crhumor times is a satire and humor website. the website publishes rumor with humor.\u201d \n\n\n\nSocial media users should be circumspect while circulating statements attributed to politicians or celebrities without verifying the credibility of the source. In the past as well, a fake newspaper clipping was circulated on social media ascribing a quote to Amit Shah calling the Baniya community \u2018thieves\u2019 and \u2018cheaters\u2019. Fake quotes have also been attributed to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, AAP leader Raghav Chadda and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.", "lang": "en"}
