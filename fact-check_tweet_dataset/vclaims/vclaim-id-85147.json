But the Obama campaign pushed hard against that interpretation. Yet here her comments are dredged up again in an attack ad.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values, is he somebody that respects family, is a good and decent person? So our view is that if you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House. So we\u2019ve adjusted our schedule to make sure that our girls are first, so when he\u2019s traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning. I get the girls ready. I get them off. I go and do trips. I\u2019m home before bedtime.\u201d\n\nThen-Sen. Barack Obama also disputed the media interpretation in a conference call with reporters. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s been listening to Michelle on the stump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s talked about the importance of family, and the need for our family to be sure that we\u2019re thinking about our kids during the process of this campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clintons certainly did have a hard time running the White House and their own house during the Monica Lewinsky affair as independent counsel Kenneth Starr and his henchmen began snooping around and President Clinton was impeached by Congress,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo you can see where I was going with this. It didn\u2019t take a huge leap of logic. My mistake was not grabbing Michelle Obama when she left to ask for further elaboration \u2014 I was waiting to hear her husband speak.\u201d\n\nSo this was all discussed and litigated at the time. Certainly some networks ran with the idea that it was a slam at Clinton \u2014 Fox News appears to have repeatedly brought up the line for months afterward \u2014 but clearly the Obama campaign rushed to dispute the negative interpretation.\n\nMedia critic Howard Kurtz, then host of CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources, also was puzzled. \u201cWhen, in fact, if you look at it in context, she wasn\u2019t talking about Hillary at all,\u201d he said on an Aug. 26 broadcast. \u201cShe was talking about sort of her own family trying to deal with the pressures of a presidential run.\u201d\n\nThe ad introduces the clip with this language: \u201cIf you really want to know who Hillary Clinton is, let\u2019s hear from those who know her best.\u201d Then after the clip runs, the ad concludes: \u201cMichelle Obama doesn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of an endorsement.\u201d\n\nKristina Hernandez, a spokeswoman for Make America Number 1, defended the use of the clip. \u201cIt certainly was considered by many to be a knock on the Clintons when it was said during the 2007/08 primaries,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should be able to judge for themselves, and thanks to the First Amendment we can give them the opportunity to make that judgment.\u201d\n\nWe initially were inclined to think this was worth Three Pinocchios, given that the comments could be open to interpretation. But given the immediate pushback at the time by the Obama campaign \u2014 the email and call from the spokeswoman, the conference call by Barack Obama, the puzzlement of Michelle Obama \u2014 we concluded it is ridiculous that this ad twists Michelle Obama\u2019s words so out of context.\n\nAlthough Hernandez says people should be able to judge for themselves, the ad actually gives viewers no opportunity to see the comments properly in context, with Obama talking about arranging bedtime and travel schedules. In fact, the ad falsely asserts, against significant evidence, that these words are about Hillary Clinton \u2014 and that Michelle Obama does not trust Clinton.", "lang": "en"}
