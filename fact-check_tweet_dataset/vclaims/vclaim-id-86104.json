Another favorite is that the president has repealed 22 federal regulations for every new regulation placed on the books. This supposedly exceeds a campaign promise to repeal two regulations for every one implemented.\n\nBut, as we have reported before, the claim of eliminating more regulations than any previous president simply cannot be verified, as there is not enough data to support this statement. There is data that indicates that growth in regulations has slowed significantly under President Trump, but that\u2019s apparently not a good-enough story to tell, from the administration\u2019s perspective.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s \u201cContract With the American Voter,\u201d issued Oct. 22, 2016, he pledged that for every federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Shortly after taking office, the president signed an executive order that aimed to put this policy into effect. The order also said that the cost of any new regulation should be offset by eliminating regulations with the same costs to businesses.\n\nCary Coglianese, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, faulted the list for including many deregulatory actions that were relatively minor, compared with the more substantial regulatory actions. \u201cIt is not too much of an exaggeration to say that administration officials are removing 22 \u2018Peter Rabbit\u2019 books from the regulators\u2019 shelves for every one \u2018War and Peace\u2019 they add,\u201d he wrote.\n\nClyde Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute crunched the numbers and concluded that after Trump\u2019s first year, the administration had taken 62 deregulatory actions and 15 regulatory actions, for a ratio of 4 to 1. In a recent update, accounting for information contained in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s spring agenda, Crews updated the list to a total of 149 deregulatory actions to 29 regulatory actions, for a ratio of nearly 5 to 1.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely significant, and it shows how difficult it is to roll back administrative regulations, regardless of the philosophy in the White House,\u201d Crews said. \u201cThe difficulty will only increase, because it becomes harder to achieve the two-for-one stance once the \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 is picked. Congress needs to act, and we do see those stars align every generation or so, but there\u2019s not a bipartisan appetite for regulatory reform right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has promised deep cuts to regulation, but it generally takes a new rule to undo an old rule,\u201d Dooling wrote. \u201cThe deep reductions in regulatory activity shown above suggest that, while the Trump administration has staunched the flow of new regulations, it has not taken all necessary steps to remove old regulations from the books.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vice president was referencing the most recent numbers reported in the final 2017 Fall Unified Agenda, released in December of 2017, which reported 22 deregulatory actions for every 1 new regulatory action introduced,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThe 2018 Spring Unified Agenda, released in May of 2018, did not provide updates or numbers, it simply laid out a regulatory road map for the year. These numbers will be provided in the final 2018 Fall Unified Agenda.\u201d\n\nThe administration has also touted the claim that in fiscal 2017, agencies saved more than $8 billion in present-value regulatory costs, or $570 million a year. But this is not the same as the rules listed in the 22-to-1 ratio. More than half of the total comes from the repeal of a federal acquisition rule that lawmakers pushed through Congress early in the Trump administration.\n\nThere\u2019s really no need to gild the lily like this. The 22-to-1 figure is especially not credible, as even analysts sympathetic to the administration\u2019s mission have said it is overstated. It should be dropped as a talking point even before the fiscal year is completed. Given what the current regulatory agenda looks like, there is little prospect to sustain that pace, unless the accounting gets even fishier.", "lang": "en"}
