Can we co-relate it and say that it was Ordained that when the Govt of the Lotus Party will come then Ram Family will be reinstalled Respectfully under the Shine of Diyas.....(As is expected on 5th August in Ayodhya.....Real Homecoming into Ayodhya?????) JAI SRI RAM to all Hindus. One side of the coin feature the lotus and Om, a Hindu religious symbol. The value of the coin is mentioned to be '2 Anna'. Further, the year 1818 is inscribed, and 'East India Company'. The Logical Indian received a request to verify the claims.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Museum has documented the history of coinage in India. Below are screenshots from RBI's website which show that coins from the British Colonisation does not resemble the coin seen in the viral photograph.\n\nAccording to the information on the RBI website, the coins of Bengal were developed along the Mughal pattern, those of Madras were struck along South Indian lines both in design and metrology (Pagoda) as well as along Mughal designs. The English coins of Western India developed along Mughal as well as English patterns. It was only in 1717 AD that the English obtained permission from the Emperor Farrukhsiyar to coin Mughal money at the Bombay mint. By the early 1830, the English had become the dominant power in India. The rise of one dominant power after over a hundred years of turmoil, enabled the enactment of the Coinage Act of 1835 and for uniform coinage to be issued.\n\nThe coins issued after 1840 bore the portrait of Queen Victoria. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India. BoomLive quoted a source familiar with numismatics or the study of coins as saying that the coin seen in the viral photograph had features of Ramatanka or 'temple tokens.' Temple tokens are not used as legal tender, but tokens (tankas) related to Hindu temples. They are usually for religious pilgrims to carry for good luck. Usual features of these include Hindu deities and other such symbols. Fantasy temple tokens can be bought on online shopping sites.\n\nThe Logical Indian reached out to numismatist and author Mohit Kapoor, South Asian chapter of the Oriental Numismatic Society saying that the coins in the viral image is a fantasy issue. \"The image of the coin is not a legitimate issue as the East India Company never struck such coins.This is part of a long series of Fantasy issues struck more as Souvenirs,\" he said.
