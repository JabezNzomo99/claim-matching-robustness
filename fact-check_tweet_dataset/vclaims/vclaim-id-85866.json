But it turned out he was asked about specific actions, which he previously had said could not be done unless he was \u201cking\u201d or \u201cthe emperor.\u201d Thus we concluded he had flip-flopped.\n\n2: Giuliani\u2019s claim that 93 percent of black murder victims are killed by other blacks\n\nContext often matters. During a debate over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani asserted that 93 percent of blacks are killed by other blacks, without acknowledging that the statistic is roughly similar for white-on-white murders. Thus he earned Two Pinocchios, though some readers vehemently disagreed with the ruling.\n\n3: Obama\u2019s claim that George H.W. Bush gave relief to \u201940 percent\u2019 of undocumented immigrants\n\nA key selling point for Obama\u2019s immigration action is that George H.W. Bush took a similar step that affected 1.5 million people \u2014 roughly the same percentage of illegal immigrants at the time as Obama\u2019s actions. But we demonstrated that virtually all of the Bush administration estimates at the time were significantly lower than 1.5 million. Indeed, the estimate given at the announcement of the policy was just 100,000.\n\n4: Did Jonathan Gruber earn \u2018almost $400,000\u2019 from the Obama administration?\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) earned a rare Geppetto Checkmark for correctly asserting that MIT economist Jonathan Gruber earned nearly $400,000 for helping the Obama administration on the health-care law. We showed that Gruber also earned substantial sums advising states on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n5: Obama\u2019s claim that Keystone XL crude would go \u2018everywhere else\u2019 but the United States\n\nTwice during his trip to Asia, President Obama suggested that Canadian crude oil that passed through the Keystone XL pipeline would simply go on the world markets. But that is incorrect, earning the president Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
