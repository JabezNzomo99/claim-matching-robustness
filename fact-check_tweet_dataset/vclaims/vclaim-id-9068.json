That\u2019s just who she is.\"\n\nAs Bernie Sanders supporters continued to protest Clinton\u2019s win, Sanders made a motion to suspend the rules during the roll call vote and select Clinton as the nominee.\n\nBefore Bill Clinton took the stage, mothers of black Americans whose deaths sparked nationwide demonstrations said they supported Hillary Clinton after meeting with her to talk about their concerns about gun violence and criminal justice reforms. The \"Mothers of the Movement\" included the mothers of Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, among others.\n\n\"(Hillary Clinton) doesn\u2019t build walls around her heart,\" said Lucia McBath, whose son, Jordan Davis, was killed in 2012 following a dispute over loud music. \"Not only did she listen to our problems, she invited us to become a part of the solution, and that\u2019s what we are going to do.\"\n\nWe fact-checked Clinton\u2019s address, as well as other speakers from the night. (Here\u2019s our rundown of the DNC\u2019s first night.)\n\nBill Clinton bragged about his wife\u2019s effort to tackle health care reform with a claim about expanding healthcare to children.\n\n\"In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids,\" Clinton said. \"There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done, piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.\"\n\nAccording to Medicaid, CHIP insures more than 8 million children. The late-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., received much of the credit for CHIP, because he shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress, and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican cosponsor.\n\nIn 2007, Kennedy vouched for Clinton\u2019s vital role in CHIP, saying, \"The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\nThat notion was seconded by Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time.\n\nPoint being, Clinton did work behind the scenes to create the program to offer healthcare to children, but Bill tip-toes around the scope of his wife\u2019s role. We rated this claim Mostly True.\n\nCountries viewed the United States more favorably after Clinton served as secretary of state, Bill Clinton said.\n\nHe cited his wife as \"one of the reasons the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it.\"\n\nClinton is generally correct about the uptick in the country\u2019s approval rating after her tenure, but he falls short on the amount of the spike.\n\nWe consulted several polls. Pew Research Center surveyed respondents in 20 countries between 2008 and 2013, asking if they \"have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the United States.\" Favorable ratings in eight countries met or came close to the 20-point increase Clinton cited over that time, but 12 did not.\n\nAnother survey, from BBC World Service/Globescan, found in 2008 that 35 percent of people said world influence of the United States was \"mostly positive\" and 47 percent said it was \"mostly negative.\" The \"mostly positive\" answers increased 10 percentage points during Hillary\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe Clinton campaign pointed to a poll by the Meridian International Center and Gallup\u2019s U.S.-Global Leadership Project, which shows a 23-point increase \u2014 but it\u2019s just for Europe.\n\nThe ratings of the United States did increase over her time at the State Department, but the ballpark is around 10 to 12 points, not 20. We rate Bill Clinton\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nClinton went through Clinton\u2019s accomplishments as the country\u2019s chief diplomat, saying Clinton applied pressure on Iran ahead of the nuclear deal.\n\n\"As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program,\" Clinton said. \"And in what the Wall Street Journal no less called a \u2018half-court shot at the buzzer,\u2019 she got Russia and China to support them.\"\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s first 18 months as secretary of state, the State Department made it a clear priority to increase sanctions on Iran \u2014 notably getting Russia and China on board \u2014 culminating in a key U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts. Experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nHowever, Clinton wasn\u2019t the only one responsible for the sanctions or getting China and Russia to support them, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren\u2019t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks. We rate Bill Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nNew York Rep. Joseph Crowley made a serious charge about Republican nominee Donald Trump, a New Yorker, profiting off the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and the years after 9/11? He didn\u2019t stand at the pile, he didn\u2019t lobby Congress for help, he didn\u2019t fight for the first responders,\" Crowley said. \"Nope, he cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover \u2014 even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected.\"\n\nA 2006 New York Daily News investigation found that Trump did receive $150,000 for the Trump Building, located less than a mile away from the World Trade Center.\n\nHowever, the money wasn\u2019t fraudulent. Under New York\u2019s grant recovery program, firms were eligible if they had 500 or fewer employees, had been physically or economically damaged and located on or south of 14th street in Lower Manhattan.\n\nTrump did say his buildings were not affected, but he likely meant physically. The grant provided for economic damages as well.\n\nCrowley\u2019s claim misses these qualifications, so we rated his claim Half True.\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., contrasted the records of Trump and running mate Mike Pence on women\u2019s rights with that of Clinton.\n\n\"Her opponent said a woman should be \u2018punished\u2019 for exercising her right to choose,\" Boxer said, \"and then picked a running mate who believes Roe vs. Wade belongs, to quote him, \u2018in the ash heap of history.\u2019 \"\n\nThe first part of Boxer\u2019s statement refers to a March interview between Trump and MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews. Trump did say \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for abortion \u2014 if it were illegal.\n\nMatthews pressed him for clarity, saying \"for the woman,\" Trump responded \"yeah, there has to be some form.\"\n\nHe quickly walked back his comments that same day, saying he meant the doctors who perform abortions, and not the women who receive them, would be punished. He said later that month it was a \"convoluted discussion\" and that he might have \"misspoke.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments on abortion have been all over the place. There\u2019s also no evidence that \"punishing women\" is a long-standing belief or policy position Trump holds. For missing this context, we rate Boxer\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nA Hillary Clinton campaign ad played at the convention appeared to show Trump denying he treats women with respect.\n\nToward the end of the 30-second video, an unidentified voice says, \"So you treat women with respect?\"\n\nThe video shifts to a younger Trump saying sheepishly, \"I can't say that either\" and offering a half-laugh.\n\nThe source of the quote comes from a 39-minute 1993 interview with Howard Stern on the E! cable channel.\n\nTechnically, this back-and-forth happened, but it\u2019s taken out of context to distort what was really said. What the Clinton ad didn\u2019t mention was the last comment Trump made to Stern about women.\n\nThis statement in the Clinton ad rates Mostly False.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., commended Clinton\u2019s compassion for victims of human trafficking and made a point about how widespread the issue is around the world.\n\n\"Human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world,\" she said.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to put a dollar amount on illegal activity, and reports varied on how much human trafficking actually costs.\n\nA U.N. agency estimated the total value of human trafficking at $150 billion. The comparable estimates for the drug trade range from about $280 billion to $420 billion. There is one dicey estimate for counterfeiting of $250 billion.\n\nBy those measures, human trafficking does rank third. However, all of these numbers hinge on sweeping assumptions and limited data.\n\nWe rated this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
