Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in this post.\n\n\n\nA similar video related to the same incident is also being shared with another version that the man seen beating in the video is a BJP leader and he was beating a man from a backward community.\n\nWhen searched on Google with relevant keywords, an article of \u2018India Today\u2019 about the incident was found. As per the story- \u2018The son of Bhabua ward councilor allegedly shot a man, who succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in the city in Bihar\u2019s Kaimur district. After this the accused, ward councilor\u2019s son, was brutally thrashed by a mob of locals in broad daylight in front of the police. The incident took place in Shivaji Chowk area of Bhabua\u2019. The article added \u2013 \u2018The man was admitted to Kaimur Sadar Hospital in a critical condition. Kaimur SP said the deceased was shot over an internal matter with the accused\u2019.\n\nAccording to the report of Prabhat Khabar, the people present at the scene grabbed and thrashed the son of the Bhabua town\u2019s ward councilor on the charge of shooting Madhav Singh.\n\n\n\nDuring the search process, it was found that the man who shot Madhav Singh was Sahil Raiyan (ward councilor\u2019s son). In the post, it is being claimed that the man beaten by the mob, i.e. Raiyan, is dead. But, when FACTLY has contacted Kaimur (Bhabua) SP, he has clarified that Raiyan is alive and is in jail.\n\nAn FIR was filed based on the statement by the aunt of the deceased Madhav Sinh and it states that her nephew was shot with a pistol by Sahil Raiyan in a \u2018land-related dispute\u2019 and had lost his life in this incident. In the FIR, she went on to mention that when Raiyan tried to escape from the sight after shooting, the mob there have caught him and beaten him.\n\nBhabua Police have filed an FIR about this incident and it states that bullets were fired in an incident of mutual rivalry and Sahil Raiyan was attacked by the crowd when he tried to escape from the shooting sight.\n\nIn both of these FIRs, there is no mention regarding the connection of any political party with this incident. Also, when \u2018Alt News\u2019 contacted Bhabua police regarding the incident, they were told that there is no communal angle to the crime and it is related to some land dispute affair.\n\nTo conclude, a video of a youth beaten by few individuals in Bihar is being falsely shared with a communal narrative.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
