We found that the incident actually pertains to a jewellery shop robbery that took place in Marsa Matrouh, Egypt in May 2017. The theft and murder were reported by several Egyptian media outlets, including Al Arabiya.\n\n\u201cA source in Matrouh security department said that it had arrested one of the perpetrators, from the province of Al-Beheira, with 5 kg of stolen gold, a shotgun and knives. His accomplices managed to escape,\u201d said the Al Arabiya report.\n\nRecent social media claims suggest that a jewellery shop named \u2018Mahalaxmi Jewellers\u2019 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra was robbed. What we found is that a store of the same name was indeed robbed, however, the viral video does not depict this incident.\n\nAccording to a November 2017 report in The Hindu, burglars had drilled a hole in the ceiling of Mahalaxmi Jewellers, a pawn shop in Kolathur, Chennai. The thieves stole nearly 3 kgs of jewellery. However, there were no reports of injuries to staff and the incident wasn\u2019t recorded on CCTV as the burglars had stolen the recorder as well.\n\nIt is commonplace on social media for videos of unrelated incidents to be circulated as recent events.
