It originated on a satirical website.\n\nThe claim that Trump sent Obama a $214 million bill for vacations that weren\u2019t \u201cofficial state business\u201d has been circulating online since at least 2017, with this particular post having been shared over 63,000 times to date.\n\n\u201cPRESIDENT TRUMP JUST ENDED THE OBAMA\u2019S VACATION SCAM! Ex-President Obama was going to stick us for $2.1 billion or so. Before Obama left office, he arranged with the State Department for a series of \u2018official visits\u2019 to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years,\u201d the post partly reads. \u201cUsing funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was planning to use what would have been $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and even a dog sitter until the year 2036.\u201d\n\nThe post further claims that Trump recalled Secret Service agents protecting the Obama family on such trips and that Obama took 692 days of vacation while in office.

The viral post lifts nearly word-for-word from a satirical article published in February 2017 on the website The Last Line of Defense. That now-defunct website disclaims, \u201cAll articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\u201d\n\nDuring his eight years in office, Obama took 29 vacation trips that spanned all or part of 235 days, as well as 39 trips to Camp David that totaled all or part of 93 days, according to CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller. Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog group, estimates that the Obama family\u2019s travel, including official government business, cost around $114 million, according to records obtained from the Secret Service and Air Force.\n\nThe \u201cOffice of Presidential Visits and Vacations\u201d does not exist.", "lang": "en"}
