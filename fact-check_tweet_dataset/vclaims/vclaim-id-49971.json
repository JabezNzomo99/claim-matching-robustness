A popular iteration of the post includes a caption that reads, \u201cThis is what the MSM won\u2019t show you. Peaceful demonstrator pointing weapon at homeowner.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, that isn\u2019t what the photo shows. Photographer Lawrence Bryant took the picture being shared for Reuters, and the caption on the Reuters website identifies the object in the protester\u2019s hand as a \u201cvideo camera and microphone.\u201d\n\nAnother photo from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shows the man holding the directional \u201cshotgun\u201d microphone from another angle.

Their attorney, Albert Watkins, told The Associated Press that the couple picked up their guns when white protesters threatened them.\n\nThe couple later issued a statement about the incident through their attorney, saying they supported the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cTheir actions were solely out of fear and apprehension, the genesis of which was not race-related,\u201d the statement said, according to Rob Edwards of St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK. \u201cIn fact, the agitators responsible for the trepidation were white.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
