But in an interview in April, he was asked about it on a radio show in Iowa \u2014 one of the only times he spoke on it leading up to his presidential announcement in June. He repeats similar answers when asked about the matter on the trail, though he often chooses not to respond.\n\nJohn Doe I was launched in 2010 by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat. The three-year investigation closed in 2013 with charges against six people (three were former aides to Walker, one was a Walker appointee and one was a major campaign donor). The investigation was related to activities by public employees during Walker\u2019s tenure as Milwaukee County executive, potential illegal campaign contributions to the Walker campaign and suspected misappropriation of certain earmarked public funds.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign pointed to reports showing that 43 of about 260 employees of the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office, led by Democrat Chisholm, signed the recall petition against Walker and showed disapproval of Walker on social media. The chief investigator in John Doe I had a Walker recall sign in his yard, according to one report by a conservative group. Yet the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Daniel Bice, a watchdog columnist who closely covered John Doe investigations, reported that those who signed the petition were not involved in the John Doe probes.\n\nAfter Chisholm\u2019s office launched the probe, it grew to span five counties and was led by five district attorneys \u2014 three Democrats and two Republicans. Veteran federal prosecutor Francis Schmitz, a Republican and Walker supporter, was the lead investigator. In addressing allegations of political motivations by John Doe 2 investigators, Schmitz\u2019s attorneys argued that he had voted for Walker in the recall election and had investigated potential threats against Walker as assistant U.S. attorney, federal court records show.\n\nWalker\u2019s \u201cbudget repair\u201d bill that enacted deep cuts to union rights did not affect Schmitz\u2019s employee rights or benefits because he was a federal employee, his attorneys argued: \u201cNothing Mr. Schmitz has observed, heard or read since becoming involved in this investigation would allow him to conclude that this investigation was motivated or based upon anything but reliable information which provides a basis to conclude that a violation of Wisconsin law may have occurred. He would never be part of an investigation that was conducted for a retaliatory purpose as such an investigation would be improper and unethical.\u201d\n\nWalker and Republican state lawmakers have tried to dismantle the watchdog board. But the board comprises six retired state judges from both parties, some of whom were appointed by Walker, and its judges unanimously voted to join John Doe 2. Plus, the board was created in 2008 to replace a partisan-run board so that it would be nonpartisan. And a recent state audit found no major problems with the board or the way it investigates complaints.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the problem here was more structural and bottom-rooted in a dangerous John Doe statute than it was personal motivations,\u201d Dean Strang, one of the defense attorneys in John Doe II, told The Fact Checker. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous statute, easily misused \u2014 and it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve seen it misused. This is the only time the public has noticed its misuse or its potential for abuse.\u201d\n\nIt may seem like a futile activity to try to prove or disprove the motivations of prosecutors in a proceeding held behind closed doors. The secretive nature of John Doe investigations, which are unique to Wisconsin, makes it easier for observers to politicize the investigations because few details are readily available to the public (and they often are leaked, which makes it even more difficult to understand the full picture).\n\nWithout having access to all of the legal documents and discussions during John Doe II proceedings, we are left to judge the veracity of Walker\u2019s characterization with the facts that voters can see. The sources that Walker\u2019s campaign showed in an effort to prove his claim pointed to accusations about political leanings of Chisholm\u2019s employees and his potential personal motivations. But those are just that: accusations.\n\nThe Milwaukee County district attorney\u2019s office was led by a Democrat, but the case spanned five counties and was handled by both Democrat and Republican district attorneys. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board is led by retired judges from both parties, and they unanimously decided to join bringing a campaign finance case. Moreover, the lead special prosecutor was a long time federal prosecutor who was not involved in state matters, was a Republican and even voted for Walker in the recall election.", "lang": "en"}
