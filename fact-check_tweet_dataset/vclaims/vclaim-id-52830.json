A reverse search of the keyframes of the video took us to the original TikTok video, which had been uploaded to the video sharing platform on 9 April, 2020 by a user called \u2018benesqueda\u2019.\n\nOn going through the user\u2019s profile, we saw that he had uploaded many such videos which had him enacting a scenario, which would be written in text superimposed on the video itself.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that an old TikTok video unrelated to Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s passing is being used to claim that it is the last video of the late actor before he died by suicide on Sunday, 14 June. According to primary information, he had been suffering from depression. The Quint has previously reported on TikTok\u2019s misinformation problem, how it has been inundated with disinformation around COVID-19 and also about organisations and individuals who are trying to curb the flow of misinformation on the platform.", "lang": "en"}
