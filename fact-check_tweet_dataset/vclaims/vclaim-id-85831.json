It also mentions that this current virus is spreading more efficiently- that is it is easier to transmit and get infected by SARS-CoV-2 over the influeza virus. However, it is not as easy to be infected by coronavirus as it is by measles which is more contagious.\n\nThe CDC believes that the virus spreads between people who are in close proximity and are within about 6 feet of one another. The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets that are produced by an infected person and can land or be inhaled by passerbys.\n\nThe virus can also be spread by people that are not showing symptoms.\n\nThe CDC believes that touching surfaces infected by the virus and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly eyes could be a potential mode of transmission of the virus but it is not the primary method of how the virus is transmitted.\n\nThe risk of the virus spreading from pets to humans is very low. On the other hand, there have been cases of animals contracting the virus from humans. Pets such as cats and dogs were found to be infected by COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization has emphasized for droplet and contact precautionary methods for people around and tending to COVID-19 patients.\n\nBOOM has contacted the WHO to understand if any mode of transmission is easier to transmit over the other, The story will be updated once the WHO responds.", "lang": "en"}
