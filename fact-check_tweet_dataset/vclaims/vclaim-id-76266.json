Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump first deployed a version of this line after Bush accused him of getting his foreign policy knowledge \"from the shows,\" but it was garbled as the two went back and forth in a flared exchange. Later, Trump circled back to make the same point with better clarity during a question directed only to him, again trying to paint Bush as a failed candidate.\n\nEven if the statistic fits with the storyline \u2013 that Bush\u2019s well-heeled campaign and super PAC went all out in New Hampshire, and Trump doesn\u2019t need to spend money to get attention \u2013 the gap seemed extraordinary.\n\nPolitiFact New Hampshire knew straight away his recollection of the election results was a bit off, so we decided to investigate whether it could be true that Trump tallied more than three times as many votes as Bush, while spending less than one-tenth what the governor did.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll take on the second half of Trump\u2019s statement: Bush \"came in five, and I came in No. 1.\"\n\nWe only needed to look at to know Trump was right about his position -- he won the Republican primary on Feb. 9 with 100,406 votes -- but wrong about Bush\u2019s.\n\nWith 11 percent of the vote (31,310), Bush came in fourth place, not fifth. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was the one who actually came in fifth \u2013 although the margin was very close. The difference between Bush and Rubio was 1,278 votes, or about 0.4 percent of the total.\n\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign and never heard back.\n\nTrump said Bush spent $44 million in New Hampshire, but made no mention of super PACs spending money. We won\u2019t hold that wording against Trump, especially since the money was spent on Bush\u2019s behalf, and Bush himself raised money for his PAC before he was an official candidate.\n\nVarious news agencies have published analyses of the money that campaigns and related super PACs have spent on ads in New Hampshire.\n\n, for one, looked at NBC-SMG Delta and Associated Press data through Feb. 3 to consider each candidate\u2019s return on his or her New Hampshire TV ad spending.\n\nTheir data, which doesn\u2019t include the final few days before the primary, found that Bush and super PACs backing him spent the most per-vote by far: $4.5 million from his campaign and $29.5 million from super PACs.\n\nWith about 31,000 voters supporting him, that meant a per-vote cost of more than $1,000.\n\nTrump, according to the same analysis, spent $3.1 million, all of which came from his campaign and none from a super PAC. With slightly more than 100,000 votes, that\u2019s $31 per vote.\n\nTo refocus on Trump\u2019s statement, the total spent for each candidate per NPR\u2019s analysis was: Trump $3.1 million; Bush, $34 million.\n\nBy that measure, Trump appears to be accurate on his own numbers but exaggerating Bush\u2019s.\n\nA secondary analysis by Morning Consult, which was published the morning of the primary, accounts for the last few days before voting.\n\nIt had each candidate\u2019s ad spending slightly higher in line with the additional time. By this time, Bush was at $36.1 million and Trump was at $3.7 million.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s estimate for himself was slightly low, while his account for Bush was still exaggerated by about $8 million.\n\nTo put that spending in perspective, we took a look at the numbers for the campaigns that fell in after Bush. Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton weren\u2019t even close, spending $18.5 million, $15.2 million, $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, according to .\n\nSo whether Trump had said $34 million or $44 million, he was pointing out a radically high number.\n\nTrump said: \"In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.\"\n\nBush came in fourth, not fifth, and his campaign and the PACs supporting him spent about $36 million, not $44 million. But it was still the most of any candidate. Trump did finish in first but spent closer to $4 million, not $3 million.\n\nTrump is slightly off in three out of the four claims, but his larger point about spending and campaign effectiveness in New Hampshire hold true.\n\nWe can\u2019t say whether Trump was intentionally exaggerating or not. Either way, we rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
