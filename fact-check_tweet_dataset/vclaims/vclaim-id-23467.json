No, that's not true: the screenshot is digitally manipulated.\n\nAn image purporting to be a screenshot from Fox and Friends falsely quotes President Trump as saying:\n\n\"The Democrats can subpoena me and my administration for the next 10, 15, 20 years and we will never capitulate. They need to face the fact that I am in charge, this is my country and I will do as I please, they have no control over me. The people support me and will always support me.\"\n\nAn example of the image can be seen in this post (archived here) where it was published on May 22, 2019. The image also came with a subtitle that read:\n\nThis is the screenshot in question:\n\nThe chyron at the bottom reads \"ar ideas and manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion\". That appears in a clip from Hannity dated April 24, 2019 which you can watch here:\n\nThe line in question appears aroun the fifty second mark, here is a screenshot of the moment in question:\n\nIt is quite obvious the text in the false image has been superimposed over this image.", "lang": "en"}
