Nancy Pelosi's Twitter account deleted a tweet showing her encouraging tourism to Chinatown weeks after President Donald Trump closed the U.S. border to China.\n\nHowever, Trump's travel restriction did not fully \"close [the U.S.] border to China,\" and archives do not document Pelosi's Twitter account having posted and then deleted a video of her Chinatown event.\n\nNancy Pelosi visited San Francisco's Chinatown to encourage tourism there three weeks after the Trump administration imposed a partial travel restriction on persons entering the U.S. from China.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted a video clip along with the claim that it depicted \u201ccrazy\u201d U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi encouraging \u201ceveryone to pack into Chinatown\u201d weeks after he had restricted air travel to the U.S. from China in order to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. In that tweet, he also claimed the House Speaker was \u201cresponsible for many deaths\u201d and had \u201cdeleted [the video] from her Twitter account\u201d:\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Pelosi responded by noting that the video in question had never been posted to Pelosi\u2019s Twitter feed in the first place (and thus couldn\u2019t have been \u201cdeleted\u201d), and that it was \u201cobviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco three weeks prior to the shelter-in-place order\u201d:\n\nThe video does correspond to a visit Pelosi paid to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown on Feb. 24 to deliver the message that no reason existed at the time that \u201ctourists or locals should be staying away from the area because of coronavirus concerns\u201d:\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi toured San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown to send a message. She said there\u2019s no reason tourists or locals should be staying away from the area because of coronavirus concerns. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do today is to say everything is fine here,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cCome because precautions have been taken. The city is on top of the situation\u201d \u2026 As Pelosi walked from the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory to lunch at a dim sum restaurant, she hugged friends and waved to onlookers. She downplayed the racism issue, saying she understands people are concerned about China \u2013 the epicenter of the novel coronavirus. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t be carried over to Chinatown in San Francisco,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s not that. But all I can say is, \u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019 We feel safe and sound, so many of us coming here.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s visit occurred three weeks before San Francisco issued a shelter-in-place order, but three weeks after the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions related to China. However, the latter did not \u201cclose [the U.S.] border to China,\u201d but rather only barred non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks (other than immediate family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents) from entering the U.S.\n\nHowever, an archive of Pelosi\u2019s Twitter account from a few days after her Chinatown visit does not record video of that event\u2019s having been posted there (and subsequently deleted), nor does Pro Publica\u2019s Politwoops database document such a tweet\u2019s having been deleted from Pelosi\u2019s account.", "lang": "en"}
