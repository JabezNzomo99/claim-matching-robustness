These protests are unique from the other ones because the women are standing at the helm here. They began with the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in both houses of Parliament on December 11, 2019.\n\nMuslim women, the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, since December 15, 2019, have blocked a major highway in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for 37 days now as of January 20, 2020. It has now become the longest ongoing continuous protest against CAA-NRC-NPR and a sensation around the country. BJP IT Cell head, Amit Malviya, tweeted a video, insinuating that protesters of Shaheen Bagh are paid an amount for turning up at the demonstration, thereby ridiculing the efforts of the protestors.\n\nNaturally, fake images from the protests have been doing the rounds over social media.\n\n One such image stands out.\n\nPoster from Shaheen Bagh protest implied that protesters were bribed for showing solidarity to the anti-CAA demonstrations. This is a doctored photo. The poster has been edited to change the real message.\n\nThe photo was found to be published by Huffington Post India, while reporting on the ongoing protests of Shaheen Bagh on January 7, 2020. It was originally clicked by AFP's Money Sharma for Getty Images. Therefore, Given the evidence, we can confirm that a doctored photo was used to falsely portray Shaheen Bagh protesters getting paid.
