In the video, the policemen can be heard saying that there will be no \u2018Azaan\u2019 and this is an order by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. Delhi-based journalist and author Saba Naqvi posted the video (now deleted) and asked, \u201cIs azaan during #Ramzaan now not allowed in Delhi?\u201c. According to her tweet, the video is from riots affected Mustafabad. However, if one listens carefully, the policemen can be heard saying, \u201cYou go to Rohin Nagar police station and see the order\u201d. The month of Ramzan starts from April 25, 2020.\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the video.\n\nOn our official Android application, the video has been uploaded with the following message \u2013 \u201c\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u092e\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u091c\u093e\u0928 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u093e LG \u0938\u093e\u0939\u092c \u0915\u093e \u0911\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u201d reads the viral text.\n\n[Translation: In Delhi\u2019s Kirari, it has been ordered that there will be no Azaan in all the mosques during Ramzan. Police says that this an order by the LG.]\n\nDelhi\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia took to Twitter and clarified that there is no restriction on Azaan. \u201cIn the lockdown, there is a complete ban on assembling of people for prayers in mosques or at any other religious places,\u201d said the Dy. CM.\n\nDelhi police also tweeted that while people are expected to follow the lockdown rules when they are observing Roza and prayers, Azaan may be carried out in accordance with NGT guidelines. \u201cIt is requested that namaz may be performed while staying indoors and have Sehri at home,\u201d reads the message posted by Delhi police.\n\nWhile speaking with BBC Hindi, Rohini DCP SD Mishra said, \u201cI saw the video this morning. Actually, the constable didn\u2019t understand the difference between Azaan and Namaz and made the false claim. Due to social distancing [norms], offering namaz at mosques is prohibited but there is no restriction on Azaan.\u201d He informed that disciplinary action has been taken against the constable for spreading false information. He added, \u201cNo such order from the office of Lieutenant Governor has been issued. We have informed the maluvis of all the mosques in the area.\u201d\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Muslims are summoned to perform five congregational prayers (Namaz) a day via the Azaan or call to prayer. Due to coronavirus pandemic, congregational prayers are suspended and namaz can be offered at home.\n\nA video of a policeman who falsely claimed that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has issued orders to ban Azaan in mosques has spread panic among the Muslim community.", "lang": "en"}
