Going further, the grisly meme alleged that the scene captured a \u201ccop after not shooting a guy with a knife.\u201d\n\nThe gruesome, lower image in the meme was, unfortunately, familiar to us. That photograph had been previously misrepresented as part of an email hoax that we reported on in 2016.\n\nWe rate this more recent claim as \u201cMiscaptioned\u201d because, although the same photograph appears to have been circulating on the internet since at least 2008, according to a reverse image search, we found no evidence to prove this photograph shows a law enforcement officer who was stabbed as a result of not firing his weapon.\n\nWe did, however, find the image appearing on a personal blog post critiquing a British police force\u2019s staffing practices, inscrutable Russian chat rooms and memes, and at least one debunked story about the rapper Eminem.", "lang": "en"}
