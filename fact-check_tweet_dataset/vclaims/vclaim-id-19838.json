{"title": "Russian MP: U.S. Playing Into Terrorists' Hands in Syria", "subtitle": "A prominent member of Russia\u2019s parliament said the U.S. was \u201cplaying into the hands\u201d of Islamic State and other terrorists by launching an airstrike against forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. strike was in fact part of an effort to stop repeated violations of the deconfliction zone by Syrian government forces that have endangered the lives of American troops.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 24, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19838", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/syria-usa-strikes-russia-reaction/28506768.html", "vclaim": "On May 18, U.S. warplanes launched an airstrike in the area of al-Tanf near Syria\u2019s border with Jordan, reportedly hitting pro-government forces who were setting up fighting positions inside the deconfliction zone in violation of an agreement between the U.S. and Russia. A U.S. army base where special forces are training Syrian militias is located in the area.\n\n\u201cThe new U.S. airstrike against Syrian government forces is a continuation of Washington\u2019s destructive line, which began with the provocation in Idlib and an attack on a Syrian airbase in Homs province,\u201d Duma Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Leonid Slutsky told Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency. He added that \u201csuch actions speak to the unpredictability of the American partners, which of course, complicates the negotiating process for a Syrian settlement.\u201d\n\nSlutsky accused the U.S. of \u201cplaying into the hands\u201d of terrorist groups \u2013 namely, Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nHis comments were typical of the reaction by members of Russia\u2019s political establishment to U.S. strikes in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe claim by Mr. Slutsky that the U.S. is undermining the forces aligned against ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra (now known as Jabhat Fateh al Sham) is not accurate,\u201d Martin Reardon, senior vice president of the Soufan Group, an American think-tank focused on terrorism analysis, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and its coalition partners have focused on degrading ISIS capabilities for over 2 1/2 years now - both from the air and with special forces units supporting Iraqi military and Syrian rebel ground attacks against them,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cIn fact, it is largely due to that support that ISIS has lost so much territory in Iraq and Syria, not to mention thousands of fighters.\u201d\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Voice of America that defeating ISIS is \u201cthe highest priority\u201d to the United States.\n\nAsked about Slutsky\u2019s comment that \u201cRussia is making enormous efforts to support the reconciliation process in Syria,\u201d the State Department spokesperson referred to a May 15 briefing by Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones. During that briefing, Jones presented a newly declassified report and photos documenting human rights atrocities committed by the Assad regime with \u201cunconditional support from Russia and Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regime must stop all attacks on civilians and opposition forces, and Russia must bear responsibility to ensure regime compliance,\u201d Jones said. \u201cRussia joined the unanimous UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which demands that all parties immediately cease \u2026 any attacks against civilians. Russia has either aided in or passively looked away (from), as the regime has conducted an airstrike against a UN convoy, destroyed east Aleppo, and used chemical weapons, including sarin, against civilians in Idlib province on April 4th.\u201d\n\nPentagon spokesman Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway told VOA that the Syrian Democratic Forces, which the U.S. is reportedly supporting and training, have liberated more than 35 percent of the territory in Syria held by ISIS.\n\nRecently, the Coalition-backed SDF rid the key city of Tabqa of ISIS terrorists, liberating a major population center and returning the Tabqa Dam to the Syrian population. In Iraq, the Iraqi Security Forces have liberated more than 90 percent of the land area of Mosul and are closing in on what is left of ISIS resistance in Mosul's Old City.\n\n\u201cU.S. forces have carried out several strikes against al-Qaeda targets in Syria, disrupting that terrorist organization's ability to plan and carry out attacks both within and outside of Syria's borders,\u201d the Pentagon spokesman said.\n\nReardon noted that hitting Jabhat Fateh al Sham (JFS) has been \u201cmore challenging since they routinely operate with or in close proximity to other rebel forces supported by the coalition.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, over 100 members of JFS were killed in a U.S. drone strike on a training camp in Syria last January.\n\n\u201cIt is worth mentioning that U.S. efforts against JFS are more of a \u2018shadow\u2019 war -- i.e. largely covert, in order to keep public attention on ISIS,\u201d Reardon said.\n\nPentagon spokesman Rankine-Galloway told VOA that the United States \u201csupports any effort that can genuinely de-escalate the violence in Syria, ensure unhindered humanitarian access, focus energies on the defeat of ISIS and other terrorists, and create the conditions for a credible political resolution of the conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. will continue to target ISIS and al-Qaeda wherever they operate to ensure they have no sanctuary,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
