Mueller\u2019s letter expressed concern that Barr\u2019s summary had failed to \"fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions.\"\n\nMueller\u2019s frustrated message seemed at odds with Barr\u2019s testimony last month, when Barr downplayed media reports that he and Mueller disagreed over the attorney general\u2019s depiction.\n\n\"You lied to Congress,\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told Barr on May 1. \"You knew you lied. And now, we know.\"\n\nChallenged by multiple senators along these lines, Barr said he had talked to Mueller by phone, and the special counsel told him nothing was inaccurate in his memo.\n\nStill, we now know Barr\u2019s earlier testimony didn\u2019t tell the whole story: Barr knew of Mueller\u2019s frustration with the summary, and he didn\u2019t share it when asked.\n\nBarr\u2019s four-page summary sought to distill the \"principal conclusions\" of Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year probe.\n\nIn his memo, Barr said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia. And while the special counsel declined to say if the president had obstructed justice, Barr and his deputy determined Trump had not done so.\n\nDays later, Mueller wrote Barr a letter stating that the attorney general had failed to adequately reflect his report.\n\n\"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public \u2026 did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions,\" Mueller said in his March 27 letter. \"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from Mueller\u2019s letter exactly which aspects of Barr\u2019s memo he objected to. But the fact that the special counsel\u2019s view diverged from Barr\u2019s backs up earlier media reporting.\n\nOn April 4, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that members of the special counsel team were frustrated by Barr\u2019s portrayal, and that the actual findings were more troubling for Trump than the attorney general had let on.\n\nAbout a week later, Barr was called to testify before a House and Senate committee. In both hearings, he was asked about friction between him and Mueller.\n\nHere\u2019s the back-and-forth between Barr and Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., during the April 9 hearing before the House Appropriations Committee:\n\nCrist: \"Reports have emerged recently, general, that members of the special counsel\u2019s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter, that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report\u2019s findings. Do you know what they\u2019re referencing with that?\"\n\nBarr: \"No, I don\u2019t. I think, I suspect that they probably wanted more put out. But in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize because I think any summary \u2014 regardless of who prepares it \u2014 not only runs the risk of being underinclusive or overinclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.\"\n\nThe Democratic senators quoted that exchange at several points in the May 1 hearing. Barr\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the letter was artful \u2014 he pointed out that Crist asked him about Mueller\u2019s team, not Mueller himself.\n\n\"I talked directly to Bob Mueller, not members of his team,\" Barr said. \"And even though I did not know what was being referred to, and Mueller had never told me that the expression of the findings was inaccurate, but I did then volunteer that I thought they were talking about the desire to have more information put out, but it wasn\u2019t my purpose to put out more information.\"\n\nLeahy accused the attorney general of intentionally creating a false impression during his exchange with Crist.\n\n\"Mr. Barr,\" he said, \"I feel your answer was purposefully misleading, and I think others do, too.\"\n\nBarr said he spoke on the phone with Mueller after receiving his letter, and the special counsel assured him he didn\u2019t think Barr\u2019s characterization of the principal findings was inaccurate.\n\n\"My view of events was that there was a lot of criticism of the special counsel for the ensuing few days, and on Thursday (March 28) I got this letter,\" Barr said. \"And when I talked to the special counsel about the letter, my understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning on why he didn't reach a decision on obstruction.\"", "lang": "en"}
