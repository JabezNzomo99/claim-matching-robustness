But sometimes, depending on the context, things can be technically true but still misleading. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s database lists 189 countries in terms of the time required to start a business. For 2014, in first place is New Zealand, with one day. In France and Canada, along with eight other countries, it takes five days. (South Korea, along with six other countries, is listed as four days.) The United States, with 12 other countries, is listed as six days.\n\nFirst of all, one extra day does not seem like much of a hindrance \u2014 so much so that, as Clinton asserted in the LinkedIn article, the fact signified the \u201cred tape that holds back small businesses and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nThe average time for starting a business in the world was 22.3 days, according to the World Bank. In high-income countries, it was 15.2 days, while in the Euro area, it was 10.6 days. So, within the world, the United States ranks very close to France and Canada \u2014 and exceeds many other industrialized countries.\n\nWe should note that the World Bank studied a very specific size of company \u2014 employing between 10 to 50 people within one month, having five owners, using start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita and being engaged in industrial or commercial activities and owning no real estate.\n\nBut there\u2019s another funny thing about the data. While Clinton uses these numbers as a proxy for entire countries, in most cases, researchers only looked at the time it took to start a business in a country\u2019s largest city. That would be Paris in France and Toronto in Canada. But the United States was one of the few countries in which its figure was an amalgam of the two largest cities \u2014 New York and Los Angeles.\n\nWhen you look at the individual city data, it turns out that it takes four days to start a business in New York and eight days to start one in Los Angeles. In the report, that was averaged as six days. But if you really used an apples to apples comparison \u2013 the largest city in each country \u2013then actually the United States (i.e., New York, with four days) tops France (Paris, with 4.5 days) and Canada (Toronto, with five days.)\n\nThe World Bank Web site lets you compare the individual cities to countries, so New York ends up tied for 6th place \u2014 with Belgium, Iceland, South Korea, the Netherlands and Sao Tome. Los Angeles is down in 15th place, tied with Cyprus, Egypt, Madagascar and the Kyrgyz Republic, among others. Another World Bank report notes that the differences are so large because, in the United States, \u201ccompany law is under state jurisdiction and there are measurable differences between the California and New York company law.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign noted that the United States (i.e., the combined ranking for New York and Los Angeles) ranked 46th on a broader \u201cstarting a business\u201d category, which also includes time to start a business, the number of procedures, cost of capital and paid-in minimum capital. Each element is weighed equally to come up with an overall ranking.\n\nUnder this criteria, Canada ranked second, Korea was 17th and France was 28th. But again, the U.S. score is dragged down by greater difficulties found in starting a business in Los Angeles. And Clinton spoke simply of the time it took to start a business.\n\nIn the context in which Clinton used this factoid, it does not make much sense. This is specifically about starting businesses in a country\u2019s largest city \u2014 and the score for the United States is affected by the fact that it is one of the few countries with a blended figure for two cities.\n\nThere is such a wide variation between New York and Los Angeles because corporate law generally is set at the state level \u2014 making us wonder what federal solution Clinton is proposing. (Her article said such specific policy suggestions would be forthcoming in the future.)", "lang": "en"}
