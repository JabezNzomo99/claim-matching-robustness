But when she does make political endorsements, they tend to be for Democratic candidates.\n\nIn 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 endorsed Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was running against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz for his Senate seat. In 2016, she supported Trump\u2019s then-opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nDuring a 2019 campaign rally, Trump responded to her endorsement of Clinton, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t need Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. And I didn\u2019t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
