Spending on health is at record levels and has increased in most years since 1950.\n\nHealth is a devolved area so the UK government is only directly responsible for exactly how money is spent on this in England. The health budget was around \u00a3125 billion in England in 2017/18.\n\nNot all of this money is spent on the NHS. For example, some is spent by on things like public health initiatives, education, training and infrastructure. NHS England funding and overall health funding is projected to increase in the coming years, though the amount not spent on the NHS is projected to be lower in 2020/21 than it is now. This includes money announced in the most recent Budget.\n\nBased on current plans, spending per person on health in England is set to increase each year until 2019/20, but in 2020/21 it will fall by 0.01%, according to health experts.\n\nIn today\u2019s prices, public spending on adult social care in the UK was \u00a321 billion and \u00a310 billion was spent on children\u2019s social care, in 2016/17.\n\nPublic spending on adult social care fell from 2009/10 to 2016/17 by around 10%.
