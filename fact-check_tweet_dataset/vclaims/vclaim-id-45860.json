No, that's not true: a gang of hoaxers (likely from the Philippines) has created a string of fake news websites that trick people into sharing the false news on their Facebook timelines by fooling them into thinking they need to share a link to be able to continue watching a video. The links being shared to Facebook are quasi-random, and they ultimately all lead to the same hoax video. The real CNN has made no mention of the \"news\".\n\nAn example of the claim could be found in an article published by randomnames.club titled \"DEREK CHAUVIN Police Officer Who Killed George FIoyd Found Dead inside His Apartment Last Night\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe article contained a video (archived here) that would only play for a few seconds before being interrupted by a message asking people to share the story to continue watching.\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nThe actual link people were being tricked into sharing was one of several different links that all led back to the hoax page, causing several links to go viral at the same time to make the fake news harder to stop on social media.\n\nEarlier, the same network of sites also ran death hoaxes about Vin Diesel, Will Smith and his son, Duane Chapman, Clint Eastwood, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Tom Cruise and Rowan Atkinson.", "lang": "en"}
