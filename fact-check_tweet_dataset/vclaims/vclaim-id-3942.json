The rise in dissatisfaction, according to new survey results, is the largest annual increase since this data started being collected in 1983. But the level of dissatisfaction has returned to roughly where it was between 2011 and 2013.\n\nBBC News, the Telegraph and the Independent were among others to phrase this correctly.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked for a correction from the Mirror.\n\nThe measure of satisfaction can reflect more than simply views on the quality of the NHS service. Researchers say that opinions are also influenced by things like politics and policy changes.\n\n23% of people responding to the British Social Attitudes survey in 2015 said they were either very or quite dissatisfied with the way in which the NHS runs. That was up from 15% the previous year\u2014a rise of eight percentage points, the highest annual rise since the survey began in 1983.\n\nDissatisfaction was last at this level in 2012.\n\nPreviously it has been much higher than this. It was once 50% in the mid-1990s.\n\nMore people said they were \u201cquite dissatisfied\u201d (16%) than \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d (7%).\n\nBy historical levels, satisfaction with the NHS remains high. Satisfaction was at the second-highest level ever recorded as recently as 2014.\n\nAs a measure, \"satisfaction\" can capture more than simply people's views about the quality of the service, NatCen Social Research\u2014which carries out the survey\u2014said last year.\n\nIt pointed out that many of the people spoken to hadn't had recent experience of the NHS. So it's possible their satisfaction is based on an outside perception of the health service, perhaps influenced by politicians or the media.\n\nAmong people saying they were dissatisfied, the main reasons were waiting times for GP and hospital appointments (55%), insufficient staff numbers (44%) and under-funding (39%).\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about people\u2019s experience of the NHS. Political affiliation also plays a part, for example.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund, a health charity which has analysed the data, said that there was a big difference in satisfaction between supporters of the Conservative and Labour parties.\n\nWhile satisfaction among Conservative supporters remained about the same, satisfaction among Labour supporters fell back by 11 percentage points to its 2013 level of 59%.\n\nThe charity said this could reflect the general election result, as the survey was conducted in the few months afterwards.\n\nSatisfaction among Labour supporters was particularly high the year before, which The King\u2019s Fund commented is likely to be because \u201cthey were signalling a vote of support for the health service as an institution during tough times\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s typical for satisfaction to be higher among supporters of the political party in power.\n\nAmong people saying they were satisfied, the biggest drivers were the quality of care provided (61%), the NHS being free at the point of use (59%) and the range of services and treatments available (54%).", "lang": "en"}
