The posts claim that there are only a \"few farms and public utilities still left\" in Australia, as the government has sold significant portions of land to China. The claim is false; China only held 2.3 percent of agricultural land in Australia according to the Australian government's most recent records; just 13.4 percent of Australia's agricultural land had \"a level of foreign interest\" in 2017-18 and 80 percent of this was on a leasehold basis, ruling out complete ownership.\n\nThis Facebook post includes a map of Australia which purports to show how much land is Chinese-owned. It has been shared more than 7,100 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe text around the map reads: \u201cFOR SALE AUSTRALIA. ATTENTION WORLD! There are a few FARMS and PUBLIC UTILITIES still left so YOU BETTER BE QUICK!\u201d\n\nThe text above the map states: \"Look and weep...you cannot buy land in China only lease. Our zoos can't even own Pandas...all pandas are leased by zoos and must return to China every 4 to 5 years. Yet our traitorous governments of both persuasions sell off our COUNTRY to our biggest economic threat...China! Wake up Australia before it's too LATE!!\"\n\nThe same image was also shared on Facebook here and here, and on Twitter here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the map significantly overstates the proportion of Australian farmland held by China.\n\nAccording to Australia's Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land, published here by the Australian government on June 30, 2018, just 13.4 percent of Australian land in 2017-18 had \u201ca level of foreign interest\u201d, and 80 percent of this was on a leasehold basis, ruling out complete ownership as the map suggested.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this section of the report, with the relevant figure highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nThe report lists the United Kingdom as the largest foreign agricultural land holder in Australia, with 2.6 percent; followed by China with 2.3 percent; and the United States with 0.7 percent.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this section of the report, with the relevant section highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the section the report which lists countries in order of how much agricultural land they hold in Australia by hectares:", "lang": "en"}
