This is false; the post is inspired by a now-deleted report based on a satirical article void of facts, its author told AFP.\n\n\u201cTrudeau lashes out against seniors that don\u2019t agree with his world view,\u201d claims a meme shared on \u201cJustin Trudeau Not,\u201d a Facebook page dedicated to the prime minister and whose content AFP has previously debunked.\n\nNext to a black-and-white photo of a laughing Trudeau, a quote attributed to the Liberal Party prime minister reads: \u201cThese people generally don\u2019t believe in climate change, green initiatives, basically anything we\u2019re trying to do to save the planet that they won\u2019t be around for. So why are we letting them ruin it for the rest of us?\u201d\n\nThe meme is based on a now-deleted article from the Cultural Action Party of Canada, a website debunked by AFP in the past. According to the article, the prime minister spoke ill of seniors during a visit to the Atlantic province of New Brunswick. He declared that seniors over the age of 85 would no longer be allowed to cast votes in the next federal election, due to their views on climate change.\n\nHowever, Trudeau did not utter the words attributed to him and seniors will still be able to cast ballots in the election.\n\nThe now-deleted report cited \u201can alternative media,\u201d linking to a November 2019 article from The Manatee, a New Brunswick-based satirical website that writes about Canada\u2019s Atlantic provinces.\n\nThe quotes attributed to Trudeau are directly lifted from The Manatee\u2019s article, which is pure fabrication, its author Alex Vietinghoff told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cMy article is entirely satirical and made-up! The piece was inspired by stories I saw shared on Facebook at the time of the election (in October 2019), of elderly poll workers mixing up ballots and votes being spoiled by accident,\u201d Vietinghoff said.\n\nSatirical articles from The Manatee have misled the public in the past, such as when online users believed that smoking in public before 8:00 pm would become illegal in New Brunswick.", "lang": "en"}
