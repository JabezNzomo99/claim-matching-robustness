He further claimed that \u201cthey say they want to avoid a hard border but what they would do then would be to force a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom where we send 60% of all our sales\u201d.\n\nDoes Northern Ireland sell 60% of its goods to Great Britain?\n\nIn 2016, Northern Ireland sold \u00a314.6 billion worth of goods and services to Great Britain, which equates to 56% of external sales. External sales are defined as sales by Northern Ireland businesses to destinations outside Northern Ireland, which means sales to Great Britain plus exports beyond the UK.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that by rounding the figure up, Nigel Dodd\u2019s claim of 60% sales to Great Britain is accurate.\n\nSo, how does this compare with trade to Ireland?\n\nIn 2016, Northern Ireland exported \u00a34 billion worth of goods and services to Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s sales to Ireland accounted for 15% of goods and services sold outside of its own borders in 2016, which includes that sold to Great Britain.\n\nExports are technically described as goods produced in one country which are then shipped to another country for future sale or trade. As Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the sales it makes to England, Scotland and Wales do not count towards exports. Therefore, around 35% of Northern Ireland exports go to Ireland.\n\nThese figures are summarised in the following table, compiled by NISRA:\n\nWhy is it relevant how much Northern Ireland trades with Great Britain and Ireland?\n\nWhen the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the currently porous border between Northern Ireland and Ireland could be affected. There is the potential for a land border between a non-EU member state (United Kingdom) and an EU member state (Ireland). Currently the trade of goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland is custom-check free. However, with a hard border this could change and may have knock on implications on trade; what these implications may be are hard to predict.\n\nWe found that the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency\u2019s data confirms Nigel Dodd\u2019s claim that Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201cbiggest market\u201d is Great Britain. While Dodds claimed that Northern Ireland sends 60% of sales to the UK, the figure is closer to 56%. Comparing this to trade with Ireland, our findings suggest that Northern Ireland is more dependent on trade with Great Britain than it is with Ireland.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
