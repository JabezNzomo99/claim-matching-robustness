There have been multiple instances of fake quotes circulated on social media in the past which have been chronicled by Alt News. If and when public figures do make any controversial statements, they are always reported by at least a section of the media. Social media users are therefore strongly advised to verify any quote attributed to a public figure that they may come across by searching the quoted statements via search engines such as Google.", "lang": "en"}
