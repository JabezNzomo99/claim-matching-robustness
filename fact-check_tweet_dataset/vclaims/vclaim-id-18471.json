Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.\u201d\n\nThis quote was actually penned by gothic novelist Anne Rice in the foreword of a collection of Kafka\u2019s writings published in 1995.\n\nKafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer, did not gain prominence for his work until after his death in 1924. He wrote several novels and numerous shorter works, including \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d and \u201cIn the Penal Colony.\u201d However, there is no evidence that Kafka penned the quote attributed to him in the post.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Kafka Project, an extensive online archive of Kafka\u2019s work, but found no matching expressions. The quote isn\u2019t present in his collected letters either.\n\nIt actually originated with a foreword written by Rice for a collection of Kafka\u2019s writings published in 1995, the website Quote Investigator discovered. In the foreword where the quote appears, Rice describes the ways in which Kafka\u2019s writing influenced her own, saying, \u201cKafka became a model for me, a continuing inspiration.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Anne Rice discussed the misattribution on Facebook after Quote Investigator reached out to her. Here\u2019s the post:\n\n\u201cThose are my words struggling to define the impression Kafka\u2019s example made on me! And it\u2019s being attributed worldwide to Kafka,\u201d Rice said in the post. \u201cWhat a shame. I think Kafka might have expressed those sentiments a lot better!\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
