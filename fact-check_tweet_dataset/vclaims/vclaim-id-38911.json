This is false; the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data does not support the claim. The last time the disease was so deadly was in 2009.\n\nAfter Nigeria confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus on February 28, 2020, all major newspapers in the country led with reports on the virus.\n\nIn response, Garba Shehu, special media adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari, asked on March 1, 2020 when the spotlight would shift to the 822 people \u201ckilled by malaria everyday in Nigeria [sic]\u201d.\n\nWhat do the statistics say?\n\nWHO estimated in its World Malaria Report 2019 that 405,000 people died from malaria globally in 2018, adding that Nigeria accounted for the majority -- nearly 24% of the total or 97,200 deaths.\n\nThe report also noted a continuing decline in malarial deaths \u201cfrom about 400,000 in 2010 to about 260,000 in 2018\u201d in 11 high-burden to high-impact (HBHI) countries, including Nigeria.\n\nIn the same period, Nigeria\u2019s death toll fell by about a third.\n\nHas malaria ever killed 822 per day in Nigeria?\n\nFor Nigeria to record 822 deaths from malaria every day, means 300,030 deaths in total a year -- two-thirds more than the most recent official figures\n\nIn 2009, the World Bank stated that more than 1,000,000 people died from malaria every year, including \u201cmore than 300,000 Nigerians\u201d -- the last time the country had more than 300,000 estimated malaria deaths since the inception of WHOs comprehensive World Malaria Report in 2005.\n\nThe presidential spokesman's claim is therefore false.", "lang": "en"}
