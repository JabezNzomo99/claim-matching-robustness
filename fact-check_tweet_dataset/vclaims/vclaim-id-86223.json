Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in the Hill on March 7. \u201cFor every $200, the federal government will pay $1,200 of taxpayer dollars to a congressional or presidential campaign. Meaning regardless of whether you support my bid for reelection, $1 million in public funds would have been to get me reelected last cycle had H.R. 1 been enacted.\u201d\n\nIn a March 4 report explaining the bill, the House Administration Committee noted that \u201cin the 2018 midterms, only 0.47 percent of the population gave $200 or more to political campaigns,\u201d but that represented \u201c71 % of the money that went to federal candidates, PACs, parties, and outside groups.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201csmall dollar donors of $200 or less contributed only 30 percent of the money raised in the 2018 midterms.\u201d (This data is via the Center for Responsive Politics.)\n\nThe report pointed to voluntary public funding systems that it says have proved successful elsewhere, such as in New York City, where a $10 contribution from a New York City resident to a participating candidate could be worth as much as $90 to their campaign. The city matches up to $250 and most candidates participate. The result is that city candidates raise 90 percent of their money from the city\u2019s census blocs, compared to 30 percent for state assembly candidates in the same areas and which do not receive matching funds, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nDavis, ranking Republican on the Administration Committee, claimed that the bill, if passed into law, would add $1 million to his campaign coffers. That\u2019s apparently based on the fact he raised $183,000 from $200 and lower donations. (That\u2019s 5 percent of his total.) But he raised more than $500,000 from people who contributed $1,000 or more \u2014 money he would have to forgo if he agreed to participate in the program.\n\nBoth McCarthy and Davis also claimed that the matching funds were taxpayer money. As the bill is now structured, that\u2019s not correct. The money for the matching donations would come from a 2.75 percent fee assessed on civil and criminal financial penalties with the government, which then would be earmarked for a \u201cFreedom From Influence Fund.\u201d\n\nDaniel Jacobs, a spokesman for Sarbanes, said there was no estimate for how much money this provision would raise. The Congressional Budget Office did not score the provision because the new tax on financial penalties was inserted as a manager\u2019s amendment during Rules Committee markup, after the CBO report was completed. When the CBO examined the bill, the funding supposedly was going to be determined through future legislation.\n\n\u201cExpenditures for those programs would be limited to amounts designated in the proposed Freedom From Influence Fund,\u201d the CBO wrote. \u201cThe bill would provide no source of funds for the Freedom From Influence Fund; without funding, those programs would not be implemented and thus those provisions would have no cost.\u201d\n\nThe bill, however, explicitly says payments will be reduced if there is insufficient money in the fund and no money can be used from other sources: \u201cIn any case in which the Commission determines that there are insufficient moneys in the Fund to make payments to participating candidates under this title, moneys shall not be made available from any other source for the purpose of making such payments.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously takes no position on the merits of such a public-financing system. McCarthy\u2019s video attack leaves out key points, especially the fact that lawmakers would be required to stop accepting any donation over $1,000. He misleadingly suggests that every small-dollar donation would be matched, but that\u2019s only if certain thresholds are achieved.\n\nAs for whether taxpayer money would be involved, that\u2019s not the current structure of the bill. So McCarthy\u2019s statement on the funding is not quite right but not totally off-base. The funding at the time of the CBO score was a blank slate, leaving the bill open to attacks on this issue. Democrats waited until after the CBO score to come up with the funding mechanism. That\u2019s often a suspicious sign.", "lang": "en"}
