Moreover, Owaisi in a statement said that those who died due to Covid-19 are martyrs. He also urged people to follow Govt guidelines during burials.\n\nHowever, Owaisi did accuse BJP of turning COVID-19 into a communal matter following the Tablighi Jamaat issue.\n\nThe above information proves that even though Owaisi targeted BJP and PM Modi over turning COVID-19 into a communal matter, however, he has nowhere, denied the existence of the virus.\n\nHence, the posts in question are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
