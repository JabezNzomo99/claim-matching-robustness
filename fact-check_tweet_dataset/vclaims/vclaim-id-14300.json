Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for president in 2020, called this month for ending the Electoral College \u2014 highlighting some Democrats\u2019 discomfort with the current process for electing the U.S. president and vice president.\n\nThe political debate over the Electoral College has taken to social media, too, where an image seeking to defend the system gained popularity.\n\n\u201cThe red dot is Los Angeles County. That county has the same population as ALL of the blue sections,\u201d reads the image\u2019s text, shown above a map with a majority of states across the country shaded in blue. \u201cAny questions as to why we need to keep the Electoral College?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not true that \u201cALL of the blue sections\u201d has the same population as Los Angeles County.\n\nWhether one interprets the text as meaning that the blue-shaded states collectively have the same population as Los Angeles County, or that each of the states independently have the same population, it\u2019s wrong.\n\nLos Angeles County has a population of 10.1 million, according to the U.S. Census\u2019s 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.\n\nThe states in blue collectively far outnumber Los Angeles County\u2019s population, and individually most states have lower populations \u2014 or in Georgia\u2019s case, slightly higher. Idaho\u2019s population, for example, was recorded at about 1.7 million, according to the Census survey. New Jersey, meanwhile, had nearly 9 million. Georgia, a reported 10.2 million.\n\nThe seven states not highlighted in blue \u2014 California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York \u2014 all have more residents than Los Angeles County.\n\nBy highlighting the states that mostly have lower populations than Los Angeles County, the creator of the image may have been attempting to illustrate an argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College: that it forces candidates to consider the interests of citizens in more rural, less populated areas of the country.\n\nThe Electoral College was established by the Constitution. The process has resulted in five presidential candidates losing the election despite winning the popular vote \u2014 most recently in 2000 and 2016 with Democrats Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, respectively. Prior to that, the last time it happened was in 1888.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cElectoral College Fast Facts.\u201d Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives.
