The Dutch authorities told us it had approved the use of face masks that conform to some Chinese and American standards.\n\nThis would mean that, while the UK and the EU have the same standards in normal times, at the moment, exports of PPE from the UK to the EU would not necessarily be compliant for UK use.\n\nBut putting that aside, on the day of PMQs, the Telegraph newspaper\u2019s front page carried a story about the export of face masks to the EU by a firm called Veenak International.\n\nA spokesperson for Veenak told us that the PPE shipped back to the EU conformed to European standards, which means that even if those EU countries have relaxed their standards, this kit was compliant with normal EU-standards and so fit for use in the UK.\n\nVeenak\u2019s spokesperson told us the company was now mainly supplying into the UK.\n\nA government spokesperson told Full Fact: \"We are incredibly grateful [for] thousands of offers of support from suppliers as part of the national effort to ensure that appropriate PPE is reaching the frontline.\n\n\"We are working rapidly to assess these offers, ensuring they meet the safety and quality standards that our NHS and social care workers need, and prioritising offers of larger volumes.\"", "lang": "en"}
