This video was not deceptively edited, nor was the audio manufactured. However, this video does not capture a narrative-destroying, hot-mic moment. Rather, it shows an informal conversation between two friends and some gallows humor.\n\nThe video was widely shared on social media as if it showed members of the news media \u201cadmitting\u201d that COVID-19 pandemic was a hoax. Others highlighted a comment from Mills in which he says that \u201cwe\u2019ve all been vaccinated.\u201d These social media users did not, however, question how these two claims \u2014 the disease is a hoax and that everyone has been vaccinated for the disease \u2014 could even co-exist. How would you vaccinate against a disease that isn\u2019t real?\n\nRoberts told the Associated Press that the exchange captured in this video showed some \u201csardonic gallows humor\u201d between friends, that the conversation was a \u201ctotal joke,\u201d and that \u201cclearly no one has been vaccinated\u201d because no COVID-19 vaccine yet exists.\n\nThe conversation in the above-displayed video largely deals with a recent study from the University of Southern California that found the infection rate in the state was likely much higher than originally reported. While this study suggests that more people may be carrying the virus, it also may mean that the fatality rate could be much lower.\n\nRoberts asked the White House\u2019s Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx about this study during the press conference:\n\nIn sum, the viral video truly shows an informal exchange between Roberts and Mills in which Mills joked that COVID-19 was a hoax. While this video was shared as if it featured a \u201cbombshell\u201d revelation, it really just showed an off-the-cuff exchange between two friends.\n\nIn fact, at the end of this viral video, after Roberts has told his friend Mills about the new study, Mills jokes that \u201cit was a hoax,\u201d to which Roberts responds: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was a hoax.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
