According to media reports, none survived the crash \u2014 including seven others who were aboard the helicopter. In a spine chilling prediction, a twitter user \u2014 dotNoso \u2014 reportedly predicted that Kobe would \u2018end up dying in a helicopter crash.'\u201d\n\nSimilar articles were published by Gulf News, the Times of India, News18, and NDTV.\n\nTwitter user @dotNoso\u2019s tweet came to prominence after Bryant\u2019s death. It read: \u201cKobe is going to end up dying in a helicopter crash.\u201d According to its timestamp, it was published at 4:32 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Nov. 13, 2012 \u2060\u2014 nearly eight years before the basketball star\u2019s death:\n\nSome social media users had speculated that @dotNoso might have somehow published the tweet after Bryant\u2019s death in January 2020 but artificially edited the timestamp so that it appeared to have first been tweeted in 2012, perhaps using a third-party Twitter client or application. This was not the case. In response to our inquiries, a spokesperson for Twitter told Snopes it is simply not possible for anyone to edit the text or timestamp of a tweet once it has been published.\n\nTherefore, @dotNoso\u2019s eerily prescient tweet was authentic and was indeed first published in November 2012. It\u2019s not clear what inspired or prompted the post, nor the level of earnestness associated with it.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2020, the day of the helicopter crash, @dotNoso appeared to express remorse in a new tweet posted as a response to the initial tweet.\n\nEven in 2012, Bryant was publicly known to own and regularly use a helicopter for personal travel, and on Nov. 12 and 13, in the hours before @dotNoso\u2019s tweet, Sports Illustrated and USA Today both published articles about Bryant\u2019s helping his Lakers teammate Steve Blake by flying him to the hospital in his personal helicopter. It\u2019s possible that the now-infamous tweet was no more than a morbid response to the basketball player\u2019s frequent use of that particular mode of transport.", "lang": "en"}
