No, that's not true: the claim was made up by a liberal satire page on Facebook looking to troll conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing fake news. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from a post with a meme image published on October 9, 2018 by a Facebook page named \"America's Last Line Of Defense \" (archived here) with following text:\n\nThe caption on the meme read:\n\nSpotify & iTunes have dropped all of her songs from their playlists. This will cost her $millions.\n\nHowever Swift is definitely still available on iTunes and also on Spotify:\n\nWhich makes sense since the Facebook page that originally published the meme has an \"Info\" tab that reads like this:\n\nInfo\n\nNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\n\nColofon\n\nUse the force and the truth shall reveal itself. Just not here. Ever.\n\nProducten\n\nGood Old Fashioned Liberal Troll Provided Fantasy presented as comedy to the left and a social experiment to the right. Please don't hurt the Trumpanzees. they'll be gone in a few years back to the shadows from whence they came and we'll be back to trolling Tea Turds.", "lang": "en"}
