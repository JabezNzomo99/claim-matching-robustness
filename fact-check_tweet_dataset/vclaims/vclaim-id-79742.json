The claim is false; the footage actually shows a fire at a shopping mall in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook by user \u676d\u5bcc\u8d22 on September 18, 2019. It has been viewed more than 31,000 times.\n\nIn the one minute, 27-second video, flame and smoke can be seen filling the central section of a shopping mall. The footage is shaky, and a person\u2019s voice can be heard throughout on the audio.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe camera later moves closer to the blaze, and a fire alarm can be heard as people are seen leaving the area.\n\nA journalist in AFP's Hong Kong bureau analysed the footage. Some Mandarin phrases can be heard on the audio: \u201cOn the scene\"; \u201cFire at furniture exhibition\"; \u201cDisperse the crowd\u201d.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cPacific Place in Admiralty. The mob was setting fire just now, so that the indoor oxygen could be dried out soon, and people could die together.\u201d\n\nHong Kong witnessed three months of street protests which have at times become violent, including demonstrators throwing petrol bombs and setting fires in the city's streets.\n\nThe same video was published on Facebook here, here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the fire happened at a shopping mall in Malaysia. The cause of the blaze remains under investigation, according to the mall\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the video found this news article published by Singaporean news channel Channel News Asia, headlined: \u201cFire breaks out at Johor Bahru shopping mall\u201d.\n\nThe CNA article states in part: \u201cJOHOR BAHRU: A blaze broke out at an exhibitor's display in a popular shopping centre in Johor Bahru on Wednesday (Sep 18) afternoon, setting off fire alarms.\n\n\u201cFirefighters were called to The Mall, Mid Valley Southkey Johor after the reports of a fire on the ground floor of the shopping centre at around 2.15pm.\u201d\n\nThe same video used in the misleading posts can be seen here on Twitter. The footage is embedded below.\n\nThe CNA article also links to this announcement published by The Mall, Mid Valley Southkey\u2019s official Facebook page, posted on September 18, 2019.\n\nThe English announcement states: \u201cINCIDENT AT THE MALL, MID VALLEY SOUTHKEY, JOHOR, Wednesday, 18 September 2019\n\n\"The management of The Mall, Mid Valley Southkey, would like to confirm that an incident occurred at our premises earlier this afternoon.\n\n\"Details: A fire broke out at an exhibitor\u2019s display at the Centre Court, Ground Floor, The Mall, Mid Valley Southkey, at around 2:14pm, and was subsequently contained by Emergency Response Team at 2:18pm. As of 4pm, we can confirm that there have been no injuries or casualties reported.\n\n\"Members of the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia are currently on scene, conducting all necessary investigations, and securing the premises for the safety of all present with no further disruptions to the mall operations.\n\n\"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused. We would like to reiterate that the safety of our shoppers and guests remains our top priority.\u201d\n\nAFP found photos of the mall on its official Facebook page here and here, which correspond with the mall seen in the misleading video.\n\nBelow are two sets of comparison between screenshots from the misleading video (L) and photos from the mall\u2019s Facebook page (R), with corresponding parts circled in red:\n\nCorresponding photos can also be seen on Google Maps, such as this one and this one posted by users.\n\nBelow are screenshots of these two photos from Google Maps:\n\nThe Malaysian mall fire was also covered such as here by local newspaper The Star and here by the Malay Mail.", "lang": "en"}
