Montenegran officials said the plot sought to undermine the country\u2019s bid to join NATO.\n\nAccording to Kantic, Shishmakov and another Russian operative orchestrated the coup from neighboring Serbia using mobile phone encryption and surveillance technology.\n\nAbout 20 people - including Shishmakov and several pro-Russia citizens of Serbia - are wanted by Montenegrin police.\n\nShishmakov was traveling under a passport issued to the name of Eduard Shirokov, Kantic said.\n\n\u2018So the passport was given to him by certain Russian state bodies under another name, and he is a member of the Russian military structures,\" Katnic said. \"It is clear that the passport on another name could not have been issued...without the involvement of certain (Russian state) structures.\"\n\nCiting documents, a Russian news agency, Fontanka.ru based in Saint Petersburg, said Shishmakov and Shirokov are one and the same.\n\nShishmakov, was a Russian secret service operative who once served as deputy military attache to Poland.\n\nFollowing Kantic\u2019s allegations, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called the claim as \"absurd\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"There can't be even talk about any sort of Russian officials' interference into Montenegro's internal affairs,\" Peskov said. \"Russia hasn't interfered and isn't going to interfere into domestic affairs of other countries, and in particular Montenegro with which we have very good relations.\"\n\nBut analysts say Russia and Montenegro had good relations after Montenegro's independence referendum, but they soured after it became clear that Montenegro was planning and would join NATO.\n\nAnd as for Russia not interfering in other nations domestic affairs, a Polygraph.info fact check shows growing evidence of Russian meddling in elections and public opinion in the West.\n\nStill, Lavrov said the Montenegrin claims are \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d and added there is \u201cnot a single fact\u201d to prove the accusation.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Podgorica said it had received no official inquiries regarding the accusations.\n\nBut there is growing evidence from outside of Montenegro that Russia was likely behind the attempt coup.\n\nOn February 18, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported, citing British government sources, that UK and U.S. intelligence have found evidence of Russian government involvement. The report concluded that Moscow had given its \"support and blessing\" to the plot.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also reportedly discussed the issue on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bonn, Germany on February 15.\n\nLavrov said the British report was \"far-fetched.\" He said the British media had \"more than once hyped scenarios out of thin air, such as the (Aleksandr) Litvinenko issue,\" referring to the former KGB officer and critic of Putin who was assassinated with radioactive poison in London in 2006.\n\nRussian political scholar Anton Shekhovtsov, a visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Austria, told Polygraph.info via email, that \u201cMontenegrin chief prosecutor's accusations are quite serious. I also think that some Russian actors were behind the failed coup attempt.\u201d\n\nBut Shekhovtsov said it is \u201cnecessary to know whether those Russians involved in the case acted on the direct orders from any Russian state agency or whether they were independent political entrepreneurs who sought to 'present' the coup to the Kremlin and get something in return for their actions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
