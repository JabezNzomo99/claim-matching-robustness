These ratings are given by the police watchdog HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in its most recent report.\n\nHaving said that, only one of the 43 forces rated, Durham, was given an \u2018outstanding\u2019 rating for effectiveness. The other 28 Ms Truss is talking about were rated \u2018good\u2019.\n\nThere were also 13 forces rated as \u2018requires improvement\u2019 and one that was rated \u2018inadequate\u2019, Bedfordshire.\n\nAs well as ratings for their effectiveness, police forces are also rated on their efficiency and legitimacy over the course of the year. More forces were rated as good or outstanding overall in these elements in 2016 than for effectiveness.\n\nWhat did HMIC say about neighbourhood policing?\n\nThe most recent HMIC assessment of police forces\u2019 effectiveness focused on four key questions for each. The first of these questions looked at how good the force was at preventing crime, tackling anti-social behaviour and keeping people safe. HMIC told us that neighbourhood policing was mostly, but not entirely, covered by this question.\n\nOther questions looked at how good police were at investigating crime, protecting the vulnerable and tackling serious and organised crime. The ratings each force got for these four individual elements all fed into the overall rating they received. HMIC told us that some elements of neighbourhood policing might also be found in these areas.\n\nOn the question of crime prevention 32 forces, or almost three quarters, were rated good (30 forces) or outstanding (two), but that was a deterioration on the previous year\u2019s results. HMIC found \u201cevidence that the service is suffering from the reduction in neighbourhood-based teams. This is a consequence of forces giving priority to addressing vulnerability and risk and on occasion broader budget reductions\u201d.\n\nAcross all police forces, HMIC highlighted neighbourhood policing as one of its areas of concern. It said it \u201cfound that neighbourhood policing continues to be eroded. The police service is no longer consistently implementing elements of neighbourhood policing known to be effective in preventing and tackling traditional crime and has not yet applied these to 21st century threats (online crime and so-called hidden and complex crimes)\u201d.\n\nIt also recommended that there should be national guidelines on what makes for effective neighbourhood policing which all forces should check their performance against.", "lang": "en"}
