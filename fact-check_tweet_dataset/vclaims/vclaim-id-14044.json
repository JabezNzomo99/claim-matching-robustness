A city spokesman told us a plan to phase out government purchases of processed meats and reduce purchases of beef \u201cwould not impact hot dogs\u201d sold \u201cat baseball games, street vendors, restaurants, etc.\u201d\n\nNew York City recently unveiled what it has dubbed its own \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 a reference to congressional Democrats\u2019 proposal to address climate change.\n\nThe city\u2019s plans are part of a larger effort known as \u201cOneNYC 2050,\u201d which also touches on issues such as economic inequalities and health. The initiative calls for a \u201cnearly 30 percent additional reduction in emissions by 2030.\u201d It contains numerous components \u2013 including a mandate that large buildings cut emissions, or face penalties, and a goal to \u201cconvert government operations to 100 percent clean electricity.\u201d\n\nBut in some circles on social media, thousands of users shared headlines zeroing in on one supposed target of the plan: hot dogs.\n\n\u201cNYC To Ban Hot Dogs and Processed Meats To Improve Climate,\u201d reads the misleading headline posted on a network of radio websites.\n\nAt least 20 various iHeart.com pages published the same story, which has an equally disingenuous opening sentence: \u201cNew York City is the first city in the United States to eliminate processed meats.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the changes outlined apply only to meat purchases by the city government.\n\n\u201cThis policy would apply only to City purchases. The plan is to phase out completely purchases of processed meats by agencies, and reduce how much agencies spend on beef by 50 percent,\u201d a city spokesman, Phil Ortiz, told FactCheck.org in an email. \u201cThis would affect, for example, hamburgers in NYC public school lunches. It would not impact hot dogs at baseball games, street vendors, restaurants, etc.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the changes would be made; we asked and Ortiz said: \u201cWe will have more to say about the implementation in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe iHeart.com story only hints at what is truly happening in the second paragraph, which says: \u201cThe plan will cut purchases of red meat by 50 percent in its city-controlled facilities such as hospitals, schools, and correctional facilities.\u201d\n\nOther websites, such as thedcpatriot.com, carried similarly misleading headlines. And another post that appeared on an iHeart.com website \u2014 \u201cNYC Banning Hot Dogs As Part Of Green New Deal\u201d \u2014 further distorts the facts.\n\n\u201cCould this be the end of the dirty water dog?\u201d it reads. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love a dirty water dog before or after a show in the city \u2026 What are your thoughts on this proposed ban on hot dogs and processed meats?\u201d\n\nThe full \u201cOneNYC report\u201d report doesn\u2019t even specifically mention hot dogs. It does, however, repeatedly note that the changes regarding processed meats and beef relate to city operations.\n\nThe report states at one point that the city will lead \u201cby example on climate change by ending City purchases of unnecessary single-use plastic foodware and phasing out the purchase of processed meat, cutting beef purchasing in half.\u201d\n\nIt also notes that processed meat \u201chas been linked with increased risk of cancer and is often high in saturated fat and sodium which is linked to heart disease. Processed meat will be replaced by healthier proteins, including an increase in plant-based options.\u201d\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, does indeed categorize processed meats as a \u201cGroup 1\u201d agent, which it defines as being \u201ccarcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the case of processed meat, this classification is based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer,\u201d also known as colon cancer, the WHO reports.\n\nWhile \u201cGroup 1\u201d also includes tobacco smoking and asbestos, the WHO notes that being in the same classification \u201cdoes NOT mean that they are all equally dangerous.\u201d Instead, the classification is based on \u201cthe strength of the scientific evidence about an agent being a cause of cancer, rather than assessing the level of risk.\u201d\n\nRed meat, meanwhile, is listed in \u201cGroup 2A\u201d \u2014 \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d On that, the WHO says \u201cthe classification is based on limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as well as strong mechanistic evidence.\u201d\n\nLivestock do indeed affect climate change, as we\u2019ve reported before. Cows, for example, produce and release methane, a greenhouse gas, as a result of digesting food. Almost a third of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are methane production from livestock. Methane is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.
