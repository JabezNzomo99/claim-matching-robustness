But days before the vote, President George W. Bush said, \u201cI hope this will not require military action, but it may.\u201d\n\u2022 overstated statistics on health care spending and medical bankruptices. For instance, he said \u201cworkers\u201d were \u201cpaying on average 20% of their incomes for health care,\u201d but the figure would be 12.7% based on the spending number his campaign cited.\n\u2022 None Sanders said that unless the U.S. leads \u201cthe world right now\u201d on climate change, \u201cthe planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable.\u201d While climate change is an urgent and serious issue, many scientists do not think it will render the entire planet uninhabitable.\n\u2022 Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was the only person \u201con this debate stage\u201d who answered \u201cIran\u201d in the \u201cvery first debate\u201d when asked \u201cwhat we saw as the biggest threat.\u201d True, but there was only one candidate on stage last night \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who was also in that first debate with Klobuchar.\n\u2022 Sanders claimed half a million people are \u201csleeping out on the streets,\u201d but a government count of unsheltered homeless people puts the number at closer to 200,000.\n\u2022 None Biden repeated a false claim that PolitiFact referred to his early climate change legislation as \u201ca game changer.\u201d The fact-checking website did not say that, although it did say he was a \u201cclimate change pioneer.\u201d\n\u2022 Sanders blamed two trade agreements for the loss of 4 million American jobs, but estimates on that vary.\n\nThe Jan. 14 debate, hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register, was held at Drake University in Iowa.\n\nBiden was wrong when he said only the wealthy are doing well in the current economy.\n\nWhether workers are doing \u201cwell\u201d may be a matter of opinion, but the fact is, rank-and-file workers have been making steady gains in weekly paychecks.\n\nFigures released earlier on the day of the debate by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers in \u201creal\u201d terms \u2014 that is, after adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose 2.5% during President Donald Trump\u2019s first 35 months in office. That\u2019s actually a more rapid pace than when Biden was vice president, when real weekly earnings rose 4% over eight years.\n\nFurthermore, rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (82% of all workers) are doing just a bit better than their bosses during Trump\u2019s tenure. Real earnings for them have gone up 2.6%.\n\nTo be sure, those at the top are gaining faster. A study last year by ISS Analytics for the Harvard Law School\u2019s Forum on Corporate Governance found that the median compensation of chief executive officers of S&P 600 corporations rose 95% (before inflation) between 2009 and 2018, while median worker pay rose only 20%.\n\nBut saying that \u201conly\u201d the wealthy are doing well is just not true.\n\nBiden continued to spin the history around his vote in 2002 to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, claiming the Bush administration \u201csaid they were not going to go to war\u201d and only sought weapons inspections. In a speech days before Biden\u2019s vote, Bush made clear that military action was possible.\n\nBiden also misleadingly claimed that from the moment the war started, \u201cI was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\u201d Biden criticized President Bush for getting into the war too soon, with too few allies, and without a clear plan to \u201cwin the peace,\u201d but he did not initially oppose the war altogether.\n\nHere\u2019s how Biden described things during the debate:\n\nIn a speech on Oct. 7, 2002, just days before Congress would vote on a resolution authorizing military force against Iraq, Bush said that after years of \u201ccontainment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nBush did call for new, tougher inspections and sanctions \u2014 as Biden said during the debate. But contrary to Biden\u2019s claim that the Bush administration assured \u201cthey were not going to go to war,\u201d Bush made clear in that speech that war was possible.\n\n\u201cI hope this will not require military action, but it may,\u201d Bush said.\n\nA day after the resolution passed the House on Oct. 10, 2002, it passed the Senate 77-23, with Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voting in favor.\n\nIn the days and weeks before and after the war started, Biden said that while the hope was that the resolution could be used to leverage further inspections, he also acknowledged it was a vote for the possibility of war.\n\n\u201cThe way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,\u201d Biden said in a CNN interview two weeks after the war started. \u201cIt\u2019s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we\u2019ve [done] that then it\u2019s his decision to prosecute the war.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Biden also misleadingly claimed that from the moment the war actually started, \u201cI was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of \u201cwinning the peace\u201d once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime was toppled.\n\nIn other words, Biden argued that it was a mistake the way the Bush administration went to war, but Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion. The day the war commenced, Biden told CNN: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn\u2019t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn\u2019t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose on March 20, 2003, the day after the start of the war, Biden said, \u201cI all along, Charlie, believed the right decision is to separate him from his weapons and/or separate him from power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the U.N. didn\u2019t do it, do it?\u201d Rose interjected.\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019ve gotta do it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not the time to argue it, but I am disturbed at the lost opportunities we had to bring the rest of the world along with us to this point. \u2026 And so now the question is \u2026 can you make lemonade out of lemons here?\u201d\n\nIn a Brookings Institution address on July 31, 2003, Biden said the Bush administration was \u201cright to confront the challenge posed by Saddam thumbing his nose at the world and refusing \u2014 refusing \u2014 to alter his conduct. Contrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. So I commend the president. \u2026 For me, the issue was never whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam. And it\u2019s precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we\u2019re paying the price for it now.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Nov. 27, 2005, that Biden acknowledged on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his 2002 vote authorizing force in Iraq was \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nSanders made several claims about health care that were close to true, but not quite there.\n\nSanders went too far (again) when he claimed: \u201cWe\u2019re spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.\u201d The U.S. spends twice as much as most countries \u2014 and twice as much as the average for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries \u2014 but not twice as much as \u201cany other country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the most recent OECD data, the U.S. per capita spending ($10,586) was twice as much as every country except six others, though the U.S. spending was close to double the amount for several of those nations (Denmark, Austria and Sweden). However, Switzerland\u2019s per capita spending was $7,317; Norway\u2019s was $6,187, and Germany came in at $5,986.\n\nThe senator also exaggerated in claiming that \u201cyou\u2019ve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills.\u201d The research he has cited indicates that medical bills or health problems contributed to \u2014 but not solely caused in all cases \u2014 a half million bankruptcy filings. We wrote more about the claim after the September debate.\n\nSanders claimed that \u201cworkers\u201d were \u201cpaying on average 20% of their incomes for health care. That is insane.\u201d His campaign pointed us to a figure from the Milliman Medical Index, which said in 2018 the cost for a \u201ctypical family of four\u201d with an employer-sponsored health plan was $12,378, which includes employee contributions to premiums and out-of-pocket costs. That figure is nearly 20% of the 2018 median household income of $63,179, according to Census Bureau figures (see Table H-11), the campaign said. But that\u2019s not the correct Census statistic to use for a \u201cfamily of four.\u201d\n\nThe average household size was 2.52 people. Census does have a median income figure for a family of four, and that\u2019s $97,631 (see Table F-8). That would make $12,378 in health care spending 12.7% of the median income for a family of four.\n\nNear the end of the debate, moderators asked candidates about climate change, drawing out a response from Sanders in which he suggested the planet could become unlivable.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what timeline Sanders had in mind, or what he meant by \u201cuninhabitable,\u201d but many scientists disagree with the notion that the entire planet will soon become uninhabitable because of climate change.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before when clarifying politicians\u2019 comments about climate change being an \u201cexistential\u201d threat, NASA scientist Benjamin Cook said that it was plausible that some parts of the world could become unlivable. \u201cIn a given locality, if the impacts are so severe,\u201d he said in a phone interview, the current way of life could become \u201cno longer tenable.\u201d\n\nBut he did not think that would happen everywhere. The effects, he said, are likely to be uneven, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest.\n\nScientists who reviewed a 2017 New York magazine story about climate change, \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth,\u201d for the website Climate Feedback also repeatedly noted that they found the notion that the planet would be uninhabitable to be unrealistic.\n\n\u201cWhile it is clear that ongoing warming of the global climate would eventually have very severe consequences, the concept of the Earth becoming uninhabitable within anywhere near the timescales suggested in the article [by 2100] is pure hyperbole,\u201d said Richard Betts, a climate researcher at the U.K.\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and a professor at the University of Exeter.\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain also commented, \u201cThe title itself is hyperbolic\u2014there\u2019s not really a plausible climate change scenario in which the Earth becomes truly uninhabitable.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar sought to separate herself from other Democratic candidates on the issue of Iran by claiming that she alone was prescient enough to see that Iran was the \u201cbiggest threat to our world.\u201d\n\nBecause of the large Democratic field, the first debate was split into two nights \u2014 June 26 and June 27, 2019, and 10 candidates participated in each debate for a total of 20 candidates. Klobuchar is referring to a question that was asked only of 10 of the 20 candidates \u2014 the \u201cfirst night of the very first debate\u201d \u2014 and the only candidate on stage last night who was also in that first debate with Klobuchar was Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThat night, co-moderator Chuck Todd asked: \u201cWhat is our \u2014 what is the biggest threat \u2014 what is \u2014 who is the geopolitical threat to the United States? Just give me a one-word answer.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar gave two answers, and was chided for it by Todd.\n\nWarren, following the rules, simply replied \u201cclimate change.\u201d Biden, Sanders, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and businessman Tom Steyer were not in the June 26 debate, so they weren\u2019t asked that question.\n\nKlobuchar also misled when she said that in her answer to the question about the biggest threat she said Iran \u201cbecause of Donald Trump, because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies.\u201d We provide her entire answer above.\n\nKlobuchar is referring to another question asked during the same debate \u2014 but that question was not asked of Warren or any of the other candidates in last night\u2019s debate.\n\nLester Holt, who was also a moderator of the June 26 debate, asked Klobuchar if the nuclear agreement was a \u201cgood deal\u201d for the United States. She said it was \u201cimperfect\u201d but a \u201cgood deal for that moment.\u201d She went on to express concern about Iran exceeding the limits on enriching uranium and the possibility of war.\n\nBut Klobuchar is not the only Democratic candidate who sees Iran as a threat or fears Trump will lead the U.S. to war with Iran.\n\nIn the first night of the second debate, Warren said the world is getting \u201ccloser and closer to nuclear warfare\u201d because Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nSanders exaggerated when he said repeatedly that 500,000 people are \u201csleeping out on the streets.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. The most recent annual assessment of the homeless population, released Jan. 13 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, estimated that 211,293 people were homeless and without shelter on the night the census was taken in 2019.\n\nSanders was referring to the total population of homeless people, which HUD estimated at 567,715. As HUD\u2019s report to Congress stated, \u201cJust under two-thirds (63%) of people experiencing homelessness were staying in sheltered locations, and just over one-third (37%) were found in unsheltered locations.\u201d\n\nBy that measure, Sanders\u2019 talking point is not even half true.\n\nAfter Sanders\u2019 uninhabitable comment, Biden was given the floor to talk about climate change \u2014 and he used the opportunity to remind viewers of his historical role in taking action on the issue.\n\n\u201cMy response is, back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cand check [PolitiFact], they said it was a game changer.\u201d\n\nWe did check PolitiFact, and as in the November debate, when Biden made the same claim, it doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\nPolitiFact wrote in May about Biden\u2019s role in legislation that was introduced in 1986 and passed in 1987, after the former vice president claimed to be \u201cone of the first\u201d people to introduce a climate change bill.\n\nWhile the headline referred to Biden as a \u201cclimate change pioneer,\u201d the article never used the words \u201cgame changer.\u201d The article also specifically noted that the bill, which directed the president to establish a global warming task force, essentially was a plan to make a plan \u2014 and should not be confused for a substantive bill that tackled greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSanders blamed two trade agreements \u2014 the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China \u2014 for the loss of 4 million American jobs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear exactly how many jobs have been affected by the deals.\n\nHere\u2019s what the senator said in an exchange with Biden:\n\nSanders\u2019 figure is backed up by the labor-funded Economic Policy Institute. The EPI estimated that the U.S. has lost 3.4 million jobs since the U.S. granted permanent normal trade relations with China in 2001. The institute also estimated that NAFTA cost the U.S. 682,900 jobs, as of 2013.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, however, found that NAFTA didn\u2019t have a big impact on jobs. In a 2017 report, it said, \u201cIn reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.\u201d\n\nAnd the impact of PNTR with China since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 is similarly unsettled. A 2017 working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the job losses in manufacturing have been partly offset by job gains in other parts of the economy.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Sanders has trotted out a reference to job losses due to trade deals, we wrote about a similar claim he made during a primary debate in 2016.\n\nClimateFeedback.org. \u201cScientists explain what New York Magazine article on \u2018The Uninhabitable Earth\u2019 gets wrong.\u201d 12 Jul 2017.\n\nKruzel, John. \u201cWas Joe Biden a climate change pioneer in Congress?
