It's just strange, because they're saying it's because it's easy to travel among these countries. But they're separate from the U.K.,\" Pelosi said. \"Well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K. Again, it's a decision they made. It has its ramifications. We'll see whether it's worth the trouble.\"\n\nPelosi said she wasn\u2019t there to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s decisions, but emphasized that testing would be \"the only way\" to learn how the virus is spreading.\n\nPolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at Pelosi\u2019s comments about travel in Europe and how it relates to the details in Trump\u2019s proclamation.\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamation seeks to restrict \"all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.\"\n\nU.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their close relatives are exempt from the ban. So are numerous categories of other people.\n\nThe Schengen Area covers European states that agree to free movement among their nations without border checks. Countries in the zone include Austria, Belgium, and France (here\u2019s the full list). The United Kingdom \u2014 England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 is not part of the Schengen Area. (Neither is the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union that borders Northern Ireland.)\n\nWhen Pelosi said \"well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K,,\" she was referring to the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel is the short name) that runs under the English Channel linking England and France. People move from one country to the other via trains.\n\nHowever, even if someone gets from France to the United Kingdom, they can\u2019t get on a plane right away and come to the United States, since Trump\u2019s proclamation bars people who had been in Schengen Area two weeks before.\n\nPeople from the United Kingdom who traveled to a Schengen Area state in the two weeks before their attempted travel to the United States would presumably be barred entry, unless they qualify for the exemptions.\n\nPelosi didn\u2019t say that a person could cross the Chunnel and then immediately travel from the United Kingdom to the United States, said Henry V. Connelly, Pelosi\u2019s deputy communications director.\n\n\"The point is that, with the ease of travel between the U.K. and the continent, there\u2019s not a meaningful difference in risk of the community spread of coronavirus between the two \u2014 and thus, not much difference in the coronavirus risk from a person from the U.K. or from inside Schengen Area,\" Connelly said.\n\nSpeaking of Trump\u2019s Europe travel restriction exempting the United Kingdom, Pelosi said, \"Well you can just get into the Chunnel, and you\u2019ll be in the U.K.\"\n\nIt isn't that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France. The travel ban applies to people who were in the Schengen Area 14 days before their attempted travel to the United States. So someone in France who traveled to England would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions.\n\nPelosi\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
