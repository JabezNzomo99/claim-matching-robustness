We\u2019ve covered this in depth. Before the ACA was enacted, Hobby Lobby actually had provided coverage for all 20 FDA-approved contraceptive procedures required under the law. After the law was passed, the owners decided to object to four of the contraceptives (\u201cmorning-after\u201d pills and intrauterine devices, or IUDs) on religious grounds. The company\u2019s founder, David Green, said the family believed covering the four contraceptives \u201cwould violate their deeply held religious belief.\u201d So the family\u2019s challenge to the law did not include other forms of contraception, like the birth-control pill.\n\n\u201cI believe the sharp contrast in language between the actual legal question\u2014is there a conflict between the owners\u2019 religious beliefs and the law\u2014and Judge Gorsuch\u2019s oracular description of the case is very telling. The legal issue has nothing to do with \u2018the wrongdoing of others\u2019 and Judge Gorsuch gratuitously injects that into the case. His decision to write this concurrence tells you something about his philosophy. His choice to make it about \u2018complicity\u2019 and \u2018the wrongdoing of others\u2019 rather than just about the clash between the owners\u2019 views and the statute is revelatory of his thinking about the topic. And his universalizing of the question\u2014\u2019All of us\u2019 is twice repeated\u2014also shows that he is going well beyond the narrow role of resolving a straightforward legal dispute.\u201d\n\nWe asked whether Kaine is referring to all forms of contraceptive, or the four identified in the Hobby Lobby ruling. Kaine responded that Gorsuch did not word his concurring opinion narrowly to apply just to the four: \u201cJudge Gorsuch could have introduced his concurrence in the narrow way favored by the majority and said something like, \u2018Can the Green family maintain suit under RFRA against an ACA mandate requiring their company, in opposition to their religious beliefs, to provide health coverage for certain forms of birth control?\u2019 He chose to greatly broaden the question to be about \u2018all of us\u2019 and our \u2018complicity\u2019 in \u2018the wrongdoing of others.'\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.): \u201cLet me invoke your beliefs as a commentator. Do you believe it was the right result, based on your understanding of law \u2014 not your personal beliefs about whether contraceptives are a good thing or a bad thing, but your beliefs about the constitutional underpinning, the right to privacy, the Fourth Amendment, substantive due process, underpinning of Griswold versus Connecticut, was it the right result?\u201d Gorsuch: \u201cSenator, I\u2019ve consistently \u2014 I\u2019m not picking out Griswold or any other particular case \u2014 I\u2019ve drawn a line that I think is required of a good judge to be fair and to respect the separation of powers, without respect to precedent. A precedent of the United States Supreme Court, as we were talking with Senator Flake, they\u2019re all precedents. They all deserve respect of a judge. [\u2026] I have said, Senator, that, with this particular precedent we\u2019re talking about, that it\u2019s over 50 years old \u2014 weighty factor; that the reliance interests around it are many and great. I have said that it has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court. I\u2019ve said that I cannot imagine a state actually legislating in this area. And I have said that I cannot imagine the Supreme Court taking someone wishing to challenge that precedent seriously. I don\u2019t know how much more clear I could be to you, Senator.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal: \u201cYou\u2019re unwilling to say that. And you\u2019re unwilling to say, as Chief Justice Roberts did about Griswold, I agree with the Griswold court\u2019s conclusion, that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that.\u201d Gorsuch: \u201cRespectfully, Senator, I think we\u2019re splitting hairs. I really do because I have told you quite clearly that both of those precedents are in the realm of 50 years old, that have serious reliance interests around them, that they\u2019ve been repeatedly reaffirmed. And Senator, what I\u2019ve tried to do with respect to all precedents is treat them equally, in my presentation before you. Because as a judge, I come at them equally. In my line of work, a precedent is a heavy, a weighty thing. And it deserves respect as precedent, as part of our history. And \u2026 Blumenthal: \u201cWith all due respect, Your Honor, we\u2019re doing more than splitting hairs here, because words matter. And the words of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito were different than yours. Asking you to agree that these results were correct, I think is a relevant and important question. And your declining to do so \u2014 I respect your reasons, but I think that it speaks volumes, with all due respect.\u201d Gorsuch: \u201cWell, let me try one more \u2014 this way, Senator, for you. Maybe this will help. The way I look at it is, I don\u2019t come at these issues fresh. It\u2019s not whether I agree or disagree with any particular precedent. That would be an act of hubris. Because a precedent, once it\u2019s decided, it carries far more weight than what I personally think.\u201d\n\nKaine shouldn\u2019t assume that one tweet will capture the pages and pages of nuance and argument that he\u2019s set forth. All we had to do was look at Kaine\u2019s tweet and search the phrase \u201cwrongdoing of others\u201d in Gorsuch\u2019s opinion in the Hobby Lobby case to find that the judge was not directly referring to women\u2019s right to use contraceptives. Gorsuch is no pink-hat donning marcher for women\u2019s reproductive rights, but the tweet is in no way an accurate portrayal of his concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case. The tweet on its own would have received at least Three or Four Pinocchios, as it takes Gorsuch\u2019s words way out of context.", "lang": "en"}
