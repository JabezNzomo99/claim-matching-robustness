(EVM fraud in UP\u2019s Chandauli \u2013 Viral video has caused a ruckus -Afzal Ansari has staged a protest \u2013 The game of EVMs has begun in many states -translated)\u201d. The video also explicitly stated that it is from Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked the video in March 2019 when it was circulated with a false narrative that PM Modi, Amit Shah and the Election Commission had hatched a conspiracy to store electronic voting machines in strong rooms, which were then transported in an unnumbered school bus and two Bolero jeeps. It was found that the video was shot in November 2018 when Congress workers accused the BJP of tampering with votes, ahead of the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections. It was also claimed these EVMs reached the polling booth 48 hours after voting had concluded.\n\nHowever, the Chief Electoral Officer, Madhya Pradesh claimed that these were \u2018reserve\u2019 EVMs, stationed at police stations and were meant to be used as replacement for malfunctioning machines during polling. \u201cSuch machines were to be stored separately from polled EVMs. Strong room having polled EVMs was neither opened nor was supposed to be opened,\u201d read the quote-tweet by CEO MP.\n\nAccording to a report published by NDTV, government officials were not giving a clear answer on the issue. Alt News also found the same video uploaded on YouTube at least five months ago.\n\nA controversy did erupt over the allegation raised by the opposition parties of EVMs being unloaded from a truck without any security in Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHowever, the CEO UP allayed the apprehensions over the security of EVMs. He said, \u201cIn Chandauli, unused EVMs were unloaded in the store located on the Mandi Parishad premises (where strong rooms also exist) after informing representatives of all political parties. Suddenly, the representatives of a political party raised objection. They demanded that unused EVMs should be kept in the district collectorate. Later, the EVMs were shifted to the collectorate premises with representatives of all political parties present during the shifting.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that complaints regarding EVMs had indeed been raised by the opposition parties in Chandauli, MP. However, the video report published by National Dastak has passed off an old video from Madhya Pradesh as pertaining to the protest in Chandauli.", "lang": "en"}
