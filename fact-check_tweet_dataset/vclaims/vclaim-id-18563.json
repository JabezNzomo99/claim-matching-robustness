But that doesn\u2019t mean the government has \u201cfound homes\u201d for all those people.\n\nMany of these people will own homes, rent privately or won\u2019t have had financial support from the government in finding homes.\n\nThere were an estimated 320,000 homeless people in Great Britain at the start of 2018, but they definitely weren\u2019t all British citizens as the post implies. Data on homelessness is imprecise, and that figure is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nThe UN estimated the size of the UK\u2019s foreign-born population in 2017 was 8.8 million\n\nThere are two possible ways of measuring the size of the UK\u2019s foreign-born population.\n\nThe UN reports that the UK\u2019s foreign-born population was estimated to be 8.8 million . The UN uses census data as well as things like surveys and population registers to put together these figures. We don\u2019t know about the nationalities of these people, or how many are refugees.\n\nMeanwhile the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports that in 2018 the non-UK born population was 9.3 million. Being born abroad is different from citizenship status: according to the same data, the UK population of people who are not British citizens was 6.1 million. That data comes from the ONS\u2019 annual population survey.\n\nThe ONS and UN figures differ because they use different sources and methodologies to come to their final number. We\u2019ve talked more about the difference between the ONS data and UN data here.\n\nThe government didn\u2019t \u201cfind homes\u201d for all of them\n\nThe idea that the government has \u201cfound homes\u201d for the UK\u2019s entire immigrant population is without any foundation.\n\nAccording to research from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, in 2017, 42% of the foreign-born population owned their home, while 41% were private renters. (Compared to the UK-born population, they are more likely to rent privately and less likely to be home owners.)\n\nThose who were born abroad have similar rates of participation in social housing as the UK population, at 17% (compared to 16% for UK-born.)\n\nPeople who have requested asylum are able to get housing assistance while their asylum claim is being assessed if they are destitute. There were just under 32,000 asylum applications made in the year to March 2019.\n\nPeople in the UK illegally are not eligible for government assistance with housing.\n\n320,000 is a realistic figure for the number of homeless people in Great Britain, but it includes people who aren\u2019t from the UK\n\nHousing charity Shelter estimated that there were at least 320,000 homeless people in Great Britain at the start of 2018. We\u2019ve talked about this number several times before. Shelter used official homeless statistics for England, Scotland and Wales, submitted FOIs to councils and used the charity Homeless Link\u2019s research on the number of homeless hostel spaces.\n\nShelter\u2019s definition of homelessness included people in temporary accommodation (including places arranged by children\u2019s services), single people in homeless hostels and those sleeping rough. People in temporary accommodation are estimated to account for around 300,000 of the total.\n\nShelter said 320,000 is likely an underestimate, and as we\u2019ve said before, we think that\u2019s probably fair.\n\nNo one knows exactly how many homeless people are not UK nationals\n\nHomelessness charity Crisis said in a 2018 report that migrants \u201cclearly make up a significant proportion of the rough sleeping and wider homeless population across Britain, but there are significant gaps in data that are collected or published.\u201d\n\nA single night snapshot count of the number of rough sleepers in England during the autumn of 2018 found that about 64% were UK nationals (the nationality of 10% was not known).\n\nThe data for rough sleepers is more detailed in London. CHAIN (Combined Homelessness and Information Network) is a database recording the number of people found sleeping rough by outreach teams in London. Of those seen rough sleeping in Greater London in 2018/19, just under half were UK nationals.\n\nThis fact check doesn\u2019t address the claim that the government is \u201cignoring\u201d the homeless, which is a statement of opinion.", "lang": "en"}
