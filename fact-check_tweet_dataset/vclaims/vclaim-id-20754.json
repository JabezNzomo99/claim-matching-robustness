People are free to speak out and make a name for themselves as representatives of many political movements do,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments came the day before Putin met with the Austrian chancellor.\n\nThe Freedom House 2018 Freedom in the World report rates Russia \u201cNot Free,\u201d based on Russia\u2019s score on the \u201cFreedom rating\u201d \u2013 6.5; For \u201cPolitical rights\u201d \u2013 7; And for \u201cCivil liberties\u201d \u2013 6 on a scale of \u201c1=Most Free; 7=Least Free.\n\n\u201cPower in Russia\u2019s authoritarian political system is concentrated in the hands of President Vladimir Putin. With loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, a controlled media environment, and a legislature consisting of a ruling party and pliable opposition groups, the Kremlin is able to manipulate elections and inhibit genuine opposition. The country\u2019s rampant corruption is one notable threat to state power, as it facilitates shifting links among bureaucrats and organized crime groups,\u201d Freedom House said.\n\n\u201cThe media is not free in Russia, unfortunately,\u201d Roman Badanin, former editor-in-chief of an independent and privately owned television station TV Rain told Polygraph.info. \u201cPutin says many lies. He is very much aware of the pressure on the media and cases of government pressure on press freedoms in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe non-state Russian pollster Levada-Center found that in 2018, television remains the main source of information for 85% of Russians, or almost 125 million people.\n\nThere are twenty-two major national TV channels in Russia, and the federal government owns twenty of them either directly or via proxy firms such as Gazprom, a gas giant with state-controlled majority shares.\n\nDuring Putin\u2019s 16th \u201conline town hall\u201d with on June 7, Putin said the government does not interfere with the editorial policy of one of the major radio stations, the Echo of Moscow, despite the fact that the station is financed by Gazprom.\n\n\u201cGazprom does, in fact, pay for Echo of Moscow operations but does not interfere with its editorial policies,\u201d Putin said during the broadcast of Direct Line. \u201cIn part, this points to the fact that we pay attention to the so-called \u2018freedom of press\u2019.\u201d\n\nAlexey Veneditkov, the chief editor of the \u201cEcho of Moscow\u201d radio station, told Polygraph.info: \u201cGazprom does not interfere into the editorial practices at the radio, the president is correct.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Venedictov, \u201cThe freedom of press in Russia is constantly diminishing. Specifically, amendments and changes into the law in the recent years as well as court practices and police standards (that) are obviously repressive towards the press freedoms.\u201d\n\nAccording to Freedom House, the Russian government under Vladimir Putin has passed laws that have been used as leverage against independent media.\n\nSince 2014, the Russian government implemented policies targeting influential bloggers. The security forces have the authority to monitor and oversee Russian bloggers with daily audiences over 3,000. Such bloggers are required to register as media and obtain a media license.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called Russia one of the deadliest countries for independent media and in most cases crimes against reporters remain unsolved.\n\n\u201cToday, journalists in Russia and post-Soviet states risk intimidation, harassment, arrest, and even murder for their work. Those who criticize the government or investigate sensitive issues like corruption do so at their own peril. More often than not, cases remain unresolved and victims and families do not see justice,\u201d said CPJ in a meeting announcement last year.\n\nPUTIN: \"People are free to speak out\"\n\nPolygraph.info debunked, in the past, Vladimir Putin\u2019s claims regarding political freedom in Russia. Recently, Putin called the 2018 presidential elections the \u201cmost transparent and clean vote in Russian history.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion drawn by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was just the opposite.\n\n\u201cThe 18 March presidential election took place in an overly controlled legal and political environment marked by continued pressure on critical voices.,\u201d The OSCE reported. \u201cRestrictions on the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as well as on candidate registration, have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine competition. The extensive and uncritical coverage of the incumbent as president in most media resulted in an uneven playing field.\u201d\n\nRussia's past elections have been characterized by a number of irregularities, including changes to the rules for candidate registration which favored the incumbent, as well as election day irregularities such as ballot stuffing and carousel voting, the report said.\n\nBelow are some Individual cases that demonstrate the types of the consequences people in Russia face for attempting to \u201cspeak out.\u201d\n\nJune 8- Varvar Mikhailova was fined 160,000 rubles ($2,560) by a St. Petersburg court for participating in the city\u2019s May Day march with an anti-Putin banner.In 2012 Vitold Filipov was charged with extremism for \u201cliking\u201d a photo from the film American History X on the social network VKontakte. Filipov argued that the film is \u201canti-fascist\u201d and has been shown on Russian television, but he was still fined 1000 rubles (approximately $30 at the time).\n\nIn May 2018, 28 organizers from Navalny\u2019s organization were taken into custody and charged with \u201cinciting riots\u201d for retweets and shared posts on social media.\n\nIn June 2018, a court sentenced Vladimir Egorov, an activist with Russia\u2019s Yabloko Party, with extremism after he published a post on social media calling for Putin to be removed. He received three years of probation.\n\nIn May 2017 a court gave Ruslan Sokolovsky a 3.5 year suspended sentence for \u201coffending the feelings of religious believers\u201d after he played Pokemon Go in a church and later posted a video of himself doing it on Youtube. Sokolovsky did not disrupt the church service in any way.\n\nVolodymyr Balukh, a resident of Russian-occupied Crimea, was arrested after police searched his house when they noticed a Ukrainian flag flying from it. They later claimed to have found 90 rounds of ammunition and some explosives in the house, but this evidence has been largely refuted.", "lang": "en"}
