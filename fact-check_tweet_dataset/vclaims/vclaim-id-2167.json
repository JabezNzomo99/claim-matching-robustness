For example, an image was posted on Twitter in August 2017 by political commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza along with a message labeling Soros a Nazi collaborator:\n\nThe original photograph was taken at a campaign rally on 28 January 2008 at American University and showed then-candidate Barack Obama with Senator Ted Kennedy. At some point, Soros\u2019s head was superimposed over Kennedy\u2019s to make it appear as if Obama were conspiring with the billionaire, who has become a boogeyman to some segments of the American right wing.\n\nHere\u2019s the genuine photograph (left) and the doctored image (right):\n\nThe photograph was poorly digitally manipulated, and does not actually show Obama with Soros. The first clue is the lighting: the shadows on Obama\u2019s face (for example, beneath his earlobe) do not match the shadows on Soros\u2019s face. Soros, too, is slightly out of focus, whereas Obama is in perfect focus. You can even see a bit of Kennedy\u2019s hair where Soros\u2019s head was superimposed over it, which D\u2019Souza conveniently cropped out of the image in his tweet.\n\nAs for the claim that Soros was a \u201cNazi collaborator\u201d, we investigated that rumor in November 2016 and found it to be false.", "lang": "en"}
