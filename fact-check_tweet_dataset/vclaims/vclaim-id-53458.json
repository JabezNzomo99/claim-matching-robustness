The claim is false; the photo in fact shows Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah at iftar in 2018.\n\nThe photo of Shah, who is chief minister of Pakistan\u2019s Sindh province, was shared more than 4,300 times after being published on Facebook here on May 3, 2020.\n\nThe image features Urdu-language text that translates to English as: \u201cThe Chief Minister of Sindh who locked the mosques and got the worshippers beaten with batons after throwing Iftar parties giving a message to the people that corona is his brother.\u201d\n\nPakistan has been under various COVID-19 lockdown measures since March 2020. Ahead of the ongoing holy month of Ramadan, authorities did permit mosques to hold prayers and evening congregations, AFP reported.\n\nThe same photo was also shared alongside a similar claim here, here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo shows an event in 2018.\n\nKeyword searches also found another photo from the same party published in May 2018.\n\nMansoor Khokhar, a former journalist who attended the party, published a photo with Shah on Facebook here on May 23, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the photo on Khokhar's Facebook page (R) with Shah circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe chief minister\u2019s office also marked the iftar dinner on Twitter here on May 23, 2018.\n\nA Sindh government spokesman, Murtaza Wahab, said that the photo is from 2018 and condemned the posts as political misinformation against Shah and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the governing political party in Sindh.\n\n\u201cThere is a defamatory campaign going on in social media showing photos of an Iftaar Party attended by CM Sindh & other PPP leaders. Please note that no such event has taken place this year since there is a ban on social gatherings & the photos being circulated are of May 2018,\u201d Wahab said on Twitter on May 3.\n\nRasheed Channa, a media consultant in the chief minister\u2019s office, also refuted the claim.\n\n\u201cThese pictures were taken on May 23, 2018 at an Iftar party Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Shah had hosted at CM House. Some people have made these pictures viral again with the wrong caption of the Iftar party during the on-going Ramzan. As a matter of fact no such Iftar has been hosted at CM House,\u201d Channa told AFP by phone on May 4, 2020.\n\nSindh officials had announced on April 24 that no iftar celebration would be held by the provincial government, according to The News, a Pakistan-based English language newspaper.", "lang": "en"}
