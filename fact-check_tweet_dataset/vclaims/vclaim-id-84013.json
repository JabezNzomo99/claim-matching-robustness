The repercussions of speaking critically of the present regime in Delhi is well known now. Abuse, rape threats, death threats, endless trolling on social media and in some instances even physical attacks are various tactics employed by these trolls to drown every critical voice. But what happens when a Kargil martyr\u2019s daughter raises her voice?\n\nAfter the recent attack by ABVP members in Ramjas college, Delhi, on members of others unions such as SFI, AISA and other students, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of a Kargil martyr Captain Mandeep Singh, posed with a placard stating \u201cI am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP\u201d.\n\nIn India, we place a martyr\u2019s family at a much higher pedestal than others. Was Gurmehar spared of the wrath of the trolls? She wasn\u2019t. On the contrary, the attacks against her on social media are the most vile in recent times. The three images below collated by Lallantop shows a glimpse into the extent of abuse that this 20 year old has had to face.\n\n\u201cShe is terrorist now jisko dekho goli mar do janna nasib hogi \u2013 Nathuram Godse.\u201d\n\nSo, the \u2018nationalists\u2019 while professing their love for the country are threatening a 20 year old with rape because she dared to speak. Meanwhile, Gurmehar Kaur is taking on the hateful \u2018nationalists\u2019 with much poise and elegance.", "lang": "en"}
