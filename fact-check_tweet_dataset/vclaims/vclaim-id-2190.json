The photo appeared to show a shark swimming in the street, as shown from the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle.\n\nAs of this writing, the image had been liked more than 36,000 times and retweeted more than 28,000 times.\n\nBut it\u2019s a fake image, which appeared to have been first circulated at least as far back as 2011. The photo turned up after Hurricane Irene struck Puerto Rico. It linked to an Aug. 25, 2011, photo on imgur.com showing the big fish swimming alongside what looks like an SUV.\n\nThen it came back in 2012, with social media users claiming it was taken in New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy.\n\nIn 2015, this very same shark had already been spotted in Houston after severe floods.\n\nThen it somehow swam to North Myrtle Beach, S.C., after Hurricane Joaquin later in 2015.\n\nSo where did this really come from? The PhotoShopped image appeared to have taken the shark from a photo that ran in Africa Geographic in 2005.\n\nThat picture showed a great white shark swimming behind a kayak, and folks on Reddit noticed the similarities back in 2011.\n\nDon\u2019t believe this fish tale, because it\u2019s a hoax that has been luring people for years.
