But according to pundit and former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Zerlina Maxwell, Sanders\u2019 speech announcing his 2020 bid didn\u2019t do much to shore up his support.\n\nMaxwell, speaking on MSNBC following Sanders\u2019 remarks, said the senator had buried any mention of race and gender until deep into his 2020 presidential kickoff speech.\n\n\"I clocked it. He did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech,\" Maxwell said March 2. \"As somebody who is a black woman ... I was looking to hear messaging specifically for my community, and I did not, at least until 23 minutes into the speech. \"\n\nLater, she delivered the same message to her more than 150,000 Twitter followers \u2014 in a tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nBut a review of the tape shows Sanders made mention of these constituencies earlier in his speech, a reference Maxwell now says she accidentally overlooked.\n\nSanders staged his first 2020 campaign rally in Brooklyn, several miles from his birthplace. In opening remarks, he thanked his family and acknowledged several key supporters.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of his speech, Sanders proposed a re-ordering of America\u2019s governing principles, and made specific reference to race and gender (emphasis added):\n\n\"At our very first rally, I want to welcome you to a campaign, which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and religious bigotry. It will not be tax breaks for billionaires and efforts to throw millions off the health care that they currently have.\n\n\"This campaign is going to end all of that. The principles of our government will be based on justice. On economic justice, on social justice, on racial justice, on environmental justice.\"\n\nSanders referenced race and gender again around 21 minutes into his speech. Sanders pledged a campaign to unify the country, he said, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who \"wants to divide us up based on the color of our skin, based on where we were born, based on our gender, based on our religion or our sexual orientation.\"\n\nMSNBC aired the roughly 37-minute speech in its entirety. Afterwards, host Alex Witt turned to the panel for their reaction, at which point Maxwell claimed Sanders had been mute about race and gender until 23 minutes in.\n\n\"And just for point of comparison, I went back and looked at Elizabeth Warren\u2019s opening speech,\" Maxwell said. \"She mentions race and gender in the first paragraph. So that\u2019s a big difference.\"\n\nMaxwell\u2019s claim met with quick pushback. Journalist Glenn Greenwald noted that Sanders had been introduced by a series of speakers that included three African-Americans (among them was Greenwald\u2019s colleague at the Intercept, Shaun King), each of whom highlighted the senator\u2019s record as a champion of racial justice.\n\nResponding to criticism on Twitter, Maxwell walked back her initial claim. (She later deleted the erroneous initial tweet.)\n\n\"Ok. I\u2019ve rewatched since yesterday and while I can acknowledge that I missed the passing line at 6 minutes I stand by my point since talking about criminal justice is not the same thing as talking about race and gender and if you don\u2019t get why Bernie won\u2019t win....again. \u270c\ud83c\udffe\" she tweeted.\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact, Maxwell acknowledged the error, but stood by her broader point that Sanders had not adequately addressed the issues in his kickoff speech.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sanders delivered another campaign speech March 3 that addressed race in more explicit terms. After commemorating the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Ala., Sanders delivered a speech in Chicago that called to \"end the institutional racism which permeates almost every aspect of our society.\"\n\nMaxwell said, Sanders \"did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech\" announcing his 2020 presidential run.\n\nSanders made reference to race and gender within the first five minutes of his speech. Maxwell has since acknowledged that she overlooked this, and deleted an erroneous tweet.", "lang": "en"}
