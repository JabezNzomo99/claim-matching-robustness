Ganesh Kohli, a teacher and entrepreneur, is the founder of IC3 Movement to impact 1,75,000 high schools over 15 years. He has helped to build a platform that provides career and college counseling within schools. \n\n\n\nWe accessed the original video posted before three years.\n\n\n\nWhile we connected to Kohli, he expressed his concern over the false claims.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that this misinformation is being spread like that.\n\n This is an old video and is available on YouTube for last three years,\u201d said Kohli.\n\nHe clarified to us that it was an overwhelming and beautiful experience to meet his teacher and the message he conveyed over the video is most important. Kohli had also tweeted about the false claims from his official twitter handle.\n\nConclusion: The viral post claiming Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet and Google pays tribute to his beloved Maths teacher Molly Abraham is fake. The video features Ganesh Kohli, the founder of IC3 and not Google CEO Sundar Pichai.", "lang": "en"}
