No, that's not true: While the chain has reduced hours and implemented drive-thru and carry-out only at its locations, CEO Dave Hoffmann has not said it was shuttering stores publicly. Nor has he issued a written statement saying this.\n\nThe fake announcement, which spells the CEO's name wrong and uses incorrect branding, was posted on Facebook (archived here) and other social media platforms on March 17, 2020. It read:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nThe post is signed by David Hoffman, but the CEO is David Hoffmann (with two n's) and he goes by Dave Hoffmann, CEO of Dunkin' brands.\n\nLike many fast-food restaurants across the United States, Dunkin' is taking steps to flatten the curve in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It has reduced hours and limited service to drive-thru and carry-out-only, according to the company's web site.", "lang": "en"}
