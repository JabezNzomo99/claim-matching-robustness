Thank you to everyone who sent us quotes for checking via Twitter using hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA, on Facebook or by email.\n\nCentral to the success of the current affairs television show Q&A are the questions submitted by audience members and viewers to be answered by the panellists of the week.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s live show, audience member Roger French said:\n\nThe original question French submitted to Q&A said Muslim couples in Australia have \u201con average 4.5 children per couple, whereas the rest of us have 1.5 children per couple on average\u201d. Q&A\u2019s producers did their own fact-checking on this question.\n\nWe want people to ask questions that reflect their own opinions and concerns but sometimes we go back to the questioners to ask them to shorten or simplify their question, or to check a factual assertion. When the producers spoke to the audience member shortly before the program, he wasn\u2019t able to provide a source for the statistics and so agreed to drop them. When he asked the question live Mr French didn\u2019t include the statistics but maintained the general assertion about birth rates among Muslim couples and other couples in Australia. Unfortunately, the Q&A social media team wasn\u2019t alerted to that late change, so the wording Mr French submitted in his original questions was used initially in Q&A\u2019s Facebook post.\n\nThis is understandable in the making of a fast-paced live TV show, and the Q&A Facebook post was corrected. But the original post had been shared on social media.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what the data show about birth rates for Muslim couples and other couples in Australia.\n\nDo Muslim couples in Australia have an average of 4.5 children per couple?\n\nThere is no evidence to support the claim that Muslim couples in Australia have an average of 4.5 children per couple, or that non-Muslim couples in Australia have an average of 1.5 children per couple.\n\nCensus 2016 data show that women of Islamic faith in Australia have an average of 3.03 births per woman, while the average for all women in Australia is 2.02 births per woman.\n\nIt is correct to say that Muslim women in Australia currently have a higher birth rate than other women in Australia. It\u2019s not reasonable to say, based on current figures, that Muslims in Australia will outnumber non-Muslims in \u201ca couple\u201d, or even many more, generations.\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about how many children a couple have \u201con average\u201d, we\u2019re talking about birth rates. Birth rates are calculated by looking at how many children are born, and how many women there are, in a particular population. Birth rates in Australia relate to women, not couples.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes a number of births indicators, but these data are not reported by religion. Australian Census data give us an opportunity to examine birth rates by religion, with the caveat that reporting your religious affiliation in the Census is optional. In 2016, 96% of people provided a response to the question about religion.\n\nWe can estimate birth rates from Census data using information about the number of children ever born, which is asked of women aged 15 and over. By looking specifically at the number of children women have given birth to by the age of 45-49, we can see what is called the \u2018completed fertility\u2019 rate. Relatively few births in Australia occur to women 45 years or over.\n\nPrior to the 2016 Census, information collected about the number of children a woman had given birth to did not include stillborn babies; only live births. In Census 2016, the instruction to include live births only was removed. Despite this change, the data appear to follow a similar trend as previous data.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what the data show about the number of children born to women who were aged 45-49 at the time of the 2016 Census.\n\nAnalysis of \u201cchildren ever born\u201d information shows an average of 2.02 births for all women aged 45-49 in Australia. Women in Australia of Islamic faith aged 45-49 had, on average, 3.03 births per woman. Women of Jewish faith of the same age had on average 2.17 births per woman, while women of any Christian faith of the same age had on average 2.11 births per woman.\n\nInternationally and in Australia, a commonly used measure for birth rates is the total fertility rate. Total fertility rates are calculated using information about the number of births registered by women of different age groups in a particular period (for example, in 2015). Birth registrations are used to estimate the number of children a woman would have on average over her lifetime if those age-specific trends persisted.\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data show that the total fertility rate for Australia in 2015 was 1.81 babies per woman. That\u2019s below the population replacement level, which requires around 2.1 babies per woman to replace herself and her partner.\n\nWomen in Australia who were 45-49 years old at the time of the Census and of Islamic, Christian and Jewish faiths are among the only groups examined which have at or above replacement level birth rates.\n\nThe difference between the Census figure (2.02 births per woman) and the ABS figure (1.81 births per woman) is that the Census figure relates to 'completed fertility\u2019 of women now aged 45-49, while the ABS figures look at fertility rates based on current trends.\n\nPossible growth of the Australian Muslim population\n\nIs it possible that, due to relatively higher birth rates, \u201cin a couple of generations Australia could have a Muslim majority\u201d? We can address this question by looking at the proportion of the Australian population reporting Islamic faith.\n\nIn Census 2016, fewer than 3% of all Australians reported being of Islamic faith. By comparison, more than 50% of Australians reported being one form of Christian faith. 30% of Australians said they had no religion.\n\nBased on current birth rates (3.03 children per woman) and the size of the Muslim population (604,200 people, or 2.6% of total population) people of Islamic faith in Australia will not outnumber those of non-Islamic faith in \u201ca couple of generations\u201d \u2013 or even many more generations.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that children will not necessarily take on the religious beliefs of their parents, particularly in the long term.\n\nIn April 2017 the Pew Research Center published a study on global religious affiliation trends that received international media coverage. The report\u2019s authors projected that, worldwide, \u201cthe number of babies born to Muslims is expected to modestly exceed births to Christians\u201d by the year 2035.\n\nThe Pew Research Center data are based on assumptions about future demographic trends, and how many people will switch religions in the future. The report suggests that between 2015 and 2020, around 8.2 million people will leave Christian churches, while 420,000 people will join the Islamic faith.\n\nThe report does not include country level information, but it does estimate that by 2060, the percentage of Muslims living in the Asia-Pacific region (which includes Australia) is expected to decline from 61% to 50%.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the claim that Muslim couples in Australia have on average 4.5 births per couple, or that non-Muslim couples in Australia have on average 1.5 births per couple.\n\nBased on Census 2016 data, Australian women of Islamic faith have, on average, 3.03 births per woman, while the average for all women in Australia is 2.02 births per woman.\n\nThere is also no evidence to suggest that the number of people in Australia of Islamic faith will outnumber those of non-Islamic faith in \u201ca couple\u201d, or even many more, generations. People in Australia reporting Islamic religious affiliation are a minority, despite relatively higher birth rates. \u2013 Liz Allen\n\nThis is a sound FactCheck. The average numbers of children ever born for women aged 45-49 for the various categories of religion presented by the author are correct.\n\nIn view of the lack of published data on the fertility of religious groups based on birth registrations, the Census is the appropriate data source to use.\n\nI agree with the author\u2019s conclusion (and Q&A panellist Mehdi Hasan\u2019s point) that, while the available evidence shows that, in Australia, Muslim women have a higher birth rate than non-Muslim women, it is extremely unlikely that Muslims will outnumber non-Muslims in Australia in one or two generations\u2019 time.\n\nI would further add that people of Islamic faith represent small minorities of the most recent inclusions in Australia\u2019s population, both by birth and migration.\n\nIn the 2016 Census, 4.32% of children aged 0-4 years who had been born in Australia were recorded as being of Islamic faith. This figure reflects recent birth patterns and the identification of young children\u2019s religion by parents.\n\nThe Census data also show that women of Islamic faith who were born in Australia have on average smaller numbers of children (2.67 per woman) than first generation migrant women aged 45-49 of Islamic faith.\n\nIn terms of migration, Census data show 10.53% of people who arrived in Australia between 2012 and the 2016 Census date were of Islamic faith.\n\nThe Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures Project projects that Muslims will form 4.9% of Australia\u2019s population in 2050. \u2013 Nick Parr\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit is the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
