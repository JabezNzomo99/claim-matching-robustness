[That\u2019s a] lie. Everything that comes from the gringo empire is a lie.\u201d\n\nThe one-page agreement Maduro referred to was signed on June 1 by the Venezuela\u2019s health minister, Dr. Carlos Alvarado, the National Assembly\u2019s health adviser, Julio Castro, and the Pan American Health Association's (PAHO) representative in Venezuela, Dr. Gerardo de Cosio.\n\nIt did not stipulate how much money would be involved. Rather, it committed both sides in the running stalemate over Venezuela\u2019s rightful leadership to work together to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe agreement aimed to create official channels for PAHO to help in fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela. It guaranteed \u201cthat the equation resources / access and donations / access can be met,\u201d and would \u201cnot be exploited, politicized or hindered by the regime,\u201d Miguel Pizarro, an opposition leader and one of the architects of the agreement, told Venezuelan newspaper Cr\u00f3nica.Uno.\n\nPAHO will be in charge of prioritizing locations to receive assistance aimed at increasing diagnostic capacity, protecting health workers, responding to confirmed cases, increasing epidemiological surveillance and improving risk communication with the population.\n\nIn the interview with Cronica.Uno, Pizarro said money for the response would come from the National Liberation Fund, which was approved by the National Assembly in February and launched in April with about $80 million from Venezuelan assets abroad frozen under U.S. sanctions.\n\nAt the end of March, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 announced the recovery of $20 million in frozen funds, which would be made available to international humanitarian organizations operating in Venezuela. In an email to Polygraph.info, a PAHO spokesperson said that while it had not received that $20 million, the organization \"is implementing other existing funds to move the agreement forward.\"\n\nOther countries that previously froze Venezuelan funds also have said they will transfer assets to PAHO. The Spanish government, for example, announced a transfer on June 4, although the amount wasn\u2019t disclosed.\n\nPAHO\u2019s communication team added that \u201c[t]he funds used for [the agreement] are existing PAHO funds that had been mobilized for pandemic response in Venezuela.\u201d It also said that \u201cthe implementation of actions in the country have been discussed and approved, and priority has been made to ensure the purchase of PPE (which is in process).\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday (July 22), Dr. Julio Castro, one of the signatories of the agreement, tweeted a spreadsheet showing where the PPE had already been delivered in the country. It included the states of Zulia, T\u00e1chira, Apure, Bolivar, Miranda and Distrito Capital (where part of Caracas, the capital, is located).\n\nThe appeal for a collaboration between both parties was first made on March 28, two weeks after Venezuela confirmed its first COVID-19 case. At the time, Guaid\u00f3 called for the formation of a \u201cnational emergency government\u201d and the implementation of a response plan.\n\nThe plan, called Plan Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas \u2013 after the former Venezuelan president, who was also a doctor \u2013 included importing essential medical equipment, constructing wells for hospitals and requesting $1.2 million from international financial organizations.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 and Maduro have fought for control of the country since a disputed presidential in 2018. In January 2019, Guaid\u00f3, as leader of the National Assembly, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president and quickly received support from the United States and some U.S. allies.\n\nMaduro, who opponents accuse of corruption, has remained in power with the support of Venezuela\u2019s military. Meantime, the country has spiraled into economic collapse and a humanitarian crisis, with the coronavirus only adding to the problem.\n\nMaduro insists the country and his government are being unfairly attacked. \u201cThank God we have medical professionals. Thank God we have guaranteed treatments for all who need,\u201d he said during his July 19 remarks.\n\nReuters reported that COVID-19 cases have multiplied in recent weeks, triggering \u201calarms from doctors and opponents who say that the government did not provide hospitals in time to combat the disease.\u201d\n\nIn June, Polygraph.info found that Maduro had glossed over the seriousness of the pandemic. PAHO reported in 2018 that a third of Venezuela\u2019s 66,000 doctors had fled the country by 2014 as the economy fell apart.\n\nMaduro said on July 19 that Venezuela had nearly 410 new infections in 24 hours, putting the total COVID-19 cases in the country at 11,890. But experts say the real numbers are much higher.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine tracking site, the country had 13,164 reported COVID-19 cases and 124 deaths as of July 23. Infections have been rising sharply since mid-May.\n\nIn a May study, the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences concluded that \"the tests carried out so far in Venezuela are insufficient to adequately estimate the true size of the COVID-19 epidemic in Venezuela.\"\n\nIt also concluded that \"underreporting is estimated to be 63% at best and at worst 95% of symptomatic cases as of April 23, 2020.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An initial version of this fact check mistakenly suggested PAHO already had access to the $20 million in unfrozen funds. PAHO later clarified that was not so. We regret the error.", "lang": "en"}
