Why was Trump\u2019s campaign INVESTIGATED?\"\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked variations of the claim, and this one is no more accurate.\n\nThe post, which has been shared hundreds of times by several conservative pages, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image itself \u2014 which displays text around a photo of Russia President Vladimir Putin holding Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as a puppet \u2014 appears to have been created on ImgFlip, a popular meme-making site, at least two months ago. It\u2019s a riff off a similar meme from 2016 that originally had Trump\u2019s head where Schiff\u2019s is.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 There\u2019s no evidence that Clinton Foundation received contributions from the Russian government. At best, investors with a business connection to Russia donated $4 million. (See the previous fact-check.)\n\u2022 There\u2019s no evidence that Trump has accepted political contributions from the Russian government. Russians have invested in his properties.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation donations involve nine people related to a 2007 deal between Clinton Foundation board member Frank Giustra\u2019s company and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. In 2009, Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency bought a 17% share of Uranium One. A year later, it bought enough shares to give it a 51% stake.\n\nBut the bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Foundation, about $131 million, came from Giustra \u2014 a businessman from Canada, not Russia.\n\nGiustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state.\n\nIf he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly \u2014 from $145 million to $4 million.\n\nNo Russian donations to Trump campaign\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, foreign nationals are not permitted to contribute to American elections. That includes foreign governments donating to campaigns. So Russians could not directly contribute to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller considered bringing charges against members of the Trump campaign for meeting with Russian nationals who said they had dirt on Clinton, but ultimately didn\u2019t. The reason is \"the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation.\" The Mueller report makes no mention of donations to the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump himself has benefited from Russian money through his global real estate business. A 2017 Reuters investigation found that Russian elites have invested tens of millions of dollars in Trump\u2019s buildings. Among the buyers were several politically connected businessmen, but none were from Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nA Facebook post claimed that the Clinton Foundation has received $145 million from Russia, while Trump has received nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s inaccurate to say that the Clinton Foundation $145 million \u2014 it may be closer to $4 million from Uranium One investors. It against election law for candidates to accept political contributions from foreign governments, and the Mueller report did not show that Trump\u2019s campaign broke it.\n\nThe statement is not accurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
