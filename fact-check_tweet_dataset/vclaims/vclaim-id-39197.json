Facebook user Imtiyaz Khan posted the video with the claim, \u201cChina Me ( 20 ) Lakh Se Zyada Log Islam Qubool Kiya Yeh Dekh Kar Ke > Corona Virus Ek Bhi Musalman Ko Effect Nahi Kiya Yeh Samajhne Ke Baad Wahan Logon Me ibrath Haasil Huwa = ALLAHU AKBAR\u201d. According to the claim, more than 20 lakh people have accepted Islam after they realised that no Muslim has been infected with novel coronavirus so far.\n\nSeveral other people on Facebook and Twitter shared the video with the same narrative.\n\nWe have received several requests on our official app to fact-check this video.\n\nAlt News found that the video is close to one year old and unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic. It was posted by a Facebook page on June 3, 2019. \u201cWelcome to our brothers in faith\u201d, said the caption posted along with the video. At 5 seconds in the video, the people can be heard reciting the Shahadah, a statement of faith that affirms, \u201cI witness that there is no god but God and Mohammed is his messenger\u201d. These people are reciting the verse in Arabic.\n\nMoreover, AFP found a Facebook post by one Ahmad Eradino who posted the pictures of the same event on June 11, 2019.\n\nThe Arabic text inscribed on the banner in the photos reads, \u201cIftar project in the industrial city of Jeddah (KSA)\u201d. Jeddah is a city located in Saudia Arabia. KSA stands for Kingdom of Saudia Arabia. Iftar is the scared sunset meal Muslims take to break the daily fast of Ramadan. We found several tweets with keywords Jeddah and Iftar on the same day in June 2019. This further corroborated that Iftar was celebrated in Jeddah, KSA on June 3, 2019.\n\nThus, a 2019 video of Iftar in Saudi Arabia was shared by social media users to claim that more than 20 lakh people converted to Islam after it was found that no Muslims are infected with the coronavirus. Moreover, we found no reports in the media of a mass religious conversion programme to Islam as claimed on social media.", "lang": "en"}
