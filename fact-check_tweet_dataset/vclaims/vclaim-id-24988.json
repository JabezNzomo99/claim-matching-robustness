Mueller, contrary to social media posts claiming otherwise.\n\nAs former special counsel Robert S. Mueller testified before the House Judiciary Committee the morning of July 24, Fox News was airing the testimony live \u2014 as the network said it would.\n\nYet some on social media were still sharing posts that claimed otherwise.\n\n\u201cFox News announced that it will NOT air Mueller\u2019s testimony before congress,\u201d one Facebook post said. \u201cYou know the testimony that will exonerate TRUMP.\u201d\n\nBut Fox News never announced that. Instead, in a July 22 press release, the cable network said it would \u201cpresent live coverage\u201d with co-anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, for both the judiciary committee hearing as well as Mueller\u2019s expected, subsequent testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nFox News did indeed air the morning committee hearing, which we observed, as Mueller answered lawmakers\u2019 questions regarding his completed investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe falsehood has circulated across social media platforms over several days.\n\nA viral post by the popular Facebook group Occupy Democrats that also made the erroneous claim was subsequently updated with a text apology and correction. The group said the meme \u201cwas based on a since-deleted tweet by MSNBC contributor Joy Vance,\u201d which was \u201clater repeated on MSNBC by contributor Rick Wilson and MSNBC anchor Nicole Wallace didn\u2019t correct the misinformation.\u201d\n\nThat claim was made by Vance on Twitter on July 21 and also stated by Wilson the next day on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House\u201d with Wallace.\n\nVance took to Twitter the same day as her original tweet to say she had deleted her earlier post: \u201cI\u2019ve deleted an earlier tweet I intended ironically, but that some took as factual regarding Fox news coverage of Mueller\u2019s testimony. My apologies to anyone I confused. I don\u2019t like to delete tweets but that seems a better course than unintentionally misinforming people.\u201d\n\nWilson also posted a correction on Twitter, which Wallace retweeted.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Robert Mueller knows it\u2026 This is also a moment where the premise of television in our political lives is going to come to the fore. And Donald Trump knows this\u2019 \u2013 @TheRickWilson w/ @NicolleDWallace.\u201d Twitter. 22 Jul 2019.\n\n\u201cFox News Channel to present live coverage of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s live testimony before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday July 24th.\u201d Press release, Fox News Channel. 22 Jul 2019.\n\nWilson, Rick (@TheRickWilson). \u201cI stand corrected: Fox apparently will cover the Mueller hearings. The MAGA Javerts were all aflutter.\u201d Twitter. 22 Jul 2019.\n\nVance, Joyce (@JoyceWhiteVance). \u201cI\u2019ve deleted an earlier tweet I intended ironically, but that some took as factual regarding Fox news coverage of Mueller\u2019s testimony.
