This is false; the drawing was created by Italian artist Yuri Pomo, as an homage to Floyd\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI love the Simpsons, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time the FBI and CIA investigate the creators of the cartoon, cause this it\u2019s just hitting the nail right in the head,\u201d read one of the Facebook posts that shared the image on May 31, 2020.\n\nA video containing the same image and claim was also published on YouTube, here. \u201cGeorge Floyd death was predicted by the Simpsons,\u201d the headline of the video viewed more than 50,000 times says.\n\nThe image can also be found on Twitter, here and in a blog post which claimed \u201cThe Simpsons predicted Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck in a 1990's episode. During the episode the police character \u2018Chief Wiggum\u2019 stands on a black character's neck as Lisa Simpson holds a sign saying \u2018Justice for George\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Simpsons writers are known for sometimes creating eerily predictive episodes that come to fruition -- for example, this episode from 1998 foreshadowed a deal between Walt Disney Co. and 21st Century Fox.\n\nHowever, this drawing is not an original from the series and was made after Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nAFP found the original by Italian artist Yuri Pomo who confirmed he was the creator.\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t related with any episode of The Simpsons, this is a piece I did due to what happened recently,\u201d Pomo told AFP on Instagram. \u201cI used the most famous cartoon in the world (...) to help raise awareness of the world\u2019s actual situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we face is real! Serious! And absolutely wrong,\u201d he added.\n\nPomo also published, here and here, other Simpsons-themed pieces as an homage to Floyd and two other African-American victims this year, Ahmaud Arbery, 25, and Breonna Taylor, 26. Three white men have been arrested in the killing of Arbery in Georgia, and authorities are investigating the police killing of Taylor during a Kentucky drug raid.\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old unarmed restaurant worker, died from suffocation while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, according to a private autopsy report. He had been accused of trying to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit bill and his aggressive arrest was caught on video.\n\nThe images showed a handcuffed Floyd gasping for breath as a white policeman pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The now-fired former officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder on May 29.\n\nPeaceful and violent protests have gripped the nation in the worst unrest since 1968.", "lang": "en"}
