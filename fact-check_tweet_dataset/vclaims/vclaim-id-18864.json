Twitter user Mirza Javed Ullah Khanposted the video with the narrative that these are soldiers of the Indian army meting out brutality on these \u2018martyred Kashmiri Muslims\u2019.\n\nAnother Twitter user shared the same video with a similar narrative.\n\nWith the help of digital verification tool Invid, Alt News broke the video into multiple frames, which were then used to perform a reverse search on Google. It was found that the video has been manipulated with unrelated audio superimposed over it. This video depicting extremely disturbing visuals is at least seven years old and has been shared in the context of the politics of West-Asia. There is no reference to India in the 2012 article that Alt News found. We found the screenshot of the frames from the viral video posted in a blog published on November 3, 2012. Moreover, the blog claimed that these soldiers were from Syria\u2019s secret police, the Shabiha.\n\nAlt News was unable to independently ascertain that these visuals depicted Syria\u2019s Shabiha. However, it is clear that the video couldn\u2019t be a recent one from Kashmir.\n\nIn conclusion, a seven-year-old video of a man, dressed in army fatigues, relentlessly stabbing a dead person is being falsely propagated on social media as footage of brutality meted out on Kashmiris by Indian army personnel.", "lang": "en"}
