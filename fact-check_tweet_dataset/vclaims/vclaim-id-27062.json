It also sets out how the NHS plans to use the \u00a320 billion in extra funding it will receive over the next five years\u2014which we\u2019ve written about here.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how exactly NHS England calculated the figure of half a million lives saved and we\u2019ve asked them a number of times, for more information. There are a lot of things we don\u2019t know for certain about it: for example it\u2019s unclear what time period these lives will be saved over\u2014while the time span of the plan is ten years, the lack of detail on the calculation means we don\u2019t know specifically. We also don\u2019t know whether there is any margin of error on the figure, or exactly how these lives will be \u201csaved\u201d (beyond a few general examples such as early cancer detection).\n\nWe think important policy announcements like this should be based on published, clearly explained figures so that everyone can see how they\u2019re calculated, and assess whether public bodies are achieving the goals they\u2019ve set out.\n\nWhat do we know about how these 500,000 will be saved?\n\nNot very much.\n\nIn its public announcement of the plan, NHS England did provide some additional detail on how it proposes to save these 500,000 lives. It said \u201cthe latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Simon Stevens specified that new treatments and testing services \u201cwill mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.\u201d That alone might seem to get us over the half a million mark, if you add it up over the ten years\u2014but as we\u2019ll explain, it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nMr Stevens added that: \u201cAround 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.\u201d\n\nThe plan itself also says that the NHS will look to halve maternity-related deaths by 2025.\n\nWhen we asked NHS England for more detail about how the calculation was done and what the component parts of it were, it told us that: \u201cThe calculations were made based on new and expanded services which the plan will bring into place\u2014mainly new cancer treatments with earlier diagnosis and interventions to catch more strokes, heart attacks, respiratory problems.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t make things much clearer, so we\u2019ve asked them again for more information. We are awaiting a response.\n\nWhat don\u2019t we know?\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s unclear what time period these 500,000 lives will be saved over\u2014as the NHS says itself in the plan, not all of the goals it sets are meant to be fulfilled within ten years, some are over a shorter time frame. The lack of detail also means we don\u2019t know if any of the goals will take longer to achieve.\n\nTo put the target in context, there were just under 500,000 deaths registered in England in 2017. The health think tank Nuffield Trust says that, based on official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), around 110,000 deaths in England a year are \u201cavoidable\u201d, either through better quality healthcare or healthier public behaviours.\n\nSecondly, NHS England makes no mention of how definitive this number is\u2014is it a best estimate with a wide margin of error around it, or is NHS England fairly certain it can save this many lives through the measures planned over the next ten years?\n\nThirdly, as we\u2019ve mentioned already, bar a few specific examples we\u2019ve no indication of how the Long Term Plan will save all of these lives and of the conditions and diseases it plans to tackle in order to do so.\n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s not apparent from the information published what NHS England actually means when it says it will \u2018save\u2019 these lives.\n\nHow you define a \u2018life saved\u2019 can affect the numbers\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but talking about \u2018saving a life\u2019 can mean very different things depending on how you define it.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust has also been looking into this and got a bit more detail from the NHS about its calculations. It says that \u201cNHS England focus on those that are alive, counting the number of times a life is saved, whereas ONS focus on those that have died and instead count how many of these deaths could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nFor example a person who is prevented from dying from two separate illnesses in the same year would count as one avoided death based on the ONS\u2019 definition. But for the NHS, this could count as two lives saved.\n\nThe method you choose can impact the overall number you end up with. NHS England says improvements in treatment and testing will save the lives of 55,000 cancer patients a year, but the ONS estimated that around 38,000 cancer deaths in England were avoidable in 2016.\n\nThis also raises the question of how much longer a patient might be expected to live after their life is counted as \u2018saved\u2019, and from what point in time you measure this. The Nuffield Trust says: \u201cNHS England also count people who survive for five years after diagnosis of cancer as being lives saved. But not all these people, sadly, will live much longer. Performance against this measure could improve purely through earlier diagnosis without actually prolonging lives although, of course, earlier diagnosis can contribute to better outcomes.\u201d\n\nWe think it\u2019s inappropriate and unhelpful for organisations like NHS England to use figures that aren\u2019t in the public domain. Figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from, how they\u2019re calculated, and whether public bodies are meeting the goals they\u2019ve set out. Public bodies shouldn\u2019t be asking anyone to take their word for it on something so important.", "lang": "en"}
