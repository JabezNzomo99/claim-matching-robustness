The video shows mosque members distributing bags of ration during the ongoing lockdown. Minutes into the video, the distributors announce that Hindus who are not enlisted need not come to collect the relief material.\n\nBOOM found that the video is from Bangladesh's Sylhet where a local political leader was called out for religious discrimination while distributing relief aid. Bangladesh has been on a complete shutdown from March 26. The same has been extended till April 25 after a spike in positive cases of COVID-19.\n\nAt the six second time stamp one of the members can be heard saying in local Bangladeshi dialect, \"Hindus will not come, whose names were not on a list.\"\n\nThe viral video has since been shared on Facebook with a caption in Hindi which reads, \"Food was being distributed from a mosque, some needy Hindus reached there but they were banished by saying that there is no system in place for Hindus.\" (Original text in Hindi: \u090f\u0915 \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0938\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0901\u091f\u0940 \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0925\u0940, \u0915\u0941\u091b \u091c\u0930\u0942\u0930\u0924\u092e\u0902\u0926 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941 \u0935\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0901\u091a \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u092a\u0930 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u094b \u092f\u0939 \u0915\u0939\u0915\u0930 \u092d\u0917\u093e \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948)\n\nA text in Bengali has been overlaid on the left side of the video, which states that Hindus were refused the relief because of their religious identity. The text reads, \"The helpless Hindus did not receive the relief distribution because of being Hindus. Bangladesh is my motherland. (We) did not get in Pakistan also and not even in Bangladesh.

The caption in Bengali reads, \"No relief will be distributed to Hindus, Hindus go home. Sylhet.\"\n\nWe found a news report which was published on Sylhet Mirror on April 4, 2020. According to the report, the video is from Osmaninagar, Sylhet, where Hindus were refused relief fund allocated for the area.\n\nThe incident happened on April 3, 2020 after the Friday prayers. The relief distribution was led by Kamrul Islam, the person identified as reading out names which were on a list. Islam is a Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader and director of Pally Vidyut Samiti, in Sylhet area.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the video is part of a Facebook Live, which later was viral.\n\nThe report stated that the relief distribution was conducted without informing the administration, as there was no permission of mass gathering at the mosque. The Sub District Nirbahi Officer, Mosammat Tahamina Akhtar termed the incident discriminatory and directed Rashid Mobarak, officer in-charge Of Osmaninagar police station to investigate the case.\n\nOn April 5 Islam released a press statement with regrets stating that relief for Hindus will be distributed in their home or other suitable area, maintaining law and order. He appealed not to create disharmony, reported Sylhet Voice. A list of Hindu names were also published in the article.\n\nAlso Read: 2011 Video Of Domestic Help Contaminating Water Peddled With Communal Claim", "lang": "en"}
