The posts claim that Thai police obtained vital DNA evidence from the gunman\u2019s sweat because of the guard\u2019s actions. The claim is misleading; the man in the photo has been identified as the security guard killed in the robbery, but police said they were not been able to extract the gunman\u2019s DNA from sweat.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on January 22, 2020. It has since been shared more than 6,400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English in part as:\n\n\u201cPraise the bravery of Mr. Theerachatr Nimma, the security guard of a department store who sacrificed himself by shutting the automatic doors, which resulted in him being shot dead by the robber. But his bravery was not for nothing as the police were able to obtain the suspect's sweat which turned out to be DNA evidence for the police to confirm the suspect's identity. #thisisThailand\u201d.\n\nThe post is referring to an armed robbery and triple homicide that occurred at a gold store in Lopburi, Thailand on January 9, 2020.

We don't have the suspect's sweat as evidence,\" said Police Lt Gen Suwat Jangyodsuk, Chief of Provincial Police Region 1, at a press conference at the Royal Thai Police headquarters in Bangkok on January 23, 2020.\n\nLocal media also reported here and here that police identified the suspect thanks to tips from local residents and by verifying the gun and silencer used in the attack.\n\nThe photo used in the misleading post does show the late security guard.\n\nAFP confirmed that the black and white image was made by one of the victim's friends, who originally posted the photo on Facebook here in a condolence post. The friend told AFP via Facebook on January 29, 2020 that he took the photo from the victim's Facebook account here.\n\nPPTV, Thailand\u2019s digital TV channel, also published a photo of the security guard here on January 13, 2020.
