As per the claim, the video is from a supermarket in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe text associated with the viral video reads, \u201cCrows not allowing customers to come out of super market in Saudi .. is it the beginning of the end of the world ??\u201d Alt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nBelow is a tweet by Roop Darak HINDU (@iRupND) who posted the viral video along with the same claim.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that the viral video was uploaded by a verified YouTube account ViralHog on April 18.\n\nAs per the video description, this event occurred outside H-mart on December 6, 2016, in Carrollton, Texas, USA.\n\nIn order to verify the location, we searched for Carrollton H-Mart on Google street view and found several similarities which have been marked in the screenshot below. Most importantly, the mall in the viral video has the same serial number as the store on Google street view (highlighted in red).\n\nEarlier this year in February, 6abc and The Daily Mail reported a similar incident took place in Fort Worth suburb Burleson in Texas on January 24. This particular behaviour of birds flying together in a large group is known as a murmuration. The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as, \u201ca large group of birds, usually starlings, that all fly together and change direction together, or the act of birds doing this\u201d.\n\nThus the social media claim that the video was shot outside a supermarket in Saudi Arabia is false. The incident happened in Texas, USA.", "lang": "en"}
