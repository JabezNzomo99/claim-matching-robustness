The full C-SPAN video shows that Pence delivered full boxes and did not touch or pretend to deliver the empty ones.\n\nPence helped deliver boxes of PPE from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the Woodbine Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Alexandria, Virginia, on May 7. The delivery was part of a larger FEMA shipment to nursing homes across the country that included 63 million gloves, 13 million medical gowns and 14 million face masks, according to The Hill.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, the host of the \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d late-night talk show, suggested in his May 7 monologue that Pence was caught on a hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE to that facility. He also shared the clip on Twitter but has since deleted it.\n\nIn the video, Pence drops boxes at the door of the nursing home and returns to a van, where an unidentified person tells the vice president that the rest of the boxes in the van are empty. Pence can be heard responding, \u201cCan I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he\u2019s doing: a big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing,\u201d Kimmel says at the end of the clip.

Vice President of Whitman Insight Strategies Matt McDermott and other users also shared the clip on Twitter. The claim that Pence was caught on a hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE does not hold up, however.\n\nHere\u2019s the full C-SPAN video of the delivery:\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed the entire 29-minute video and found that the viral clip has been edited to remove key context surrounding the delivery. The C-SPAN video shows Pence helping unload boxes of PPE from the van and carrying them to the health care center for several minutes. Pence\u2019s quip about the \u201cempty ones\u201d comes around the 9-minute mark and is greeted with laughter. He then closes the doors to the van and does not pretend to lift or deliver any of the empty boxes to the nursing home, the full video shows.\n\nJon Thompson, Pence\u2019s campaign communications manager, said on Twitter that Pence is \u201cclearly joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is absolute garbage spread by @JimmyKimmel,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPence is clearly joking about empty boxes & if Kimmel showed the full clip from CSPAN, not the one he selectively edited, you see and hear it.\u201d\n\nKimmel later tweeted an apology of sorts.\n\n\u201cIt would appear that @vp was joking about carrying empty boxes for a staged publicity stunt. The full video reveals that he was carrying full boxes for a staged publicity stunt,\u201d he tweeted. \u201d My apologies. I know how dearly this administration values truth.\u201d\n\nA Twitter spokesperson confirmed to the Caller on Friday that McDermott\u2019s tweet of Kimmel\u2019s video had been labeled \u201cmanipulated media\u201d based on the platform\u2019s Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy.
