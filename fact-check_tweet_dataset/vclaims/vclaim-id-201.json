The 99-year-old covered the 25-metre circuit with the help of a wheeled walking frame, completing the challenge just two weeks shy of his 100th birthday on April 30.\n\nThe money is being raised through Just Giving for NHS Charities Together, an organisation that represents 140 member charities that support the work of the health service, according to Moore\u2019s Just Giving page.\n\nJust Giving told Reuters that 97% of the donation will go directly to NHS Charities Together. Of the remaining 3%, around 2% will cover payment processing fees, and approximately 1% will go back into the company.\n\nThe platform charges a processing fee of 1.9% + 20p per donation, or 2.9% + 20p if the donation is not in pounds sterling. Just Giving said the fees cover \u201ccard payment charges, which are set by external card providers, and the costs of processing millions of donations\u201d and are \u201cin line with industry standards\u201d(here).\n\nThe roughly 1% of donations kept by Just Giving amounts to around \u00a3290,000 as of April 27 and would rise to \u00a3300,000 if donations reached \u00a330 million, and so forth.\n\nThe platform told Reuters it had donated \u00a3100,000 to Captain Tom\u2019s campaign in celebration of him reaching the \u00a310 million milestone.\n\nFalse. Just Giving is not making \u00a32 million from Captain Tom\u2019s fundraising campaign for the National Health Service.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
