Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: The video is an old one. It was taken before the recent Coronavirus outbreak. Also, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has clarified that there is no evidence to show that eating mutton can transmit Coronavirus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 12 December 2019. But the recent Coronavirus epidemic was reported to have begun in the last week of December 2019. So, the video is not related to the recent \u2018SARS-CoV-2\u2019 Coronavirus. \n\n\n\nWhen a similar video went viral in UAE, their government has clarified that \u2018the footage is old\u2019.\n\n\n\nAlso, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shandilya Giriraj Singh has tweeted that the consumption of chicken, mutton, fish, and eggs doesn\u2019t cause the transmission of Coronavirus.\n\n\n\nPreviously, when the message that chicken consumption causes coronavirus went viral, FACTLY debunked it as Fake news and the article can be read here.\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018goats affected by Coronavirus\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
