After a large brunch of eggs, bacon, ham, pheasant, roast beef, elk, and a variety of sausage, Trump had a case of diarrhea while playing the 5th hole of his back nine. A golden color cart drove up and escorted Trump back to the side entrance of Mar-a-lago. \u201cIt was pretty funny,\u201d said another.\n\nThe same photograph was used to illustrate a 30 December 2017 article published by the Empire News junk news site, headlined \u201cA Crying Donald Trump Was Escorted Off Mar-A-Lago Golf Course After Accidentally Pooping His Pants\u201d:\n\nPresident Trump has spent most of his winter vacation golfing with friends and family at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, but on his latest outing, the President was caught with his pants up\u2026when perhaps they should have been down. According to photographers at the golf game, President Trump was on the 13th hole and right after teeing off, he let out \u201ca massive, wet, drippy fart sound.\u201d \u201cIt was simultaneously hilarious and disgusting,\u201d said Chris Robbins, the photographer who captured the immediate aftermath. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting any really good shots throughout the day, but then I heard Trump rip one, really hard and really wet. I look over, and he has literally shit himself. It was made even more hilarious because, like most dipshit golfers, he was wearing stupid clothes \u2013 white pants!\u201d\n\nBoth this story and the image are fake. The original photograph was taken by Reuters photographer David Moir on 10 July 2012, during the opening of the Trump International Golf Links golf course. Here\u2019s a look at the original image, as well as a cropped closeup showing Trump\u2019s stain-free backside:\n\nA similar image purportedly showing an incontinent Hillary Clinton was circulated during the 2016 presidential campaign. That photograph was also a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
