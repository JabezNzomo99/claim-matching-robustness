That report can be accessed here.\n\nBack then, we had found out that in September 2016, the Indian Army on its official Twitter page posted a clarification that said it would create a new bank account called the Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties (AWFBC).\n\nDonations received will be used to support the next of kin/widows/dependents of soldiers who have been killed in battle. This was done in the aftermath of a deadly avalanche in Siachen in 2016 that claimed the lives of many soldiers and the subsequent outpouring of support from citizens who wished to contribute.\n\nIS THE ACCOUNT STILL OPERATIONAL?\n\nBOOM received several messages from readers on our WhatsApp helpline (7700906111) asking if the Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties account is still operational.\n\nBOOM called Colonel Aman Anand, PRO (Army), to know the truth.\n\nColonel Anand told us that this is a voluntary arrangement. \"People who want, they can contribute. There is an account like that but it hasn't been forwarded officially asking people to donate. It's voluntary,\" he added.\n\nWhen we asked him if the account was still operational, he replied in the affirmative.\n\nThe Colonel also said actor Akshay Kumar's initiative Bharat Ke Veer is also raising funds for the kin of the CRPF martyrs.\n\nKumar had, in January 2017, posted a video on Twitter pitching an idea for a website or a mobile app that could accept voluntarily contributions for the families of martyred soldiers. The Bharat Ke Veer website was subsequently created with the help of Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nThe website has been updated with the names of CRPF personnel who had lost their lives in the February 14 terror attack.", "lang": "en"}
