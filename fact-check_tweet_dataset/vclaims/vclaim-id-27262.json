The unemployment rate in July was 4.3 percent. It was 4.8 percent in January, when Trump took office, so it was already rather low.\n\nMoreover, six of the past 12 presidents could brag of an unemployment rate lower than 4.3 percent. It was as low as 4.2 percent under George W. Bush, 3.9 percent under Bill Clinton, 4.2 percent under Richard Nixon, 3.4 percent under Lyndon B. Johnson, 2.5 percent under Dwight D. Eisenhower and 2.7 percent under Harry Truman.\n\nThe current rate is the lowest in 16 years \u2014 at the start of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency \u2014 and sometimes Trump gets that right, sometimes he gets it wrong. \u201cThe unemployment rate is at a 16-year-low,\u201d he said on Aug. 11. That same day, he also said: \u201cThe unemployment rate just came out. It\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been in 18 years.\u201d\n\nWhen the unemployment rate hit 2.5 percent in 1953, about six months into his presidency, Eisenhower\u2019s approval rating was about 70 percent in the Gallup poll. Ronald Reagan\u2019s approval rating went up above 60 percent as the unemployment rate fell to the low of his presidency, 5.3 percent. Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating exceeded 65 percent as the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent.\n\nThe closest analogy to Trump\u2019s situation is Johnson\u2019s. The unemployment rate was below 4 percent for much of LBJ\u2019s presidency and even fell to 3.4 percent, but his approval rating kept sinking, reaching a low of 35 percent. LBJ, of course, found himself mired in the Vietnam War and mass protests \u2014 and his low came in the final year of a five-year presidency. Trump is faring as poorly in his first year.\n\nWhere could Trump get the notion that unemployment is lower than it has ever been? At a news conference on Aug. 15, commenting on the Charlottesville confrontation, he remarked: \u201cWe have the highest employment numbers we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country.\u201d This is an especially silly statistic, since it mostly reflects the fact that the U.S. population keeps growing; even recessions just put a brief dent in growth of employment. But maybe that explains why he claimed a record. (The White House declined to comment.)\n\nAt The Fact Checker, we have a somewhat jaundiced view of a president\u2019s impact on the employment rate, especially so early in a term. The unemployment rate reflects long-term economic trends, some of which can be affected by federal policy, but the impact normally takes years to be felt.\n\nOne reason the unemployment rate may not resonate now is that Trump spent his presidential campaign attacking it as phony. He repeatedly offered a Four-Pinocchio claim that tens of millions of people were not being counted in the statistics, even though the vast majority have not been interested in working because they are retired, disabled or in school. He now embraces a statistic he previously rejected as a falsehood.\n\nGiven that Trump on some occasions has correctly identified the unemployment rate as at a 16-year-low, we are inclined not to rate this claim and perhaps chalk it up to over-exuberant campaign spiel. (We try not to play gotcha at The Fact Checker.) That\u2019s of course no excuse for a president, who always should strive for accuracy. Indeed, we can\u2019t simply dismiss this as a one-time flub, given that it was recorded and sent to thousands of phone numbers in Alabama. In any case, exaggerating about the unemployment rate is not going to enhance the president\u2019s approval rating.", "lang": "en"}
