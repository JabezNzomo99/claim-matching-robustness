More so, if there was any semblance of truth to the claim, it would have been reported by the same platforms that reported President Buhari congratulating the Prime Minister on his victory in the parliamentary election!\n\nYet another instance of uncorroborated news from an unreliable source. Similar to the case of Vladmir Putin as fact-checked by Dubawa, who was alleged to have said \u2018\u2018Africa is just a cemetery for Africans. How could a cemetery be developed?\u201d; this post has been discovered.\n\nThe post by \u2018\u2018Reporters Press Nigeria\u2019\u2019 titled IPOB: \u201clet them go and build their empire\u201d Isreal Prime Minister tell Nigeria Govt was published on June 9, 2019. In the report, it is alleged that the Israel Prime Minister urged the Nigerian government to grant freedom to the people of Biafra. This post has no verifiable source and has no verification whatsoever by a notable media platform.\n\nSome other platforms like Jamyco have the same content as regarding Benjamin Netanyahu, and a similar one referencing the Sudanese President.\n\nIt is true that IPOB often protests in Nigeria as seen in these videos. However, what is not true is the statement attributed to Netanyahu. His claim can therefore be as a result of IPOB leader\u2019s rapport with Israel.\n\nBuilding on that, in a report by the Punch, Nnamdi Kanu is remarked to have beckoned the nation of Israel for support. He asserts it is the responsibility of Israel to ensure Biafra\u2019s independence. These occurrences are perhaps the basis for the origin of the claim.\n\nTurns out, the circumstances were misconstrued. It was actually the indigenous people of Biafra in Israel who beckoned on the nation\u2019s Prime minister. Jerusalem Post reports how Nigerians took to the streets of Tel Aviv in a bid to garner endorsement from the state with respect to their claim for independence in the United Nations.\n\nAlso, this claim is similar to a fact-check done by African check, with a caption \u2018\u2018Israeli prime minister didn\u2019t say Biafra would \u2018overtake Nigeria as Africa\u2019s giant\u2019.\n\nMore so, there still is no official report or statement from the Israel Prime Minister to authenticate this story. If at all Benjamin Netanyahu actually made such a comment, it would have made headlines. That did not happen! \n\nFurthermore, the grammatical errors and mediocre plot style call its veracity into account.\n\nA simple case of misconstrued context and uncorroborated news similar to the post on Vladmir Putin. More so, if there was any semblance of truth to the claim, it would have been reported by the same platforms that recorded President Buhari congratulating the Prime Minister on his victory in the parliamentary election.", "lang": "en"}
