Here\u2019s a fact-check. In a rambling two-hour speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, President Trump repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the investigation into Russian collusion during his presidential campaign. We\u2019re waiting for a report by people that weren\u2019t elected. We had \u2014 think of this. We had the greatest election, in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson. This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I\u2019m not saying it, right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan. When I first started, \u201cThis is Ronald Reagan!\u201d Then we started really doing well. And they were coming from everywhere to vote, those red hats and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d That\u2019s what it said, right? Right? [Applause] But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost and, unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn\u2019t be there. And all of a sudden, they\u2019re trying to take you out with [expletive], O.K.? With [expletive]. Now Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the attorney general says, [Southern accent] \u201cI\u2019m going to recuse myself.\u201d And I said, why the hell didn\u2019t he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself? But they fight so hard on this witch hunt. This phony deal that they put together. This phony thing that now looks like it\u2019s dying. So they don\u2019t have anything with Russia. There\u2019s no collusion. So now they go and morph into: \u201cLet\u2019s inspect every deal he\u2019s ever done. We\u2019re going to go into his finances. We\u2019re going to check his deals. We\u2019re gonna check...\u201d These people are sick. They\u2019re sick. I saw a little shifty Schiff yesterday. It\u2019s the first time he went into a meeting and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to look into his finances.\u201d I said, where did that come from? He always talked about Russia! Collusion with Russia. The collusion delusion. In a rambling two-hour speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, President Trump repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the investigation into Russian collusion during his presidential campaign.
