Overall life expectancy in the UK is not falling, but it is stalling.\n\nLife expectancy in the UK has been rising for well over a century, and in recent years that growth has slowed down considerably and has almost stopped.\n\nIf you dig beneath those national figures, you can find cases of falling life expectancy in certain local authorities, including in Hartlepool\u2014which the New York Times drew attention to in its piece.\n\nThe New York Times changed its headline after we contacted them and it now correctly reads that life expectancy has stalled.\n\nOverall life expectancy in the UK has stayed roughly the same for several years\n\nThere are two ways of measuring life expectancy: called \u201ccohort\u201d and \u201cperiod\u201d.\n\nCohort life expectancy tries to project how long you will live by observing current mortality rates and projecting how those rates will improve over time. It\u2019s regarded as the most realistic number for how long you\u2019re actually expected to live.\n\nCurrent cohort projections suggest a man born in the UK today has a life expectancy of nearly 90 years, while a woman\u2019s life expectancy would be over 94 years.\n\nYou can find out your own life expectancy in this way using this Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculator.\n\nA less tangible but still useful figure is period life expectancy. This just looks at the year you\u2019re born in and assumes that year\u2019s mortality rates apply throughout your life. So it\u2019s a lower number because it\u2019s not taking into account the likelihood that your life expectancy will go up as you get older, because in general we\u2019re getting healthier, medicine is getting more sophisticated, and we\u2019re living longer as a population.\n\nBut it has the advantage of being a more certain figure (it doesn\u2019t have to guess what the future holds) and it tells us a bit more about what\u2019s happening to people\u2019s health and wellbeing right now. These are the figures featured by the New York Times.\n\nOn this measure, according to the ONS: \u201cLife expectancy at birth in the UK did not improve in 2015 to 2017 and remained at 79.2 years for males and 82.9 years for females.\u201d\n\nIf you look at the trend over time in those figures, both male and female life expectancies rose slowly until about 2014, and they haven\u2019t discernibly changed since.\n\nAreas like Hartlepool have seen falling life expectancy\n\nIn this section we\u2019ll use \u201cperiod\u201d life expectancy figures, as these are better for showing us what\u2019s happening to the UK today.\n\nDifferent parts of the UK have seen different trends which don\u2019t follow the national picture. For example, life expectancy at birth fell slightly for both sexes in the most recent figures for Scotland and Wales, and for men in Northern Ireland.\n\nAs the New York Times focuses on, Hartlepool has also seen falls.\n\nHartlepool has seen the steepest fall in male life expectancy of any local authority in the UK over roughly the last three years. It was 77.6 years around 2012-2014 and was 76.1 years in 2015-2017. For women the drop is much less pronounced: it was 81.6 in 2012-2014 and 81.4 in 2015-2017.\n\nEven those figures are for Hartlepool overall, and there\u2019s further evidence that neighbourhoods within the town differ a great deal. According to data from Public Health England, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas of the town is 11.7 years for men and 10.2 years for women.\n\nIn one sense these falls don\u2019t sound very big\u2014but any fall in life expectancy is fairly unprecedented in the wider context of UK trends for over a century, and the stalls or falls in recent years have prompted debate over what\u2019s causing them.", "lang": "en"}
