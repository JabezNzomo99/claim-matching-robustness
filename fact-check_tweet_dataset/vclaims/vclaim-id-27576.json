The clip drew 41,000 views.\n\nAnother video of the same incident was shared by Panwar.\n\nAlt News contacted Baddi police, Solan district. After looking at the video, the police informed us that a mentally unstable man was caught and beaten by locals in Salhewal over false rumours of child-kidnapping. \u201cThis man had come from Chandigarh and had lost his way. Locals apprehended him as they found him suspicious and also beat him up. Later, when the police intervened, his wife and mother came and we found that the man was mentally unstable. He came to Himachal after getting into a fight at home. The incident took place in Salhewal and has nothing to do this child-kidnapping. It\u2019s a false rumour,\u201d said the police. Child-kidnapping rumours are rampant in the country, with mobs taking the lives of innocents in several cases. Mentally-challenged individuals have become the most common victims of mob violence sparked by such false rumours.", "lang": "en"}
