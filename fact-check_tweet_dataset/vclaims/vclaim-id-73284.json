The claim is false; all four photos have circulated in reports about Black Lives Matter protests across Germany in June 2020.\n\nThe collage was published here on August 2, 2020. It has been shared more than 600 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cI was sent this from many friends today. People in Berlin protested against Germany\u2019s coronavirus restrictions on Saturday, insisting \u2018the end of the pandemic\u2019 has arrived.\n\n\u201cProtesters held up signs with slogans like \u2018Corona, false alarm,\u2019 \u2018We are being forced to wear a muzzle,\u2019 \u2018Natural defense instead of vaccination\u2019 and \u2018We are the second wave.\u2019 @COVID19Up. Remember the people have the power.\u201d\n\nSome 20,000 people gathered in Berlin on August 1, 2020 to protest against coronavirus restrictions implemented by the government.

You won\u2019t get this under control permanently with weak corona rules and without support from the federal government and states!\u201d\n\nA subsequent keyword search found this June 6 report by German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost about a gathering of 15,000 people in Alexanderplatz plaza in Berlin, Germany for an anti-racism protest on the same day.\n\nHeadlined \"15,000 people on Alex; 93 arrested, 28 injured\u201d; the article reads, in part: \u201c15,000 people came to demonstrate against racism after George Floyd's death.
