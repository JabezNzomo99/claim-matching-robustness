No, that's not true, while NASA tracks many asteroids, this one poses no threat to our planet, and no warning has been issued. Lead Stories reached out to NASA, which confirmed that there is simply no danger - at all - of this asteroid impacting Earth, much like other asteroids and other space objects currently tracked by the space agency.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Daily Express on March 2, 2020, titled \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM killer rock on approach - Could end human civilisation\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe Daily Express shared the article on their Facebook page here on March 2, 2020, with a caption that only read, \"Terrifying.\" In just four days, between four tweets of the story spread across several days, the post had gathered 53,000 shares on Facebook. The @Daily_Express twitter account had accumulated about 137,000 reactions, including 32,317 retweets.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLead Stories reached out to Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director at NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CENOS), for comment. He replied:\n\nYes, these articles are problematic: They are completely misleading because they imply there is a chance that these asteroids can impact the Earth. They misrepresent the results from CNEOS. CNEOS tracks all the near-Earth asteroids, and we publish predictions of close approaches to Earth here: https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ The article correctly points out that 1998 OR2 will approach Earth to 16.36 Lunar Distances (LD), or about 6.3 million km, on April 29. They get that number from our table, and we get that number from our calculations of the asteroid orbit. We have been tracking this asteroid for decades, and we have lots of data! But, there is no chance at all that this asteroid or any other on the table can impact!\n\n\n\nThis should be clear from the column \"labeled CA Distance Minimum\" which clearly states that the minimum possible close approach distance is the same: 16.36 LD: we know that it can't get any closer, even including all the uncertainties in the calculations! We don't \"Issue a Warning\" because there is no hazard whatsoever: Again, there is ZERO chance of an impact.\n\nThrough the Planetary Defense Coordination Office, NASA has a clear protocol for when an actual warning is warranted and how that is to be carried out.\n\n\n\n Daily Express regularly publishes warnings about asteroids. The articles are filled with factual details pulled from NASA's publicly available tables - and then lots of conjecture is added to produce alarming headlines. Another recent article (archived here), titled, 'Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 'potentially hazardous' rock rapidly approaching Earth,' opened by saying:\n\nWhat did Chodas have to say about that?\n\nReferring to the article about Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2), Chodas said:\n\n\n\nThis article is mostly false, because its main point is to suggest there's a danger when there is absolutely no danger.\n\n We have another webpage where we list all asteroids that DO have a chance of impacting Earth: https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/ In other words, if an asteroid has a chance of impacting, it will be on this page, not the other. Encounters on the Sentry page all have very small probabilities, most of those encounters are decades away, and 90% of the asteroids are so small that they would burn up in the atmosphere. Furthermore, as we track those objects, we expect that our prediction accuracy will improve to the point that we rule out most if not all of the potential impacts on this list.\n\nThe Center for Near Earth Object Studies sent out a tweet regarding this article.\n\n\n\nThe article contains several sci-fi art images. The featured digital illustration by Andrea Danti titled, \"Big asteroid crashing on the surface of an Earth-like planet\", depicts an imaginary fiery impact. This image is widely available as a stock image. It seems clear that the artist had no intention to accurately illustrate - or misrepresent - this specific scenario. By using the picture, the image's impact becomes at least as strong as the misleading headline.\n\n\n\nDoes the illustration happen to show a space rock the 4.1 km size of the 52768 (1998 OR2) asteroid?\n\nThe Earth's curvature in the illustration was scaled and matched to an image of Earth sourced from NASA. We can now compare the size of the imaginary space rock to Earth's diameter.\n\n\n\n The illustrated space rock is estimated to be about 1,500 km across (or 932 miles). Using Photoshop, we scaled the rock in the illustration to be 3,000 pixels wide. Then, we could measure, pixel by pixel, to depict the approximate size of the real asteroid in relation to the one in the illustration. There are two tiny dots included inside the dark square, and they represent the smaller and larger limits of the estimated size (1.5- 4.1 km) of the 52768 (1998 OR2) asteroid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen April 29, 2020, rolls around, the asteroid will pass our planet at a distance of about 6.3 million km (3.9 million miles). Astronomers give the distance that the 52768 (1998 OR2) asteroid will pass as 16.36 LD or 0.04205 au. Lunar Distance (LD) represents the average distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the moon, and that's 384,400 km (or 238,855 miles). An astronomical unit (au) is the average distance from Earth to the Sun, that's 150 million km (or 93 million miles). That means on April 29, 2020, the asteroid will be more than 16 times further from Earth than the Moon.\n\nIf we scaled this down to a model on a map of the United States, put the Earth at New York City and the Moon at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania- 16.36 times that distance would take us across the country to Los Angeles.\n\nHere is a sampling of asteroid headlines collected from Daily Express:\n\n\n\nNASA asteroid warning: 'Nothing' can be done to stop major asteroid destroying Earth (here)\n\nAsteroid warning: NASA tracks a 1KM rock that could kill millions on rapid Earth approach (here)\n\nAsteroid warning: NASA radars predict slim chance of impact with 600M rock - Will it hit?
