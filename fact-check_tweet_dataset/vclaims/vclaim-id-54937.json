It added that clinical trials are ongoing for both traditional and western medicine.\n\n\u201cWHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19,\u201d said WHO Philippines.\n\nThe misleading videos were posted by a certain Boyet Castelo, a self-proclaimed COVID-19 patient who, however, admitted he had not yet seen a doctor at the time he went live to share the home remedy. On April 19, contradicting his acknowledgement that there is still no cure against the virus, he said the saltwater concoction will \u201cheal\u201d a person with the disease, adding the solution cured him of his COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nThree days later, he went on FB Live again and repeated his claim that the salt \u201cwill kill the virus in one\u2019s body.\u201d He also repeatedly said \u201cthere is nothing to lose\u201d in trying the method.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has found at least four FB pages and seven YouTube channels that re-uploaded Castelo\u2019s video, propagating the false claim that salt and salt water can cure COVID-19.\n\nAmong these is YouTube channel Gzion TV which overlaid a graphic over Castelo\u2019s video that placed an \u201cX\u201d over logos of the World Health Organization and United Nations, among others, and has text that reads \u201cend of covid\u201d and \u201cnatural, tested & effective cure.\u201d\n\nCastelo\u2019s fallacious videos surfaced amid global efforts to find a cure for the disease, which has already affected more than 2.7 million people worldwide as of April 25.\n\nSimilar claims, such as warm salt water gargle and salt water steam to treat the disease, have also circulated on social media but those have been debunked by health experts. (SEE: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Salt water steam DOES NOT kill coronavirus)\n\nCastelo\u2019s videos have reached over 2.5 million views and more than 135,000 shares.", "lang": "en"}
