He was speaking of migrants \u201cwho of necessity have to leave their villages,\u201d but he didn\u2019t call for \u201can invasion\u201d of Mexican citizens, which is how some websites spun his comments.\n\nThe distortion of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s quote appears to have begun when the right-leaning Daily Caller reported:\n\nThen partisan websites ratcheted up the slant with headlines like, \u201cMEXICO\u2019S NEXT PRESIDENT Calls for An Invasion Of The US By Mexican Citizens: \u2018must leave their towns and find a life in the United States\u2019\u201d and \u201cMexico\u2019s Next President Tells Country: They \u2018must leave their towns and find a life in the United States\u2019\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Mexican constitution limits presidents to one six-year term, so Pe\u00f1a Nieto is not eligible for reelection. Four candidates are vying for the seat, and L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftist, is leading the pack, according to recent polls. The election is scheduled for July 1.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, Andr\u00e9s Manuel. \u201cAsk AMLO for Pe\u00f1a to act urgently and immediately on the issue of Mexican children deported from the US.\u201d LopezObrador.org. 19 Jun 2018.", "lang": "en"}
