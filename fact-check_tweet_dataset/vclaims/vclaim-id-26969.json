A reverse image search found the picture had been doctored from a 2016 photograph showing Duterte holding a chart about a narcotics network.\n\nThe misleading post shows Duterte holding a white banner with the message \u201cNO TO MAR ROXAS IN MINDANAO\u201d.\n\nManuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas is running for senator in the Philippines\u2019 legislative elections in May under the opposition Liberal Party.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the post:\n\nWhen translated into English, the status says: \u201cYES, YOU WILL GET ZERO HERE IN MINDANAO\u201d.\n\nThe caption on the communications office image says: \u201cPresident Rodrigo Duterte presents a chart illustrating a drug trade network of high level drug syndicates in the Philippines during a press conference, July 7, 2016\u201d.\n\nThe altered version of the photo, referencing Roxas, appeared on Facebook February 1, 2019.\n\nThe original photo and the doctored image contain these same details: A blue flag in the background and Duterte wearing a black polo shirt and a black watch on his left wrist.\n\nDuterte can also be seen holding the chart in a video released by his communications staff, which was posted on YouTube July 7, 2016. The image appears at timestamp 5:14.\n\nHere is a screengrab from the video of Duterte holding the chart:\n\nIn comments on the Facebook post that shared the altered image, some people indicated they believed it was authentic:\n\nThe one below, when translated to English, says \"Yes..Father Digong\".\n\nDigong is Duterte's nickname and he is sometimes referred to as \u201cfather\u201d by his supporters. \n\n\n\nThe post was shared over 1,200 times by Facebook accounts which support Duterte and his allies.", "lang": "en"}
