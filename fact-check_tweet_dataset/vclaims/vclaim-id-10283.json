The story misleads about a proposed bill related to studying reparations for African-Americans.\n\nThe story links to a January 2017 by the Washington Examiner that stated the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democrats re-introduced legislation that would set up a commission to consider whether reparations should be paid to black Americans for slavery.\n\nThe Examiner story never mentions the word \"tax.\" The bill, H.R. 40, doesn\u2019t mention a tax for white people.\n\nRep. John Conyers Jr. D-Mich., proposed the bill repeatedly during the last two decades.\n\n\"I\u2019m not giving up,\" Conyers said in February 2017. \"Slavery is a blemish on this nation\u2019s history, and until it is formally addressed, our country\u2019s story will remain marked by this blight.\"\n\nA headline said that the \"Congressional Black Caucus introduces bill: tax people for being white.\" The story cites a bill that calls for setting up a commission to consider reparations for slavery, but the bill doesn\u2019t call for a tax on white people.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
