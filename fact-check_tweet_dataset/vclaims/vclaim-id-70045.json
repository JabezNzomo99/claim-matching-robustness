In the tweet, it is written that Afzal Guru will be at peace as the man (Pranab Mukherjee) who rejected his mercy petition is dead. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Rana Ayyub\u2019s tweet saying Afzal Guru will be at peace as Pranab Mukherjee has died. Fact: The tweet in the photo is digitally created. There are many differences in the posted tweet and how an actual tweet looks on the Twitter platform. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we looked for the tweet on Rana Ayyub\u2019s official Twitter account, no such tweet was found. Also, many differences were found between the posted tweet and how an actual tweet looks on the Twitter platform. The alignment is wrong, Pranab\u2019s photo comes out of the designated area and there is no date/time. So, it can be concluded that the tweet in the photo is digitally created.\n\nAlso, replying to a similar post, Rana Ayyub has clarified that it is a \u2018fake, photoshopped tweet\u2019. Her clarification can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the screenshot of Rana Ayyub\u2019s tweet saying Afzal Guru will be at peace as Pranab Mukherjee has died is digitally created.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
