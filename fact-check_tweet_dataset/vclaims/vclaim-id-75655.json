The image is a still from a small-budget film titled 'Kya Yahi Sach Hai' and has been photoshopped with the BJP leader's face.\n\nThe image which was viral two weeks ago on WhatsApp has now made its way to Twitter with some claiming that the police officer is the DGP (Director General of Police) of Gujarat.\n\nTwitter users Alamgir Rizvi, who has a picture of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi as his profile picture, tweeted the photo claiming the man kneeling was the DGP of Gujarat. The real DGP of Gujarat Geetha Johri.\n\nHis tweet was retweeted by Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha. Jha subsequently deleted his tweet after BOOM and other factcheckers called it out as fake.\n\nReleased in December 2011, 'Kya Yahi Sach Hai' is a film about an honest police officer fighting a corrupt system. The film is a fictional account of corruption in the police force loosely based on the life of YP Singh, who also directed the movie. The film got a half star rating from critic Mayank Shekhar.\n\nThe scene from which the still was taken can be viewed at 2:04:16. Click here to view the video. The politician seated on the sofa in the scene is actor Raju Mavani while the police officer kneeling is Saurabh Dubey.", "lang": "en"}
