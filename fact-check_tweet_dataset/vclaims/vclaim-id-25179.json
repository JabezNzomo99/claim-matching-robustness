That\u2019s because the measure of poverty used for the UK here is different to the one used for all the other countries\u2014it\u2019s also looking at a different year.\n\nAlthough the tweet says that the figures relate to 2018, they seem (with the exception of the UK figures) to be figures for 2016.\n\nLooking at consistent figures on the proportion of people \u201cat risk of poverty\u201d in the UK in 2016, we can see the comparable UK figure is around 16% (just below the EU average) rather than 23%.\n\nThe most recent figures we have, using this measure, are for 2017. These place the UK twelfth out of the 28 EU countries and at almost exactly the same level as the EU average (17%).\n\nThe UK figure is based on a different measure of poverty\n\nMost of the figures used by the Spectator Index\u2014and the figures in our chart above\u2014 look at the \u201cat-risk-of-poverty\u201d rate in each country. This measures the proportion of people at risk of poverty after \u201csocial transfers\u201d have been counted\u2014things like pensions and benefits.\n\nSpecifically that means people whose take-home pay after benefits are less than 60% of the national average (median). These figures are published by Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistics agency.\n\nBut the UK figure used by the Spectator Index is from a different source entirely\u2014a UK-based think tank called the Resolution Foundation.\n\nIt told us its measure is an estimate of the proportion of people whose income is below 60% of the median income, after housing costs have been paid in 2017/18. Adjusting for housing costs tends to show more working-age people at risk of poverty than measures when housing is not adjusted for (in the UK at least).\n\nThe Resolution Foundation\u2019s figures are based on official poverty figures produced by the Department for Work and Pensions, but these only go to 2016/17 at the moment.\n\nThe post from the Spectator Index has led to a number of similar posts reporting on the figures, some of which make it appear as though the UK has the highest poverty level in Europe\u2014which is also incorrect.\n\nThere are many ways to define poverty\n\nThere isn\u2019t one set definition of poverty. Most of the claim\u2019s data refers to a poverty measure published by Eurostat, but Eurostat also has other poverty measures. In the UK the government publishes a number of measures, as do other organisations like the Social Metrics Commission.\n\nComparing countries using different poverty measures, can make them look better or worse than they actually are\u2014so consistency is important.\n\nOne of the reasons that there are so many measures available is that it\u2019s not always clear how to measure what we might think of as \u201cpoverty\u201d. Looking at 60% of the median income is one way to do so, but the Office for National Statistics points out that a low income doesn't necessarily imply a low standard of living.\n\nComparing these countries doesn\u2019t take into account the living standards in each country either. For example, the Eurostat measure says that people living with less than 60% of the median income are all at risk of poverty. But your standard of living (in terms of things like housing, prices and food availability) could be a lot higher in one country than another, even if you\u2019re on the same level of income.\n\nFinally, relative poverty measures such as this one\u2014which compare everyone\u2019s incomes in a specific year\u2014can lead to some odd outcomes. For example, if the incomes of richer people in a country fell while everyone else\u2019s stayed the same that would reduce the median income. As a result fewer people would be classed as \u201cin poverty\u201d even though their incomes hadn\u2019t changed.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked before at some of the pros and cons of the official measures published in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
