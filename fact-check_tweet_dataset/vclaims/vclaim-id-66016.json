But other clues also show that the story is bogus.\n\nThere is no media outlet called the St. George Gazette. The website implies it is based in St. George, Utah, but the newspaper there is called the Spectrum.\n\nThe story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories.\n\nHorner, formerly a writer at fake news site NationalReport.net, is credited with writing stories ranging from Bill Murray running for president to President Barack Obama opening a Muslim museum to Banksy getting arrested. You can read a roundup of some his work at NewsExaminer.net, which also is a fake news site.\n\nAmong his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to \"Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin\" and a plea to donate socks to the homeless.\n\nThe footer note posted on the bottom of the website lists a \"complaint department\" phone number that is actually the number for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. It\u2019s another Horner staple to use that number: The Ryan article cites the same number as a hotline set up by the White House for people to comment on Trump\u2019s resignation.\n\nThere\u2019s otherwise no contact information for the website. We reached out to Horner, who responded to us with a cheeky reply on Facebook, but did not address this particular story.\n\nThe story is made up, in any case. We rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
