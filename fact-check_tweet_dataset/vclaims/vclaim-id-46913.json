On January 3, @QamarAb42592867 tweeted the video and said, \u201d NRC implemented in Assam, people are being arrested from home now. News channels won\u2019t show, because they are currupt. Now it is our responsibility to share this video[Translation from: ..Asam me NRC lagu, logo ko gharoo se uthana shuru ho chuka h. News wale aapko ye nahi dekhayegi, kyun ki wo bik chuki h, ab aapki aur humari zimmadari h is video ko ziyada se ziyada share karne ki]. \u201c\n\nThe same video along with the claim has been shared by several Facebook users.\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (98252 55790) and on our official mobile app.\n\nA close look at the video shows that it carries a logo \u2018Azad Reporter\u2019. Alt News looked up Azad Reporter on Facebook and found the page Azad Reporter Abu Aimal. It has over 1.4 million followers and the same logo as seen in the viral video.\n\nWe found that the same video was posted on the page on December 19, 2019. According to the description, the incident took place in Hyderabad at \u2018exhibition ground.\u2019\n\nAccording to a December 19 report by The Indian Express, \u201cAround 73 students from the University of Hyderabad were detained in the bus itself as they proceeded towards Exhibition Ground to join the protest and were taken to Moinabad police station on the city outskirts in the morning.\u201d The report added that the students resumed the protest outside the police station. An effigy of Home Minister Amit Shah was also set ablaze.\n\nTherefore, the viral video shows CAA and NRC protesters being detained in Hyderabad. It has been falsely shared on social media as people in Assam being arrested in Assam after the NRC was implemented.", "lang": "en"}
