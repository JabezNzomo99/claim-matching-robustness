Several websites claim that it is from Pakistan.\n\nAt a later part in the video, we saw a Coca Cola fridge with the tagline \u201cMaza Har Lamhe Ka\u201d written in Urdu.\n\nThis is a Coca Cola slogan launched in Pakistan in 2016, as per the Coca Cola Pakistan website. In the screenshot below, the same slogan in Urdu can be seen (marked in blue) in an advertisement of the beverage giant.\n\nAnother Coca Cola advertisement aired in Pakistan where the same slogan can be heard in a jingle can be watched below.\n\nTherefore, a screengrab of an old pornographic video from Pakistan is circulating in India with the false claim that it shows RSS worker Deepak Mishra. It is noteworthy that Alt News was unable to find any person with that name affiliated with the organisation.", "lang": "en"}
