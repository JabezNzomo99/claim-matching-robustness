Sumagui cited a supposed resolution from the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) ordering municipal treasurers and election officers in some towns in Camarines Sur \u2013 Robredo's home province \u2013 to explain issues or irregularities found in election paraphernalia.\n\nAccording to online tool Crowdtangle, the article has been shared at least 1,652 times after being posted by Facebook pages supportive of Ferdinand Marcos Jr \u2013 who filed the election protest against Robredo \u2013 and presidential daughter Sara Duterte, like Sara Duterte for President 2022 Elections, Marcos Loyalist, and Duterte Marcos Supporters.\n\nThe PET resolution indeed made the resolution, as reported by Rappler on July 5, 2018. The PET resolution was dated June 19, 2018, and concerned municipal treasurers and chairmen of the board of election inspectors (BEI) from Iriga City, Tinambac, and Tigaon.\n\nA separate resolution on April 24, 2018, ordered municipal treasurers in 4 other Camarines Sur towns to explain the issue of \"wet ballots.\" This was also reported in Manila Bulletin in May 2018, and mentioned in Rappler's July 2018 report.\n\nSince then, however, there has been no ruling yet on whether these issues or irregularities constitute cheating, because PET proceedings are confidential in nature.\n\nThe PET has also not issued a decision, as of writing, on the first stage of the 2016 vice presidential vote recount, which is part of Marcos' election protest against Robredo. The Supreme Court, sitting as the PET, scheduled for October 8 a new round of deliberations.
