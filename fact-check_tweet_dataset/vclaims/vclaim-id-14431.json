{"title": "Hate Crimes Hotline Headline Is Wrong", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2018-11-30T18:05:38+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14431", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/hate-crimes-hotline-headline-is-wrong/", "vclaim": "A popular website that spreads misinformation and conspiracy theories has twisted old news about a hate crimes hotline to create a bogus, anti-Muslim headline.\n\nIn June 2017, Minneapolis opened a new hotline for reporting hate crimes.\n\nWhy does that matter in 2018? Because on Nov. 27, a website known for spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories posted a story with the headline: \u201cMinneapolis Installs Sharia Hotline to Report Americans Who Criticize Islam.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s typical for purveyors of misinformation to take old news, like the announcement of this hotline, and twist it to create an incendiary, clickbait headline that is based on a kernel of truth. The site that posted this story, News Punch, used to be called YourNewsWire, which we\u2019ve written about several times before.\n\nTheir method works, too. The News Punch story has been shared on social media pages with a combined following of 2.6 million, while a copy of the story that was posted on another website, The Liberty Eagle, has been shared on social media pages with a combined following of 2.2 million, according to data from CrowdTangle.\n\nBut the headline isn\u2019t true. Minneapolis didn\u2019t create a \u201cSharia hotline to report Americans who criticize Islam.\u201d\n\nRather, the city started a hotline for reporting hate crimes, which it defined as \u201cany crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone\u2019s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity. This includes prejudice-motivated property damage (including graffiti), stalking and assault.\u201d\n\nThe story that follows the false headline does include some accurate information, although it is mixed with misinformation, and is lifted largely from a right-wing website called WND that wrote about the hotline shortly after it was announced in 2017. WND describes itself as \u201ca fiercely independent news site committed to hard-hitting investigative reporting of government waste,\u201d but it was one of the sites to advance the thoroughly debunked \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the U.S.\n\nOne example of accurate information mixing with misinformation shows up in both the WND story and the News Punch story. They each cite a real statement from Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel, who said after the 2016 election: \u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated. Activities such as these are against the law. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nBut both stories introduce the quote by claiming that the hotline would \u201ctarget\u201d supporters of President Donald Trump. That\u2019s not true.\n\nKorbel\u2019s statement says that there had been an increase in \u201chate-motivated speech and actions\u201d since Trump was elected. Reported incidents of hate crimes rose by 17 percent nationally in 2017, according to the FBI\u2019s annual hate crime statistics report released on Nov. 13. In Minnesota, there was a 23 percent increase in 2017, compared to the year before.\n\nThe News Punch story also wrongly says Minneapolis is \u201crun by Democrat Mayor Besty [sic] Hodges.\u201d Betsy Hodges was the mayor when WND posted its story, but Jacob Frey is the current mayor. He took office in January.\n\nAfter publishing the story, News Punch changed its headline to say: \u201cMinneapolis Installs \u2018Sharia\u2019 Hotline to Report \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 About Islam.\u201d It\u2019s still not true that it\u2019s a \u201c\u2018Sharia\u2019 hotline,\u201d and it isn\u2019t true that the hotline is solely for reporting \u201c\u2018hate speech\u2019 about Islam.\u201d Instead, it is for reporting hate crimes of any kind.\n\nAs of this writing, the Liberty Eagle still had the original headline on its website.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cNew hotline to report hate crimes: call 311 from inside Minneapolis or 612-673-3000.\u201d Press release.
