In light of that, Mahesh Bhatt's upcoming project Sadak 2's trailer is set to become the second-most disliked video on YouTube. The movie stars Sanjay Dutt, Aditya Roy Kapur and his daughters Alia Bhatt and Pooja Bhatt in the lead roles. Reportedly, when the trailer was released on YouTube, fans 'disliked' the trailer more than 11 million times in a span of a week.\n\nMahesh Bhatt lashed out because his upcoming movie received more than 11 million 'dislikes' on YouTube. The viral video is from Mahesh Bhatt's daughter Shaheen Bhatt's book launch, as is mentioned at the back of the stage.\n\nSadak 2 is set to release on Disney+Hotstar on August 28. The trailer was released on August 11, 2020. Therefore, the viral video is unrelated to the recently released trailer.\n\n During the event, last year, Mahesh Bhatt had spoken about the society being \"sick\" and that he feels like a misfit, even at his age, therefore he could never expect his children to fit in.
