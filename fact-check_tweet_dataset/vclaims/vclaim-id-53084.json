The choppers seen in the viral video are not of IAF and they are not patrolling over Pangong Tso. These are United States army choppers flying over Lake Havasu in Arizona.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. Multiple Facebook users have posted the clip with a similar claim. These posts can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of InVID, reverse image search and keyword search, we found that several American pilots and military veterans have posted the same video on Instagram recently, claiming this to be from Lake Havasu in Arizona, where fighter pilots often perform low-flying maneuvers.\n\n\n\nWe found several videos of Lake Havasu on YouTube where similar air maneuvers were being performed by military choppers. A very similar video of a low-flying Apache helicopter over Lake Havasu from 2018 is also found on YouTube.\n\nWe found there is a stark difference of colours between a US army chopper and an IAF helicopter. An IAF chopper always has the Tricolour on its tail. The chopper in the viral video bears no Tricolour.\n\nLake Havasu is a canyon, its blue-green water surrounded by stiff hills in most places. Comparing a Google Earth image of the lake with the viral video we found similar structures and geographical identities.\n\n\n\nGoogle Earth image of Lake Havasu\n\nOn condition of anonymity, an IAF source also confirmed to us that the viral video is not of IAF's Apache helicopters over Pangong Tso.\n\nWe could not ascertain the exact date the viral video was shot, but it is certain that the video is not of IAF choppers patrolling over Pangong Tso, but US army helicopters over Lake Havasu, Arizona.\n\nEarlier, we had mentioned it as US army chopper, now we are changing it to US army chopper", "lang": "en"}
