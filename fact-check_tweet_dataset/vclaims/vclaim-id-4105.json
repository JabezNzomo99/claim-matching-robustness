At the very least, they do depict a real syndrome.\n\nMany Internet users may have encountered these images on Imgur, where they were posted with a humorous title, or various Facebook pages, where they were shared with some misinformation about \u201cmirror hand syndrome.\u201d These unreliable posts may have made some viewers especially doubtful about its authenticity.\n\nHowever, while we cannot say with authorities that these exact photographs are real, they do show a real condition: Ulnar dimelia, a rare congenital anomaly of the upper limb characterized by \u201cduplication of the ulna, absence of the radius and polydactyly\u201d:\n\nUlnar dimelia, called also the mirror-hand, is classified to the 3rd group of congenital hand malformation, according to the classification proposed by Swanson [Swanson 1976] and adopted by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) and the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand (IFSSH).\n\nThere have been several documented cases. Dr. Rupesh Namdev of Bilaspur, India documented a similar condition in a seven-year-old girl in 2012. This child also had eight fingers on one hand:\n\nSimilar cases can be found elsewhere on Radiopaedia.org and the National Center for Biotechnology Information:\n\nThe condition can be mitigated with surgery.", "lang": "en"}
