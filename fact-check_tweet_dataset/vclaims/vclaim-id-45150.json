We reached out Nijalon Dunn, who is listed in the caption as having provided the image to Christianity Today, and Dunn confirmed that the image is real.\n\nAccording to Christianity Today, Floyd was a devout Christian who worked to mentor and spread faith to members of his neighborhood, the Third Ward in Houston, where he lived before relocating to Minneapolis for a job opportunity. The magazine reported:\n\nBefore moving to Minneapolis for a job opportunity through a Christian work program, the 46-year-old spent almost his entire life in the historically black Third Ward, where he was called \u201cBig Floyd\u201d and regarded as an \u201cOG,\u201d a de-facto community leader and elder statesmen, his ministry partners say. Floyd spoke of breaking the cycle of violence he saw among young people and used his influence to bring outside ministries to the area to do discipleship and outreach, particularly in the Cuney Homes housing project, locally known as \u201cthe Bricks.\u201d\n\nChauvin, who was fired along with three other officers seen in the video shortly after it went public, has been charged with murder.", "lang": "en"}
