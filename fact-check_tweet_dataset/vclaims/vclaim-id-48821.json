The purported ad showcases a body bag manufactured by the Italian luxury fashion brand \u201cPrada\u201d.\n\nThe 1.25-minute film shows a woman\u2019s body being carried away in a body bag with a \u201cPrada\u201d logo on it. The woman had died after accidentally falling off a staircase. The tagline of the video says, \u201cPrada Body Bag It\u2019s the last bag you\u2019ll ever need\u201d.\n\nWhile some have found the ad cringe-worthy in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, others are just amused. Many have taken to social media claiming that \u201cPrada\u201d is now making bags for corpses.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is actually a spoof. The video was made four years back by a group of American comedians calling themselves \u201cThe Kloons\u201d. Neither has \u201cPrada\u201d made the ad, nor is it manufacturing body bags.\n\nThe video, which has been shot like an ad campaign, is circulating on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The archived versions can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nThe video has been shared widely on Facebook.\n\nWe scanned through the YouTube channel of \u201cThe Kloons\u201d and found that they had written about the idea and mentioned the list of people behind making this spoof video.\n\nThe caption of the video, posted on April 20, 2016, says, \u201cPrada Body Bag It\u2019s the last bag you\u2019ll ever need. What will the coroner carry YOU away in when you die? And who cares cause you\u2019ll be DEAD. Big thanks to everyone who helped us make this thing happen, we\u2019ve been planning this one for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe spoof video is their tongue-in-cheek reply to people\u2019s obsession with brands. Fashion magazine \u201cCosmopolitan\u201d reported in 2016 on the spoof with a headline \u201cPrada released a bag for corpses?\u201d\n\nThis four-year-old spoof video on Italian mega fashion brand \u201cPrada\u201d has resurfaced after Italy reported one of the highest numbers of cases and deaths for Covid-19. Till May 10 evening. Italy reported almost 2.2 lakh cases of coronavirus infections and over 30,500 deaths.", "lang": "en"}
