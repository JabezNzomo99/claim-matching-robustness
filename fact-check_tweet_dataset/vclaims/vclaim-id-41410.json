On 2 July, Zee News Hindi tweeted a 7:47 minute-long video from its prime time show, Daily News and Analysis hosted by editor-in-chief Sudhir Chaudhary. In the video, Chaudhary claimed that the maiden speech delivered by Trinamool Congress lawmaker Mahua Moitra on 25 June in Lok Sabha was plagiarised. He took to Twitter and shared images of an article titled as \u2018The 12 Early Warning Signs of Fascism\u2019 and claimed that Moitra \u2018stole\u2019 words from it. Now Zee News is not the only one who claimed that the TMC parliamentarian had read a plagiarised speech. Several other prominent leaders also alleged the same on Twitter. The famous speech by @Trinamool MP #MahuaMoitra which @sardesairajdeep praised was an article written by a US journalist on trump in Jan 2017. All she did was to juxtapose Modi in place of Trump. Plagiarism at its worst. Here is original articlehttps://t.co/1DWj3ZtAnD \u2014 Dr Vijay Chauthaiwale (@vijai63) July 1, 2019 Is Mahua Moitra a plagiarist? Compare https://t.co/XdRr0rDDW7 & https://t.co/LeVeOEIFnA The words aren't identical but the basic structure (using the Holocaust memorial poster) & ideas have been lifted; instead of @realDonaldTrump she's lambasting @narendramodi on similar lines. \u2014 Makarand R Paranjape (@MakrandParanspe) July 1, 2019 True????\n\n Plagiarised piece Mahua Moitra read out was actually an article written by a US journalist Martin Longman about Trump way back in January 2017. \n\nHere is the article from where it was plagiarised:https://t.co/zNmQKWiOX3 \u2014 Shobhaa De (@DeShobhaa) July 2, 2019 The claim made by Zee News is false. The aforementioned article, with the headline \u2018The 12 Early Warning Signs of Fascism\u2019, published by the Washington Monthly in 2017 was written by Martin Longman. In his article, Longman had referred to a poster that highlighted early signs of fascism and mentioned that it could be found hanging at the US Holocaust Museum. In her speech, Moitra was referring to the same poster.\n\nIn her maiden speech video, at 9:12 minutes, she can be heard saying, \u201cIn 2017, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum put up a poster in its main lobby and it contained a list of all the signs of early fascism. Each of the seven signs I have pointed to you, features on that poster.\u201d Further, the TMC parliamentarian released a press statement. An excerpt from the statement reads, \u2018My source as mentioned categorically in my speech was the poster from the Holocaust Museum created by the political scientist Dr Laurence W. Brit pointing out the 14 signs of early fascism. I found 7 signs relevant to Indian and spoke at length about each of them.\u2019 While she mentioned that the poster with early signs of fascism was displayed at a museum in US, however that\u2019s not true. In 2017, American fact-checking website Snopes had debunked the fact that the poster was not exhibited in the museum but was available in its gift shop for sometime. Coming back to Longman\u2019s article, in a series of tweets he denied that the politicial in question had plagiarised. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m internet famous in India because a politician is being falsely accused of plagiarizing me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of funny, but right-wing assholes seem to be similar in every country. \u2014 Martin Longman (@BooMan23) July 2, 2019 Whether they reach out to me or not, this is ridiculous. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t steal or plagiarize anything. \u2014 Martin Longman (@BooMan23) July 3, 2019 US Author Shuts Up Right-Wing Trolls Accusing Mahua of Plagiarism Despite the fact that Mahua had issued a press statement clarifying all concerns regarding her speech, Sudhir Chaudhary now tweeted that she had quoted the article \u2018out of context.\u2019 The #TukdeTukdeGang has been demolished and are crying foul again. An elected Indian MP picks up a random article/poster and quotes it out of context to demean the Indian electorate.We called her out.Her gang is hurt?We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll expose all attempts to discredit the voters of India \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00ae\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00b3 \u2014 Sudhir Chaudhary (@sudhirchaudhary) July 3, 2019", "lang": "en"}
