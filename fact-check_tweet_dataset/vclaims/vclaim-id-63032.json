The letter is scathing, however it appears Morgan and Trump\u2019s friendship was already on the outs when Morgan wrote it.\n\nMorgan\u2019s letter was largely a critique of Trump\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and read in part:\n\nYou are the most powerful person in America and your words carry enormous weight and consequence. Within hours of you suggesting it might be a good idea to use bleach, one public health hotline in one state \u2013 Maryland \u2013 received 100 phone calls asking about whether they should use household detergent to combat the virus, and was forced to issue an alert warning people not to try it. New York City\u2019s Poison Control Center took 30 similar calls from the moment your briefing last Thursday night ended to 3pm the next day \u2013 and was also forced to release an alert saying that using bleach \u2018can put people at great risk.\u2019 This latest debacle came after you previously and repeatedly hyped up an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as another \u2018cure\u2019 \u2013 until it turned out to cause more deaths in COVID patients than those who weren\u2019t treated with it. This is a terrifying illustration of how dangerous your rhetoric can be. So yes, I think when it comes to floating mad ideas about potential \u2018cures\u2019 for coronavirus, you should shut the f*ck up. I can understand why such direct language from a long-time friend may have offended you, and I understood that when I wrote it. You have a notoriously thin skin and take any criticism very badly.\n\nIn the letter, Morgan also notes that Trump unfollowed him on Twitter after Morgan posted another column for the Daily Mail days earlier that began with \u201cSHUT THE F**K UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP.\u201d\n\nIn the April 27 open letter, Morgan acknowledged that he and Trump had been friends for 15 years, \u201cBut if you can\u2019t handle my criticism, and our friendship is over, then let me mark the end of our relationship with a few home truths about your spectacularly bad handling of this crisis that may yet, if you heed them, still enable you to get re-elected in November.\u201d\n\nBecause the letter circulating on social media was indeed written by Morgan, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
