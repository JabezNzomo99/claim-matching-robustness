The quotes appear to have come from a satire website.\n\nFacebook posts attributing racist remarks to Kors have circulated since 2015. This particular iteration appears to show a screen grab of an article quoting him as also saying he can\u2019t \u201cstomach the thought of my Micheal Kors purses being stuffed with synthetic hair, weave or whatever those people call it.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports crediting him with the comments, only fact-checkers debunking the attribution. Had he made the statements, it almost certainly would have been picked up by major news outlets.

An archived version of the story shows that the website has a disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \u201cNahaDaily is a daily satirical news source. Meaning complete fiction.\u201d\n\nAfter George Floyd\u2019s death on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody, the Michael Kors brand announced on Facebook that it would, among other actions, donate to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\n\u201cOur company does not condone racism, discrimination or violence of any kind,\u201d the statement reads, in part. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the Black community to work towards ending racial prejudice and injustice.\u201d\n\nIt also said Kors would be \u201cmaking a personal donation\u201d to support the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.", "lang": "en"}
