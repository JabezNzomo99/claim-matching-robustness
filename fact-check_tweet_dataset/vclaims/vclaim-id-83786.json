The people in the crowd are actually calling out the name of his sole challenger in the presidential race, Prabowo Subianto.\n\nThe 26-second video, posted to Facebook group SUARA MAYORITAS (Voice of the majority) on November 29, 2018, has a caption that claims the crowd is voicing support for \u201cJokowi\u201d, which is the president\u2019s nickname, at a match in Liga 1, Indonesia\u2019s premier football competition.\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says:\n\n\u201cThe shouting \u2018JOKOWI\u2026 JOKOWI\u2026 JOKOWI\u2019 can be heard everywhere. Now the shouting \u2018JOKOWI\u2026 JOKOWIIII\u2026 JOKOWII\u2019 is also heard in the decisive Liga 1 match between Semen Padang Football Club and Persita Tangerang.\u201d\n\nHere is a snapshot of the misleading post:\n\nBut in the video, which was shared hundreds of times within a few hours of it being posted, the crowd can clearly be heard chanting Subianto\u2019s first name.\n\nAfter \u201cPrabowo\u201d is chanted several times, a man can also be heard saying: \u201cReplace the president\u201d.\n\nAFP has not posted the video so as not to drive traffic to the misleading post. But it can be traced back by clicking on its archived link.\n\nSemen Padang, one of the teams playing in the match featured in the post, is from the province of West Sumatra.\n\nAn Indonesian news group sumbarpost.com, which reports news related to West Sumatra, published an article on November 28, 2018, about Semen Padang fans chanting Subianto\u2019s name in the match, pitting their club against Persita. Here is that article.", "lang": "en"}
