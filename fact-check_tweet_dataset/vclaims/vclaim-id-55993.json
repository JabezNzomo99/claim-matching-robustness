The original banner actually has the words \u201cFree All Antifa Prisoners\u201d on it.\n\nFalse rumors have recently circulated online that members of the Hells Angels and Mongols motorcycle clubs were traveling together to Seattle to confront antifa, short for anti-fascist, activists.\n\nThe image being shared appears to reference that debunked claim, showing a crowd of people in front of what appears to be a stage. Some people in the front of the photo hold a banner, purportedly bearing the words \u201cAntifa Against Bikers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a fight they don\u2019t want to start,\u201d the accompanying post reads. \u201cOne they won\u2019t win.\u201d (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Hells Angels And Mongols Bikers Riding To Seattle To Fight Antifa Activists)\n\nHowever, the image appears to have been digitally manipulated to change the words on the banner the people are holding. A reverse image search traced the photo back to July 2015, when a group of anti-fascists came together to celebrate the \u201cinternational day of solidarity with antifascist prisoners,\u201d according to its caption. The original image, posted on the website of a New York-based anarchist political center, shows the words \u201cFree All Antifa Prisoners\u201d on the banner.\n\nIn late May, President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. government will designate antifa as a terrorist organization. Legal experts have questioned the president\u2019s ability to do so, BBC News reported.", "lang": "en"}
