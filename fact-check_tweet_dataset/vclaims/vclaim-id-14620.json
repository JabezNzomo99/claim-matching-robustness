(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the claim about Coulter is accurate.\n\nCoulter made the statement several times, notably on The View and on Twitter in 2015.\n\nThe particular quote in the meme comes from Coulter\u2019s 2015 appearance on The View where she discussed her book \"\u00a1Adios, America! The Left's plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole.\"\n\nAs The View panel and Coulter discussed Coulter\u2019s anti-immigration views, guest host Ana Navarro asks Coulter if she\u2019s Native American.\n\nCoulter responds, \"Why, yes I am. I am a settler. I am descended from settlers \u2014 not from immigrants.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not living in Cherokee nation; I did not immigrate to Cherokee nation,\" Coulter continued. \"We\u2019re living in America, which was created by settlers, not immigrants.\"\n\nFollowing the interview, genealogist Megan Smolenyak took a look at Coulter\u2019s family tree. While Coulter\u2019s mother\u2019s side can be traced back to colonialism, Smolenyak wrote that Coulter\u2019s paternal ancestors came to America two centuries later than the first Europeans \u2014 a stretch for fitting the definition of \"settler.\"\n\nWe're not judging whether it's accurate for Coulter to call herself a settler. We're just confirming that she described herself as such.\n\nThe Facebook meme quotes Coulter accurately. We rate this claim True.\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to correct a reference to Smolenyak's work.", "lang": "en"}
