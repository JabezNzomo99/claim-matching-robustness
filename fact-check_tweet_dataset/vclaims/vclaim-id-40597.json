The claim has been debunked numerous times over the years as an internet hoax.\n\nWarnings for women to be cautious if they find zip ties attached to their vehicles are being widely shared on Facebook.

Of these trafficked people, approximately 75 percent are girls and women.\n\nHowever, putting zip ties on windshield wipers does not appear to be a widespread tactic used by human traffickers to abduct victims. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible sources documenting this tactic, only media outlets debunking it.\n\nAyan Ahmed, a spokesperson for the human trafficking-focused NGO Polaris Project, told PolitiFact that most most human traffickers lure victims through psychological means. Human traffickers also more often target people they know than strangers, according to Ahmed.\n\nPost Oak Mall, the shopping center mentioned in the image, is located in College Station, Texas. The local police department addressed the story on their official Facebook page, noting that it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d the tactic has anything to do with human trafficking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to remind people, especially during the busy shopping season, to be aware of their surroundings and to report suspicious activity,\u201d advised the College Station Police Department.\n\nThe hoax may have originated in October 2018 when similar claims of zip ties being used by human traffickers in San Angelo, Texas, circulated online. After reportedly receiving multiple inquiries about the viral posts, the San Angelo Police Department put out an official statement about the supposed tactic.\n\n\u201cThe San Angelo Police Department has not received any reports of human trafficking, kidnappings or attempted kidnappings relating to human trafficking nor have we received any reports of black zip ties being used as a means to mark a target of any type of crime,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cAdditionally, our administration has reached out to the Angelo State University Police Department and their administration had confirmed that they have not received any such report.\u201d\n\nOther police departments across the country have since dispelled stories of human traffickers using this tactic, according to the Kansas City Star.", "lang": "en"}
