Numerous fact-checkers have previously debunked the claim that the U.S. rejected World Health Organization test kits.\n\nThe CDC-developed test protocols require that labs use Thermo Fisher Scientific products, including its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument, according to CDC testing instructions. Some people, including journalist Amee Vanderpool, expressed concern that Trump would profit from testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nSimilar sentiments also circulated on social media: \u201cSo Trump turned down the WHO testing kits in February,\u201d claimed a March 7 post. \u201cLo and behold the CDC has ordered kits to be made by a company Trump is a stockholder in \u2013 Thermo Fisher Scientific.\u201d (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A \u2018Hoax\u2019 At His South Carolina Rally?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Trump currently owns Thermo Fisher Scientific stock. He owned between $500,001 and $1 million worth of the company\u2019s stock in 2015 and less than $1,001 worth in 2016, but financial disclosures show he had divested from the company by the time he took office in January 2017.\n\nVanderpool\u2019s article, headlined \u201cTrump Could Profit From Coronavirus Testing,\u201d appears to have first made the claim, citing an outdated 2016 story from The Associated Press. She later updated the story to reflect the fact that Trump\u2019s recent financial disclosures show no evidence he owns stock in the company, but by that time the initial allegation had already spread across the internet.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
