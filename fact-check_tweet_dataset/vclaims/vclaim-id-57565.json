Some social media users alleged that the bill included hidden pay raises for members of Congress.\n\n\u201cGuess what else Nancy hid in her stimulus bill?\u201d reads one post. \u201cA pay increase for Congress! But it\u2019s only $25M.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Divert $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment?)\n\nBut this is incorrect. While the stimulus package does include $25 million for House \u201csalaries and expenses,\u201d those funds will not go to a \u201cpay increase\u201d for members of Congress. Instead, they go toward \u201cnecessary expenses of the House of Representatives to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus,\u201d according to the text of the bill.\n\nEvan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, explained further in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation:\n\nThe $25 million funding is to support the House\u2019s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network. It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the House Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters.\n\nThe bill signed into law and an earlier GOP-backed proposal included the $25 million appropriation for House \u201csalaries and expenses,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn accordance with the 1989 Ethics Reform Act, congressional salaries adjustments are automatic and based on changes in private sector wages, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied. Congress has voted against pay increases since 2009, when they first instituted a pay freeze.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
