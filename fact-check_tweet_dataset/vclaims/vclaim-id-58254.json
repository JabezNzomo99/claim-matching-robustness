Next to the picture is a timeline of eight viral outbreaks from 1957 to 2019 which reads: \u201c1957-1958 \u2013 H2N2 originated in China. 1968-1969 \u2013 H3N2 originated in China. 1997-2004 \u2013 H5N1 originated in China. 2003 \u2013 SARS originated in China. 2006 \u2013 Bird Flu originated in China. 2009 \u2013 Swine Flu originated in China. 2013 \u2013 Porcine Pestivirus originated in China. 2019 \u2013 Covid-19 originated in China.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s accompanying text states: \u201cAnyone else see a pattern? Question. Why does the world feel the constant need to kowtow to the Nation that has some of the worst Human Right Violations on the Planet, is one of the worst polluters, has delusions of global dominance (See Belt and Road Initiative) and keeps exporting viral disease after viral disease around the world?\u201d\n\nThe post by New Zealand Facebook group, South Island Independence Movement, is one of at least 13 examples found here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here by AAP FactCheck. The post\u2019s multiple examples have attracted nearly two million views and more than 3200 shares.\n\nCOVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan in China in December 2019 and has now spread to 216 countries, areas or territories as of May 14, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 4.2 million cases have been confirmed and the global death toll is approaching 300,000.\n\nCOVID-19 is not the first deadly viral outbreak to have originated in China, with the country correctly identified in the post as the source of several of the listed outbreaks. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that affected 26 countries in 2003 originated in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002, while the H5N1 virus \u2013 or \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 was first discovered in a goose in the same Chinese province in 1996, according to WHO.\n\nHowever, not all the viruses in the post can be directly attributed to China. The H2N2 virus of 1957-58 \u2013 more commonly known as \u2018Asian Flu\u2019 \u2013 was the first major worldwide influenza outbreak since the devastating Spanish Flu of 1918. The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the H2N2 virus was first reported in Singapore in February 1957 before spreading to Hong Kong in April and then to the US and other countries in June.\n\nThe CDC and WHO also rule out China as the source of the 2009 Swine Flu outbreak. Passed to humans from pigs, the first infections were detected in the United States and Mexico in April and by June the disease had spread to more than 70 countries.\n\nThere are also discrepancies about the origin country for other viruses listed. The H3N2 virus of 1968-69 is more commonly known as \u2018Hong Kong Flu\u2019 and while some researchers believe it may have originated in mainland China, it has never been proved conclusively. WHO (see table, page 41) lists Asia as the source. As the name suggests, it resulted in a large epidemic in Hong Kong, which at the time was a UK colony.\n\nThe Facebook post lists as separate events, \u201c1997-2004 \u2013 H5N1\u201d and \u201c2006 \u2013 Bird Flu\u201d, however this is not correct as they are the same virus. Those events were part of an ongoing series of infections in animals and humans from the H5N1 virus first identified in China in 1996, confirmed with human infections in Hong Kong in 1997 and continued through to 2006.\n\nFor the \u201c2013 \u2013 Porcine Pestivirus\u201d, it is unclear what this refers to. Pestiviruses are RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae, but the only one to have been designated \u201cporcine\u201d is Atypical Porcine Pestivirus (APPV). APPV is highly diverged from other members of the genus and was first identified in the US in 2015. A National Center for Biotechnology study in 2017 identified cases of APPV in Austria between 2013-2016.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be partly false. While COVID-19, SARS and bird flu outbreaks can be sourced to China, two events cited, the H2N2 virus of 1957-1958 and the 2009 Swine Flu outbreaks, did not originate in China. A third, the H3N2 virus of 1968-69, has not been conclusively sourced to China, while the claims relating to the origins of H5N1 (1997-2004), \u201c2006 \u2013 Bird Flu\u201d and Porcine Petrivirus (2013) are inaccurate. The \u201c1997-2004 \u2013 H5N1\u201d and \u201c2006 \u2013 Bird Flu\u201d events were part of an ongoing series of infections in animals and humans from the same H5N1 virus first identified in China in 1996, confirmed with human infections in Hong Kong in 1997 and continued through to 2006. For the listing \u201c2013 \u2013 Porcine Pestivirus\u201d it is unclear what this refers to. Partly False \u2013 The claim of the content is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
