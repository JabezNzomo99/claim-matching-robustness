The individual elements have long featured in myth and superstition \u2014 the mirror serving as a representation of the soul and number seven being associated with portentous events \u2014 but answers about how and why they came to be linked in this particular fashion have been lost in the mists of time.\n\nThe generally accepted explanation for why breaking a mirror brings one bad luck is that the reflection in a mirror represents not just one\u2019s physical appearance but also one\u2019s soul, so damaging a mirror also damages the soul of the one who broke it. More elaborate explanations posit that the damaged soul which results from mirror breakage is less capable of protecting a person from misfortune (and thus that person will be subject to more \u201cbad luck\u201d in the future) or that the damaged soul itself brings down the bad luck as an act of revenge against the mirror breaker\u2019s carelessness.\n\nMany sources tie the amount of bad luck brought about by breaking a mirror (i.e., seven years\u2019 worth) to the Romans, who are said to have believed that life renewed itself every seven years. Damaging a mirror was tantamount to damaging one\u2019s health and therefore brought about a calamity that would not be fully righted until the next seven-year cycle had passed.\n\nAs with many superstitions, the \u201cbreaking a mirror brings bad luck\u201d belief has prompted the creation of a variety of counter-superstitions \u2014 antidotes that, if applied quickly enough by the mirror breaker, will ward off the otherwise inevitable run of bad luck:\n\u2022 Throw salt over your shoulder. (This is also a remedy for other forms of bad luck-producing accidents, such as spilling salt.)\n\u2022 Immediately spin around three times in a counter-clockwise direction. (This act is often said to bring about bad luck in itself; doing so after breaking a mirror confuses the spirits and reverses the bad luck.)\n\u2022 Grind the mirror shards into a fine power. (This prevents any more reflections from being viewed in the damaged mirror.)\n\u2022 Gather the broken mirror pieces and submerge them in the waters of a south-running stream. (This will wash away the bad luck after only seven hours rather than seven years.)\n\u2022 Use flames to burn or blacken the mirror fragments, then bury them a year later. (Burying the fragments will lift the hex after only one year.)\n\u2022 Take a piece of the broken mirror and touch it to a tombstone. (This will immediately lift the curse of bad luck.)", "lang": "en"}
