A post has been going viral on social media claiming that a Japanese man killed his friend because the online multiplayer game PUBG. The post contains an image of a man in police custody.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The man in the image was arrested for killing nine students in China. This had nothing to do with PUBG.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe text with the post viral on Facebook and other social media platforms reads: \"A Japanese man killed his friend just because he didn't give him 6x scope in PUBG.\"\n\nOn reverse searching the image, AFWA found a news article published in China Daily. According to the report, 28-year-old Chinese man Zhao Zewei was convicted of killing nine middle school students in Mizhi County on April 27, 2018. He was executed in September 2018, after his death sentence got approved by the Supreme People's Court.\n\nZhao, a former student of the same middle school was upset over the bullying he suffered as a child. He reached school to take revenge from his classmates but didn't find any of them. Angry, he stabbed students coming out of school at random.\n\nA number of accidental deaths, murders and cases of mental misbalance have been reported from across the globe, attributing the ill effects of PUBG on young minds. It includes the case of a PUBG addicted Delhi teenager, who killed his family.\n\nA recent incident took place in Maharashtra where two men died while playing PUBG on the railway tracks. The incident happened in March this year, was reported by many prominent media houses.\n\nThere are many similar cases reported till now. However, AFWA has not independently verified these incidents.", "lang": "en"}
