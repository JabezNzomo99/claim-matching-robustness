Okoth, the member of parliament for Kibra, responded to the widely circulated rumours through a tweet stating: \u201cI am alive and kicking.\u201d\n\nOkoth's name began trending on Kenyan Twitter when the claim began circulating mid-morning on Tuesday.\n\nA website called Kwetu FM published an article claiming that Okoth\u2019s office had confirmed his death in a statement. The website has a similar name to the better-known Qwetu Radio. While it contains a large number of news articles from Kenya and abroad, the link to its \u201cabout us\u201d page does not work, meaning the site is of questionable credibility.\n\nPolycarp Hinga, a well-known blogger who has more than 35,000 followers on Twitter, also tweeted the information but apologised after the response from Okoth.\n\nThe claim was also shared on WhatsApp groups, causing a bit of panic among social media users who started questioning whether the information was true.\n\nOkoth, who uses Twitter quite regularly, dismissed the claims via his account stating: \u201cI'm alive and kicking. Folks should stop killing me before my time with rumours.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, the lawmaker -- whose constituency Kibra is Kenya\u2019s largest slum -- confirmed he had been diagnosed with stage four colorectal cancer. Okoth has been very open with details concerning his condition and at one point he posted images to show how chemotherapy had affected his skin.\n\nRumours of the deaths of prominent personalities are not a new occurrence in Kenya. Last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to respond when false rumours of the death of Kenya's second president, Daniel Moi, circulated online.", "lang": "en"}
