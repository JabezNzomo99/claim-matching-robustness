Is this so?\n\nA Facebook post shared and continually reposted in recent days claims that President Donald Trump \u201csigned an executive order allowing our veterans to get 100% medical bills paid at hospitals other than a V.A. hospital.\u201d\n\nBut no such executive order was ever signed, as evidenced by a review of Trump\u2019s more than 60 orders made between 2017 and 2018.\n\nSeveral readers inquired with FactCheck.org about the veracity of the claim.\n\nWe looked at news reports and White House statements and could find no evidence to support the post, which in one instance was shared more than 209,700 times. It reads in full:\n\n\u201cFor all the Trump haters; today President Trump signed an executive order allowing our veterans to get 100% medical bills paid at hospitals other than a V.A. hospital. This will save the lives of many American service men and women who have been on V.A. waiting lists, some for years and many dying while waiting. Now they can go to ANY hospital they want\u2026 This is how our veterans SHOULD be treated!!! Thanks President Trump!!!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Trump hasn\u2019t used his signature to address veterans\u2019 issues.\n\nThe president has continued the Veterans Choice Program, a program started in 2014 following a scandal over wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities. The program was created through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill that was signed by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program allows some veterans who experience difficulty obtaining care from a Veterans Affairs medical facility to seek care elsewhere. To qualify, veterans must be enrolled in the VA health care system and demonstrate certain barriers to using the VA system (such as wait time or distance).\n\nIn 2017, Trump signed a bill that eliminated the program\u2019s expiration date and twice signed legislation (in August and December) that authorized funding to keep the program afloat.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee everything is free, either. Some veterans could have copayments under the VA system \u2014 determined by financial assessments \u2014 and are still responsible for those payments under the choice program, according to the VA. The VA reports that \u201cwhile most Veterans receive cost-free care and services based on eligibility factors, such as service connection and/or income, the 2016 average annual out-of-pocket costs for all other Veterans was just $320.\u201d\n\nTrump also has used executive orders to advance veterans-specific policies, including one aimed at increasing accountability at the VA and adding protections for whistleblowers. Another extends mental health coverage to all veterans during the first-year transition back to civilian life.\n\nUpdate, July 6: On June 6, Trump signed the VA MISSION Act of 2018, a bipartisan bill that calls for a number of changes at the VA. The new law continues the Veterans Choice Program for a year, but then replaces it with the Veterans Community Care Program.\n\nThe new program expands the criteria for those who seek care outside of the VA health care system. For example, it allows a veteran to go to a private provider if the \u201ccovered veteran and the covered veteran\u2019s referring clinician agree that furnishing care and services through a non-Department entity or provider would be in the best medical interest of the covered veteran.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that \u201cin the early years of the program, roughly 640,000 additional veteran patients would be referred out to community care each year.\u201d The law also requires the VA to provide veterans access to walk-in care from non-VA providers; the veterans may be required to pay copayments, as determined by the VA.\n\n\u201c10 Things to Know About the Veterans Choice Program.\u201d U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 10 May 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, VA, and You.\u201d U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
