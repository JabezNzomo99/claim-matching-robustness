He blamed the Mamata Banerjee-led government for giving leeway to such hate against Hindus in the name of free speech.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was also picked up by hate-monger and serial purveyor of fake news Shankhnaadwho called Hindus \u201cstupid\u201d for tolerating and allowing such things to happen.\n\nThe undue attention received by the one-man play caused Kolkata police to take action against \u201cattempts to disrupt the communal harmony of the state\u201d. Taking note of Maiti\u2019s complaint, Kolkata police took to Facebook to let people know that they have successfully taken down posters of \u2018Hindu Chor\u2019 from across the city and have also identified those associated with the play to take necessary legal actions against them.\n\nAkshay Singh, BJP IT cell in-charge, Kolkata tweeted against the play and wrote that Hindu Jagaran Manch registered a complaint in Hastings police station. The complaint termed the name of the play \u201chighly objectional\u201d and that it \u201churts the sentiments of Hindu communities as a whole and thereby promoting disharmony and feeling of hatred among different religious groups.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, the play wasn\u2019t against Hindus, but the complete opposite. West Bengal BJP member Aparajita Chakraborty revealed that it is based on the \u201chardships and persecution faced by Bangladeshi Hindus every day.\u201d She says in her Facebook comment \u2013 \u201cOur friend has tried to paint this picture in this play, let us all watch it on 25th June and then decide whether it warrants any protest. Only Hindus from Bangladesh are aware of the pathetic situation that they are in currently. No one is there to support them.\u201d\n\nDebashish Iyer, who according to his profile is a journalist and a former social media strategist for BJP, also commented that the play was, in fact, pro-Hindus.\n\nDirector changes the name of the play\n\nOwing to the backlash received on social media, director Probir Mondal decided to change the name of his play from \u2018Hindu Chor\u2019 to \u2018Giren Chor\u2019. In a Facebook post he wrote \u2013 \u201cI apologise to everyone, please do not create any further controversy. I am changing the name of my play \u2018Hindu Chor\u2019 to \u2018Giren Chor\u2019. This is the brave tale of a Hindu \u2018Chor\u2019. I do not want to offend any religious sensibilities, but I apologise if I have done so unintentionally.\u201d\n\nA scroll through Mondol\u2019s Facebook profile gives an idea of his political inclination. Despite being a BJP supporter, he was pulled into the controversy and abused on social media by right-wing crusaders. A right-winger, one Rajib Roy, posted Mondol\u2019s phone number on Facebook asking all \u201cproud Hindus\u201d to call him in protest.\n\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s named was dragged into the controversy, blaming her for providing a safe haven to those circulating objectional statements against Hindus. CM Banerjee has often herself in the crosshairs of fake news purveyors and rumour-mongers who often portray her as Muslim and Bangladeshi sympathiser.\n\nAn entire episode of hate-mongering along communal lines started and ended with people of identical political beliefs, a reminder of the famous quote by German theologian Martin Niem\u00f6ller \u2013 \u201c\u2026then they came for me\u2014and there was no one left to speak for me.\u201d\n\nA Facebook user Utsav Guhathakurta tipped Alt News about the controversy and helped us with the translations.", "lang": "en"}
