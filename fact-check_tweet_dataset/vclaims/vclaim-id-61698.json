He believes his plan would lower health care costs enough that most of the 47 million Americans without coverage would be able to find a plan they could afford.\n\nBut with no mandate, some people would inevitably go without coverage. But how many? Clinton says 15 million; health care experts it's impossible to come up with a reliable number without more details on Obama's plan.\n\nClinton's 15 million number could be a reasonable estimate -- it's 30 percent of those currently without insurance -- but it's at best a guess. For that we reason, we rate her claim half true.", "lang": "en"}
