The photo is based on a picture of Trump and his daughter Ivanka, with Epstein\u2019s face superimposed.\n\nMany social media users encountering the image, as seen (here , here , here) commented that it was evidently an altered photograph \u2013 but not all appear to have noticed the edit. \u201cThis picture says a thousand words,\u201d writes one user who shared the image. \u201c\u2026trump said he never had much dealings with him... Aye right....\u201d remarks another.\n\nThe longtime associate of Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, has recently been charged with luring young girls so that the late financier could sexually abuse them (here).\n\nTrump has been pictured and filmed with Epstein and Maxwell on multiple occasions in the past (here , here).\n\nHowever, the photo being shared in the viral social media posts of Trump with his arm around Epstein, kissing him on the head in the back of a car, is not real. Epstein\u2019s head has been added in to replace Ivanka Trump\u2019s head. The original photo, taken in Paris in 1990, can be seen on Getty Images (here ). The French text accompanying the image says, \u201cUnited States, 15 March 1990, the American billionaire real estate magnate Donald Trump in his limousine embracing his daughter Ivanka Trump (13 years old), who he had with his previous wife, Ivana\u201d.\n\nFalse. The photo has been edited to replace the head of Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka with that of Epstein.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
