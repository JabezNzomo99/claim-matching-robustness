Both sides like to cherry-pick parts of the report that support their position. For instance, Democrats love to cite the fact that State concluded the pipeline would result in 35 permanent jobs, which is a very minor aspect of the report. But they ignore the bottom line conclusion of the State Department analysis\u2014the environment impact would be minimal because \u201cthe proposed project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction in oil sands areas.\u201d\n\nEven the nomenclature of the material under discussion is in dispute, with the State Department using an industry term, \u201coil sands,\u201d and foes calling it \u201ctar sands.\u201d Basically it is a hard material known as bitumen, mixed in with sand and clay, which must be extracted, often through open-pit mining, and then refined into crude. (This Pennsylvania State University Web page explains the process; it takes about two tons of oil sands and some barrels of water to yield one barrel of oil.)\n\nThat\u2019s difficult work which results in more greenhouse gas emissions than other transportation fuels, on average. The State Department pegged it at 17 percent difference over the life of the fuel (ie, \u201cwell-to-wheels\u201d); the Congressional Research Service looked at a range of scientific studies and concluded it was between 14 to 20 percent. (Opponents often cite a much higher figure that looks only at the difference of getting the fuel to the tank.)\n\nCardin\u2019s staff pointed to news articles and reports by environmental think tanks to make the case that oil sands extraction is harmful to the environment\u2013and that there are potential concerns about the building of the pipeline itself. But the key question before Congress is whether the Keystone pipeline would make a difference in Canada\u2019s extraction of oil sands; the Department concluded it would not.\n\nThose sentences may sound contradictory, but essentially higher transportation costs, when crude prices are below $50 a barrel, would result in oil being left in the ground. But the pipeline would lower transportation costs for the companies that bid for the pipeline space, so some producers would take advantage of that and possibly expand production. Even if production levels remain the same, the industry would consider the pipeline a worthwhile project because it would siphon oil away from more expensive railroads.\n\nThe State Department noted that \u201cthe dominant drivers of oil sands development are more global than any single infrastructural project\u201d and so \u201cthe potential effects of those factors on the industry\u2019s rate of expansion should not be conflated with the more limited effects of individual pipelines.\u201d In other words, the oil industry takes a long view, over 30 to 40 years, and one should not overemphasize the impact of a single project.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact checked President Obama\u2019s claim that the pipeline was designed to take Canadian crude oil to the world markets. The president earned Three Pinocchios for suggesting that all of the Canadian crude would be exported. First of all, most of the oil would almost certainly stop on the Gulf Coast to be refined into products. On top of that, current trends suggest that only about half of that refined product would be exported.\n\nBut the fact remains the reason for the pipeline is because it is taking the crude oil to the refiners on the Gulf Coast, where it would be refined into products such as motor gasoline and diesel fuel. The State Department report disputed claims that the oil \u201cwould pass through the United States and be loaded onto vessels for ultimate sale in markets such as Asia,\u201d saying it was not economically justified. The State Department noted that the traditional sources of crude for the Gulf Coast, such as Mexico and Venezuela, are declining, and so refineries would have \u201csignificant incentive to obtain heavy crude from the oil sands.\u201d\n\nOil sands extraction certainly has higher levels of greenhouse emissions than other sources of crude, but the State Department concluded the impact of building the pipeline would be minimal; the material is going to be extracted anyway. Critics of the project say the State Department report is already outdated, given the decrease in oil prices, but the impact on production remains unclear. While the pipeline might offer some cost advantage over rail, if the price of oil keeps dropping, the incentive to mine oil sands will diminish as well.", "lang": "en"}
