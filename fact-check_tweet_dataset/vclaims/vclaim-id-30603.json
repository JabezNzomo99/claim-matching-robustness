Amidst the attacks on Congress and the Left, discussions on the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the protests opposing the legislation, the PM also spoke about the abrogation of provisions of Article 370.\n\nDuring his address, PM Modi attributed the following quote to former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah: \u201c\u0906\u0930\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0932 370 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u091f\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0910\u0938\u093e \u092d\u0942\u0915\u0902\u092a \u0932\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0938\u0947 \u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e (The abrogation of Article 370 would bring a massive earthquake that it will divide Kashmir from India.)\u201d Abdullah has been under house arrest for the past six months.\n\nThe portion of his address where he accredits the statement to Abdullah can be watched below or here on PMO India\u2019s Youtube channel.\n\nThis was also tweeted by the Bharatiya Janata Party from its official handle.\n\nIt is noteworthy that after PM Modi\u2019s speech, ex-chief ministers of J&K Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were booked under the Public Security Act (PSA).\n\nIt would be amusing were it not worrisome that the prime minister quoted an article from a satirical website \u2018Faking News\u2019 in the Parliament. The website had published the exact quote on May 28, 2014.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the satirical piece.\n\nAbdullah had posted a tweet on Article 370 and the Modi government a day before this satirical piece was published. The tweet suggested that J&K won\u2019t be a part of India if Article 370 ceases to exist. This is the closet quote we found compared to PM Modi\u2019s statement. However, there is no mention of an \u2018earthquake\u2019 which appears only in the satirical article.\n\nA quick Google search throws up no news reports where Abdullah has been quoted making the statement quoted by PM Modi. Furthermore, an advanced search on Twitter in both English and Hindi using keywords from the PM\u2019s claim throws up references exclusively to the Faking News\u2019 article and nothing else. It is unclear why and how the prime minister quoted a six-year-old satirical piece as genuine news in the Parliament.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News, national spokesperson of National Conference (NC) Imran Nabi said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he [Omar Abdullah] has ever made this statement. It seems that this has been picked up from the satirical website Faking News. The last tweet which was made by him spoke about keeping calm.\u201d\n\nThe last tweet that went out from Abdullah\u2019s account has been embedded below. It was shared on August 4, 2019.\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi therefore quoted a satirical article in the Parliament to target former J&K CM Omar Abdullah.", "lang": "en"}
