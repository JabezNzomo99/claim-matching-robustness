And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.\"\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve previously rated an Obama claim that Romney\u2019s view on killing bin Laden was \"it's not worth moving heaven and earth.\" We found it Half True. While Romney used those words, he also explained that he wanted to see a broader focus against the \"worldwide jihadist effort,\" not just the al-Qaida leader.\n\n \n\n In this fact-check, we\u2019re asking whether Romney once said \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to strike if bin Laden was in reach.\n\n \n\n \u2018We keep our options quiet\u2019\n\n \n\n Obama approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist mastermind in his compound in Pakistan.\n\n \n\n The secret, unilateral Navy SEALS mission followed through on a 2007 Obama campaign promise: \"If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President (Pervez) Musharraf won't act, we will.\"\n\n \n\n Obama\u2019s words attracted criticism from his Democratic and Republican opponents at the time \u2014 including Romney.\n\n \n\n The Republican primary candidate told reporters in Iowa in August 2007 that Obama\u2019s comments were \"ill-timed and ill-considered.\"\n\nA Romney campaign news release in December 2007 said, \"Sen. Obama Recently Suggested Attacking Inside Pakistan Without Pakistani Approval.\"\n\n \n\n Romney didn\u2019t explicitly say that he would ask for permission to strike inside the country.\n\n \n\n Rather, he said he wanted to \"participate with other nations,\" to fight terrorism and criticized Obama for saying he would attack \"without Pakistani approval.\"\n\n \n\n And there\u2019s a bit more to the story.\n\n \n\n At the Aug. 5, 2007, Republican debate in Iowa, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Romney to explain his reaction to Obama\u2019s pledge.\n\n \n\n \"I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies,\" Romney said. \"... He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend.\"\n\n \n\n Stephanopoulos pushed for details: \"But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?\"\n\n \n\n Romney responded:\n\nStephanopoulos clarified: \"So ... what I'm hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that?\"\n\n \n\n A transcript shows former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson speaking up \u2014 but not Romney.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Obama claimed that during the 2008 campaign, Romney said, \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to take out bin Laden. The reality is somewhat more complex.\n\n \n\n Romney did express a preference for working with the Pakistanis, and he attacked Obama for saying he would strike if Musharraf wouldn\u2019t.\n\n \n\n But Romney\u2019s clearest objection was to Obama saying the United States would attack inside Pakistan without approval \u2014 not to the option itself. \"We keep our options quiet,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Obama oversimplified Romney\u2019s stance four years ago. We rate his statement Half True.", "lang": "en"}
