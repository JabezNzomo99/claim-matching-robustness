The video plays for a few seconds, then requires the viewer to share the post on their own Facebook accounts to \u201cuncover\u201d the rest of the clip.\n\nThe facts: Shaina Magdayao is alive. No legitimate news organization has announced her passing as of writing, and the actress is still very much active on her official and verified social networking account.\n\nOn October 23, the actress was seen in a photoshoot for a local fashion brand. Her makeup artist that day also posted a behind-the-scenes photo on Instagram, to which the actress commented using her verified account: \u201cThank you for today.\u201d\n\nMoreover, although the links that posted the false claims look confusingly similar to the official websites of legitimate news organizations, the videos on their websites are not authentic clips of news reports. When fully played, the videos only show a montage of Magdayao\u2019s photos captioned with texts that say she\u2019s dead, without providing proof or any other basis.\n\nIn 2017, Magdayao first disclosed that she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and said she\u2019d been taking maintenance medicines. In June 2019, she confidently said in an Instagram post: \u201cFor the first time in years \u2013 I FEEL HEALTHY.\u201d \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
