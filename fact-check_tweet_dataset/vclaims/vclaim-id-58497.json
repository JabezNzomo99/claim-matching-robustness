Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights.\n\n\"You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative,\" Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has \"always been pro-life,\" while Romney has \"been on both sides\" of that issue.\n\nPerry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade \"before he was against\" it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body.\n\nSo, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights?\n\nFor another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question.\n\nRomney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position:\n\u2022 In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.\" He added: \"I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.\"\n\u2022 In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.\"\n\nThose comments \u2014 made in public forums eight years apart \u2014 struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter.\n\nWhat about his views today?\n\nThe \"issues\" portion of his website doesn\u2019t have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Review\u2019s website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint \"pro-life\" candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers.\n\nIn the op-ed, Romney wrote: \"I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nRomney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law \"to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion\" and \"appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.\n\nWe rate Perry\u2019s claim that Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights True.", "lang": "en"}
