Back in June we reported on false claims that the UK would be forced to participate in an EU army and that this would involve conscription.\n\nThe post we\u2019re checking now claims that if the UK stays in the EU, Brits aged 16-25 will be called up to serve in an EU Army.\n\nFirstly, the UK could not be \u201cforced\u201d to participate in EU military policies even if we stay in the EU.\n\nWhether or not EU nations wish to create an \u201cEU army\u201d, and regardless of what that might actually entail, member countries effectively have a veto on laws about security and defence, so the UK would only take part if it chose to.\n\nAs there are no formal plans in place for an EU army, there is no requirement for British youths to serve in one.\n\nThe EU does have various policies for defensive and security cooperation. For example, under the Common Security and Defence Policy, EU countries can pool military funding and resources. The UK participates in military operations through this policy.\n\nThe EU has also established Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) a strategy which aims to \u201cjointly develop defence capabilities and make them available for EU military operations\u201d which the UK has chosen not to participate in.", "lang": "en"}
