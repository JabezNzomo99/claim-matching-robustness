With production and construction activities halted and left with little food and money, migrants have been making the arduous journey back home, often walking for hundreds of kilometres in the absence of proper transportation.\n\nThe railways later started Shramik Special trains and state governments started operating buses to bring migrants home. Amid this, a video of mob violence is going viral on social media with the claim that migrant labourers damaged vehicles near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\u201cLabourers attacking cars and buses near Kanpur in UP. This is the start of a civil war between the haves and the have nots. This is terrible. Hunger is bigger than Covid-19,\u201d reads the claim along with the viral minute-long video.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from Kanpur but Rajkot in Gujarat.\n\nThe video is quite viral on Facebook and Twitter. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nAt the starting of the video, we found a red board on the roadside with \u201cShapar Veraval Industrial Association\u201d written on it.\n\nWe ran a search on the Internet and found that Shapar Veraval Industrial Association (SVIA) is situated near National Highway 27 in Gujarat.\n\nOne can also see a PCR van with a Gujarat registration number starting with \u201cGJ 18\u201d at 53 seconds into the video.\n\nWe ran a search on the Internet with the keywords \u201cLabourers attacking cars and buses+Shapar Gujarat\u201d and found many media reports related to the incident which took place on May 17.\n\nAs per these reports, migrant labourers waiting for Shramik Special trains turned violent near the industrial clusters of Shapar and Veraval, adjoining Rajkot in Gujarat. They damaged more than a dozen trucks, buses, and cars, leaving five policemen and a TV reporter injured.\n\nWe also found a longer version of the video on Twitter, shot by the same man.\n\nOn the same day, in Uttar Pradesh too, hundreds of migrant labourers blocked NH-2 at Raipura Jat village in Mathura district for an hour after they were stopped from continuing their journey. Many prominent media houses had covered this news.\n\nBut the viral video is not from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh as is being claimed but Rajkot in Gujarat.", "lang": "en"}
