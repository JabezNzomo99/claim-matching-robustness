These documents are fabricated.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here , bit.ly/2YIRICo and bit.ly/2ZlENp2 .\n\nThese claims first surfaced after Clinton\u2019s health became a topic of discussion during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIn December 2012, she suffered a concussion and shortly afterward developed a blood clot. In a letter released by her doctor in July 2015, Clinton was described as being in \u201cexcellent health\u201d and \u201cfit to serve\u201d in the White House ( here ). The letter outlined her medical conditions at that time, include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.\n\nLess than two months before the election in 2106, Clinton fell ill at a 9/11 memorial event ( here ). Her doctor at the time, Lisa Bardack initially said in a statement that Clinton was experiencing a cough related to allergies, though it was later revealed to be pneumonia ( here ).\n\nThe \u201cmedical records\u201d in the claim on social media are not published on a letterhead and do not include a signature from Bardack. It appears that they were originally published on Twitter by a now-deleted account ( archive.is/fdakQ ).\n\nIn 2016, Bardack released a statement addressing the fake leaked medical records. \u201cAs Secretary Clinton's long time physician, I released a medical statement during the campaign indicating that she is in excellent health. I have recently been made aware of allegedly \u2018leaked\u2019 medical documents regarding Secretary Clinton with my name on them. These documents are false, were not written by me and are not based on any medical facts.\u201d ( here )\n\nSome iterations of the claim allege that Daniel Fleck is Clinton\u2019s physician and outline conspiracy theories relating to the death of his father. Reuters found no evidence supporting these claims.\n\nOther fact checkers have also tackled this claim and found it to be false.
