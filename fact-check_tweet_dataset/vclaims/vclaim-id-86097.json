In a nutshell: While Trump\u2019s tax cuts would generate net economic activity, the government would not reap as much revenue as it did under the previous, higher tax rates, the CBO analysis found.\n\nTenney referenced the gross national product (GNP). This is similar to the gross domestic product (GDP) but factors in only goods and services produced by U.S. residents. The GDP is broader and accounts for all goods and services produced within the country.\n\nOnly a fraction of the total $1.5 trillion in economic gains Tenney mentioned would be taxable, so it\u2019s inaccurate to say the cost of the tax cut has been offset already. Tenney\u2019s interviewers at WUTQ-FM quickly jumped on her claim and pressed her to explain. In the end, she shifted somewhat, from saying the tax cuts had paid for themselves in six months to saying \u201cin the end, the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we get into the end of the year, and you start seeing what is happening as people are seeing their tax cuts realized when they start paying on an annualized basis for their tax cuts, going into next year, I think you\u2019re going to see the so-called deficit,\u201d Tenney said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see in the end, the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves, as predicted even by some of the government measures.\u201d\n\nTenney\u2019s campaign manager, Raychel Renna, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article about a one-page analysis of the tax plan written by the Treasury Department. Using a GDP growth forecast of 2.9 percent over the next decade, administration officials estimated $1.8 trillion in added tax revenue, which would more than offset the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax cuts.\n\nBut other analysts say that\u2019s optimistic and predict growth will be closer to 2.2 percent, as the New York Times reported. After its most recent meeting, on June 13, the Federal Open Market Committee said it expected 2.8 percent GDP growth in 2018, 2.4 percent in 2019, 2 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in the longer run. The FOMC is the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm.\n\n\u201cThe economy is growing, jobs are being created and the federal government is collecting record tax revenue,\u201d Renna said. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that the CBO projection doesn\u2019t always get it right. One notable example is that their projections about Obamacare enrollment were significantly off the mark.\u201d (The CBO overestimated how many people would buy insurance on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, but its overarching estimate of how many people would gain insurance coverage was largely on target, as we\u2019ve reported.)\n\nRenna also cited a GDP growth forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is predicting 3.9 percent GDP growth for the second quarter of 2018. The Atlanta Fed cautions that this is an unofficial forecast (updated every few days). In any case, that covers only one quarter, but there are 39 other quarters to consider during the 10-year time frame for analyzing the cost of Trump\u2019s tax cuts.\n\nThe congresswoman seems to have gotten her wires crossed, confusing total economic growth with tax revenue collections. Her revised claim that Trump\u2019s tax cuts are on a 10-year path to pay for themselves is also extremely dicey, so we award Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
