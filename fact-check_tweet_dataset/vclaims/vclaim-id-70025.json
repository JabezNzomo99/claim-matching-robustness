The former President had rejected Afzal Guru\u2019s mercy plea, leading to his hanging.\n\nThe tweet, with an image of Mukherjee, says, \u201cThe man who rejected martyr Afzal Guru\u2019s petition is dead. Afzal Guru is at peace today!\u201d\n\nMultiple Facebook and Twitter users have shared the screenshot, condemning Rana Ayyub. Some of these Twitter accounts are even followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other Union ministers.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the screenshot is photoshopped. Rana Ayyub has made no such tweet linking Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s death to Afzal Guru\u2019s hanging.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here, here. The post is also viral on Facebook.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 1, Rana Ayyub tweeted the viral screenshot and complained against it to Twitter.\n\nAFWA found that the viral image is indeed photoshopped, which can be identified easily on two counts. As we have shown below, the timestamp, seen beside every tweet, is missing in this image. Secondly, the editing and overlaying of Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s picture is also evident.\n\nWe searched through Rana Ayyub\u2019s original Twitter account using \u201cSpoonbill\u201d and found that she has not changed or removed anything after July 28 from her account. We also found that she has not tweeted anything related to Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s death since August 31.\n\nChecking her Twitter account, we found that Rana Ayyub has always been a staunch critic of Afzal Guru\u2019s conviction and hanging.\n\nBut the viral screenshot of a tweet in Rana Ayyub\u2019s name where she\u2019s saying that Afzal Guru is at peace after Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s death is photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
