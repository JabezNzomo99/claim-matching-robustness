One user posting in a public group accompanied her link with the caption: \u201cnot sure how I feel about this. What if a flaming lib is in charge next time this happens? who goes to jail then the conservatives?\u201d ( here ). Another user posting in a public group wrote \u201cTake that ya rotten Commies!\u201d ( here ).\n\nIn another public group, a post sharing the link with no text ( here ) prompted comments including \u201cThank you and about time! These animals need to be dealt with and peace needs to be restored!\u201d Comments on another post ( here ) include \u201cAnd so it should it\u2019s time for America to put the rioters in there (sic) place a peaceful protest does not include burning down buildings and damaging peoples property\u201d and \u201cIts about time. Now get out and do it.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on July 22 that federal law enforcement agents would be dispatched to cities facing challenges with violent crime, including Chicago, Illinois and Albuquerque, New Mexico ( here ). Speaking at the White House, Trump blamed the increases in violence on left-leaning movements to \u201cdismantle and dissolve\u201d local police departments in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. Oregon\u2019s governor said on Wednesday that federal tactical police had agreed to withdraw from the city of Portland, but U..S. officials said agents would stay until conditions improved after weeks of clashes with protesters there (here ).\n\nSome legal experts have said the president\u2019s sending of federal agents to major cities controlled by Democrats may be difficult to defend in court ( here ). Legal experts told Reuters that Trump can deploy federal agents to enforce federal laws, but lacks carte blanche.\n\nAs reported here by The Conversation on July 24, there are currently four lawsuits challenging the presence of federal agents in Portland. These lawsuits have not yet made it to the U.S. Supreme Court, however.\n\nSatire. The claim that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional for the president to \u201cto take control of any rioting city in America\u201d originated on a satirical website but has been understood as real by many Facebook users.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
