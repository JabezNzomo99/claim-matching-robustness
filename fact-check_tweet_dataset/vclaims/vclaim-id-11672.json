So it\u2019s more an effect of the government\u2019s policies over a few years.\n\nWe asked the Treasury where the data comes from and they said it wasn\u2019t all in the public domain, because of confidentiality issues surrounding the data on taxpayers, and neither were their calculations.\n\nIt\u2019s inappropriate for Ministers to use figures that aren\u2019t in the public domain, so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from and how they\u2019re calculated. If it\u2019s not possible to publish the figures then Ministers shouldn\u2019t use them.\n\nAs a result we can\u2019t confirm the exact figure, but it does seem to be in the right ballpark.\n\nWho benefits from income tax changes?\n\nIn 2015/16 the personal allowance (the income you don\u2019t pay tax on) was \u00a310,600. If that figure had risen in line with inflation, the change in how much things cost over time, it would stand at around \u00a311,520 in 2019/20. The government has actually increased it to \u00a312,500 for the next financial year. So everyone who gets a personal allowance would benefit from income tax changes.\n\nSome very high earners don\u2019t get a personal allowance, but they will still benefit from other income tax changes. That\u2019s because the higher rate threshold (the level above which you pay 40% income tax rather than 20% income tax) is also being increased by the government to \u00a350,000 in April 2019. Back in 2015/16 the higher rate threshold was \u00a342,385\u2014if it had risen in line with inflation it would stand at around \u00a346,220.\n\nWhile the personal allowance is offset by the UK government, individual income tax bands in Scotland are set by the Scottish government (in this case the higher rate threshold).So UK government policy isn\u2019t responsible for any benefits to those without a personal allowance and paying the higher rate of tax in Scotland.\n\nWhat all this means is that almost everyone earning above \u00a311,520 in 2019/20 will be paying less income tax in real terms than they would have, had the UK government kept income tax changes in line with inflation.\n\nSo how many people would we expect to be in this category?\n\nBecause some of the information isn\u2019t publicly available, we can\u2019t forecast this perfectly. As a starting point, we can assume that\u2019s almost everyone who pays income tax at the moment (people earning over \u00a311,850) will benefit\u2014that\u2019s about 31 million people.\n\nPeople earning between \u00a311,520 and \u00a311,850 would also benefit. That\u2019s the group who would have ended up paying income tax if the government hadn\u2019t increased the personal allowance above the level of inflation. We don\u2019t have figures on how many people this equates to, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume it\u2019s enough to push that 31 million figure up to 32 million.\n\nThe claim doesn\u2019t tell you how much people are saving\n\nSaying how many people benefit from income tax changes doesn\u2019t give you any sense of how significant these changes have been. In theory, if the government increased the personal allowance by \u00a31 tomorrow it would be reducing income tax for around 30 million people, though would only deliver a benefit of 20 pence each.\n\nBetween 2015/16 and 2019/20 the personal allowance is forecast to have increased by around \u00a3980 in real terms. That means that basic rate taxpayers (that\u2019s most people) won\u2019t have to pay 20% income tax on \u00a3980 of their income, that would equate to a reduction in the amount of tax paid to around \u00a3200.\n\nWhat about other taxes?\n\nIncome tax is only one of the taxes people pay\u2014other tax and benefit changes have affected some peoples\u2019 earnings to a greater extent in recent years.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies looked at the impact of tax and benefit reforms between May 2015 and May 2017 and found that benefit reductions somewhat offset tax reduction for the average household.\n\nIn total tax and benefit reforms between May 2015 and June 2017 benefited households by \u00a3111 on average per year. But this wasn\u2019t the experience of all household types: the benefit was primarily felt by richer households, while poorer households lost out on balance.\n\n We\u2019ve written more about tax and benefit changes since 2010 here.", "lang": "en"}
