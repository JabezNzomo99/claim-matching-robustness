This claim is false; these photos were taken in 2011 and show the guru receiving treatment at a hospital after fasting for nine days.\n\nThe photos were published here on Facebook on March 7, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cRamdev is admitted in AIIMS hospital, doctors informed that he had an overdose of cow urine to ward off Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nAIIMS is an acronym for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in Delhi.\n\nOn several occasions, Ramdev has promoted the use of cow urine for its health benefits. According to this March 14, 2020 India TV report, Ramdev says cow urine is \u201ceffective in [treating] blood pressure, constipation and even cancer\u201d.\n\nSince the novel coronavirus outbreak, these assertions have gained increased traction. On March 14, 2020, for instance, dozens of Hindu activists held a \u201ccow urine party\u201d in the Indian capital to protect themselves from the new coronavirus. Here is an AFP report on the event.\n\nThe photos of Ramdev were also shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here, here and here and on Twitter here and here.\n\nHowever, the claims are false.\n\nA reverse image search found the photos have circulated online since at least June 2011 in local media reports on a nine-day hunger strike that Ramdev undertook to protest corruption.\n\nThe first photo was published in this report published on June 12, 2011 by India Today, an English-language Indian news magazine. The report is headlined \u201cBaba Ramdev ends fast against black money\u201d.\n\nThe photo's caption reads: \u201cBaba Ramdev just after breaking his fast in a Dehradun hospital on Sunday, June 12, 2011\u201d.\n\nThe second photo was found in this report by the Indian newspaper The Hindu Business Line, titled \u201cRamdev\u2019s condition stable, to be discharged tomorrow\u201d. The article was published on June 13, 2011.\n\nThe report reads, in part: \u201cThe condition of yoga guru Ramdev is stable and he will be discharged tomorrow provided all his parameters record improvement, doctors attending on him said today.\n\n\u201cRamdev had given up his nine-day fast yesterday after being persuaded by Sri Sri Ravishankar and other spiritual leaders. He had been on a hunger strike since June 4 demanding a tougher anti-corruption law and seeking a return of black money stashed away abroad.\u201d\n\nBelow is a comparison the photos in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the photos published by the India Today and The Hindu (R):\n\nAdditionally, Tijarawala SK, Ramdev\u2019s spokesperson, took to Twitter on March 5, 2020 to deny the false claims, saying Ramdev is \u201ccompletely healthy\u201d.\n\nThe tweet translates to English as: \u201cThere is no truth in this, Ramdev is completely healthy. People have heard him speaking on various news channels in the past couple of days talking about coronavirus. Today he is in Bangalore.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019 and has since spread exponentially worldwide. As of March 18, 2020, the viral disease has killed almost 8,000 people and infected close to 200,000, according to this AFP report.", "lang": "en"}
