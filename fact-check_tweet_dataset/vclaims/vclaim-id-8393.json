In 2018/19 it is budgeted to be over \u00a313.1 billion. That\u2019s a difference of about \u00a34 billion, but these figures don\u2019t account for projected inflation over that time.\n\nIf you factor that in then the difference is half that at \u00a32 billion.\n\nThat spending hasn\u2019t happened yet. These figures are projections for future spending. Spending for this year suggests the increase since 2006/07 is slightly less than \u00a32 billion so far.\n\nHealth is a devolved area in Scotland, and the Scottish government decides exactly how much money is going to go into the NHS budget each year.\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s budget is made up of three components: money it receives through the block grant from the UK government, money raised through taxes in Scotland (and collected by the Scottish government directly), and money raised through borrowing.", "lang": "en"}
