He said the commission is working on another salary structure that would dock the lawmakers pay.\n\n\"We are yet to conclude on the downward review of the remuneration package for political and public office holders, though it started in 2015.\"\n\nof legislator pay by the\n\nthe research and advisory body of Nigeria\u2019s parliament, reflects the 2007 remuneration structure.\n\nSenators earn an annual basic salary of N2,026,400 (US$6,630 at the current official exchange rate), while that of a house of representatives member is N1,985,212 (US$6,495). But allowances can swell the basic salary more than six-fold - to N12,902,360 (US$42,212) a year for a senator and N9,525,985 (US$31,160) for a member of the lower house.\n\nThe legislators further qualify for additional benefits paid every four years. These are accommodation, car loans, furniture allowances and a send-off amount at the end of their term.\n\nCalculated annually, these extra benefits can take the annual pay of a senator to US$62,000 and US$50,964 in the case of a house of representatives member.\n\nSamuel Atiku, the head of research at public finance watchdog\n\n, told Africa Check that due to a lack of transparency in parliament\u2019s budget process the total annual pay may be even higher than what is publicly shared.\n\nThe national assembly enjoys wide financial autonomy, which has created conditions for secrecy about their pay.

Still, campaign groups say parliament needs to be much more transparent about legislators\u2019 pay and plug loopholes, given that its budget is bigger than that of some states.", "lang": "en"}
