After being pointed out that the video was misleading, Kishwar retweeted another video claiming that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 chants were made at another Congress event. The tweet by @Offenssiv that was retweeted by Kishwar is now deleted, but it\u2019s archived version can be accessed here and its screen recording can be viewed here.\n\nBased on the video, Kishwar appealed to Jaipur Police to take action.\n\nSeveral other individuals circulated the same video with identical claims.\n\nIronically, the video shared by Kishwar to defend her earlier misleading video was also misleading.\n\nThe above video has been doing rounds on social media since before the start of the recent assembly elections. It has already been debunked by multiple media outlets, including BBC Hindi, AFP,The Times of Indiaand India Today.\n\nIn one watches the video carefully, a banner placed on the stage reads \u2013 \u2018Nagar Congress Committee Rajsamand\u2019, and the crowd of Congress workers actually chants \u2013 \u201cMai lai lalkar hai, hamaki sau ke paar hai. Bhati Saab Zindabad (We have accepted the challenge. This time we will score more than 100. Long live Bhati Saab).\u201d\n\nNarayan Singh Bhati was the Congress candidate from Rajsmand, Rajasthan. Alt News has broken down that part of the video where the crowd chanted his name. When heard multiple times over, \u201cBhati Saab Zindabad\u201d is audible more clearly.\n\nMadhu Kishwar has been found circulating misinformation several times in the past (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). She was also pulled up by J&K police for sharing fake news. Despite the multiple attempts to point out the truth, Kishwar continues to circulate disinformation through her Twitter account.", "lang": "en"}
