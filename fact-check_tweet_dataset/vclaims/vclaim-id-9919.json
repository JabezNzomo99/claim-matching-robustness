I\u2019m so proud of it. We started. We started. We have $1.6 billion, and we\u2019ve already started.\u201d Then, in front of the leaders of three Baltic nations April 3, he said it again.\n\nThe article said that the Border Patrol had identified the project as a priority in 2009, and that funding for bollard fencing \u2014 hollow steel beams spaced several inches apart \u2014 had been appropriated in 2017. (If you look closely at Trump\u2019s photos, they show 30-foot-high fencing, not a wall.)\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to get out in front of it and let everybody know that this is a local tactical infrastructure project that was planned for quite some time,\u201d David Kim, assistant chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol\u2019s El Centro sector, told reporters.\n\nIndeed, when Trump ran for president, he described his vision of the wall: It would be 1,000 miles long, made of precast concrete slabs, rising 35 to 40 feet in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a high wall, it\u2019s going to be beautiful,\u201d he insisted in 2016, saying it would be \u201cso easy\u201d to get Mexico to fund it.\n\nOnly designs from before May 2017, such as \u201ccurrently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety,\u201d can be used. Moreover, the bill identified that the money for the barriers \u2014 about $1.3 billion \u2014 could be used only for items listed as \u201cprimary pedestrian levee fencing,\u201d \u201cprimary pedestrian fencing\u201d and \u201csecondary fencing.\u201d About $250 million is for secondary fencing, meaning it just backs up other fencing.\n\nIn a March 30 briefing for reporters, Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner Ronald D. Vitiello acknowledged that the agency faced \u201crestrictions on this appropriation \u2026 it does not fully fund our needs in the most critical locations.\u201d He said that the prototypes viewed by Trump would be used to \u201chelp us inform a new design standard.\u201d\n\nThe closest thing to a wall would be the levee fencing, which is a concrete levee topped by bollard fencing. The bill allows for 25 miles in the Rio Grande Valley. But the bill also bars any spending for a border barrier in the 2,088-acre Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, one of the nation\u2019s top birdwatching sites, with more than 400 species of birds. The administration had chosen the Santa Ana refuge as the first site for a border wall segment because it is owned by the federal government, avoiding legal entanglement with property owners, according to the Texas Observer.\n\nAs far as we can tell, from review of local news articles, only 33 miles of new barrier \u2014 fencing on top of an existing levee in Hidalgo County, Tex. and a fence in Starr County, Tex. \u2014 would be funded under the 2018 bill. The rest of the money appears to be for replacing existing fencing or barriers \u2014 with fencing.\n\nBut Vitiello insisted that the roughly 100 miles of fencing that was funded through 2017 and 2018 appropriations was \u201call new,\u201d because it will replace smaller, less-effective structures, such as barriers made of Vietnam War-era helicopter landing mats. That\u2019s what is happening in Calexico, where there is about two miles of landing-mat fencing. Officials said one problem with the landing-mat fencing is that agents could not see through to the other side.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on April 4, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said: \u201cIf there\u2019s a wall before that needs to be replaced, it\u2019s being replaced by a new wall. So this is the Trump border wall.\u201d Replacing a \u201ccurrent wall\u201d would count as a \u201cnew wall,\u201d she said.\n\nThe White House failed miserably to achieve its objectives on funding for a border wall, receiving relative peanuts. It sought $25 billion but ended up with 5 percent of that. Moreover, the money came with strings attached so that it could be used only for fencing, not the \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cbeautiful wall\u201d promised by Trump.", "lang": "en"}
