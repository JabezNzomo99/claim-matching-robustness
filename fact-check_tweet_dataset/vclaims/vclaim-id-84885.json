Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had claimed that before the housing bubble burst in 2008, Trump had hoped to profit from a downturn in home prices because of a real estate boom. Trump responded by calling her a hypocrite, accusing her of making a \u201cquick killing\u201d in the real estate market by buying foreclosed housing. We took a deep dive, and found his claim was greatly exaggerated.\n\n2. Trump campaign\u2019s claim that State Department gave $55.2 million to Laureate Education after hiring Bill Clinton\n\nIn an email sent by his campaign and a speech attacking Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, Trump accused her of treating the State Department as her \u201cpersonal hedge fund.\u201d The campaign alleged that Clinton\u2019s State Department gave $55.2 million in grants to Laureate Education, after the company hired Bill Clinton for $16.5 million as honorary chancellor. But this talking point conflated two organizations that are independent of each other, and was inaccurate.\n\nTrump blasted U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, presiding over two of three lawsuits against Trump University, saying Curiel was biased and gave \u201cvery unfair rulings.\u201d Trump said the case \u201cshould have ended years ago on summary judgment,\u201d but that Curiel was being \u201cvery unfair\u201d by letting it continue. But Curiel made a straightforward legal judgment, and didn\u2019t have much of a choice than to let the case go forward to a jury. Trump\u2019s defense attorney even said Curiel was doing his job.\n\nTrump surrogate Michael Cohen made a claim that was picked up by Diamond and Silk, a pro-Trump duo with a big Twitter following. We dug around to see if any facts supported it, but found all the makings of a mishmash talking point stringing together different information relating to Haiti recovery efforts \u2014 such as a message from the last player in a game of \u201cTelephone.\u201d\n\nReaders have asked for fact checks of some of the gun rhetoric used by Democrats in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando. In one case, we have already delved into this material, but other claims are new. So, let\u2019s take a look, starting with Murphy\u2019s statement.", "lang": "en"}
