Yet, he won the Noble [sic] peace prize. What a joke!\"\n\nThis screenshot appeared online shortly after Trump gave a speech during a rally in Toledo, Ohio on January 9 in which he took credit for Abiy Ahmed's Nobel prize. He told the crowd: \"I made a deal, I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country.\" (See video below.)\n\nThe Nobel committee honored Abiy -- Africa\u2019s youngest leader at 43 -- for progress in the months after he took power in April 2018, including formally ending a stalemate with Eritrea and pushing to introduce democratic elections in a country long ruled by authoritarian governments.\n\nA day after Trump\u2019s remarks at the Toledo rally, the House Foreign Affairs Committee\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted that Trump was \u201cconfused\u201d, and said that \u201cAbiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Prize for his efforts to bring peace to the Horn of Africa, not stalled negotiations about a new dam on the Nile\u201d. (See screenshot below.)\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s complaints about missing out on the Nobel Peace Prize, Abiy Ahmed responded on a televised speech saying, \u201cIf Trump wants to complain, he should go to Oslo, not Ethiopia\u201d. (Video below.)\n\nAFP ran an advanced search on Twitter and found no trace of the purported Trump tweet on the US president\u2019s official account. We also searched keywords from the purported tweet in The Trump Archive, a tool that saves all tweets from Trump\u2019s official account -- even ones that have been deleted.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot above, Trump has only written one tweet about Ethiopia in the past -- and it was not the tweet from the screenshot.\n\nAFP has previously debunked several fake Trump tweets relating to Ethiopia.
