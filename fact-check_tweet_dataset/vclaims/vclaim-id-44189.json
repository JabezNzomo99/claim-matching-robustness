COVID-19 testing is likewise voluntary and also does not carry a penalty for refusing to participate, according to a Washington State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nThe image featured a screen grab of a May 13 tweet from the Lynnwood Times that contained a link to an article titled \u201cGovernor Inslee lays out statewide contact tracing plan for COVID-19.\u201d The tweet read, \u201cFor those individuals that refuse to cooperate with contact tracers and/or refuse testing, will not be allowed to leave their homes to purchase basic necessities such as groceries and/or prescriptions.\u201d\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced plans May 12 to implement a statewide contact tracing program to track the spread of COVID-19. Contact tracing is the process of public health officials making contact with infected individuals, identifying other people who have been exposed and making contact with those individuals to curb the spread of an infectious disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmy Reynolds, communications director for the Washington State Department of Health, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that \u201cparticipation in contact tracing is voluntary.\u201d The Washington State Department of Health website also notes that the program is voluntary and that \u201cthere is no penalty for declining an interview\u201d with contact tracers.\n\nThe Lynnwood Times updated its article May 20 to clarify that \u201cindividuals that refuse testing\u201d may be subject to such restriction, but that claim doesn\u2019t hold up either. Reynolds confirmed to the DCNF that there is no penalty for refusing COVID-19 testing and that the state \u201cis not aware of any authority that would require someone to be tested for COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave their homes, as are people who refuse a test after they\u2019ve been exposed. People who have COVID symptoms are also allowed to leave their homes,\u201d Reynolds said in an email. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s not what we want them to do. We urge people to stay home and away from others in these instances, because it\u2019s the best way to prevent the spread of disease.\u201d\n\nThe confusion appears to stem from the controversy surrounding what happens when an infected or exposed individual refuses to self-isolate.

This authority is rarely used as a last resort when someone is intentionally putting others at risk.\u201d\n\nReynolds noted that a \u201cvast majority of people\u201d are willing to stay home voluntarily when asked \u201cbecause they care about the wellbeing of others in their communities.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
