Each year they try to prevent some money being lost before it happens, recoup some of the money they do lose, and through those actions try to prevent losses in future years. The money they estimate they have secured through all these activities is called their \u201ccompliance yield\u201d.\n\nYou get a figure of around \u00a3160 billion by adding up HMRC\u2019s total compliance yield for every year since 2010/11\u2014roughly the first full year of the coalition government.\n\nThose figures\u2014at least the ones since 2011/12\u2014are provided in a chart in HMRC\u2019s annual report. The 2010/11 figures are in an older report, and are known to be of worse quality.\n\nThis chart, though, isn\u2019t telling you the whole story.\n\nApart from the \u2018new methodology\u2019 2016/17 figure, the total amount of money being shown in each year isn\u2019t what HMRC thinks it actually made in extra revenue for those years. It\u2019s including the money HMRC thinks it will make in future years, up to 2021/22.\n\nThat\u2019s because part of what HMRC estimates it has secured each year is called \u201cfuture revenue benefit\u201d, which is included in the chart. This is an estimate of the future benefits of the compliance work already undertaken, spread out over about five years.\n\nSo when HMRC and the Prime Minister say \u00a3160 billion has been \u201csecured\u201d, they\u2019re actually talking about expected revenue for the future as well, not just what\u2019s actually been realised so far.\n\nHMRC sets out separately how much money it thinks was actually secured in these \u2018future revenues\u2019 each year since 2011/12.\n\nThat means that the actual amount secured so far, excluding the expected benefits to come, amounts to just under \u00a3150 billion, with the rest expected over the next five years, as a result of action that\u2019s already been taken.\n\nSome of the other money isn\u2019t certain either\n\nMeasuring the effect of the government\u2019s tax compliance activities isn\u2019t straightforward. HMRC describes it as \u201ca complex hybrid of measures, calculated in different ways and covering different time periods, which are designed to reflect the breadth of HMRC\u2019s compliance activities.\u201d\n\nThe independent National Audit Office is satisfied that \u201cHMRC has robust processes in place for estimating and reporting the value of the yield that it has generated through its compliance activities\u201d, but notes there is still uncertainty in the estimates.\n\nThe largest part of the compliance yield each year is called \u201ccash expected\u201d, which is what HMRC estimates it is likely to recoup in lost revenues that year. It\u2019s adjusted to take into account that it won\u2019t be able to collect every sum it identifies.\n\nA large sum is also is made from preventing losses before they happen. This is where HMRC estimates its own actions have prevented losses that could otherwise have occurred, like stopping fraudulent repayment claims, according to HMRC.\n\nYou\u2019ll often also read about governments trying to close \u201ctax loop holes\u201d by introducing new laws or putting tighter systems in place. These make up a smaller part of the money that\u2019s recouped in the HMRC figures\u2014about \u00a33 billion last year.", "lang": "en"}
