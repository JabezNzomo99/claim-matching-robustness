Instead, it belonged to a Minnesota man, as FactCheck.org has confirmed.\n\nThat falsehood was widely distributed by conservative websites this week before the user on the social website debunked it. Popular websites like the Gateway Pundit and Infowars have since acknowledged the mistaken identity: The former removed the claims that were in its original story, and the latter deleted its story altogether. The Gateway Pundit also acknowledged in an \u201cupdate\u201d: \u201cAn anonymous Reddit user was mis-identified in an earlier post.\u201d\n\nOn other websites, though, the deception has lingered.\n\n\u201cThe Jacksonville Shooter Hated Trump,\u201d conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh\u2019s website declared in a Aug. 27 post, citing the Gateway Pundit\u2019s story on the Reddit comment.\n\n\u201cJACKSONVILLE SHOOTER WAS ANTI-TRUMP RESISTANCE WARRIOR,\u201d reads another headline from the same day on davidharrisjr.com, whose story logged thousands of Facebook engagements. Both of those stories were still posted on the websites on Aug. 30.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if David Katz wore a mask and participated in violent riots, but we do know he was part of the Trump resistance, who called Trump supporters \u2018Trumptards\u2019 and \u2018mentally ill,'\u201d the davidharrisjr.com article reads.\n\nThe post republished the Gateway Pundit\u2019s story, which cited a tweet from conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich that referenced the Reddit account\u2019s remark that used the term \u201ctrumptards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou trumptards seriously can never stop amazing everyone with how mentally challenged you guys are,\u201d the user commented in a thread on a sub-Reddit dedicated to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Reddit account\u2019s username \u2014 \u201cravenchamps\u201d \u2014 is similar to a username that Katz reportedly used in video gaming \u2014 \u201cravens2012champs.\u201d But the actual owner of the Reddit account made clear that he was not Katz when he posted after Katz\u2019s death.\n\nThat user, whose first name is Pavel, spoke to FactCheck.org by phone after corresponding through Reddit, and he confirmed the misidentification. The 23-year-old from Minnesota requested his last name be withheld for privacy.\n\nPavel said he logged on to the website the night after the shooting and noticed comments claiming his account belonged to Katz. \u201cI go online and look and see and there\u2019s a couple harassing ones, hoping that I was dead and rotting in hell,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe posted his comment debunking the theory to a sub-Reddit called \u201cAsk Me Anything,\u201d or AMA.\n\n\u201cEven after this AMA, I still get a few messages from people claiming I\u2019m the guy\u2019s mom,\u201d or someone else covering it up, he said.\n\nPavel said he typically uses Reddit for football news (he\u2019s indeed a Baltimore Ravens fan), world news and to follow other sub-Reddits out of hobby. He doesn\u2019t post about politics too often, he said.\n\n\u201cI make fun of Republicans and Democrats, they all have their issues,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Pavel applauded the fact that some users did point out that a photo he once uploaded of his car showed Minnesota plates (which didn\u2019t comport with the fact that Katz lived in Baltimore, Maryland), the whole episode left him realizing how susceptible some are to misinformation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of idiots out there on the internet that don\u2019t fact check anything,\u201d he said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nPavel (Last name withheld). \u201cRavenchamps\u201d Reddit user.
