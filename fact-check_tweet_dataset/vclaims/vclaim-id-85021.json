{"title": "IDENTIFIED: Admin of the FB page that called for violence against 100+ inter-faith couples", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2018-02-05T14:29:57+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85021", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/identified-admin-fb-page-called-violence-100-inter-faith-couples/", "vclaim": "On February 4, 2018, Alt News published an article that shockingly revealed how a list of more than 100 couples who had entered into inter-religious union were being targeted on social media and a page called \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d was openly calling for violence against these couples by putting out links to their Facebook profiles as a list in the public domain.\n\nAlt News has identified the perpetrator of these threats. The Facebook page by the name \u2018Hindutva Vaarta\u2018 had urged social media members to track and hunt down Muslim men who are in a relationship with Hindu women. A person called Satish Mylavarapu admitted to being the admin of the page.\n\nMylavarapu has been rather brazen on social media, openly posting threats and inciting violence against members of a particular community. His viciousness can be judged by the fact that he openly pays tributes to Nathuram Godse and claims that Godse saved the country. In the following tweet, along with a picture of Nathuram Godse, Mylavarapu writes, \u201cRaghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Desh Bachcha Gaye Nathuram\u201d.\n\nMany of Mylavarapu\u2019s tweets call for genocide against ethnic communities and religious minorities.\n\nIn the following tweet, he urges members of the Sikh Community (Khalsa) to crush Islam.\n\nHis bigotry did not even spare Ankit Saxena who was killed by the family members of the Muslim woman he was in love with, justifying his murder and claiming that it is the wicked Indian constitution that led to his death, and not Islam.\n\nAfter Alt News\u2019 story on the call for violence against inter-faith couples led to a huge uproar, the FB page \u2018Hindutva Vaarta\u2019 was suspended. Mylavarapu however was nonplussed about the fact that his page was taken off Facebook, resolving to bide his time.\n\nThis nonchalance on the part of those who are openly issuing violent threats in the public domain is a serious cause for concern. Such threats are a direct affront to the authority of the state which is expected to crack down with a heavy hand on those who challenge its monopoly over the legitimate use of force. Moreover, these calls for \u2018tracking and hunting down\u2019 Muslim boys is not only blatantly communal but calls upon ordinary citizens to adopt violent tactics, openly fuelling communal tension and conflict. Alt News calls for strict action to be initiated against the admin of the page.", "lang": "en"}
