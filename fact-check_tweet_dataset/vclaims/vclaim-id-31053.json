The UK paid \u00a38.9 billion into the EU budget, once you subtract what it got back in rebate, and in terms of EU spending on the UK public sector.\n\nThat works out at 37p per person per day.\n\n\u201cCost spent on Brexit since 2016: 91p per person per day\u201d\n\n91p per person per day assumes that the cost of Brexit has been around \u00a366 billion in the three years since 2016. This might have been taken from a report by the financial services company Standard and Poor\u2019s, which estimated the same cost in the two and a half years since the 2016 referendum. That\u2019s a slightly different time period, but it doesn\u2019t make a big difference to the numbers.\n\nThe graphic misrepresents what Standard and Poor\u2019s found. It didn\u2019t say \u00a366 billion had been \u201cspent\u201d on Brexit (presumably by the government); it estimated that Brexit had cost the UK economy \u00a366 billion in terms of lost GDP growth. This doesn\u2019t mean the economy got \u00a366 billion smaller\u2014it means that UK GDP would have grown by \u00a366 billion more had the UK not voted to leave, according to this estimate.\n\nWe can\u2019t say for certain that \u00a366 billion of growth has been lost. It\u2019s an estimate based on economic modelling, which depends on making a lot of assumptions about things nobody knows for certain. We\u2019ve written more about the caution you need to take when interpreting models.\n\nThe investment bank Goldman Sachs made a very similar estimate about the impact of the Brexit vote on UK economic growth.\n\nIn January 2019 we found that the Treasury had allocated \u00a34.2 billion towards government departments for Brexit preparations since 2016. This is not all the money that the government plans to spend on Brexit\u2014as some departments\u2019 pre-existing budgets will be used for Brexit preparation too.\n\n\u201cEstimated cost of Brexit: \u00a34.15 per person per day\u201d\n\nThe above cost works out at around \u00a3100 billion per year, meaning it may well come from analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), an independent social research institute.\n\nIn November 2018, NIESR estimated what would happen to UK GDP in a number of Brexit scenarios. The \u00a3100 billion figure relates to a scenario where the UK leaves the EU with Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, and then signs a free trade deal compatible with that agreement.\n\nNIESR estimated that, by 2030, UK GDP would be 3.9% lower (\u00a3100 billion lower, in 2016 prices) than if we remained in the EU.\n\nNIESR\u2019s estimate is roughly in line with the models of a number of other researchers. But it\u2019s not fair to say, based on NIESR\u2019s research, that Brexit is estimated to cost every person \u00a34.15 a day. There are three key reasons why.\n\nFirstly, the \u00a34.15 per day figure in the graphic is presumably based on an estimate that UK GDP would be \u00a3100 billion smaller in 2030, compared to if we remained. The graphic seems to assume this change happens over one year, whereas it would actually be after 11-12 years.\n\nSecondly, NIESR\u2019s estimate was based on the UK leaving with Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in March 2019. This didn\u2019t happen, and it\u2019s by no means certain that we will leave with that withdrawal agreement.\n\nThirdly, and most fundamentally, NIESR\u2019s modelling is a hypothetical forecast for what might happen in the future. As NIESR says: \u201cThe estimates\u2026 are themselves uncertain as there is no historical precedent of a country leaving a major trading block such as the EU\u201d.\n\nThis uncertainty means the research should not be used to accurately predict the size of the economy in 2030, or to translate the \u201ccost\u201d of Brexit into a definitive cash sum. Instead, models like this should be used to give a general sense of the expected direction of the economy over time in different scenarios.\n\nIt uses a \u201cremain\u201d scenario as a baseline, and then compares how much \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d it expects GDP to be in other alternative scenarios. This gives us a relative sense of how the UK economy might perform in each case.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that the \u201cremain\u201d scenario is also a hypothetical, and all are vulnerable to unexpected events. Things like global economic crises can arrive unexpectedly, meaning we can\u2019t definitively say what the economy will look like a decade from now in any scenario.\n\nMost models say that remaining in the EU is likely to provide stronger GDP over growth over time than any Brexit scenario. But they can\u2019t predict the exact cost of Brexit to every man, woman and child in the UK.\n\n\u201cEstimated cost of No Deal Brexit: \u00a35.81 per person per day\u201d\n\nThe above cost works out at around \u00a3140 billion per year, so it seems to be based on NIESR\u2019s estimate for what would happen to GDP if we left the EU with an \u201corderly no deal\u201d. It estimates that GDP would grow by 5.5% (\u00a3140 billion) less than in its \u201cremain\u201d scenario.\n\nFor the same reasons as above, this can\u2019t be translated into the \u201ccost\u201d of a no deal Brexit to every single person in the UK.\n\n\u201cNigel Farage\u2019s earnings from TV and radio since 2016: \u00a3541.10 per day\u201d\n\nThis is probably based on Transparency International\u2019s analysis of MEP\u2019s declarations of outside interests. It found that Nigel Farage earned income of between \u20ac590,048 and \u20ac790,000, from activities outside of his work as an MEP, between July 2014 and July 2018. It reports his \u201cactivities\u201d as \u201cbroadcast contracts\u201d, although it\u2019s unclear if every last cent was earned through media activities.\n\nThe upper estimate of \u20ac790,000 across four years works out at an average \u20ac541.10 per day.\n\nBut there are a few of problems with the post\u2019s presentation. Firstly, it reports the earnings in pounds, when it\u2019s actually in euros. At the time of reporting, Mr Farage\u2019s earnings were estimated to be worth up to \u00a3700,000 across four years from 2014, which works out at \u00a3479.50 per day.\n\nSecondly, these were Mr Farage\u2019s earnings for a four year period beginning in July 2014, rather than from 2016 as the graphic says.\n\nThirdly, the calculation uses the upper estimate made by Transparency International. The group reported a range because MEPs report their financial interest in ranges (e.g. \u20ac1.001\u2014\u20ac5.000), so it can\u2019t be known exactly how much Mr Farage earned.\n\nMr Farage\u2019s income could have been even higher than \u20ac790,000 though, because the exact value of earnings above \u20ac10,000 did not have to be specified until December 2016. Transparency International assumed all such earnings were exactly \u20ac10,000. Mr Farage had the sixth-highest earnings from outside income of all MEPs, according to Transparency International\u2019s data.", "lang": "en"}
