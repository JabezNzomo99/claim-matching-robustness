{"title": "The cost of public inquiries", "subtitle": "Figures cited on BBC Question Time for the cost of the Chilcot and Leveson Inquiries are correct.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16097", "url": "https://fullfact.org/law/cost-public-inquiries/", "vclaim": "Both figures are correct. The Iraq Inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, spent just over \u00a313 million over the eight years it was in action. The Leveson Inquiry into press culture and standards, back in 2011 and 2012, came in at about \u00a35.4 million over roughly a year.\n\nCosts aren\u2019t seen as a bad thing by everyone. One audience member responded to these figures by saying \u201cwhat price justice?\u201d.\n\nStaff costs are the biggest expense in inquiries like these. Almost two thirds of the \u00a313 million in Chilcot went on people: mainly on staff doing secretarial work and on paying the committee leading the Inquiry. Similarly, over two-thirds of the Leveson costs went on staff and lawyers.\n\nThe cost of public inquiries varies a lot. By far the most expensive in recent years was the Bloody Sunday Inquiry from 1998 to 2010, which cost \u00a3192 million. Nearly \u00a3100 million of that went on legal representation. As the Chair of that Inquiry said afterwards: \u201clawyers are expensive; very expensive\u201d.\n\nMost inquiries don\u2019t cost anywhere near that but several have gone some way over the \u00a313 million spent on Chilcot. A few years ago the government published a list of inquiry costs since 1998, so it\u2019s easy to compare them.", "lang": "en"}
