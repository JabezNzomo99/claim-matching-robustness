This photograph was taken by Alison Jackson, an artist known for using celebrity lookalikes to create staged paparazzi-style images. A description of Jackson\u2019s work appears on her web site:\n\nAlison Jackson is renowned for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is \u2018real\u2019. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson\u2019s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of \u2018truth\u2019.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first one of Jackson\u2019s photographs to fool unsuspecting internet users. We\u2019ve also covered one of Jackson\u2019s images purportedly showing a nude Bill Clinton receiving a massage, and another image purportedly showing President Trump at a Ku Klux Klan rally. Jackson also created several other images featuring a Trump lookalike performing questionable activities in the oval office. Those photographs, along with other staged images featuring celebrity lookalikes, appear in Jackson\u2019s book Private.", "lang": "en"}
