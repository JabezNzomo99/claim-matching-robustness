It stipulates a jail term of up to four years or a N200,000 (US$550) fine for offenders.\n\nThe author of the newspaper report told Africa Check he got the data from a contact.\n\n\u201cI contacted one of my trusted sources for statistics on female genital mutilation; he then informed me about the claim,\u201d Oluwaseun Akingboye said. He didn\u2019t state which document or report was cited by his contact, however.\n\nWithout a specific source, Africa Check turned to the country\u2019s statistics agency, the\n\ncontains the most recent data on female genital mutilation, according to the data agency\u2019s statistical information officer, Leo Sanni.\n\nDone as part of its\n\n(Unicef) partners with local health and statistics agencies to carry out the nationally representative survey, which is usually done every five years.\n\nDuring the latest round, 34,376 women between 15 and 49 were interviewed across Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones and asked whether they had gone through some form of genital mutilation or cutting.\n\n18.4% of the women had been subjected to female genital mutilation. This is a drop from the previous round in 2011, when 27% of women aged 15-49 reported having experienced a form of mutilation or cutting. In 2007, the prevalence was estimated at 26%.\n\nMore girls still being cut\n\nDespite the drop, the data showed that more girls below 14 are still being cut. Successive multi-indicator surveys indicate the share of girls in this group who underwent the custom almost doubled in the past 10 years. While it stood at 13% in 2007, by 2016/17 it had increased to 25.3%.\n\nThe survey has also revealed new regional hotspots for the practice, Atul Kumar, a Unicef spokesman, told Africa Check. While states such as\n\nZamfara, Kaduna and Jigawa had a prevalence of under 20% during the 2011 survey, this rose significantly in the latest round. The share in Zamfara increased from 2.5% to 26.4%, in Kaduna from 19% to 39.3% and from 2% to 14.4% in Jigawa.\n\nKumar noted that \u201cmore worringly\u201d, prevalence also rose in girls below 14 in these states. Zamfara recorded an increase from 5% to 58.2%, Kaduna from 38.3% to 63.1%, Jigawa from 36.9% to 66.9%. In Kano state, it went from 51.4% to 71%.\n\nRise could be due to increased reporting\n\nA public health expert, Dr Sunday Aderibigbe, said the rise could be due to increased reporting as more mothers become aware of the dangers of female genital mutilation.

In contrast to this, the number of girls younger than 14 that their mothers reported as being cut has almost doubled since 2007. Some states also reported a big jump.\n\nWhether this is due to increased reporting or other factors, Unicef couldn\u2019t say. But these variances need to be teased out if campaigners want to make headway.", "lang": "en"}
