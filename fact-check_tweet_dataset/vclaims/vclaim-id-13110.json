Those parasites blocked his heart and he died here at the Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201d\n\nThe picture does not show a child\u2019s heart. It comes from a 2012 scientific paper about a dog parasite, and shows the parasitic worms in a dog\u2019s heart.\n\nThe worms are Dirofilaria immitis, a parasite which can get into the hearts of dogs and sometimes cats. Humans can catch it too, but it can\u2019t get as far as their hearts, though it can cause nodules in the lungs.\n\nThe parasite is transmitted from dog to dog (or cat or human) via mosquito. Being near an infected dog (and mosquito) might mean that you are more likely to catch the parasite, but\u2014despite what the post claims\u2014direct contact is not how it spreads.", "lang": "en"}
