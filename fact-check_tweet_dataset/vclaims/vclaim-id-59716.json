The RNC agreed to cooperate with the foundation\u2019s request, Giller said.\n\nAt issue was a fundraising email sent by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising effort composed of the Trump campaign and the RNC. As The Washington Post reported, the email offered supporters \u201ctwo commemorative coins, one engraved with Reagan\u2019s image and the other with that of President Trump to anyone who donates $45 or more for Trump\u2019s reelection. The email was \u2018signed\u2019 by Trump.\u201d\n\nGiller told us, \u201cThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute owns the name, image, and likeness of President Reagan and they used [Reagan\u2019s] image for the coin without our consent.\u201d\n\nTrump responded with a tweet implying that the foundation\u2019s request for the campaign to stop using Reagan\u2019s image on the coins was attributable to the fact that Frederick J. Ryan, Jr., serves as both the chairman of the board of trustees for the Reagan Foundation and as the publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. Trump frequently complains about the Post\u2019s coverage of him.\n\nWe rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d because the Reagan Foundation did request that the Trump campaign and RNC stop using Reagan\u2019s likeness for fundraising using Reagan\u2019s likeness, which was done without the Foundation\u2019s consent.", "lang": "en"}
