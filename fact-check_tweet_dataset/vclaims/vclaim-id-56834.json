The incident took place on Tuesday morning at 7 am in Telinipara district of West Bengal. India is burning in the fire of Hindu-Muslim hatred. How long will this go on?\n\nThe video has raked in over a million views on Facebook, and was also found being shared on Twitter with the false narrative.\n\n\n\nBOOM noticed that in every post the video had a logo on the top right corner.\n\nCropping the logo and running it through Google reverse image search revealed that it was actually the logo of Rohingya News National News (RNN), which defines itself on its Facebook page as an independent non-profitable news agency of Rohingyas of Arakan, Myanmar.\n\nWe found a longer version of the viral video on the RNN's Facebook page, posted on May 12, 2020. The caption of the video read, \"The devastating fire has taken place in the Kutupalong refugee camps today in the morning. \"Reportedly 312 shelters were completely destroyed, and 362 more partially damaged, as well as small shops\" UNHCR. ERC has learned that at least 10 victims have been taken to the hospital for the treatments. ERC thanks the Rohingya volunteers who are first responders in the sense. ERC is trying to reach out those affected by the fire. ERC also urges UNHCH & WFP Bangladesh for the emergency response to the displaced.\"\n\nLooking for recent incidents of fire in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh's Cox Bazaar (run by the Bangladeshi government), and found multiple news reports (Times of India, The Independent, News18) that spoke of a fire on May 12 that gutted around 400 shanties and shops in the Lambashia camp in Kutupalong.\n\nWhile the video is recent, it does not show the plight of Muslims in West Bengal's Telinipara, following the sectarian violence that took place in the area a week ago.", "lang": "en"}
