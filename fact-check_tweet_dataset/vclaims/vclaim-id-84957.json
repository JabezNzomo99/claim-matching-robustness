But there\u2019s no evidence that she or her campaign questioned Obama\u2019s birth certificate or his citizenship. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton\u2019s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim.\n\nMoreover, Trump did not \u201cfinish\u201d the birther controversy. He was one of the most high-profile birthers during President Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign.\n\nIt was our friends at FactCheck.org \u2014 not Trump \u2014 who \u201cfinished\u201d the birther controversy eight years ago. After looking at, holding, photographing and investigating Obama\u2019s birth certificate, FactCheck.org published an August 2008 article debunking \u201cbirther\u201d claims, titled \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.: The truth about Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\u201d\n\nYet as recent as August 2015 \u2014 two months into his presidential campaign \u2014 Trump continued to raise questions about Obama\u2019s citizenship. At the time, we gave Four Pinocchios to Trump for saying that Obama \u201cspent $4 million in legal fees to make sure that nobody ever saw\u201d his college and passport records, which would indicate his true citizenship.\n\n[Update: James Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, tweeted on Sept. 16 that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal had met with him to ask for an investigation into birther rumors in 2008. Asher told McClatchy that Blumenthal \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cinvestigate the exact place of President Obama\u2019s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.\u201d McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said.\n\nWe reached out to Asher, but he did not respond to our requests for further explanation. Blumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: \u201cThis is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.\u201d]\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
