The country\u2019s government started distributing food essentials to vulnerable populations on March 30, according to Rwandan media outlet Taarifa.\n\nA photograph featuring what appears to be piles of neatly stacked bedding and food set out in a dusty area started circulating on Facebook and Twitter shortly thereafter. Social media users claimed the picture shows \u201cCovid-19 relief materials in Rwanda to an (sic) household under president #Paul_Kagami.\u201d (RELATED: Did Walmart Introduce A Staggered Shopping Schedule By Age Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?)\n\nFormer Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who was appointed to the African Union as a special envoy to mobilize international economic support for the continent\u2019s fight against COVID-19, made a similar claim about the same photo in an April 8 tweet.\n\n\u201cResponsible food distribution with social distancing to assist lower income households in the #COVID19 era!\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cA great example from #Rwanda where community workers also distribute food and other necessities door-to-door @PaulKagame.\u201d\n\nThe photo, however, dates back to at least May 2019, months before the new coronavirus first emerged in China. Several Facebook posts from May 2019 assert that a Gambian sheikh donated the supplies to Muslims in his region during the month of Ramadan, which occurred from May 5 to June 3 last year.\n\nThe Daily Caller found a YouTube video, posted on May 21, 2019, that corroborates the claim of these Facebook posts. The French-speaking narrator attributes the piles of supplies to the same Gambia sheikh, and the piles of supplies in the video match those in the Facebook posts from May 2019.\n\n\u201cThanks to those who have drawn my attention to the food distribution picture I tweeted earlier today. A friend sent it to me that it\u2019s from Rwanda,\u201d Okonjo-Iweala later tweeted. \u201cWhether Gambia or Rwanda, the point I want us to focus on is that it is a safe way of handling food distribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
