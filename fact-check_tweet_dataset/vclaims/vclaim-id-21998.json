There was crabgrass growing on the runways. And now they\u2019re vital and we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re doing \u2014 we\u2019re going to Mars. We\u2019re stopping at the moon.\n\nPresident Trump, like some of his predecessors, has retooled the government\u2019s space program. But space exploration had not grinded to a halt before he took office in 2017. In fact, NASA for years has been aiming for a trip to Mars.\n\nCasey Dreier of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that promotes space exploration, said that the Trump administration \u201chas been unusually attentive to space\u201d but noted that it has \u201cgenerally continued policies established over the past 15 years, and benefited from a rapidly maturing commercial space industry that has taken decades to develop.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush proposed a return to the moon as a springboard to Mars. President Barack Obama canceled that moon program in 2010, choosing to focus instead on reaching an asteroid and then Mars, while encouraging government financing of commercial spaceflight.\n\nMr. Trump has since scrapped the asteroid idea and refocused on the moon, eyeing a 2024 landing (however unlikely) as the interim step before reaching Mars. He also restored the National Space Council, \u201cwhich has taken significant steps to propose updates to regulations around the commercial use of space and space traffic management,\u201d Mr. Dreier said. And most recently, Mr. Trump authorized the creation of the United States Space Command, a precursor to the military Space Force he often champions.", "lang": "en"}
