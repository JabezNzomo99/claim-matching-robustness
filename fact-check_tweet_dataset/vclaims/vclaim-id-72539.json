America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.\"\n\nWe decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world\u2019s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we\u2019ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades.\n\nThe , which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain.\n\nBy this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that\u2019s about 40 percent of total global production.\n\nIf we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of \"oil production\" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nA note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It\u2019s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings.\n\nThe United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.\n\nHere is a chart showing the breakdown:\n\nThe United States and Russia are the of natural gas -- with the United States producing 29.5 trillion cubic feet in 2012, and Russia producing 23 trillion.\n\nOil production growth has to the United States\u2019 ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices.\n\nThe majority of U.S. oil production growth is in four regions: Bakken, N.D.; Eagle Ford, Texas; the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest states; and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.\n\nNorth Dakota and Texas comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all U.S. crude oil production.\n\nIn 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country\u2019s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with , or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the in shale gas production.\n\nThere is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States\u2019 oil production compared with Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University\u2019s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market.\n\n\"In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,\" Maugeri said.\n\nObama said \"America is No. 1 one in oil and gas \"\n\nThe latest global oil and natural gas production statistics back up Obama\u2019s claim. The United States has been the world\u2019s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. We rate his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
