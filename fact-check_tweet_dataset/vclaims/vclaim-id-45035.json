There were 32 committee meetings in May 2020, many more than one for each working day of the month.\n\nAlmost all of these debates or meetings were held using online video conferencing tools that allow people to take part from home. Some business in the debating chamber has been conducted as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 meeting with some MSPs physically present, and some participating online.\n\nIn response to the Scottish Conservative party leader\u2019s comments, STV News reported that a spokesperson for the parliament said they were: \u201cSimply not accurate.\u201d\n\nThe format and rules for meetings at the Scottish Parliament are set by a cross-party committee called the Parliamentary Bureau. The Scottish Conservative party is represented on this body.\n\nThe Ferret contacted the Scottish Conservative Party to request evidence in support of the claim it made. The party said that its press office had used \u201cthe wrong phrase\u201d and that work had indeed been undertaken at Holyrood more than one day per week. However, the party maintained that the parliament was running \u201csignificantly beneath capacity.\u201d\n\nJackson Carlaw\u2019s claim that the Scottish Parliament is only meeting once per week is false. Scottish Parliamentary records demonstrate that business is being conducted in both the debating chamber and in committees on a far more frequent basis, despite the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
