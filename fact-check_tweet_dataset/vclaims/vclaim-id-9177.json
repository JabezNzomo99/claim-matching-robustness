Hillary Clinton did not question on Twitter why Republicans need guns when they have God, and Gary Sinise did not assert that the reason was because they don\u2019t trust Democrats.\n\nThese messages don\u2019t appear on either the presidential candidate\u2019s or the actor\u2019s Twitter timelines. While it\u2019s possible that the original tweets could have been subsequently deleted, this is highly unlikely since they were supposedly retweeted thousands of times yet we found no links back to the originals.\n\nFurthermore, this purported Twitter conversation matched an image macro posted to Twitter two months earlier:\n\nIt appears that the Facebook page \u201cAmerican Proud\u201d simply re-imagined the above-displayed joke as a conversation between Clinton and Sinise.", "lang": "en"}
