Burton further pointed out that there were no statewide issues on the May 2009 ballot, according to an April 24, 2009, American-Statesman news blog.\n\n \n\n Similarly, there are no proposed constitutional amendments on the May 12, 2012 ballot.\n\n \n\n The next statewide elections are the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 29, 2012. Proposed constitutional amendments do not appear on primary ballots.\n\n \n\n Finally: It\u2019s not uncommon for chain emails to say Texans are voting on an issue not on the ballot. We pointed out a flaming example in 2010, adding that if voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683.\n\n \n\n We rate the chain email about turning out to vote on behalf of elderly residents and people with disabilities as a golden-oldie Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
