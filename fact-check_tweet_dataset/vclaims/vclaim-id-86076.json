Roberts Jr., said it passed constitutional muster. He once again falsely said he passed the biggest tax cut in U.S. history, when it\u2019s only in eighth place. He inflated the trade deficit with Mexico. And he offered a long list of false statements about immigration, ranging from mischaracterizing the visa lottery to whether his long-promised wall is being built. (It\u2019s not.) He also twisted the words of Democrats, casting words of sympathy for undocumented immigrants as support for MS-13 gang members.\n\nBut here\u2019s what Trump himself said to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt just two days after the firing: \u201cI was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the New York Times reported that Trump, in a meeting with Russian officials the day after the firing, said: \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d Those quotes appeared in a White House document summarizing the meeting.\n\nOur interactive graphic, created with the help of Leslie Shapiro and Kaeti Hinck of The Washington Post\u2019s graphics department, displays a running list of every false or misleading statement made by Trump. We also catalogued the president\u2019s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging that he or she did so.\n\nTrump has a proclivity to repeat, over and over, many of his false or misleading statements. We\u2019ve counted at least 122 claims that the president has repeated at least three times, some with breathtaking frequency.\n\nAlmost one third of Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 931 \u2014 relate to economic issues, trade deals or jobs. He frequently takes credit for jobs created before he became president or company decisions with which he had no role. He cites his \u201cincredible success\u201d in terms of job growth, even though annual job growth under his presidency has been slower than the last five years of Barack Obama\u2019s term. He also loves to cite unemployment figures, even though he repeatedly said during his campaign that the unemployment rate was phony and could not be trusted.\n\nNot surprisingly, immigration is another source of Trump\u2019s misleading claims, now totaling 379. Nineteen times just in the past three months, for instance, the president has falsely claimed his long-promised border wall with Mexico is being built, even though Congress has denied funding for it.\n\nBut moving up the list quickly are claims about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether people in the Trump campaign were in any way connected to it. The president has made 265 statements about the Russia probe, using hyperbolic claims of \u201cworse than Watergate,\u201d \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and, of course, \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He often asserts that the Democrats colluded with the Russians, even though the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were victims of Russian activities, as emails were hacked and then released via WikiLeaks.", "lang": "en"}
