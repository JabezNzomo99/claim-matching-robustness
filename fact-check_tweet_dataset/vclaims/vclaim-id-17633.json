The claim is false; the photo has been doctored from an original photo taken in November 2016 which did not include Imran Khan.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on April 6, 2019 by a page with more than 480,000 followers. It has since been shared more than 3,400 times.\n\nThe photo in the misleading posts appears to show Mirza Masroor Ahmad, an Ahmadi leader, with Imran Khan. In the doctored image, Khan's face has been circled in red.\n\nThe Urdu language text on the photo states: \u201cBreaking news. Photo of a secret meeting of Prime Minister Imran Khan with Masroor Qadiani (Ahmadi) has come to fore.\u201d\n\n\u201cMasroor Qadiani\u201d refers to Mirza Masroor Ahmad. This is a profile about him on an official website for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.\n\nThe Urdu language caption in the post translates to English as: \u201cThat\u2019s why arrests are being made, so that Qadianis can roam freely. People of Pakistan do recognise these Qadianis.\u201d\n\n\u201cQadianis\u201d is a term used to describe Ahmadi Muslims. This article published by the Dhaka Tribune newspaper on February 13, 2019, references the term.\n\nThe Ahmadis are described as non-Muslims in Pakistan's constitution, which can be seen here, with the relevant section on Page 170. This Human Rights Watch report published in 2018 describes Ahmadis as a persecuted religious minority in Pakistan.\n\nA \u201c24 News HD\u201d logo has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the photo.\n\n24 News HD is an Urdu language television channel based in Lahore. There are no reports about the purported secret meeting on the official 24 News HD website.\n\nThe photo in the misleading Facebook posts was also shared on Facebook here and here with the same claim.\n\nThe photo in the misleading posts has been doctored from an original image of Mirza Masroor Ahmad without Imran Khan, which was posted here on Twitter on November 14, 2016:\n\nThe image was shared on the verified Twitter account of MTA International, which describes itself on its official Facebook page as a broadcasting company based in London.\n\nMTA International also shared this video footage of Mirza Masroor Ahmad from the same event.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the doctored photo in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and the image tweeted by MTA International (R):\n\nImran Khan does not appear in the MTA International photo.\n\nThe photo tweeted by MTA International includes a caption which states the photo of Mirza Masroor Ahmad was captured at \u201cFazl mosque\u201d.\n\nThe photo corresponds with Google Street View images of Fazl mosque in Southfields, southwest London.\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the image of Imran Khan in the doctored photo has been taken from this original Associated Press photo taken in March 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on the AP website:\n\nThe caption of the AP image says: \u201cPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan arrives to attend a military parade to mark Pakistan National Day, in Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday, March 23, 2019. Pakistanis are celebrating their National Day with a military parade that's showcasing short- and long-range missiles, tanks, jets, drones, and other hardware.
