All other claims made by Emeagwali were debunked by the newspaper\n\nA blog has raised dust again about a black man who is the creator of the internet. The particular claim was also made by the Vice President, Professor Osinbajo in his 2018 Independence Day speech and has been a cloud of continuous dust, raised over and over again.\n\nThe blog claimed Google confirms the statement of Philip Emeagwali, Nigerian American-based computer scientist, as being the father of the internet and also quoted interviews of CNN and TIMES to support the claim.\n\nA quick search on google led to Philip Emeagwali\u2019s Wikipedia page which never had anything associated with the invention of the internet. However, he was well rounded up in the supercomputing applications and in 1989, he won the $1000 Gordon Bell Prize. Likewise, the history of the internet highlighted by Wikipedia does not also move in the direction of Emegwali as one of the fathers of the internet.\n\nIn the 2-part Investigation on the claims of Philip Emeagwali titled The Lies of Philip Emegwali and ExxonMobil, others disown Emeagwali published by the rested NEXT newspaper in December 2010, the newspaper contacted leading American Scientists knowledgeable about Computing and Internet as well as Nigerians in the Cyberspace Technology\n\nAmong them was Gordon Bell, a pioneer in high-performance and parallel computing for whom the prize won by Mr Emeagwali is named after and he said the entry that earned the Nigerian scientist the award had nothing to do with the Internet.\n\n\u201cApart from the prize itself, there is no evidence that Emeagwali\u2019s work was ever accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, nor that it had any other lasting impact on the field of high-performance-computing or the development of the Internet. Neither does he hold any recognised patents for his results,\u201d Gordon Bell said.\n\nAlan Karp, one of the Judges that selected the Philip Emegwali\u2019s work for the Gordon Bell Prize said \u2013\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the work he submitted for the Gordon Bell Prize had no influence on the Internet. The material he submitted for the Gordon Bell Prize did not address adjustments to Newton\u2019s Laws.\n\n\u201cMany people programmed the Connection Machines, both the CM-1 and the CM-2 that Mr Emeagwali programmed. To claim that sending emails programmed is misleading. The work Mr Emeagwali submitted for the Gordon Bell Prize did not set a world record. In fact, another team produced better performance and better price performance that same year and was awarded the Gordon Bell Prize for performance.\u201d\n\nAside from the Gordon\u2019s prize, Mr Emeagwali is not known for any other breakthrough and the investigation also revealed that PhD was never part of Mr Emeagwali\u2019s Academic degree because the University of Michigan did not find his dissertation good enough and never won a Nobel prize in computing.\n\nEmeagwali\u2019s interview with CNN and TIMES were part of the self-promotion and branding he did after winning the Gordon Bell\u2019s prize.\n\nThe internet was never created by a black man even though one person, in particular, cannot be pinpointed as the father of the internet because many scientists worked on a different part. Emeagwali\u2019s work was never related to the internet. It was all self-promotion and branding.", "lang": "en"}
