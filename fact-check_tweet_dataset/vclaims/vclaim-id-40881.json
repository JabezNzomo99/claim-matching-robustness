Also, by the standards of one key government database, the U.S. had eight \u2014 not zero \u2014 school shootings in March 2020.\n\nAccording to one government database, the U.S. has had at least one shooting on K-12 school properties every March from 2003 through 2009, and every March since (but not including) 2010.\n\nTo prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, state leaders across the U.S. ordered widespread school closures in March 2020. In the weeks that followed, millions of students spent their days at home instead of in classrooms. Some teachers and staff moved lessons online, and administrators locked the doors to school buildings so the general public could not enter.\n\nThe closures were among the most dramatic steps by state leaders to combat the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 58,300 people globally as of this writing in mid-April 2020. About 56.6 million students registered for elementary or secondary school classes in the U.S. at the start of the 2019-20 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nWhile a disruption to students\u2019 learning, the shutdowns in America may have provided an unintended benefit, beyond limiting people\u2019s exposure to the virus. On April 13, 2020, a journalist tweeted to his some 49,600 followers: \u201cLast month was the first March without a school shooting in the United States since 2002.\u201d\n\nThe reporter, Robert Klemko, quickly gained Twitter popularity among Americans who believe federal and state leaders should enact stricter gun laws, including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a pandemic to make this possible,\u201d her Twitter account wrote in a retweet of Klemko\u2019s post.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook users shared screenshots of Klemko\u2019s tweet, and one Instagram account for a website that brands itself as a fact-checking service on that platform posted a photograph of a law-enforcement officer monitoring students boarding a school bus with Klemko\u2019s claim as overlay text. Among media sites, CBS News published a story stating the assertion as fact.\n\n\u201cMy teens said this is the first time they have relaxed. No need to be hyper vigilant of every unusual sound, can just focus on school work,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cBoth grew up with regular Active Shooter Drills since kindergarten.\u201d\n\nThe claim about school shootings since 2002 is twofold: It asserts that no school shootings occurred in the U.S. in March 2020 and that every March between 2003 and 2019 documented at least one such incident. But because agencies across government and the news media do not share a consistent way for tracking and defining school shootings, the truth of both assertions depends on whom you ask.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and FBI, for example, provide an explanation of factors that contribute to school shootings but do not keep a running list of all on-campus gun crimes. Academics and school officials often rely on news media reports for their research, though journalists may not cover every shooting.\n\nThe nation\u2019s biggest guns-rights group, the National Rifle Association, does not publish a running tally of shootings in schools, yet it has convened researchers to compile recommendations on how to avoid such incidents, like other organizations. Meanwhile, a leading opponent of the NRA \u2014 the lobbyist group Everytown for Gun Safety \u2014 has tracked all \u201cincidents of gunfire\u201d in K-12 schools and colleges, including suicides; shootings in which no one suffered injuries; and cases where the victims or gunmen may not have any connection to the school, since 2013.\n\nThose prominent advocacy groups aside, the least partisan and most comprehensive source of school-shooting data appears to be the \u201cK-12 School Shooting Database\u201d sponsored by the U.S. Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Updated daily by emergency-management researchers, the database records \u201ceach and every instance in which a gun is brandished, fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week,\u201d according to its stated methodology. Its website summarizes the tricky situation analyzing school-shooting data as follows:\n\nWith that as background, administrators of the CHDS-sponsored K-12 database documented eight incidents fitting its definition of a \u201cschool shooting\u201d in March 2020. Local news media reports affirm those findings. The incidents include:\n\u2022 A shooting inside a Texas high school on March 2. According to , authorities arrested a 17-year-old student on suspicion of \u201caccidentally\u201d firing a gun during morning class. No one was injured.\n\u2022 A shooting at a Florida K-12 private school on March 5. A security guard at the school allegedly shot another staff member in the face while showing off his gun, according to . The victim sought medical help.\n\u2022 A shooting in Pennsylvania on March 10 in which a gunman opened fire at school bus carrying elementary students. Per , the bus was driving to school when a bullet \u201cwent through one window and exited out the other side\u201d. No one was injured.\n\u2022 A incident on March 13 in which a security officer at a Tennessee elementary school discharged his gun inside his office. No one was struck. ( .)\n\u2022 The fatal shooting of a 19-year old man on a Texas high school football field on March 15. He was a former student of the high school. ( .)\n\u2022 A shooting on March 18 in the parking lot of a Louisiana high school that injured a 15-year-old male student. ( .)\n\u2022 A shooting on March 24 in the parking lot of a Louisiana elementary school that wounded a man. ( .)\n\u2022 A shooting on March 30 in the parking lot of a Georgia elementary school that injured three people. According to , the victims sought medical help.\n\nRegarding the claim that March 2020 was the first March without a school shooting since 2002, the data is more murky. The CHDS-sponsored database lists at least one incident in U.S. K-12 schools in March of every year from 2003 through 2009, and every year from 2011 through 2020, but none in 2010. Supporting that finding, tallies of K-12 school shootings by the for-profit National School Safety and Security Services consulting firm and the advocacy group the National School Safety Center do not show a March 2010 incident.\n\nHowever, those sources only consider shootings on U.S. elementary, middle and high school properties. If you expand the scope of research to also include shootings on college campuses, Ohio State University documented a deadly shooting on March 9, 2010. According to the New York Times\u2019 coverage of the incident, officials said a custodian of the school shot and killed a co-worker before killing himself in a maintenance building. Another person was wounded in the gunfire.\n\nWe reached out to Washington Post reporter Klemko \u2014 the author of the viral claim \u2014 to understand where he got his numbers. He said he did include cases involving post-secondary institutions, rather than only focusing on K-12 schools.\n\nBut unlike other datasets, he said he only considered shootings in which students, teachers, or staff were the targets of the gunfire or the perpetrators. In other words, he said he did not consider cases where people trespassed on school property and opened fire at other people who aren\u2019t part of the school community. He also did not consider cases in which persons (no matter their affiliation with the school) accidentally discharged a gun or shootings on school properties outside of school hours or on weekends.\n\n\u201cI used shootings on school property, k-12, vocational schools, colleges and universities, where students or staff were intentionally shot at, or doing the shooting,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWhere government and private data were inconclusive, news reports filled the gaps.\u201d\n\nLooking at the comprehensive standards by which the CHDS-sponsored database documents shootings, he said \u201cit\u2019s a mistake\u201d to consider the database\u2019s definition of a \u201cschool shooting\u201d as the most fair. \u201cFew Americans would agree, for example, that an incident where a safety officer accidentally fires a gun in an office, injuring no one, constitutes a school shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cLikewise, few would agree that adults trespassing on school grounds and exchanging gunfire when school is not in session and no children are present, is a school shooting.\u201d\n\nIn sum, given the absence of a universal definition of \u201cschool shooting\u201d in the U.S., and given that a government database and news media reports show at least eight shootings did occur on school properties in March 2020, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
