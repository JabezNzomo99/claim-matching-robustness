The photo actually shows flooding on Indonesia\u2019s section of Borneo Island in 2015.\n\nThe image was posted on December 2, 2018, to Facebook group Demi Anak Generasi, which supports Indonesian President Joko Widodo and political ally Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the former governor of Jakarta.\n\nThe image -- which attracted more than 2,000 reactions -- has a caption that says: \u201cDuring the era of Mr. Anies, living in Jakarta is like vacationing in Venice.\u201d\n\nIt refers to Anies Baswedan, the current governor of Jakarta who defeated Purnama in the city\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial election.\n\nPurnama was subsequently jailed for blasphemy against Islam over comments he made during the election -- a criminal case pushed by Muslim groups loyal to Baswedan.\n\nComments on the misleading Facebook post include: \u201cGreat! During this rainy season, Jakarta citizens can travel in boat, like in Venice\u201d and \u201cCool! Governor Anies wants to make Jakarta like Venice.\u201d\n\nA Google reverse image search found the image was taken in 2015 by Indonesian state news agency Antara and shows flooding in Kalimantan -- Indonesia\u2019s section of Borneo island. The rest of the island is divided between Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nThe original photo\u2019s caption read: \u201cA citizen uses her mobile phone while in a boat during a flood in a residential area in Balai Karangan village, Sekayam, Sanggau, West Kalimantan, January 19, 2015.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
