Ted Cruz has been openly opposed to same-sex marriage, but he didn\u2019t blame gay people for mass shootings and public nudity during a 2014 speech.\n\nA 2015 viral image that falsely quotes Cruz is gaining traction again on social media as incumbent Cruz looks to keep his seat in the 2018 Texas Senate race against Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe false image originates from the now defunct Facebook page \"Stop the world: Teabaggers want to get off.\"\n\n\"When gays stayed hidden we had no mass shootings; we had no public nudity,\" the meme says Cruz said. \"Society was polite. Now anything and everything goes and I blame them.\"\n\nPolitiFact and its affiliates fact-checked several similar memes about Cruz from that Facebook page when it was active in 2015. We rated those Cruz-related memes Pants on Fire or False.\n\nThis claim is no different. The meme says Cruz made this statement during his speech at a 2014 Conservative Political Action Committee conference. We watched a video of the speech. He does not mention gay people, mass shootings or public nudity.\n\nThe original Facebook page had an About section that says the page \"is for entertainment purposes\" and is \"primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages.\" However, the meme that\u2019s reappeared on social media three years later does not have this disclaimer attached.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t blame public nudity or mass shootings on gay people. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
