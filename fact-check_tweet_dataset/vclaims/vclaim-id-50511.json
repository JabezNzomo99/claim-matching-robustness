This is false; there is no record of the top Democrat having spoken those words, and her office said she made no such remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about coal miners in W.Virginia. I don\u2019t care about steelworkers in Pennsylvania. I was elected by the people of California. They are the only ones I care about!\u201d says the post, shared here, here and here.\n\nAsked if Pelosi had made the remarks, Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff, told AFP in an email: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia, often dubbed \u201ccoal country,\u201d is a largely conservative state. The Republican vote passed the two-thirds mark there in 2016 when Donald Trump defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nPennsylvania, home to some of America\u2019s biggest steel manufacturers and producers of other metals, is a key battleground in this year\u2019s presidential election. It moved into the Republican column four years ago, when Trump narrowly won the swing state by 0.7 per cent.\n\nUnited Steelworkers (USW), a major union, issued a statement of support for Pelosi when she successfully ran for House speaker in November 2018.", "lang": "en"}
