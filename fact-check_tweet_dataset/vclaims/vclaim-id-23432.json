The first, on the left, is falsely identified as being from 1977 and includes a doctored headline reading, \u201cHow to Survive the Coming Ice Age.\u201d The cover on the right, which is real, is from 2008 and has a headline that reads: \u201cHow to Win the War on Global Warming.\u201d\n\nThe cover falsely purported to be from 1977 was actually published April 9, 2007, and is available on the magazine\u2019s website. Its real headline? \u201cThe Global Warming Survival Guide.\u201d\n\nTime itself attempted to set the record straight in a 2013 post that debunked the fictitious version, but the false cover has persisted online nonetheless.\n\nThe meme\u2019s overarching claim about \u201cexperts\u201d warning of a \u201cglobal cooling in 1977\u201d also isn\u2019t new. We addressed a similar claim advanced by Trump last year, and by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz before him.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, there were indeed articles (including in Time) in the 1970s that warned of cooling world temperatures. A 1975 Newsweek story has received considerable attention. But the journalist who wrote that piece criticized it himself in 2014, taking aim at parts that were not fully supported by the research.\n\nMoreover, the notion of global cooling was not widely accepted among climate scientists \u2014 as global warming is today. (NASA notes that studies show that \u201c97 percent or more\u201d of active climate scientists believe human-caused warming is occurring.)\n\nWe\u2019ll again refer to the 2008 study published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that found there was not a scientific consensus in the 1970s on the cooling idea. The authors, by surveying the peer-reviewed literature between 1965 and 1979, found quite the opposite.\n\n\u201cA review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists\u2019 thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth\u2019s climate on human time scales,\u201d they found.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
