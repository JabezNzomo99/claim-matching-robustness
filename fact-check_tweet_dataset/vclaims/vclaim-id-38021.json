Turns out, the claim is a regurgitated version of a 2015 survey conducted in 28 countries by TI. More so, the latest edition (2018) of the Corruption Perception Index places Ghana as the 39th most corrupt country in Africa.\n\nA news report published in August claims Ghana has been named the second most corrupt country in Africa by Transparency International (TI) in its Corruption Perception Index (CPI). It further suggests Nigeria came third and South Africa, first. Other news platforms reported this as well.\n\nThis is not the first allegation thrown at Ghana in this regard. Following the release of \u201cTI\u2019s People and Corruption: Africa Survey 2015,\u201d similar reports went viral in 2015. More so, the report failed to specify the edition of the CPI cited.\n\nRegardless, TI denied the claims. Coralie Pring- Research Coordinator- for Corruption Surveys at Tl explained the premise. According to her, the survey was of 28 countries; thus was not representative of Africa.\n\nAdditionally, the survey was an opinion poll and not factual by any known metrics. It measured citizens\u2019 perception of corruption in their countries and did not involve a ranking of countries.\n\nInvestigations by Africa Check also found the claim to be incorrect.\n\nFindings show present reports are a reharshed version of a debunked 2015 claim. It is interesting to note the succinct similarities in both reports. These include the usage of the same percentage of citizens (71%); and the same sample size (28 countries) reported in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe corruption in African countries report by the Transparency International stated about 71 per cent of people living in Ghana think government is not doing enough to fight corruption\u2026 \n\n\u2026 The majority (58 per cent) of Africans in the surveyed countries, say corruption has increased over the past 12 months. In 18 out of 28 countries surveyed a large majority of people said their government is doing badly at fighting corruption\u2026 \u201d\n\nSo, it was not a surprise when Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII) rebuffed the recent claims.\n\nDUBAWA went further to examine the content of the latest CPI, the 2018 edition, published on TI\u2019s website\u2013 January 30, 2019.\n\nThe report measured the perceived levels of corruption in 180 countries and territories. Metric used were surveys (13) of businesspeople and expert assessments. Countries were scored from zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean).\n\nContrary to the claim, Ghana was not named the second most corrupt in Africa in this report. The suggestion that South Africa and Nigeria ranked first and third most corrupt countries was also not supported by the report. In fact, Ghana scored 41; South Africa, 43, and Nigeria earned 27 points. This earned them 39th, 18th and 41st most corrupt countries; that is, out of the 49 countries surveyed in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "lang": "en"}
