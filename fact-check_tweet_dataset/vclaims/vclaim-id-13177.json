He gave no details and provided no evidence.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "March 21, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13177", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukrainian-general-prosecutor-claims-u-s-do-not-prosecute-list-fact-check/29835080.html", "vclaim": "On March 20, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko did an interview with the U.S. publication The Hill, during which he claimed, among other things, that when he first met U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, she \u201cgave\u201d him a list of people who should not be prosecuted by his office. According to The Hill, Lutsenko said that he replied by telling the ambassador: \u201cMy response of that is it is inadmissible. Nobody in this country, neither our president nor our parliament nor our ambassador, will stop me from prosecuting whether there is a crime.\u201d Lutsenko did not name anyone from this alleged list.\n\nIt is important to note that The Hill\u2019s translation of Lutsenko\u2019s claim contains a critical mistake. In the video interview, Lutsenko says that the ambassador \u201cvoiced\u201d (Ukrainian: oholosyla) to him a list of people not to prosecute, but the translator says \u201cgave me a list.\u201d The latter wording implies that Lutsenko actually received a physical list, something which could be produced as evidence. In fact, Lutsenko was saying that he received a verbal list, and he presented no evidence for this.\n\nLutsenko did provide to a U.S. publication a 2016 letter from a U.S. diplomat that he claimed supported an accusation that the U.S. Embassy was interfering in prosecution, from which his claim arises \u2013 saying \u201cthe list\u201d included U.S. resistance to his investigation at the time.\n\nWe get into that more in the \u2018context\u2019 section of the article. But we find nothing in the letter verifies interference although it clearly demonstrates vigorous U.S. objections.\n\nGiven strong denials form the State Department and a former diplomat that we recount below, and that there is no verifiable information from Lutsenko, the dispute comes down to what might or might not have been communicated privately. At this time, Polygraph.info must decide the claim is \u201cunclear.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has denied Lutsenko\u2019s accusations, calling them \u201can outright fabrication.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbassador Yovanovitch represents the President of the United States here in Ukraine, and America stands behind her and her statements,\u201d a State Department spokesperson told VOA following in inquiry by the VOA Ukrainian Service.\n\n\u201cThe allegations by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General are not true, and are intended to tarnish the reputation of Ambassador Yovanovitch.Such allegations only serve the corrupt,\u201d said the State Department.\n\nVOA\u2019s Russian service also asked John Herbst, a retired U.S. diplomat who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006, his opinion of the claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw the strong State Department denial. The U.S. government would not send such instructions to our embassy in Kyiv. Masha Yovanovitch is a great professional; she would not deliver such a message. So I think this is just not true.\u201d\n\nThe Kyiv Post noted in its coverage of the subject that Lutsenko\u2019s accusations came weeks after Ambassador Yovanovitch made a public statement in which she said that Anti-Corruption Prosecutor Nazar Kholodnytsky should be dismissed from his position. Anti-corruption activists had been pushing for his dismissal ever since recordings emerged in which he allegedly gave information to suspects about their cases, and pressured judges and prosecutors to dismiss charges against them.\n\nLutsenko\u2019s statement provoked a strong reaction from some of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption activist community. Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center accused Lutsenko of sparking a \u201cwar with the diplomatic system of a key ally\u201d in Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the center, wrote on her own Facebook page that Lutsenko\u2019s comments were a \u201cshot in the foot\u201d- not his own but the country\u2019s.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s John Solomon, who conducted the interview, wrote in a separate article published on Wednesday (March 20) that Lutsenko accused the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv in 2016 of \u201cinterfering in his ability to prosecute corruption cases, saying the U.S. ambassador gave him a list of defendants that he would not be allowed to pursue and then refused to cooperate in an early investigation into the alleged misappropriation of U.S. aid in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSolomon also wrote that Lutsenko had provided him \u201cwith a letter from the embassy, supporting part of his story by showing that a U.S. official did in fact ask him to stand down on the misappropriation-of-funds case.\u201d\n\nIn that letter, U.S. Embassy official George Kent wrote: \u201cWe are gravely concerned about this investigation for which we see no basis.\u201d He also wrote that \u201cthe investigation into the actions of the Anti-Corruption Action Center\u201d \u2013 a Ukrainian NGO \u2013 \u201cbased on the assistance they have received from us, is similarly misplaced.\u201d\n\nKent also wrote that the investigation \u201cappears to us to be an attempt to intimidate those in the Prosecutor General\u2019s office most committed to combating corruption, as well as nongovernmental partners and outspoken anti-corruption activists.\u201d\n\nWhile the verdict of \u201cunclear\u201d is all we can manage now, this story has created quite a stir inside Ukraine and it is possible more information will emerge that will prompt a change.\n\nFor example, on Thursday Ukrainian Pravda reported that parliamentarian Mustafa Nayyem announced that he would like to know whether Lutsenko or the government has taken any action in response to the \"list of untouchables,\" and why, if the list does exist, Lutsenko withheld his knowledge of it until now.", "lang": "en"}
