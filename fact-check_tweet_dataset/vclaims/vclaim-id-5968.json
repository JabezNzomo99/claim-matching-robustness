This guy went left to center. You can see where he broke through the guard rail on the right side of the picture where the people are standing on the road. His truck left the road, traveling from right to left, he flipped this truck end-over-end, went across the culvert outlet and landed on the left side of the road where you see it now.\n\nThe above-displayed photographs depict a December 2006 accident in which the driver of 1991 GMC pickup slid off the road onto the right shoulder, overcorrected when he turned back to the left, and crossed over the opposite lane of the highway before crashing though a cement barrier, skirting a railing above a drainage culvert, and coming to rest facing opposite his original direction of travel \u2014 barely missing a plunge over a 200-foot precipice by about twelve inches.\n\nThe roadway seen in these pictures is Highway 59 (i.e., State Route 59) near Hurricane City, Utah:\n\nThe Hurricane City Police department confirmed that these images \u201care consistent with a single vehicle traffic accident that occurred on State Route 59 in Hurricane City\u201d on 30 December 2006, and that \u201cHurricane City Police and Hurricane City Fire Rescue responded to the scene.\u201d The driver told police he was traveling at 55 mph when he left the road, but the police report of the incident notes that the truck left a 92-foot-long skid mark, suggesting a much higher speed (perhaps 75 to 80 mph).", "lang": "en"}
