The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman NOT Arrested For Trying Out Dozens of Sex Toys In Walmart Store\n\u2022 Fake News: Pro-Choice Activist Did NOT Break World Record By Getting 27th Abortion\n\u2022 Fake News: Daughter NOT Kicked Out of Home After She Refused To Wash Hair For Six Years\n\u2022 Fake News: Obese Couple Did NOT Make Three-Story Fall After Floor Collapses During Sex\n\u2022 Fake News: Australian Police Officer NOT Beaten And Sexually Assaulted By Kangaroo", "lang": "en"}
