What it did feature were almost a dozen advertisements and a short paragraph discussing social media marketing.\n\n360news.live's fake news could have reached over 3.9 million people, and was published the same day Marikina River's water level rose 17.3 meters from heavy rains caused by Tropical Depression Josie.\n\nTraffic to the story was largely generated by the Facebook page Cowork + Life and fanpages of celebrities Enrique Gil and Anne Curtis Smith. 360news.live had only begun publishing stories on July 17.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
