That\u2019s because the GOP-led Congress in January was in such a rush to repeal Obamacare that it moved forward before the CBO could complete an updated baseline, as it does regularly during the year.\n\nThat led the CBO to estimate that American Health Care Act would lead to 14 million fewer people insured than previously anticipated by 2018, the second year of the House GOP bill. Eight million of those 14 million would be people who had coverage through the individual insurance market; 4 million would be people with coverage under Medicaid; and 2 million would be people with coverage through their employers, which also would no longer be required to provide insurance. That 14 million figure grew to 23 million fewer people with insurance by 2026.\n\nNow the agency said 4 million fewer people would have insurance in the second year \u2014 not the 14 million from the estimate six months before. And the 10-year number was 13 million, not 23 million. (Note: the 23 million figure in May included the impact of a number of policy changes. A July report by the CBO more carefully defined the impact of individual mandate using the 2016 baseline: 15 million fewer insured in the second year, 16 million at the end of ten years.)\n\nWhat happened? The agency finally was using a later baseline, from the middle of 2017, rather than the 2016 one. Moreover, the agency started rethinking whether removal of the individual mandate would be as dramatic as it once assumed, as the estimate incorporated the expectation \u201cthat individuals\u2019 and employers\u2019 full reaction to the elimination of the individual mandate would phase in more slowly than the agencies previously projected.\u201d (The \u201cagencies\u201d also included the Joint Committee on Taxation.)\n\nThe report added that the work was ongoing: \u201cThe agencies have undertaken considerable work to revise their methods to estimate the effects of repealing the individual mandate. \u2026 Because that work is not complete and significant changes to the individual mandate are being considered as part of the budget reconciliation process, the agencies are publishing this update now without incorporating major changes to their analytical methods.\u201d The report added that the preliminary indication was \u201cthe estimated effects on the budget and health insurance coverage would probably be smaller than the numbers reported in this document.\u201d\n\nThe big problem the CBO faced was that it was trying to model human behavior. The initial assumption was that people were motivated to buy insurance because of the mandate \u2014 if an individual did not get insurance, he or she would face a fine. But there were other possibilities: Maybe all the news about Obamacare made people realize that relatively inexpensive insurance (after subsidies) was available in the individual market? Maybe people had developed a stronger belief that they needed to get insurance \u2014 and they understood that the Obamacare marketplace was an easy place to find it?\n\nBy May, the CBO had incorporated this analysis in its estimates. The impact of the mandate was downgraded even further, to just 2 million fewer insured in 2019 \u2014 and 8 million by the end of the decade. So that\u2019s a 38 percent reduction from the November 2017 report and a drop of 50 percent from the report that caused such a stir a year earlier. (Note: we have updated this chart to reflect the July report that more closely modeled the impact of just the mandate.)\n\nThe two groups of experts especially differ on the impact on Medicaid enrollment. The Medicare actuary says the impact is almost nil: \u201cThere is no assumed increase in the number of uninsured related to the repeal of the mandate as that coverage has no premium and little-to-no out-of-pocket costs.\u201d The CBO still believes there will be some impact under the theory that the mandate led people to get insurance, only to discover they were eligible for Medicaid.\n\nCBO forecasts do not always look great in the rearview mirror. The agency was certainly hamstrung at the start by the GOP\u2019s demand that the CBO first estimate the health-care repeal with an old baseline. Ironically, that helped make the impact of the GOP plan look even worse. Over time, with more data about how Americans reacted to the individual mandate and fresher baselines, the CBO became more conservative in estimating its impact.", "lang": "en"}
