After it emerged the man was a Labour activist, some people on Twitter and Facebook claimed he had been wearing a microphone during his encounter with the Prime Minister.\n\nTelegraph columnist Allison Pearson twice claimed on Twitter that Mr Salem had seemed to come \u201cequipped with his own microphone\u201d.\n\nOmar Salem\u2019s then-seven day-old daughter had been admitted to A&E the day before his encounter with Mr Johnson.\n\nPhotographs of the two men talking and of Mr Salem from behind don\u2019t show any microphone on his t-shirt collar, any cables, or a microphone transmitter in his pocket or on his person. A post on Facebook claiming to show a \u201cmicrophone pack attached to his belt\u201d show his belt and belt loop catching the light.\n\nThe sound in footage of the interaction filmed by the Press Association and the BBC also suggests the man wasn\u2019t wearing a microphone. The Press Association confirmed to us that it had not used a wireless radio microphone on Mr Salem. The BBC told us that the cameraman who filmed the clip confirmed that neither Mr Salem nor the Prime Minister were wearing radio microphones, and that the audio was picked up by the microphone attached to the camera.\n\nHis voice is echoing as it would if recorded from a microphone near the camera, which was a few metres away. This also seems to be the case for a third video of the incident, from a slightly different angle, posted by an ITV political reporter.\n\nHis voice was raised during the interaction, making it unsurprising that conversation was picked up by nearby recording cameras.", "lang": "en"}
