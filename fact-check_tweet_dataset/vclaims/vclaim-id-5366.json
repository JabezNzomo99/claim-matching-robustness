No, that's not true and the article claiming she did directly contradicts itself. The headline making the claim was made up by a site that liberally copy-pastes content from other sites and then adds some made up facts to its own headlines and introductory paragraphs to make the story juicier so they can profit from the advertising income when people click through on the misleading headlines.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on July 22, 2018 titled \"Peter Strzok's Wife, Who Is SEC Director, Blocked All FBI Investigations Into Clintons\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nHours after the FBI found classified Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop, Peter Strzok's wife was promoted to a powerful position in the SEC and immediately blocked all criminal proceedings against the Clintons. According to FBI sources, Peter Strzok and his wife Melissa Hodgman were instrumental in preventing Bill and Hillary Clinton from having to serve jail time for their numerous crimes.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, which contains the made up \"facts\" about blocking investigations and criminal proceedings:\n\nThe rest of the article is mostly copy-pasted from right-leaning website TruePundit and is essentially speculative in nature:\n\nIt even admits it can all be a coincidence and then uses an anonymous souce to claim it wasn't, with no further backup:\n\nHogdman wasn't even promoted to the top position at the SEC enforcement division: the page with director biographies on the SEC website lists Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin as the top directors. Hodgman was only named associate director. It is unclear how she could block any, let alone \"all\" FBI investigations from that position as the headline claims she did.\n\nIn fact the article directly contradicts that claim, noting that\n\nIn other words, two weeks after the Hodgman promotion the FBI was still investigating away.\n\nAt the same time, her husband, FBI agent Peter Strzok, was cheating on her with FBI-lawyer Lisa Page. So even if the promotion was inspired by a secret conspiracy, why would they expect her to help out her cheating husband? Some conspiracy website is probably thinking up a reason already, but unless it comes with hard evidence it is all just idle speculation and (in the case of YourNewsWire) just a shameless ploy to earn money through advertising by feeding gullible people the headlines they want to read.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: UK Government Did NOT Sell 10,000 Children To Child Traffickers\n\u2022 Fake News: Merkel Did NOT Ban Media Reporting Migrant Beheaded 1-Year-Old Girl In Germany\n\u2022 Fake News: Australia NOT To Bankrupt Parents Who Don't Vaccinate\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Jeanine Pirro NOT Confirmed By Trump To Be Next Supreme Court Justice\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Former Clinton Aide Indicted For Child Sex Trafficking", "lang": "en"}
