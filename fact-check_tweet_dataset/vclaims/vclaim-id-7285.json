There is also no report indicating whether agencies indeed followed the DBM's recommendation or if the cash-based budgeting \u201cworked\u201d for these them.\n\nFor instance, Department of Public Works and Higways (DWPH) Secretary Mark Villar said the agency will \u201cadjust\u201d to the \u201cchallenging\u201d proposed 2019 budget for DPWH, which is P93 billion lower. The agency would also lose their funds for some 125 flood mitigation projects.\n\nAffected also are education and health. Commission on Higher Education Officer-in-Charge Prospero de Vera III said the new system will \"severely hamper\" the implementation of the free higher education law. The Department of Health's (DOH) Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP) will have \"no allocation.\"\n\nIn an obligation-based system, implementing agencies \"obligate\" or commit funds to a project that may not necessarily be done yet within the same year.\n\nOn the other hand, in a cash-based system, projects that are \"not implementation-ready\" will be removed from the proposed budget. Implementing agencies will only have one year to finish their projects and 3 months after it to make payments.", "lang": "en"}
