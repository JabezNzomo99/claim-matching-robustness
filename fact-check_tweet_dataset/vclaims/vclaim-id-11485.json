However, critics found the official excuse not plausible, claiming the real reason may have been that the movie depicted the Kremlin\u2019s fears of a coup.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 06, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11485", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-hunter-killer-censored-russia/29584043.html", "vclaim": "\u201cHunter Killer,\u201d the new American action thriller film starring Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman, was scheduled to premiere in Russia on November 1. However, it was not released due to what officials say was a bureaucratic issue, not censorship. Critics disagree.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Culture, which gives permits to all art productions before they can be shown to the public, said the problem was with the Russian distributor, which did not provide a proper copy of the film to be preserved in the state film archive (Gosfilmfond).\n\nMegogo Distribution, the company that owns the distribution rights for \u201cHunter Killer\u201d in Russia, rejected the Ministry of Culture\u2019s allegations. It stated in a press release: \u201cWe have submitted all the materials and documents ahead of time; we provided copies of the movie for review a month and a half before the release date.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin expressed confidence in the Ministry of Culture\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what kind of movie it is,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture\u2019s explanation \u201cdoes not look very believable,\u201d wrote Andrey Pertsev, a political commentator with Russia\u2019s independent web magazine Snob. He added that the decision not to release \u201cHunter Killer\u201d was \u201cnot the first example of the veiled censorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thriller about a military coup in Russia did not receive a distribution license from the Ministry of Culture,\u201d Pertsev\u2019s column stated, \u201cperhaps due to the fact that the government saw in it their real phobias.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed, the independent news agency Rosbalt also questioned the Ministry of Culture\u2019s explanation. It said the official reason the film was not released seemed \u201cobviously too much,\u201d given that theaters across Russia had already listed the movie and sold tickets for the premiere, thereby suffering financial losses.\n\nThe real reason for the film not getting the green light possibly \u201clies in the plot of the thriller itself,\u201d Rosbalt wrote.\n\n\u201cHunter Killer\u201d was released in the U.S. on October 26, and grossed $6.7 million over its first weekend. The film features Gerald Butler as the captain of an American submarine who attempts to prevent World War III after the Russian president is taken hostage by a treacherous defense minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Culture refused to issue an exhibition license for \u201cHunter Killer\u201d under a law banning films that depict \"the military power of Russia.\"\n\nHunter Killer is still listed in the \u201cComing soon\u201d section of the Megogo Distribution website, with a release date of November 1.\n\nHowever, as of November 5, the movie had not been released in Russia and a new release date had not been announced.\n\nThis past summer, Russian authorities pulled the film distribution certificate for \u201cThe Death of Stalin,\u201d claiming the film violated the country\u2019s anti-extremism laws. Critics called the decision an act of censorship.", "lang": "en"}
