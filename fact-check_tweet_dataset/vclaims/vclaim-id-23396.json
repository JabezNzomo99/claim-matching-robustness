Incorrect. \u201cAtypical measles\u201d is mentioned as an adverse reaction (which is not the same as a side effect) of the MMR vaccine used in the US and one of the UK MMR vaccines. People given a certain type of measles jab in the 1960s and 70s could get \u201catypical measles\u201d if they were exposed to a certain measles strain afterwards. The other UK MMR vaccine brand lists \u201catypical measles\u201d as a \u201cpossible side effect\u201d as some people who were given the MMR got atypical measles if they also got the old measles jab. Pancreatitis, Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2), anaphylaxis, arthritis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonia, deafness, retinitis and epididymitis are also listed as side effects. Incorrect. All of these (except aseptic meningitis) are listed under \u201cadverse reactions\u201d of the MMR II vaccine used in the US. That\u2019s not the same as a side effect. Adverse reactions can refer to anything developed by chance after someone is vaccinated, but these aren\u2019t necessarily caused by the vaccine. The two UK MMR vaccines list some of these as adverse reactions. Death is listed as a side effect of the MMR vaccine. Incorrect. The US MMR vaccine package insert, under \u201cadverse reactions\u201d, says death from various and sometimes unknown causes has been reported after vaccination but a causal relationship hasn\u2019t been found in healthy individuals. Death isn\u2019t listed under adverse reactions on either MMR vaccine used in the UK. Measles is at the top of the list of the MMR vaccine\u2019s adverse reactions. Atypical measles is listed as one of the \u201cadverse reactions\u201d of the MMR vaccine used in the US and one of the UK brands (it is not \u201ctop\u201d of these lists). That\u2019s because people vaccinated with a certain brand of measles jab in the 60s and 70s were still able to get \u201catypical measles\u201d if they were exposed to a certain measles strain. The other UK brand lists \u201catypical measles\u201d as a \u201cpossible side effect\u201d as some people who were given that MMR vaccine got atypical measles if they also got the old measles jab.\n\nA post with over 1,500 shares on Facebook has made several claims about the MMR vaccine, including that measles is listed as its number one side effect, and that there are a number of other serious side effects, including death.\n\nThe MMR vaccine used in the US does list measles and most of the diseases mentioned in the post as \u201cadverse reactions\u201d, but these are not the same as side effects.\n\nAdverse reactions are conditions which may have occurred after someone got the vaccine but weren\u2019t necessarily caused by it. The two MMR vaccines used in the UK list some of the diseases mentioned by the Facebook post as adverse reactions or side effects. None of these vaccines say death is a side effect.\n\nMeasles is not listed as the number one side effect of the MMR vaccine\n\nThe two MMR vaccines used in the UK are MMRVaxPRO and Priorix.\n\nMMRVaxPro lists \u201catypical measles\u201d as a \u201cpossible side effect\u201d of unknown frequency in its information leaflet for doctors, but says atypical measles is \u201cdescribed in patients who received a killed measles virus vaccine, usually given before 1975\u201d. That means that atypical measles was observed in a small number of patients who got MMRVaxPro and had previously received killed version of the measles vaccine containing an inactivated version of the virus in it.\n\n\u201cAtypical measles\u201d is a form of measles usually seen in people who got a specific type of measles vaccine in the 1960s or 1970s. That vaccine did not protect against measles, and people who got the vaccine sometimes developed atypical measles if they were subsequently infected with a certain strain of measles.\n\nThe Priorix package insert lists \u201catypical mild or attenuated measles\u201d as an adverse reaction.\n\nThe MMR vaccine brand used in the US, called MMR II, also lists atypical measles as an \u201cadverse reaction\u201d, not a side effect.\n\nAdverse reactions are not the same as side effects\n\nWe\u2019ve talked before about how adverse reactions on a vaccine package insert aren\u2019t the same as side effects.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed on a vaccine\u2019s package insert can include anything that happened after a vaccination, but was not necessarily caused by it. Adverse reactions are not side effects of the vaccine itself.\n\nThe Vaccine Knowledge Project at the University of Oxford says \u201cwhen a vaccine is given to a very large number of people in a population, it is likely just by chance that a few of them will develop some kind of medical problem around the time of vaccination, but this does not prove \u2018cause and effect\u2019.\u201d\n\nSome of the other conditions mentioned in the Facebook post are also listed as adverse reactions in the package inserts of the MMR vaccines used in both the UK and US.\n\nPancreatitis, diabetes mellitus (the name for type 1 or type 2 diabetes), anaphylaxis, arthritis, encephalitis, pneumonia, deafness, retinitis (a range of inherited eye conditions) and epididymitis are all listed as adverse reactions on the US brand of the MMR vaccine, called MMR II.\n\nAseptic meningitis (another one of the conditions mentioned by the Facebook post) is not listed as an adverse reaction of MMR II. The package insert says: \u201ccases of aseptic meningitis have been reported\u2026following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination\u201d but it also adds that a causal relationship has only been shown between the disease and a different type of mumps vaccine, and not the one used in MMR II.\n\nThe Facebook post also claims death is listed on the vaccine\u2019s package insert as a side effect. The MMR II insert says under adverse reactions: \u201cDeath from various, and in some cases unknown, causes has been reported rarely following vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; however, a causal relationship has not been established in healthy individuals\u2026\n\n\u201cNo deaths or permanent sequelae were reported in a published post-marketing surveillance study in Finland involving 1.5 million children and adults who were vaccinated with M-M-R II during 1982 to 1993.\u201d\n\nSo death is not listed as a separate side effect.\n\nPancreatitis, diabetes, and death are not listed as side effects or adverse reactions in the package inserts for the UK\u2019s MMR vaccines.\n\nMMRVaxPro\u2019s package insert does list aseptic meningitis, pneumonia, deafness, and retinitis, as adverse reactions. Priorix mentions meningitis as an adverse reaction.\n\nThe package inserts for both UK vaccines mention arthritis, anaphylaxis encephalitis and epididymitis as adverse reactions.", "lang": "en"}
