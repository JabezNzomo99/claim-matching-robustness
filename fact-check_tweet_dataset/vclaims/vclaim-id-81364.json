The claim is false; the video is actually a news report about the arrest of two women.\n\nThe online report contains a video which it claims shows Coco Martin, the lead actor who plays a cop on the primetime TV program \u201cAng Probinsyano\u201d (called \u201cBrothers\u201d on Netflix) being arrested by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).\n\n\u201cAng Probinsiyano\u201d was criticized by the leadership of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in November 2018, according to local media reports here, for supposedly giving a \u201cbad impression\u201d of cops as it also portrays the police chief as a villain.\n\nThe PNP also reportedly issued a memorandum ordering police personnel to withdraw their support for their program by not providing equipment, such as police cars and firearms, to help with filming.\n\nThe misleading online report has been shared on Facebook here. Below is a screenshot of the Facebook post dated June 14:\n\nThe text in the screengrab, when translated to English, says: THE ACTOR OF THE TV PROGRAM \"THE MAN FROM THE PROVINCE\" COCO MARTIN WAS ONE OF THOSE ARRESTED BY PDEA\n\nPDEA is the lead government agency which investigates offenses related to the use and sale of illegal drugs.\n\nA reverse image search using Bing traced the photo of the man in the upper right portion of the post to this article on PEP.ph, a local entertainment site.\n\nThe article is about Martin\u2019s program and its guests. Below is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe actual online report contains a video, which when clicked plays only for 12 seconds. An ad prompt like the one below then appears:\n\nAFP extracted the hyperlink of the video, which leads to this news report by local broadcast organization GMA News uploaded on April 3, 2019.\n\nThe news report is about the arrest of two women suspected of selling Methamphetamine HCL or what is more commonly known as shabu in the Philippines.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of the original news report:\n\nThe spokesman of PDEA said Martin has not been arrested for any drug-related offense.\n\n\u201cChecked our reports. Negative so far,\u201d PDEA spokesman Derrick Arnold Carreon said in a text message to AFP on June 19.\n\nThe misleading online report can also be seen here.\n\nIt has been shared 217 times on different Facebook accounts.", "lang": "en"}
