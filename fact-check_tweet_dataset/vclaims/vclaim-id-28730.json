What gives?\n\nAnswer: The White House is spinning the numbers, focusing on a little-used measure to make the economy look a little more robust than it does measured the usual way.\n\nIn fact, real gross domestic product (which is adjusted for inflation) was 2.9 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, according to BEA\u2019s most recent release. (That\u2019s BEA\u2019s \u201cinitial estimate,\u201d which could be adjusted up or down slightly on March 28, when BEA plans to update its figures with more complete data.)\n\nThat\u2019s a disappointing figure for Trump, as it is still well below the 4 to 6 percent growth he promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and also as president. The 2018 figure is no better than the real GDP growth in 2015, which was Obama\u2019s best year.\n\nWhite House economists, however, focus on a different measure, one not normally used by economists in or out of government to gauge annual growth: BEA\u2019s Table 1.1.11, which measures the change between the last quarter of the year compared to the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nVoila! Now 2018 becomes a \u201cbanner year\u201d with growth at \u201cthe fastest pace for any calendar year since 2005,\u201d in the words of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The White House website carries a headline banner saying \u201cAmerica\u2019s economy achieves 3 percent growth for the first time in 13 years,\u201d which isn\u2019t as carefully worded, and is not correct.\n\nThe CEA\u2019s claim involves some careful wording and statistical cherry-picking. It\u2019s true that 2005 was the last time fourth-quarter GDP was 3 percent or more above the same quarter a year earlier. That\u2019s what the CEA means by referring to \u201ccalendar year.\u201d But there have been five other 12-month periods in the past 13 years when, measured the same way, GDP grew faster, and twice when it equaled the 3 percent rate touted by the White House website.\n\nIt grew 3.4 percent in the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2015, for example. And it grew 3.8 percent in the 12 months ending in the first quarter of that year. It also grew 3.2 percent in the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2010. Those were all during Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nSimilarly, under President George W. Bush, growth from a year earlier was 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2006, and 3.1 percent in the second quarter of that year.\n\nAlso, growth equaled 3 percent in the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2014 under Obama, contrary to the claim in the White House website banner, and again in the third quarter of 2018 under Trump.\n\nCorrection, March 21: We\u2019d like to thank a reader for pointing out a mistake in our original story, where we referred to real gross domestic product in 2019 and 2018 instead of 2018 and 2017.
