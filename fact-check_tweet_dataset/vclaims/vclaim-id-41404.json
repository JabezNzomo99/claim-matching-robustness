While one of the messages claimed that WhatsApp will be shut from 11:30 pm to 6 am daily and also invoked Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name to ensure credibility, another message attributed to Google, claimed that WhatsApp has been banned for a week.\n\nThe message also claimed that WhatsApp will charge for usage and the only way to ensure it remains free will be to send the message to 10 people.\n\nOn searching across platforms, BOOM found the messages viral on Facebook and Twitter. Several messages were also found in Hindi where the posts read: *Breaking news... The main server of WhatsApp in India crashed. You cannot download any photo, video and as per the company, it will take a long time to fix the problems.

We will update the article when we receive a response. However, Facebook has already clarified that the issue has been resolved and their users will be able to access all their services.\n\nAs users complained of facing issues with delivery of direct messages on Twitter, the platform also confirmed that there were issues and later tweeted about resolving the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, as social media users debated the reasons for the global outage, premier intelligence agency CIA found the time for a bit of humour on its possible role in the shutdown.", "lang": "en"}
