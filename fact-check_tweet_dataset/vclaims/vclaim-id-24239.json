The logo of Republic TV was superimposed on the image. We used Google search operator \u2018site:\u2019 to locate the photo on the media outlet\u2019s website.\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s clothes are the same and the background of the mountain also looks identical. The mountain in the photograph is Mount Kailash. Several websites have used the same image across the years. When we juxtapose both images, the similarities are evident. In the photoshopped image, the tilt of Gandhi\u2019s face has been adjusted. His eyes have been painted blue-black to portray him as injured. Furthermore, his face has also been bloated in the digitally-manufactured image.\n\nA double reverse-search of Gandhi\u2019s image led us to the original photograph. Among the media organisations that have used the photograph in the past was Economic Times.A side-by-side comparison of both the images reveals that Republichad superimposed Gandhi\u2019s photograph on a background of Mount Kailash for representational purposes.\n\nThe ongoing Lok Sabha elections have witnessed several cases where Congress President Rahul Gandhi was targetted using misinformation of varied kind \u2013 false claims, photoshopped images and clipped videos.", "lang": "en"}
