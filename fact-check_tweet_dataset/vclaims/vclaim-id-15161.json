Decent Americans out number [sic] Trump supporters 3 to 1.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Springsteen ever said this, though he has been critical of President Donald Trump in the past. Springsteen, when asked in 2016, said that it was unfair to call Trump supporters racist.\n\nWhile many celebrities, including Springsteen, have been openly critical of Trump, The Daily Caller could not find evidence of Springsteen ever saying or writing this quote. The image has not been shared on his social media accounts.\n\nAnother posting of the same image links to an article about Springsteen\u2019s disdain for Trump, but it does not quote him as saying that Trump supporters aren\u2019t \u201cdecent Americans.\u201d We found memes with the same wording that were not attributed to the singer-songwriter.\n\nBefore one of his \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d shows in late 2018, Springsteen told Esquire that Trump has \u201cno interest in uniting the country, really, and actually has an interest in doing the opposite and dividing us, which he does on an almost daily basis.\u201d He called this a \u201ccrime against humanity.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he offered thoughts on why some Americans find Trump appealing. \u201cI do feel that people feel under siege, and sometimes for reasons that I don\u2019t agree with and that are unfortunate,\u201d Springsteen said. \u201cLike I say, whether it\u2019s the changing face of the nation or \u2026 I think those people legitimately feel under siege. Their way of life is somehow threatened \u2013 is existentially threatened. And maybe that explains Trump and maybe it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen asked prior to the 2016 election whether he thought Trump supporters were racist, Springsteen said no. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can generalize like that,\u201d he told Channel 4 in October 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of people that are interested in him for a variety of different reasons.\u201d\n\nHe said he understood the appeal Trump had for people who have struggled for many years, but felt confident that he\u2019d lose. In a December 2018 interview, though, Springsteen said that he believed Trump would be re-elected in 2020.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone out there at the moment,\u201d he said of the potential 2020 field, which now includes more than a dozen Democratic candidates. \u201cThe Democrats don\u2019t have an obvious, effective presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen\u2019s representatives did not respond to the Caller\u2019s request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
