When I got into office, there were 650 murders a year in New York City. And I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That\u2019s the basic right of everything. And we started it. We adopted a policy which had been in place. The policy that all big police departments use of stop-and-frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop-and-frisks, we cut 95 percent of it out.\u201d\n\nAccording to FactCheck.org, \u201cBloomberg gets to his figure of a 95% cut by cherry-picking the quarterly high point of 203,500 stops in the first quarter of 2012 and comparing that with the 12,485 stops in the last quarter of 2013 \u2014 a decline that would not have been possible without the numbers ballooning earlier in Bloomberg\u2019s tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight. The reason the stop-and-frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on when we sent him there to say, \u2018This practice has to stop.\u2019 The mayor thought it was a terrible idea. We send them there, a terrible idea. Let\u2019s get the facts straight. Let\u2019s get the order straight. And it\u2019s not whether you apologize or not. It\u2019s the policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States takes no position on the fact-dependent first question of whether NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk practices violate constitutional standards such that Plaintiffs should prevail on the merits of their claims,\u201d the filing says. \u201cThe United States files this Statement of Interest only in order to assist the Court on the issue of remedy, and only should it find that NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk practices are unlawful.\u201d\n\nThe department said an independent monitor should be appointed if the judge ruled against the city, something Bloomberg had opposed. In response to Biden\u2019s debate claim, a top ACLU official tweeted: \u201cOne of the greatest movements I ever had the privilege of being a part of is the multiracial, multigenerational, multiethnic movement that rose in NYC against Bloomberg\u2019s racist policing program. That\u2019s what ended stop-and-frisk. Not Biden, not Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe passed a health-care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health-care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace,\u201d he said, according to a report by CNN. \u201cThe president, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to Congress, which didn\u2019t pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that\u2019s going to cost a lot of money.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cIt\u2019s really sad because they say they\u2019ve insured or provided coverage for another 45 million people. Except there\u2019s no doctors for 45 million more people, and unless they fix immigration and let people who come here for medical education stay here, those people are just going to do the same thing. They\u2019re going to have to go to the emergency rooms where they\u2019ve been, except that now it\u2019s going to cost a lot more money.\u201d\n\nThe Klobuchar campaign, citing a methodology that also counted voice votes, said she supported Trump\u2019s judges 33.5 percent of the time, which would place her as the seventh-most-opposed Democrat. But ahead of her are five candidates who have run for president, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) leading the list. The only senator who ran for president who opposed fewer judges is again Bennet under this accounting.", "lang": "en"}
