The posts were uploaded hours after Pakistan said it had shot down two Indian planes in disputed Kashmir in February 2019. The claim is false; the footage has been circulating online for three years.\n\nThe video in this Facebook post has been viewed more than 750,000 times and shared more than 16,000 times since it was published on February 27, 2019.\n\nEarlier that day Pakistan announced its air force had shot down two Indian planes in the disputed Kashmir region. Here is an AFP report on the India-Pakistan situation.\n\nThe 30-second video appears to show a fighter pilot, wearing a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) name tag, shooting down another plane in a dogfight, with a close-up of a missile being launched from a jet's wing.\n\nThe post's caption says, in Urdu: \"Scenes of shooting down of Indian plane by Pakistani eagles.\"\n\nThe same clip has been shared multiple times on Facebook in the past week, for example here, here and in this post \u2013 also published February 27, 2019, and viewed nearly five million times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nAn AFP analysis using digital verification tool InVID found the footage was not taken during the recent Kashmir escalation but has been circulating online since 2015.\n\nThe misleading footage was taken from an original short documentary film made by PAF called \u201cAir Defenders of Pakistan\u201d.\n\nThe film, which is just under 15 minutes long, appears in full here on Facebook and here on YouTube. A shortened version was also published here on the verified YouTube account of Dunya News, a major Pakistani broadcaster, in October 2015.\n\nThe air force provided AFP with a DVD copy of the film, which is identical to the YouTube video below:\n\nOne 30-second section of the PAF film \u2013 beginning at 12 minutes 7 seconds, and ending at 12 minutes 37 seconds in the YouTube version above \u2013 matches the footage in the misleading post.\n\nThe only difference is that a white box with the letters \"NB\" written in black appears to have been added to the misleading video.\n\nBelow are side-by-side screenshots of the post claiming this is video of February 27, 2019 (on the left) and a YouTube upload of the official PAF video (on the right):", "lang": "en"}
