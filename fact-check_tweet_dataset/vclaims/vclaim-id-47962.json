He entered Congress in 1973 after being elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate at the age of 29. He served there until becoming vice president under Barack Obama, a post he held until January 2017.\n\nTo back up Biden\u2019s first claim, that he \"entered as one of the poorest men in Congress,\" Biden\u2019s campaign sent us a 1974 Delaware newspaper article. It has incomplete figures on Biden\u2019s finances, and they compare him only to the two other members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation at the time.\n\nWe looked for outside data on this point and did not find much, but indications are Biden didn\u2019t have much wealth.\n\nRoll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, has done wealth rankings, but only for members of Congress and dating back only to 1990.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics provided us a 1973 summary of financial disclosures made by only some members of the House and Senate; it was published by Congressional Quarterly.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to say anything concrete about his actual net worth in 1973, because all we have to go off of is this summary\" and not the actual disclosure documents, said Center for Responsive Politics researcher Alex Baumgart.\n\n\"There's no listed securities here for Biden like there are for other members. From that, it\u2019s reasonable to infer he had no major investments listed on his financial disclosure.\"\n\nThe summary Biden reported outside income in 1973 of $6,050, all from speeches.\n\nOn Biden\u2019s second claim about leaving as one of the poorest officials in government, Biden\u2019s campaign sent us rankings from 2005, 2006 and 2007. Those rankings don\u2019t account for the fact that Biden remained in government for another decade.\n\nThe rankings are from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which annually ranks the wealth of government officials including members of Congress and top officials in the executive and judicial branches.\n\nBiden ranked near the bottom in the center\u2019s data in the years before he became vice president: Biden ranked 570th of 585 officials in 2005; 614th of 636 officials in 2006; and 626th of 639 officials in 2007.\n\nBecause officials report their assets and liabilities on official forms as ranges, the rankings use estimates. Biden\u2019s estimated net worth was -$47,494 in 2005; -$12,492 in 2006; and -$52,493 in 2007. In other words, it appeared that his debts outpaced his cash and other assets.\n\nThe center\u2019s rankings only go back to 2004.\n\nWe looked for the latest rankings by the Center for Responsive Politics to get a sense of where his wealth ranked when he left the White House.\n\nIn the latest data that include Biden, Biden again ranked near the bottom: 577 of 581 officials in 2014.\n\nHis estimated net worth was -$947,987, based on official reports filed in 2015.\n\nSince leaving the White House, Biden has reaped millions.\n\nCNBC reported in June 2019 that Biden and his wife, Jill, made more than $15 million combined in 2017 and 2018. And the same month, the Washington Post reported that Biden has made millions of dollars largely from book deals and speaking fees for as much as $200,000 per speech.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics estimates Biden\u2019s net worth, as of July 2019, at between $2.14 million and $7.92 million.\n\nBiden said, \"I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress and as vice president.\"\n\nBiden likely was among the less wealthy members when he first entered Congress, as a senator, in 1973.\n\nThe latest available rankings by the respected Center for Responsive Politics that include Biden, based on official reports filed in 2015, put Biden near the bottom of 581 members of the federal legislative, executive and judicial branches, in terms of wealth.", "lang": "en"}
