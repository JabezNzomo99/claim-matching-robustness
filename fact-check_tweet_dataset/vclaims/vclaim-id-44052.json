The Secretary added that Robredo revealed a \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d perspective of how government should work and cooperate by \u201cgiving more weight on the possibility of corruption instead of the benefits that the dredging of the rivers will bring.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1ol\u2019s remarks were then carried by major news websites as well as by dubious sites like am-i-right-rightttt.blogspot.com which described Robredo\u2019s remarks as the \u201cdumbest idea\u201d given that \u201cflooding in the Bicol region is a big problem of Bicolanos.\u201d The authors, editors, and owners of am-i-right-rightttt.blogspot.com are unknown.\n\nThe facts: Robredo made no reference at all to Pi\u00f1ol and his river dredging proposal during her radio show. She discussed flooding and recalled how, during the time of former public works secretary Babes Singson, desilting was discouraged because it was prone to corruption.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Rappler published this fact check piece on January 22, after the claim posted on am-i-right-rightttt.blogspot.com was emailed to us. This prompted us to trace the source of the claim which wrongly linked Robredo\u2019s statement to Pi\u00f1ol\u2019s proposal. Upon review, however, we realized that the fact check piece failed to take note of the new story published by Politiko. This fact-check explainer has been updated to clarify this chain of events.\n\nPolitiko did not update or correct its original story after Robredo issued her denial. Neither did it link to Robredo's denial which it carried as a separate report on January 16. This new story mentioned other salient details in the January 6 interview which were not reflected in the original story.\n\nPolitiko defines itself as a \u201csocial news blog where politikos, their kin, friends and allies are the center of the universe.\u201d It has an About page containing the names of its staff. Meanwhile, the blog am-i-right-rightttt.blogspot.com describes itself as \u201clooking at events from a different perspective,\u201d while its articles often provoke partisan views. \u2013 Addie Pobre/ Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
