The outrage was focused on CNN\u2019s booking of 17-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, with criticism falsely characterizing her appearance as being that of an \u201cexpert panelist.\u201d \n\n Adding to the confusion, a number of news publications ran with the same false narrative. \u201cGreta Thunberg added to CNN\u2019s expert coronavirus panel, Twitter erupts,\u201d read a New York Post headline. \u201cGreta Thunberg Isn\u2019t a Coronavirus Expert,\u201d Reason.com reasoned.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Thunberg was a guest on the May 14 show, but she wasn\u2019t the only non-medical expert interviewed. Other guests interviewed remotely included Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, who talked about ongoing negotiations with players amid a canceled season, and a private citizen, Neal Browning, who volunteered to participate in COVID-19 vaccine testing.\n\nLike the others, Thunberg spoke on a topic she was knowledgeable about, namely her effort to help raise money for the United Nations\u2019 Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), which is working to support children impacted by the pandemic. Her CNN appearance can be viewed below.\n\nOn Twitter she addressed the criticism of her appearance on CNN, saying, \u201cIt seems some people thought I was going to be on an expert panel, which of course has never been the case.\u201d\n\nTown hall co-host Anderson Cooper weighed in on the controversy after Thunberg\u2019s appearance, calling it a \u201csurreal, absurd drama.\u201d He noted that various promotions aired for both the show Thunberg appeared on and for previous town halls in the coronavirus series, which featured the likes of Manfred, singer Alicia Keys, chef Jose Andres, and film director Spike Lee as individual interviewees, not as panelists. Cooper opined that the Twitter circus was more about producing content \u201clest you miss out on a cycle of phony outrage\u201d than it was about actual concern over Thunberg\u2019s appearance on the show.\n\nBecause Thunberg was brought on CNN to discuss her efforts as a children\u2019s activist and her support for UNICEF, but was not there to play the role of a medical expert, we rate the claim that Thunberg was an \u201cexpert panelist\u201d on CNN\u2019s coronavirus town hall as \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
