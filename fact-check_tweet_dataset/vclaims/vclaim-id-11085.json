Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same.\n\n\"We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte,\" McCrory said at a press conference Monday. \"Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago.\"\n\nWe\u2019re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn\u2019t answer it.\n\nThe reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people.\n\nCarrboro also has a similar policy for contractors.\n\nA spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn\u2019t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts \"any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public.\"\n\nBut he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn\u2019t the right person to ask.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the law does invalidate those ordinances.\n\n\"He\u2019s completely wrong about that, unfortunately,\" said Carrboro\u2019s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory\u2019s claim that the law doesn\u2019t take away any existing rights.\n\nHerman said the governor\u2019s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors.\n\n\"I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor \u2013 I give him all presumption of good faith \u2013 but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised,\" Herman said.\n\nMore towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\n\nMcCrory has also said those won\u2019t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they\u2019re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him.\n\nNo more state claims for discrimination\n\nTaking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state \u2013 the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing.\n\nSuch claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2.\n\n\"This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein,\" the law states.\n\n\"This is a seismic issue,\" said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. \"It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate.\"\n\n\"I won\u2019t refer to this as a \u2018bathroom bill\u2019 because that's really not what it's about,\" she said. \"It\u2019s about the elimination of discrimination protections.\"\n\nThe law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch\u2019s Human Resource Commission.\n\nBut Doggett said that group doesn\u2019t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday.\n\n\"There\u2019s no remedy,\" he said. \"They have no teeth. \u2026 If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn\u2019t mean anything if we can't enforce it.\"\n\nNoble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it\u2019s largely meaningless.\n\n\"What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?\" She said.\n\nPeople can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts \u2013 less than six months, compared to three years \u2013 which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long.\n\nDebbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway.\n\nMcCrory said that with the passage of HB2, \"we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina.\"\n\nThat is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask.\n\nAnd it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases.\n\nBut even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong.", "lang": "en"}
