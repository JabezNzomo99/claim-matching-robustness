I don\u2019t think so!\"\n\nThe post, which had been shared more than 2,200 times within a week, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We salute the suspicious commenter who questioned the photo\u2019s authenticity.\n\nThe image is actually a still of drone footage taken in Toronto after the Raptors won the NBA championship on June 14. Photographer Toby Guu captured the scene, which you can watch here. (Pause around second 23 to see the still used in the Facebook post.)\n\nTrump himself said on June 26 that there were \"literally tens of thousands of people\" who couldn\u2019t get into his reelection campaign launch rally at the Amway Center in Orlando. However, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the arena, which has a capacity of about 20,000, was \"nearly filled to capacity.\"\n\n\"Whether it was the weather \u2014 hot earlier in the day, rainy in the afternoon \u2014 or people just wanting invitations to the historic event for keepsakes, it did appear there were fewer people than were planned,\" the newspaper wrote on June 18. \"The planned overflow area across from the arena was virtually empty as the rally began inside the arena.\"\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
