The Washington Post reported on April 18 that \u201cU.S. manufacturers shipped millions of dollars\u2019 worth of face masks and other protective medical equipment to China in January and February with encouragement from the federal government [which] underscores the Trump administration\u2019s failure to recognize and prepare for the growing pandemic threat.\u201d\n\nIn the case highlighted in the ad, the State Department\u2019s role was providing the aircraft. The department sent chartered planes to Wuhan to pick up some 800 consulate workers, their families and other Americans. The planes otherwise were going to be empty on the way to China, so officials decided to fill the jets with goods donated by Samaritan\u2019s Purse, the Boeing Company, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Intermountain Healthcare. Money to help underwrite the effort was provided by Kenneth Griffin, a hedge fund manager who is chief executive of the investment firm Citadel. (It\u2019s unclear whether he helped defray the State Department\u2019s transportation costs. A Citadel spokesman would not clarify.)\n\n\u201cWe have evacuated more than 800 people from Wuhan,\u201d Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun told reporters on Feb. 7. \u201cThe first charter flight departed Wuhan on January 28th. Two subsequent flights departed on February 5th. Yesterday, on February 6th two additional evacuation flights departed Wuhan, carrying 800 passengers. The State Department, working closely with our partners in China, has loaded the holds of those arriving 747s with 18 tons of privately donated medical supplies and humanitarian assistance for the Chinese people. This includes urgently needed masks, gowns, gauze, respirators and other vital materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountless flights carrying protective gear from all over the world arrived in China as our team worked to help doctors and nurses on the front lines,\u201d Rabih Torbay, Project HOPE\u2019s president and chief executive, told The Fact Checker. \u201cParticularly with increasing caseloads like we were starting to see toward the end of January in and around Wuhan, it is hard to imagine transport would be the limiting factor to helping contain a deadly outbreak before it becomes a pandemic.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Boeing\u2019s announcement on the donation made no mention of the State Department, simply saying it had made \u201ca donation of 250,000 medical-grade respiratory masks to address medical supply shortages in China.\u201d Similarly, a news report on the Mormon Church\u2019s donations referred only to planes being chartered for the trip, carrying 220,000 face masks, 870 pairs of protective goggles and more than 6,500 pairs of protective coveralls.\n\nAt the time of the State Department flights, the World Health Organization was pleading for help to stem the crisis in China. \u201cFront-line health workers in China require the bulk of PPE supplies,\u201d WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Feb. 7, when 12 cases had been confirmed in the United States. \u201cThere is limited stock of PPE and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most. \u2026 WHO discourages stockpiling of PPE in countries and areas where transmission is low.\u201d\n\nIt was also a one-off event for the State Department, which has not assisted or supported the delivery of additional aid to China, beyond the nearly-18-ton shipment highlighted in the ad. For context, that\u2019s a relatively small amount considering the numbers cited for Project Airbridge, the U.S. government effort to deliver medical supplies across the United States, such as 80 tons shipped on March 29 and 83 tons shipped on April 2.\n\nHe also said it was appropriate to pin the shipment on Trump because a top official from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, in late March had said: \u201cUnder the direction of President Trump, the United States Government is responding rapidly. The U.S. was among the first nations to offer help to the Chinese people, and we are the largest financial backers of the World Health Organization and UNICEF. In early February, the United States delivered more than 17 tons of medical supplies to China donated by the American people. These supplies included masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs The Washington Post\u2019s own reporting and multiple fact-checking organizations have already verified, the president\u2019s own State Department, as they said themselves, shipped 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies to China in February under the president\u2019s own direction,\u201d Fain said. \u201cThose are the facts and they\u2019re not up for debate. This president doesn\u2019t get to avoid accountability now that he finds it politically inconvenient.\u201d\n\nThirty-second attack ads are not often known for nuance. But this one goes awry when it suggests that Trump shipped to China protective gear that belonged to Americans. These were donations by private charities and public companies at a time when the U.S. case count was still low. All the State Department did was supply planes that would have been empty anyway. Nevertheless, the State Department touted the shipment and attributed it to Trump\u2019s leadership.", "lang": "en"}
