No U.N. member nation, including the United States, has recognized the annexation as legal.\n\nIn December 2016, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing Crimea as being \u201ctemporarily occupied\u201d by Russia.\n\nMost of Russia\u2019s state media has used language similar to Interfax\u2019s in the headlines of their reports about Apple\u2019s decision to label Crimea as Russian territory.\n\nThe news of the U.S. tech giant\u2019s move came from Vasily Piskarev, chair of the committee on security and anti-corruption in the State Duma (the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament), who said Apple had made \u201ccorrections\u201d to the geographical names of Crimea and Sevastopol in accordance with the Russian constitution.\n\nHowever, missing from Piskarev\u2019s comments and the Russian media reports about them was the fact that the changes only applied inside Russia. Outside Russia, Apple maps and weather applications seem to continue displaying Crimea as part of Ukraine. Apple did not respond to Polygraph.info's request for comment.\n\nMoreover, the change in how Apple\u2019s maps display Crimea and Sevastopol is not new: it was announced back in May by the chair of the Duma\u2019s committee on information policy, information technologies and communications, Leonid Levin. The latest \u201ccorrection\u201d only concerns Apple\u2019s weather application.\n\nIn its Nov. 27 report, Interfax noted that \u201cnegotiations\u201d between Russia and Apple over the issue had been going on since May and that the company had asked that deadlines be extended for \u201ctechnical reasons.\u201d According to the news agency, Piskarev said that the Duma had reminded Apple that designating Crimea as Ukrainian territory was a criminal offense under Russian law.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to monitor, so that there is no going back,\u201d Interfax quoted Piskarev as saying.\n\nIn July 2014, the Duma amended the country\u2019s law against incitement to separatism to include any public declaration that Crimea is part of Ukraine. Violation of that law is punishable by up to four years in prison. It also applies to foreign companies doing business in Russia, which, if prosecuted on these grounds, risk being fined and/or banned from Russia.\n\nThe \u201cCrimea\u201d amendment has since been used to prosecute journalists, bloggers and political activists.\n\nAccording to the profile of OOO Apple Rus, Apple\u2019s subsidiary in Russia, in the Russian tax authority\u2019s database, the company\u2019s profits in Russia had been growing since it first registered in December 2011, but showed a sharp decrease in 2016-2017.\n\nSince 2014, Roskomnadzor, the Russian government agency that oversees media and telecommunications, has insisted that Apple process and store all of its Russian users\u2019 data on servers physically located in Russia. Apple adhered to those demands, Roscomnadzor confirmed in January.\n\nThe Russian government has demanded that other global tech companies mark Crimea as Russian territory. In 2014, following Russia\u2019s annexation of the Black Sea peninsula, Google Maps adopted the same tactic as Apple, displaying Crimea as Russian territory for users inside Russia and as Ukrainian territory for everyone outside Russia.", "lang": "en"}
