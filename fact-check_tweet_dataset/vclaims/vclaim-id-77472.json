If you start in January 2009, the month that Obama took office, there has been a 451,000 increase in the number of unemployed women 16 and up through the latest report, which was issued last week.\n\n \n\n But start the count later and you get a much different picture. The Obama campaign often uses February 2010, which was the point when monthly job changes turned from negative to positive.\n\n \n\n The problem is, each party\u2019s approach amounts to cherry picking. Starting the count on the day Obama was sworn in ignores the reality that no president can have much impact on the economy in their first weeks or even months on the job -- a point that\u2019s particularly important in Obama\u2019s case because the job numbers were in a virtual free fall when he began his term on January 2009. On the other hand, starting the count at the low point, one year after taking office, shields Obama from any responsibility for more than a year.\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve often taken a middle ground, starting the count in June 2009, which was the official start of the recovery, and a few months after Obama\u2019s stimulus law took effect.\n\n \n\n As it turns out, using June 2009 makes a major difference in the result. Between June 2009 and September 2012, the number of unemployed women actually decreased by 548,000.\n\n \n\n There\u2019s also another way to look at it -- to compare the 44 months after January 2009 to the 44 months prior to January 2009. During this period -- the final 44 months of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency -- the number of unemployed women rose by almost 1.4 million. That\u2019s more than triple the increase in unemployed women that we found even under the least flattering measurement for Obama.\n\n \n\n And if you look at Bush\u2019s entire eight-year term, the number of unemployed women rose by more than 2.2 million. Even accounting for Bush\u2019s longer tenure, that\u2019s a rise far more rapid than occurred under Obama.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The Romney campaign claimed that \"since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women.\"\n\n \n\n That\u2019s literally true, but the statistic is cherry-picked. Starting the count at the beginning of the recovery, rather than the beginning of Obama\u2019s term, produces a starkly different result -- a decrease of 548,000 unemployed women. And the rise in women\u2019s unemployment under Obama pales compared to the rise experienced under George W. Bush. These important pieces of context are left out of the ad.
