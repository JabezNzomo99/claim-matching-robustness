Our friends at FactCheck.org offered a good illustration. Consider this simple arithmetic. There are almost 126 million households in the United States, so an average of $4,000 per household would mean a total income gain of $500 billion. Now that gain, according to the White House, is a direct result of the tax cut. The United States collected just under $300 billion in corporate taxes in fiscal 2017 before the tax bill was passed. If the new corporate tax rate had been in place, the government would have collected $127 billion less. Put another way, companies would have saved $127 billion, but even if they gave every dime back to workers this doesn\u2019t come near the $500 billion required to average $4,000 per household. (The White House says this is not a fair comparison because so many companies avoided the U.S. tax rates that current tax receipts are lower than they would be under the new law.)\n\nAs we have previously explained, the United States has never been one of the highest-taxed nations, developed or not \u2014 and that was before Trump\u2019s tax cut. The Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries. In 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of the economy \u2014 was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third \u2014 and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent. Given the breadth of the Trump tax cut, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the United States will rank even lower in the OECD rankings.\n\nUnder the new tax law, the family Trump describes will probably see a tax cut. However, the amount of that cut will vary depending on their individual tax situation. Plus, Trump fails to mention that these tax cuts are scheduled to phase out by the end of 2025 and as a result of inflation, taxpayers who are getting a cut now may well see a hike then. Moreover, for many families, payroll taxes take up the largest chunk of their tax bill. But Trump reductions are in income taxes \u2014 not payroll taxes.\n\nThe tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction, $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions (currently $4,050 per family member). So a couple with two children already are \u201ccompletely tax-free\u201d on their first $28,800. That\u2019s because they get $12,600 in a standard deduction and $16,200 in dependent and personal exemptions. It\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference, but maybe not \u2014 couples with children could quite possibly end up with a larger tax bill.\n\nTrump is citing a list maintained by Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax group, which says 409 companies have offered bonuses, pay increases or increased 401(k) contributions because of the tax plan. The group says over 3 million Americans have received tax bonuses, many about $1,000 or $2,000; the list identifies three companies as offering $3,000 or more. With about 126 million full-time workers in the United States, only about 3 percent have received these one-time bonuses, yet Trump misleadingly promotes them as widespread. More than half of the companies participating are in the financial services industry, while the others range from major multinational corporations to local restaurants and small businesses.\n\nSo, what are companies doing with the extra cash? An analysis from the nonprofit research group Just Capital looked at how 90 public corporations planned to spend their tax savings. It found 58 percent of the corporate tax saving would be directed to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks, direct distributions or retained earnings. Moreover, stock buybacks, which benefit shareholders (and executives), have already reached record levels. A Morgan Stanley analysis found that companies are more than three times as probably to allocate the tax savings to buybacks & dividends than labor compensation. For companies in the manufacturing industry, which Trump regularly touts, 47 percent are probably to allocate the tax savings to stock buybacks, just 9 percent are probably to spend the savings on labor compensation.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously explained, Apple announced a five-year investment plan in January, which includes $30 billion in capital expenditures and roughly $275 billion in domestic spending with U.S. suppliers and manufacturers. The tech giant plans to build a new campus and hire 20,000 employees. How much of this is a direct result of Trump\u2019s tax plan? Apple chief executive Tim Cook told ABC News that \u201cthere are large parts of this [plan] that are a result of the tax reform and there\u2019s large parts of this that we would have done in any situation.\u201d So, some but not all.\n\nApple did not provide The Fact Checker with a breakdown of which components of the plan were in place before the new law and which were added after, so we can\u2019t precisely determine the law\u2019s impact. Apple, however, did say it would be making a $38 billion tax payment to repatriate overseas profit, which is made possible under a provision of Trump\u2019s tax law. And like other big U.S. companies, it gave employee bonuses in response to the legislation.\n\nBefore the new tax law, the U.S. effective tax rate was 27.1 percent. The new federal corporate tax rate drops to 21 percent, but it also strips many of the deductions and additional tax benefits for companies, which means the effective rate will probably be closer to the set statutory corporate rate. What does all of that mean? The new U.S. corporate tax rate is more in line with the average statutory tax rate, according to tables from the OECD. And so, while the rate was never the highest, it\u2019s also not among the lowest.", "lang": "en"}
