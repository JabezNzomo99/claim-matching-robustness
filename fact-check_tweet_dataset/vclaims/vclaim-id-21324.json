(The youth of Indian Punjab stood up against the oppressive Indian army in Kashmir.)\u201d The video is 37 seconds long and shows a hugely-built turbaned youth grabbing a policeman by his neck and hurling him.\n\nThe above tweet was posted on August 13. The same video has been posted in jest by some social media users, with the message, \u201c\u0928\u092f \u0930\u0941\u091d\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u093e\u0938\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u091a \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u090f \u091c\u093c\u0930\u0942\u0930\u201d (New trend between public and administration. Please watch.)\n\nPrima facie, the video appears to be theatrical in nature. Alt News searched Google with the keywords \u2018Youth chokeslams police\u2018, and found a similar video posted on YouTube. The video has been posted on a channel CWE, and is titled, \u2018CWE Wrestler Shanky Singh Chokeslam to Constable Pandey.\u2019 Taking this as a hint, we searched for videos on YouTube with the keywords \u2018Shanky Singh police chokeslam\u2019 and found the original video posted two years ago.\n\nCWE refers to Continental Wrestling Entertainment, a sports entertainment company founded by The Great Khali, the famous WWE wrestler from Punjab. A cursory glance at the YouTube channel of CWE shows several such scripted videos, with signature wrestling moves in varied situations.\n\nThe turbaned young man seen in the video is Shanky Singh. Shanky Singh is the ring name of Gurvinder Singh Malhotra, a professional wrestler who is currently with the CWE.\n\nA theatrical video featuring a professional wrestler was shared on Twitter as \u201cyouths rising in Indian Punjab\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
