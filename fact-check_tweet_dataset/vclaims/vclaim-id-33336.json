But the widely shared images are fake. They were made for a 2011 environmental campaign called, \u201cWhen you see a tuna, think panda,\u201d meant to engender concern for threatened fish.\n\nFacebook users expressed their shock on a post from the Philippines displaying the photos, including one showing the bears strung up on a boat, that was shared more than 50,000 times since it was first published in August.\n\nSimilar viral posts in Spanish provoked the same types of reactions from users.\n\n\u201cWhere is your heart,\u201d the post asked in Tagalog, without offering further information besides sad face and broken heart emojis.\n\nSome commenters wondered where the pictures were taken and questioned their veracity, while others lamented the apparently badly injured state of the animals.\n\nBut the photos are not real. They\u2019re from the marine conservation activist group Sea Shepherd Global, which released a campaign in 2011 asking the public to imagine a panda in the place of a tuna when looking at fishing pictures called \u201cWhen you see a tuna, think panda.\u201d\n\nA representative for the organization told AFP on Facebook that the renewed viral response was \u201cexactly\u201d the kind of reaction the group was going for when they first published the photos. \u201cIt shows the hypocrisy that we were trying to put on display, that people will care for pandas, but not for fish, when they are also endangered.\u201d\n\nIs a campaign calling attention to the conservation of a species of fish necessary?\n\nThe Sea Shepherd Global campaign was specifically focused on the bluefin tuna, for which there is high demand because of the fish\u2019s popular use in sushi and sashimi.\n\nAn AFP report from 2010 says the fish, which lives in temperate waters from the equator to northern Norway, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Black Sea, are expensive (fetching up to $160,000 at auction), becoming increasingly rare and can be difficult to catch.\n\nThe quota for the number of tuna allowed to be fished each year became a topic of hot debate in 2009, when the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), charged with the regulation and conservation of the species, ignored scientific guidelines and established annual fishing quotas above expert recommendations.\n\n\"ICCAT has continually disregarded countless opportunities to do the right thing and secure the Atlantic bluefin tuna and guarantee the recovery of this species,\" Susan Lieberman, director of international policy at the Washington-based Pew Environment Group, told reporters, including AFP, in 2009.\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna is included on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) list of endangered species.\n\nIn 2017, AFP reported that Paulus Tak, a senior officer for the Pew Charitable Trust, which was an official observer of ICCAT talks, said that year\u2019s expansion of bluefin tuna country quotas by up to 50 percent to 36,000 tonnes in 2020 was an \u201cenormous step backwards\u201d for conservation.\n\nThe IUCN lists the giant panda as \u201cvulnerable,\u201d one rank more stable than the tuna\u2019s \u201cendangered\u201d classification.", "lang": "en"}
