A reverse-search of one of the frames on Google revealed that the video is from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. We found a video of a report published by News 24 on January 5, 2019, which said that the incident took place at Bhopal\u2019s Chowk Bazar.\n\nAccording to the report, a scuffle broke out between four women over a minor traffic collision. It said that an argument led to a fight where the women were seen beating one and another with slippers. The same can be corroborated with a report published by Dainik Bhaskar on January 5, 2019.\n\nViral on Facebook with the false claim\n\nThe video is viral with two similar false messages on Facebook (1, 2). It is also being shared on Twitter.\n\nIn conclusion, a year-old video of a scuffle between a group of women in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh was falsely shared as protesters fighting over the distribution of money at Shaheen Bagh. Earlier this week, a photograph of a poster was morphed to suggest that the women are accepting a \u2018fixed rate\u2019 of Rs 500 per day for protesting against CAA.", "lang": "en"}
