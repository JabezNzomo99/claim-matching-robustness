The graphic, which purports to quote the spokesperson as saying President Rodrigo Duterte receives millions of dollars from offshore gaming operations, contains a logo for an online news organisation based in the Philippines. But the graphic has been doctored; the Philippine news organisation, The Inquirer, said it had been digitally altered from an earlier post on its Facebook page; the presidential spokesperson also said the graphic was \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nThis Facebook post shared the graphic on May 4, 2020. The text in the image, which is credited to Philippine online news organisation Inquirer.net, purports to quote remarks made by presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on May 2, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe purported quote and text in the graphic reads: \"There is no favouritism there, on the other hand, 460 million pesos every month goes to the President because of POGO operations while US owned BPO's don't give anything. Its only fair to give POGO's priority because it's them that give, for what are we in power for especially the President if we don't receive anything / Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque / insisting that the government did not show favouritism to Philippine offshore gaming operators / May 2, 2020\".\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \"There DDS what can you say about this? it's clear presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said 460 million every month goes directly to the president, given by his Chinese bff, (POGO)\".\n\n\u201cDDS\u201d refers to \u201cDiehard Duterte Supporters\u201d, while \u201cBPO\u201d and \u201cPOGO\u201d are acronyms for business process outsourcing and Philippine offshore gaming operators respectively.\n\nBPO firms have been allowed to continue operating during the Philippines' COVID-19 lockdown, which has been in place since March 17, 2020. On May 1, the government announced POGO firms can partially resume their operations.\n\nThe same purported Inquirer.net graphic was shared alongside a similar claim here, here and here on Facebook; as well as here on Twitter.\n\nBut the graphic has been doctored.\n\n\u201cThis image has been altered or manipulated by individual/s or group/s out to discredit Inquirer.net,\u201d Abel Ulanday, the publication\u2019s editor-in-chief, told AFP in an email on May 4, 2020.\n\nInquirer.net\u2019s original graphic, which accurately quotes Roque, was published on the site\u2019s Facebook page here. The publication also reported on Roque\u2019s remarks in an article here.\n\nThe original graphic\u2019s quote, as translated in Inquirer.net\u2019s report, reads: \u201cThere\u2019s no favouritism, on the contrary, the equal protection clause provides that all those similarly situated must be treated alike. The IATF approved the resumption of BPOs, that\u2019s already been approved. Pogos are a kind of BPO.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the altered graphic (L) and the original Inquirer.net graphic (R):\n\nThe Philippines' Office of the Presidential Spokesperson also refuted the fake graphic in this Facebook statement on May 3, 2020. \u201cFAKE NEWS ALERT!\u201d Roque\u2019s office wrote.\n\nThis official transcript of Roque\u2019s May 2 briefing contains none of the purported remarks quoted in the doctored graphic. The accurate remarks quoted in the original Inquirer.net graphic are reflected in the transcript.", "lang": "en"}
