The number of imports, so the number of used vehicles that are imported into the country every year, and then we took the average duty.\u201d\n\nHow was the average calculated? Munyori said they used KSh450,000 \u2013 the \u201caverage tax\u201d paid to import a typical saloon car of\n\nKenya raised KSh1.28 trillion in total tax in the 2016/17 financial year, and KSh1.47 trillion in 2017/18. That\u2019s according to the\n\nBut the official data gives different numbers for car imports.\n\nThe national statistics agency says some\n\nwere imported into Kenya in 2017, at a cost of KSh85.22 billion. These were both new and used.\n\nBut the same economic survey\n\nwere landed at the port of Mombasa in 2017, but does not say if any were in transit.\n\nThe agency also publishes a \u201cstatistical abstract\u201d to give a \u201ccomplete time series data of the Kenyan economy from one single official source\u201d. The\n\ngives the number of new and used imports in 2017 as 81,585 motor vehicles and 3,946 buses, trucks and lorries.\n\nAfrica Check has asked the statistics agency to clarify the various figures. We will update this report with their response.\n\nHow many second-hand cars were imported?\n\nThe number of imported used cars could be calculated by deducting the number of imported new cars from the total number of imported cars, the Kenya Revenue Authority told Africa Check.\n\nFor the number of imported new cars, the authority directed us to the\n\n, an umbrella body for carmakers and dealers.\n\nThe association estimated that its members accounted for about 96% of all new motor units sold in Kenya, Frances Cattermole, an official, told us. The organisation\u2019s data shows 10,722 cars were imported into Kenya in 2017, and 14,003 in 2018. These ranged from saloons to buses, trucks and prime movers.\n\nUsing these and the various official figures, all for 2017, the number of used car imports could have ranged between 70,863 and 103,411.\n\nWhat does the import duty total?\n\nHow much revenue did the government earn from taxing motor vehicle imports?\n\nThe data isn\u2019t divided according to new and used vehicles, Paul Agonda, a Kenya Revenue Authority spokesperson, told Africa Check.\n\nThe Kenya Auto Bazaar Association\u2019s KSh49 billion estimate of \u201cannual\u201d taxes on used car imports is higher than the taxman\u2019s KSh47.4 billion figure (in 2017/18) for taxes on\n\nThe revenue agency counts imported new cars in its figure, so the tax from used cars is likely to be even less.\n\nConclusion: KSh49 billion claimed for used car tax is more than total for both new and used car imports\n\nUrging a review of rules they say will hurt their business, used car dealers in Kenya have pleaded with the country\u2019s president for relief.\n\nThey claimed to pay more than KSh49 billion in taxes annually. But the tax agency told Africa Check it collected an average of KSh47.3 billion in the last two financial years.\n\nThis figure is for both new and used car imports, meaning the tax raised from second cars is likely even lower.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim as incorrect.
