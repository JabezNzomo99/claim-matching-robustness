If you and I make the exact same amount of money, we live in the exact same value of house, we have the same kind of car, our kids go to the same kind of schools, shouldn\u2019t we pay the same federal income tax? The answer is yes, but the real world is no. If I live in a high tax state and you live in a low tax state, you actually pay more towards the federal government than I do. And that\u2019s just not fair. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\n \u2013White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, interview on Fox Business Network, Sept. 29\n\nThis has been a feature of the U.S. tax code from the beginning. A Civil War income tax bill passed in 1862 included this provision, and then it became part of the code more than a century ago after the Constitution was amended to allow for an income tax. Over the decades, various presidents or lawmakers have attempted to do away with it \u2013 most notably Ronald Reagan as part of the 1986 overhaul \u2013 but the efforts have always failed.\n\nEvery taxpayer has a choice of taking either a standard deduction or to itemize deductions, which in addition to state and local taxes can include mortgage payments, charitable contributions and medical expenses above a certain threshold. For most people, especially those who do not own their homes, the standard deduction is larger than itemized deductions \u2013 and Trump administration proposes to boost the standard deduction. Currently, about 30 percent of tax filers opt for the itemized deduction \u2013 and virtually all take the SALT deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. Among taxpayers making more than $100,000, 81 percent claimed the SALT deduction.\n\nThe alternative minimum tax (which Trump also proposes to eliminate) takes away this deduction from many wealthy taxpayers. (The AMT also takes away the personal and dependent exemption \u2013 something else Trump has pledged to eliminate). If the SALT deduction and the dependent exemption were eliminated from the AMT, the number of tax filers facing the AMT would drop by 95 percent, according to the Joint Committee of Taxation.\n\nProponents say without the deduction, taxpayers face double taxation. That\u2019s because without the SALT deduction, taxpayers are paying taxes on income that has already been given to the state or local governments in the form of taxes. The income tax rate in California is as high as 13.3 percent and in New York 8.82 percent. If you live in New York City, there\u2019s an additional income tax rate as high as 3.876 percent, for a total of nearly 12.7 percent.\n\nMcCarthy put it another way \u2013 that the low-tax states are subsidizing the high-tax states because the taxpayers in those states can\u2019t deduct as much from their taxes. Indeed six states\u2014California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania\u2014claim more than half of the value of all state and local tax deductions nationwide, according to IRS data. (Texas has no state income tax.)\n\nAs it happens, the high-tax states also tend to be the wealthiest states \u2013 and also blue states in presidential elections. Under this particular provision, one could perhaps make the case that they are being subsidized by low-tax states. But when you step back and look at the total revenue and spending picture, blue states could make the case that they are subsidizing other states, as various reports show they receive far less in federal spending than they pay in federal taxes.\n\nA report released on Oct. 3 by the New York State Comptroller said that New York generated 9.4 percent of the federal government\u2019s income-tax receipts, even though it represented 6.1 percent of the U.S. population. It received 5.9 percent of federal spending allocated to the states. According to the report, New York contributed $12,914 per capita in tax revenue to the federal budget \u2014 but received $10,844 in per capita federal spending. The problem has only gotten worse in the three years since the report was last produced, state officials said.\n\nNew York gets 56 cents back for every dollar and California gets 64 cents. But states such as North Dakota, South Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky, West Virginia and Indiana get more than two dollars back in federal spending for every dollar in taxes. (There are some outliers: New Mexico, which votes for Democrats, gets nearly $2.50 back for every dollar, while Nebraska and Ohio, both Republican, get back only about a half-dollar.)\n\nMulvaney, in his TV appearance, offered this example: \u201cWe live in the exact same value of house, we have the same kind of car, our kids go to the same kind of schools, shouldn\u2019t we pay the same federal income tax?\u201d This would be a more compelling argument if the administration had not exempted the mortgage-interest deduction from its drive to make the tax code simpler. Note that Mulvaney carefully said the \u201cexact same value\u201d house \u2014 even though such houses would vary greatly from state to state, as does the cost of mortgages.", "lang": "en"}
