(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking if the quote is authentic. We did not find that it is.\n\nBiden has called himself an optimist before. In 2010, for example, as he gave a speech about U.S.-Israeli relations, but he was talking about \"the prospects for peace,\" not World War II. Or in October 2018, when speaking at Youngstown State University in Ohio.\n\n\"I am an optimist,\" the Vindicator quotes him as saying. \"I am an optimist because I know the history of the journey of this country \u2026 We have always had faith in the ability of ordinary people to do extraordinary things.\"\n\nBut we didn\u2019t find evidence that Biden ever blamed Germany for the Pearl Harbor bombing. (Japan was responsible.) When we searched for the quote in connection with Joe Biden in Nexis, a database of news stories, there were no results. Looking for news stories connecting the former veep to Germany and Pearl Harbor, we turned up instances of other politicians erring on the attack\u2019s history.\n\nIn 2012, Keith Ellison, then one of Minnesota\u2019s congressmen, said \"they attacked Pearl Harbor\" on Fox News as Bill O\u2019Reilly talked about Nazi Germany.\n\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump misquoted Franklin D. Roosevelt, who on Dec. 8, 1941, called the bombing a day earlier \"a date which will live in infamy.\" (Trump tweeted, \"\u2018A day that will live in infamy!\u2019\") That same year, Melania Trump tweeted about the attack and said it occurred in November before reposting the message with the right date, Politico then reported.\n\nWe also found a 2014 Christian Science Monitor story that wonders if Joe Biden is the John Belushi of the Democratic Party. In it, Washington editor Peter Grier quotes a rousing speech Belushi gives in his oft-quoted role as John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky in the movie \"Animal House.\" Writes Grier:\n\nWith Democrats on the verge of a possibly deflating vote, Mr. Biden played the role of defiant cheerleader this weekend. He sat down with CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger and said he\u2019s not buying all those forecasts that show the GOP making big gains.\n\n\"I don\u2019t agree with the odds makers,\" said Biden. \"I predict we\u2019re going to keep the Senate.\"\n\nOK, so Joe was not as worked up as John Belushi in his famous \"Animal House\" speech. (\"Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? (Expletive) no!\")\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
