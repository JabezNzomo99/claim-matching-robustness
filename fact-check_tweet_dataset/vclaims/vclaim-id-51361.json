The post insinuates this image depicts the Battle of Adwa in 1896. However, this is false. The photograph was taken at the end of World War 2 and shows an American soldier guarding German prisoners of war.\n\nThe post, which we\u2019ve archived here, says \u201cItalian troops surrendered to Ethiopian army (sic)\u201d after a failed invasion of the African country in 1896, known as the Battle of Adwa.\n\nPublished on June 25, 2020, the post alludes to this battle, which is commemorated each year in Ethiopia.\n\nThe black and white photograph included in the post shows a black soldier with a rifle in one hand and a dagger in the other, guarding a troop of white soldiers. The captives all have their hands up.\n\nThe same image was also shared in a French post claiming it showed a Congolese officer of the Belgian colonial army fighting the Italians in 1940.\n\nSimilar claims about the origin of the soldier were shared on groups managed from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom.\n\nBoth claims are false: the black soldier is American and his prisoners of war are Germans.\n\nA reverse image search using Google revealed the image comes from the National Archives of the US government. A \u201csoldier of the 12th Armored Division stands guard over a group of Nazi prisoners captured in the surrounding German forest,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nAnother reverse image search with TinEye led to an article published by The Atlantic in October, 2011 entitled \u201cWorld War II: The fall of Nazi Germany\u201d, in which the same photograph was reproduced.\n\nThe caption is similar to that in the US National Archives, but it dates the photograph by Associated Press (AP) to 1945. It also states that the location is an unknown forest in Germany.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check, writer Alan Taylor confirmed the image used in his article for The Atlantic was licensed from AP.\n\nWho is the American soldier?\n\nAFP Fact Check can reveal the American soldier was Private Jesse Barkley of D Company, 17th Armored Infantry Battalion, 12th Armored Division.\n\nWilliam Lenches, executive director of the 12th Armored Division Memorial Museum in Abilene, Texas, said Barkley was \u201cpositively identified\u201d in 2011 by Walter Gaines, who served in the 17th Armored Infantry Battalion.\n\nLenches explained that about 600 African American soldiers served in combat in World War 2 as riflemen within the Armored Infantry Battalions of the 12th Armored Division. These men were part of companies A, B, and C, and were collectively designated as the D company.\n\nThe 12th Armored Division adopted the nickname \u201cHellcats\u201d and went into battle in the European Theatre of Operations in 1944. About the time the photograph was taken in March 1945, they were moving east across the Rhine river in Germany towards eventual victory.\n\nThe precise location of the picture, however, is a mystery, as Lenches explained: \u201cSignal Corps photographers were forbidden from tagging photographs with specific locations during the war in the interests of Operational Security.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
