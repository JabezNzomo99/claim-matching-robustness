Students, homemakers, those discouraged from looking for work and others are not part of the labour force.\n\u2022 None The 39% rate is not supported by census data, or by statistics bureau officials. Kenya\u2019s most recent official youth unemployment rate is 11.4%. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic straining economies around the world, the public conversation is shifting to its consequences \u2013 including unemployment.\n\nhis government\u2019s economic interventions during the crisis, saying the \u201cpossibility of job losses and loss of income\u201d would weigh heavily on many.\n\nAccurate data will be important in any public debate on the economic measures needed. In late February 2020, a national newspaper\n\narticle. The paper said that \u201cmore than a third of Kenya\u2019s youth who are eligible for work have no jobs\u201d, adding to the country\u2019s \u201cacute unemployment problem\u201d.\n\ncensus data released a few days earlier which showed \u201cthat 5,341,182 or 38.9 percent of the 13,777,600 young Kenyans are jobless\u201d.\n\nThis figure, it said, was backed by the estimates of others such as the World Bank which showed that in 2015, Kenya at 17% had \u201cthe highest rate of youth joblessness in East Africa\u201d.\n\nhas released some results of its August 2019\n\nThe census put the country\u2019s population at\n\nBut are 38.9% of eligible young Kenyans unemployed? Put another way, is this the country\u2019s youth unemployment rate? We took a closer look at the evidence.\n\nJoblessness does not always translate to unemployment, the journalist who wrote the Business Daily article told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe 39% who are not in any meaningful economic activity could be full time students, they could be people who are incapacitated, or they could be people who have given up looking for a job,\u201d the journalist said.\n\n\u201cSo, if somebody is reading the story with a stricter understanding of what unemployment is, they may end up feeling misled by the story.\u201d\n\nWho are the youth in Kenya?\n\n\u201cyouth\u201d as people who \u201chave attained the age of eighteen years; but have not attained the age of thirty-five years\u201d.\n\n, the statistics bureau gave the number of Kenyans aged 18 to 34 as\n\nIf the lower age group figure is used, the total number of unemployed works out at 5,185,074, or 38.1%. Using the larger one, the number of unemployed is 5,341,182, or 38.8% \u2013 close to the paper\u2019s calculation of 38.9%.\n\nWe asked a number of experts if the figure was accurate.\n\nWho are the unemployed?\n\nBased on the census data, \u201cthe 39% figure is not correct\u201d,\n\nFor the details, he directed us to Robert Nderitu,\n\nNderitu said the error in the paper\u2019s calculation was that a significant number of the population, such as \u201cfull time students, homemakers and the incapacitated\u201d, were outside the labour force.\n\nin addition to these groups, retired people and people who are either too young or too old to work are also counted as being outside the labour force. All these groups are \u201cformally referred to as the economically inactive\u201d.\n\nThe labour force therefore counts both the employed and the unemployed, but not the economically inactive. This means there are people who are not working for reasons other than an unsuccessful search for employment.\n\nThese people should have been excluded from the calculation, Nderitu said. When calculating the unemployment rate, \u201cthe focus should be on the labour force\u201d, he said.\n\nFor those aged 18 to 34, the census\n\n8,436,418 were employed. Another 1,647,484 were seeking work while 3,534,560 were not in the labour force.\n\nNderitu said the data agency \u201cusually follows the professionally laid down guidelines in computing the unemployment rates\u201d.\n\nOne such guideline, he said, was the \u201cstrict measure\u201d. Here a person could only be considered unemployed if they:\n\u2022 None had not worked or held a job within the reference period (\n\u2022 None had taken specific steps to look for a job within the reference period (four weeks)\n\u2022 None were available to pick up a job if offered one \n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists told Africa Check that using the total of 13,777,600 of young Kenyans without discounting the economically active skewed the unemployment calculation.\n\n\u201cThat is not correct,\u201d he said of the 39% figure.\n\n\u201cYou may have a total population of a cohort. That total population does not necessarily translate into the labour force, because out of this 13.8 million, we have those who are in school, those who are employed, those who are not employed but not necessarily looking for employment during the reference period.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThose people who are in school, even if the jobs were available, they would not pick them, because they are not active labour market participants. We also have discouraged job seekers.\u201d\n\non looking for work or starting some form of self employment.\n\n, the chief executive of the\n\n, agreed the 39% figure was not the youth unemployment rate.\n\nOwino said this rate considers the entire labour force, but \u201cthese things usually depend on definitions\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomebody who is in school, usually in education or some kind of training, is not considered unemployed because they are not looking for a job and unable to find it,\u201d he said.\n\nThis number tends to be large, and if this was not accounted for, the figure of 39% would be \u201coverstated\u201d, Owino said.\n\nThe most recent official data on youth unemployment is the\n\nreleased in March 2018. This gave the rate as 11.4%. New\n\nreleased by the agency on 31 March 2020 did not give this rate, with the agency\n\nAfrica Check that the \u201cstrict\u201d definition of unemployment \u2013 that you have to be looking for work \u2013 could often be difficult to explain to the public.\n\nA discouraged person \u2013 someone who has given up on looking for work or starting some form of self-employment \u2013 is considered economically inactive.\n\nOwino said these people \u201care unemployed in the factual sense, but they are not unemployed in the sense of what that [strict] measurement adopts\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Youth unemployment high, but 39% not supported by official data\n\nTo highlight what it said was an \u201cacute\u201d unemployment problem in Kenya, the Business Daily said the country\u2019s youth unemployment rate was 39%, citing new 2019 census data from the national statistics office.\n\nBut the data does not support this figure, the statistics office and economists told Africa Check.\n\nThe most recent unemployment rate was 11.4%. Newer data is in the pipeline, the data agency said.\n\nAccurate data is needed to inform both the public debate and policy aimed at tackling what is undeniably an acute problem.", "lang": "en"}
