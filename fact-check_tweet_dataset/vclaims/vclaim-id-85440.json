Fred Bergsten, senior fellow and founding director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Bergsten was one of the first people to call attention to China\u2019s currency manipulation in the 2003-to-2014 period, when China bought more than $300 billion a year to artificially keep the currency weak.\n\nSo it would be no surprise that Trump would have to give up on this pledge, since it would be rather difficult for the Treasury Department to argue that China met the legal requirements for currency manipulation. (In any case, all the label means is that the treasury secretary would begin negotiations to try to deal with the situation.)\n\nBut look at how Trump\u2019s statements have evolved. In recent weeks, he has begun to claim that China stopped manipulating the currency because he was elected \u2014 or even because he raised the issue during the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that China is a bully to us, and they come out with statements \u2014 No, no, it\u2019s fair trade. It\u2019s not fair trade. They send their stuff here. We send over there. We pay tax and we pay tariffs and we pay all sorts of things. It\u2019s not fair. What they do to their currency and manipulation makes it impossible for our companies to compete.\u201d (June 17, 2015)\n\n\u201cI will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad. And I don\u2019t blame them. They\u2019ve been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop. So easy to stop.\u201d (Oct. 22, 2016)\n\n\u201cEvery other country lives on devaluation. You look at what China\u2019s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market, and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.\u201d (Jan. 31, 2017)\n\n\u201cI did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they \u2014 as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They\u2019re not going \u2014 it\u2019s not going down anymore, their currency. \u2026 I would say that I was the one that got them to stop.\u201d (April 30)\n\n\u201cFirst of all, since I started running, they haven\u2019t increased their \u2014 you know, they have not manipulated their currency. I think that was out of respect to me and the campaign. But literally, since when I \u2014 when it looked like I was starting to win the Republican primaries, which was actually pretty early, but they haven\u2019t been.\u201d (May 1)\n\nBut now he earns another Four Pinocchios for falsely claiming that China stopped manipulating its currency because a) he was elected or b) he took the oath of office or c) he started running for the president. China stopped manipulating its currency well before Trump ever announced he was running for president. As Bergsten put it, \u201cThis is a really tall one.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
