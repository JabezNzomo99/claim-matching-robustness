In the viral message, Indian Oil is alleged to have issued a warning that suggests, due to an increase in temperature do not fill excess of petrol in your vehicle. Otherwise, an explosion can happen. Vishvas team investigated and found that the viral message is fake. Indian Oil did not give any such warning.\n\nA Facebook page named \u2018RTI Club Uttarakhand\u2019 has uploaded the viral message. The message has also been shared by various users on Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp. The viral message reads: In the coming days, the temperature is expected to increase. This can cause an explosion in fuel tanks. This week, 5 explosion accidents happened due to excessive petrol.\n\nVishvas News team started its investigation by visiting the website of Indian Oil, iocl.com. We saw an announcement on the homepage. It stated: \u201cThere are rumours in social media that Indian Oil has given a warning to the following effect: Due to increase in temperature please don\u2019t fill petrol to the maximum limit of the tank; it will cause an explosion in the fuel tank. Indian Oil would like to disown this statement.\u201d Indian Oil further clarified that: \u201cAutomobile manufacturers design their vehicles considering all aspects of performance requirements, claims, and ambient conditions with built-in safety factors. The maximum volume specified in the fuel tank for petrol/diesel vehicles is no exception. It is, therefore perfectly safe to fill the fuel in vehicles up to the full limit (max.) as specified by the manufacturer irrespective of winter or summer.\u201d\n\nVishvas News team used the Twitter Advanced Search option in InVid tool to find related tweets on Indian Oil\u2019s Twitter account. We found a tweet dated June 16, 2018, in which full message can be seen.\n\nThe tweet was also made last year.\n\nWe further investigated by visiting the Facebook page of Indian Oil. We found the same post as was tweeted by Indian Oil. The Facebook post was uploaded on April 27, 2019.\n\nWe contacted the head office of Indian Oil. We were told by an official that the post is fake and has been shared multiple times across social media. There is no truth in it.\n\nWe performed social scanning of the Facebook page \u2018RTI Club Uttarakhand\u2019 which shared the claim. The page has 2248 followers.\n\nVishvas News team investigated and found that the viral warning in the name of Indian Oil is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
