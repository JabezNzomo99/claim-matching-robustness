The same video (archived) is shared as that from a COVID-19 quarantine facility at the Trade Centre in Chennai, and also from Hyderabad. Let\u2019s find out where this dance video was filmed.\n\nClaim: Video of people dancing to the Lungi Dance song at a quarantine centre in Mumbai. Fact: The video is not filmed in any quarantine centre in Mumbai. It is captured at the quarantine centre for COVID-19 patients at Hapania Exhibition Centre in Agartala, Tripura. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe description of the video posted on Facebook mentions that the video was tweeted by Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Nitesh Rane. So when searched for that tweet it is found that a few replied to his tweet with a tweet by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which mentions that the video is not from NSCI or any other quarantine facility in Mumbai.\n\nMany have also replied to Nitesh Rane\u2019s tweet with an article from India.com which mentions that the video is from a quarantine centre in Tripura. BMC has also responded to his tweet with the same article.\n\nAnother video of this dance was uploaded on the YouTube channel of Inside Northeast which mentions that this video is from the Hapania COVID-19 facility in Tripura. The same has been reported by \u2018NDTV\u2018 and \u2018Zee News\u2018. On 19 May 2020, Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb has announced to set up a 1000-bed centre at the TIDC Exhibition centre, Hapania. He has later shared the pictures of the facility mentioning that it can accommodate 400 beds and will be managed by Tripura Medical College (TMC). One can notice the similarities between these pictures and the facility where the Lungi Dance video is shot.\n\nTo sum it up, the video of people dancing to the popular Lungi Dance song at a quarantine centre in Tripura is shared as that from a quarantine facility in Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
