Another fact check organisation got a bigger and un-cropped version of this picture and they also geo-located this place to Dubai. We have made necessary amendments in the story.\n\nAt a time governments and health experts around the world are stressing on social distancing to contain the spread of coronavirus, a photo of Muslims offering namaaz in groups on rooftops has gone viral on social media.\n\nMany on social media thought the picture to be from India. The photo is going viral on Twitter and Facebook with the caption, \u201cWhen about them, Narendra Modi ji? They least care for your request, appeal, etc. Will they also face the law, since they don\u2019t seem to obey the law atleast willingly\u201d. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nOn the other hand, many, including filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri, are wondering as to where the image is from.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photo to be false. This photo of namaaz in groups is from Dubai. However, similar incidents have been reported in India too.\n\nUsing reverse search, we found that an Arabic website \u201cHowiyaPress\u201d had used this picture in an article dated April 13, 2020. The translation of this article says that the photo was taken in a town called Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh in Kuwait.\n\nA news portal called \u201cKhalejia News\u201d had tweeted the video showing Muslims offering prayers in groups on rooftops. Here too, the caption says it is Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh town in Kuwait.\n\nAn article by \u201cArab News\u201d dated April 9 says Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh is under two-week complete isolation due to the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThough this particular photo is from Dubai, similar incidents have been reported in India as well. A report by \u201cDainik Bhaskar\u201d says that a few days back, some people gathered on a rooftop for namaaz in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh. When police tried to stop them, they were attacked and some received injuries too.\n\nHowever, it is clear that the viral photo of Muslims offering namaaz in groups on rooftops was taken in Dubai and not India.", "lang": "en"}
