The law changes CSIS from a surveillance agency to one with powers to disrupt security threats. The government has responded that the bill includes oversight alongside new powers.\n\nOn the question of oversight, Steven Blaney, minister of public safety, said \u201cevery time the right of Canadians or other people could be infringed, CSIS will need to go and seek a warrant from a judge.\u201d\n\nBill C-51 does require CSIS to get judicial warrants, but only for some activities, and C-51 uses different language than the minister.\n\nIt says the agency must seek a warrant in order to take measures that \u201cwill contravene a right or freedom guaranteed by the [Charter] or will be contrary to other Canadian law\u201d (section 12.1(3)).\n\nBlaney said \u201ccould\u201d (form of \u201ccan\u201d) instead of \u201cwould\u201d (form of \u201cwill\u201d). It\u2019s just one word, but no minor difference when the issue is the threshold at which CSIS must seek a judicial warrant for disruption activities.\n\nCraig Forcese and Kent Roach, both experts in national security law, also note the one-word difference between certainty and possibility. They wrote that section 12.1(3) \u201conly requires such a warrant where \u201cmeasures\u201d \u201cwill\u201d (not \u201cmay\u201d) contravene a Charter right or Canadian law. Other measures that do not go this far presumptively do not require a judicial warrant, and the only oversight in this instance will be internal, executive branch controls.\u201d\n\nActivities that could contravene the law constitute a broader category than activities that would do so.\n\nA government backgrounder on the bill likewise uses different language than Blaney. It too indicates certainty about a violation, not mere possibility: \u201cCSIS would need a court warrant whenever proposed threat disruption measures contravene Charter rights or would otherwise be contrary to Canadian law.\u201d\n\nIt is misleading to say that CSIS needs a warrant under C-51 for activities that \u201ccould\u201d contravene the law. That\u2019s broader than the language used in the bill. Warrants are only required for disruption activities that \u201cwill\u201d contravene the Charter or other Canadian law.\n\nBlaney did not respond to requests to clarify his remark.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
