The story there opened:\n\nA 35-year old man in Beijing China, whose name is Wong, went for a fish spa session to relax, but ended up killing all the fish, Buzzflare reported. According to World of Buzz, Wong has been working in an IT company for over 10 years and since he works overtime almost every day, he almost never has time for himself.\n\n8shit.net does come with a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that says:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website. All its content is fiction (except those posts under the \"serious\" category) and shouldn't be taken as real. All references, names and marks or institutions in this website are used as contextual elements, like in any novel or science-fiction story.\n\nIn this case the article was filed under the \"Society\" category so we have to assume the story is fictional.\n\nHowever the story points to this Buzzflare article (archive) as the source and that one references this story at World of Buzz (archive) which in turn pointed to a (now deleted) article on Sina as the original source. Fortunately a version of the article was still available in the Google cache (archived here).\n\nIn that version of the story the name of the man is \"Wang Qiang\" and no location for the story is given. It also sounds more like a morality tale teaching a lesson about body hygiene instead of a real news report.\n\nThe original Chinese version of the article ends with this disclaimer:\n\nOr, according to Google Translate:\n\nGiven that the original story has now been deleted and that the originating site already had a disclaimer on the story saying they couldn't vouch for the authenticity we are going to assume this story is false.", "lang": "en"}
