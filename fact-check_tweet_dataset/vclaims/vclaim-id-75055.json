If we turned around to retrieve it when we forgot it? If we carried it with us always, even a small pocket version? If we read God\u2019s messages in the Bible like we read messages on the mobile phone?\"\n\nThat sounds like a leader devoted to the Bible. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
