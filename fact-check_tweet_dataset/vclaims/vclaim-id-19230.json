Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: The incident in the video took place in Rajasthan, not in Jammu and Kashmir. The man in the video immolated himself and tried to catch the officers (Police Department and Forest Department, not the Indian Army), who came to remove his family from the encroached land. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, an article published by Dainik Bhaskar on this incident can be found in the search results. According to that article, the man set himself on fire and tried to catch the officers when they came to ask him and his family to vacate the encroached forest land. Some families in Gudha village of Gudha Gorji town (Rajasthan) have illegally occupied the forest land and have been living on the land from several years. Upon receiving a complaint, the Forest Department, along with the Police Department, went there to remove the encroachment. While some people resisted by throwing stones at the officers, one man immolated himself and tried to catch the officers.\n\nTo sum it up, a self-immolation video from Rajasthan is being shared as the Indian Army\u2019s attack on Kashmiris.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
