What is the need for the army? Whatever I have done so far, is after taking you into confidence.\u201d\n\nLater in the video, from 8:45- 10:30, he said, \u201cThose in our machinery like doctors, nurses, conservancy workers, revenue staff and police are under immense strain. Some policemen are falling sick and some have lost their lives while fighting for us. They are human beings and all of them need rest. Hence, I have a plan in my mind, but please do not misunderstand this. I want to request the Centre for additional manpower to give the police relief in phases for a few days. Some unwell police need time to be cured. We may ask the Centre for additional manpower, but this may be misinterpreted as the army being deployed. But, it is not so. This is meant to give relief to the tired police force. Our measures are well-rounded, we are arranging for hospital, doctors and police. I am telling this to you today, so that fear and misunderstandings do not creep into your minds as this happens.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same day, t he official account of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai debunked the viral text.\n\nPress Information Bureau Maharashtra also tweeted refuting the claims made in the viral message.\n\nThe false message is therefore viral on social media claiming that Mumbai and Pune will be under military lockdown where essential items and services will not be accessible.", "lang": "en"}
