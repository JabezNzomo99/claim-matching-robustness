When a local authority decides that a child should be placed in foster care, it can do this either by using its own network of foster carers or working with fostering agencies that have their own networks of carers. Barnardo\u2019s is such an agency.\n\nA spokesperson for Barnardo\u2019s told Full Fact: \u201cThe Local Authority would initially look at their own carers to find a suitable match before forwarding the referral onto external agencies.\u201d\n\nSo an increase in referrals to Barnardo\u2019s could, for example, reflect that local authorities are struggling to find enough carers within their own networks. That\u2019s obviously still a concern, but it doesn\u2019t definitely mean the number of children needing to be fostered in the first place has increased.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not certain that the increase in referrals to Barnardo\u2019s is representative of the situation across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, being just one of many fostering agencies that work to place children in foster care.\n\nA spokesperson for Barnardo\u2019s said: \u201cit would be fair to say that it\u2019s uncertain whether other fostering agencies have seen the same increase in referrals.\u201d\n\nThe most recent data for England is from March 2019, and showed 56,160 children were living with foster families. This was up from 54,740 the year before.\n\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe have published guidance online for anyone interested in becoming a foster parent. During the pandemic we have also made it easier for councils and fostering agencies to identify potential placements, and to assess and approve new foster carers, so that children get the support they deserve without delay.\u201d\n\nWe also asked the Local Government Association for any information it had on the number of children with foster care needs during the pandemic.\n\nCouncillor Judith Blake, Chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s Children and Young People Board said: \u201cCouncils continue to do an excellent job ensuring that children have access to support despite the difficulties experienced during the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\n\n\u201cCouncils have been encouraging applicants from people of all backgrounds who are interested in fostering and adoption, and will continue to support those who are able to provide a stable home for children in care.\"", "lang": "en"}
