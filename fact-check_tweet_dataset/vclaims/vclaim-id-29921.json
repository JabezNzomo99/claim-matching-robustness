Disgusting,\u201d tweeted Mahesh Vikram Hedge, the founder of fake news website Postcard News, on January 20.\n\nHis tweet, blaming the Muslim community for planting a bomb in Mangalore International Airport, was liked over 2,500 times and retweeted more than 1,000 times before he took it down. An archived version can be accessed here.\n\nAnother tweet by Pratheesh Viswanath that same day alleged, \u201cJihadis are looking for ways to penetrate and hit.\u201d Vishwanath is followed by BJP Delhi Spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. His tweet reads, \u201cBomb found in a left over bag at Mangalore airport. Jihadis are looking for ways to penetrate and hit. Be careful all. Inform to authorities abt any suspicious activities seen around. Inform if seeing any left over bags or anything. Be careful abt jihadis.\u201d\n\nViswanath is a member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and had led a strike against the Supreme Court order allowing women\u2019s entry in Kerala\u2019s Sabarimala temple.\n\nAfter a quick keyword search, Alt News came across newspaper reports from January 22, according to which the suspect\u2019s name is Aditya Rao. He surrendered before the police, claiming that he had planted Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) at the Mangalore International Airport. The police had recovered the explosives on January 20. Rao confessed two days later.\n\nAccording to The Hindu, \u201cThe city police are investigating as to whether Aditya Rao, who is suspected to have placed an explosive at the Mangaluru International Airport on January 20, had done so as an \u201cact of vengeance\u201d or if there were others who might have set him up for the task.\u201d\n\nAn article from Times of India says, \u201cLast year, he [Rao] had made a series of hoax bomb calls to Bengaluru\u2019s Kempegowda International Airport for which he was arrested by the cops.\u201d\n\nMahesh Vikram Hegde and Pratheesh Viswanath blamed the Muslim community before the police revealed the name of the suspect. Hegde deleted his tweet after it was reported two days that the suspect is Aditya Rao.\n\nEarlier, a photograph of an RSS worker was shared to falsely claim that he is Aditya Rao.", "lang": "en"}
