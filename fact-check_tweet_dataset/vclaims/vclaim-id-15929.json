He alleged that bricks were thrown at the rally from inside the campus and TMCP members also set ablaze motorcycles and vandalised Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar\u2019s statue. The purported student claimed that BJP workers could not have desecrated the statue as it\u2019s located deep inside the campus. \u201cYou need to cross two gates \u2013 one iron and another wooden door \u2013 to reach the statue located completely inside the college premises. And TMCP was already inside the campus with bricks,\u201d he wrote. The Facebook post was earlier tweeted by MP Swapan Dasgupta and right-wing influencer Vikas Pandey.

However, the same message has been shared by numerous people, with some circulating it in the first person. This was pointed out by many Facebook users. Posted by Avik Kumar Mondal on Tuesday, May 14, 2019 The circulation of the identical message was also noticed on Twitter. One user sarcastically wrote, \u201cToday, entire Facebook is \u2018I am a Vidyasagar student\u2019.\u201d In this article, Alt News attempts to fact-check the claims made in the Facebook post. Claim 1: First Brick Was Thrown From Inside the College Campus There are neither ground reports nor visuals circulating on social media that back the allegation that the violence was started after a brick was thrown from inside the college campus. Local news organisation Anandabazar\u2019s ground report shows stones being hurled inside the college premises by people standing outside on the road, wearing saffron coloured \u2018NaMo Again\u2019 t-shirts. The footage does not show any person throwing stones from inside the campus.\n\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a clip to support the allegation that the violence was started by the TMC. He captioned the clip as, \u201cAnother video which shows TMC had strategically planted thugs to create riot like situation during BJP President\u2019s road show.\u201d But the video incidentally does nothing to help Malviya\u2019s claims. The clip shows the police trying to keep out BJP supporters who can be seen pushing the barricades. The people on the other side of the barrier, claimed to be TMC workers by Malviya, are only raising slogans and waving black flags. In fact, one of them holds up a bottle to the camera to show that it was thrown by BJP workers. Another video which shows TMC had strategically planted thugs to create riot like situation during BJP President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s road show. The question is why? What was the motivation? Is TMC whipping up sentiment to save its political turf? TMC is a shame on Bengal. #SaveBengalSaveDemocracy pic.twitter.com/xeDBzQwgfj \u2014 Chowkidar Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 15, 2019 The Facebook post also claimed that TMCP members set ablaze motorcycles. But video footage from the ground shows men in saffron t-shirts setting the bikes on fire. This takes place outside the campus, as evident from the clip. Bikes torched during Amit Shah's Kolkata rally from Alt News on Vimeo. Another video shot from an elevated position shows the moment when the arson takes place. This footage gives a panoramic view of the site of violence. The bikes are burnt right outside the college gates that is surrounded by BJP supporters. They can be seen sporting saffron t-shirts and waving the party flag.

The one vandalised in the violence was located close to the main building\u2019s gate. It is true that one has to pass an iron gate, which is the main gate, and a wooden door to get to the statue. However, there is barely any distance between the access points. The image below shows the frontal view of the area where the violence took place. As evident, the main gate is iron, behind which are multiple wooden doors. We have already shown while fact-checking \u2018Claim 4\u2019 that BJP workers entered the premises by repeatedly thrashing the gate and thus, breaking the lock. The party\u2019s chief and the viral social media post tried to build a narrative around the iron gate, attempting to propagate that it is indestructible. A gate, iron or wooden, is as strong as its lock. The misleading emphasis around the durability of the \u2018iron gate\u2019 is aimed at misleading people.\n\nThe video posted below shows moments after the college gate was breached. Several individuals can be seen charging at wooden doors behind the iron gate. A few persons who have successfully opened the doors, bring with them what looks like parts of a white coloured sculpture. At 0:13, we can see a white object, seemingly made of plaster of Paris, being brought out and thrown around. At 0:21, the same white object is hurled to the ground. From 0:28-0:41, the object remains untouched. At 0:42, a person picks it up and thrashes it again. At least two men in the video can be seen wearing BJP\u2019s colours.

Photographs published by The Telegraph show ruins of Vidyasagar\u2019s bust, which was kept inside a glass enclosure \u2013 the same enclosure that was broadcast by Amit Shah during his press conference. BJP supporters tailing Amit Shah's vehicle broke into & ransacked the offices of Vidyasagar College, destroying a bust of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar. Some women students alleged that the intruders tugged at their dupattas and even tried to touch them.\n\n\n\nREAD: https://t.co/qCBNW3Se70 pic.twitter.com/yuimMydVbB \u2014 The Telegraph (@ttindia) May 15, 2019 According to The Telegraph, \u201cPrincipal Goutam Kundu, who said he was shocked while speaking minutes after the attack between 6.50pm and 7.05pm on Tuesday, described how a group broke open the gate and stormed the office and went for the glass case.\u201d A video posted by Amit Malviya shows moments after Vidyasagar\u2019s bust was vandalised when CM Mamata Banerjee inspects the site. The clip depicts the same location where the statue was being destroyed. It\u2019s noteworthy that the second part of Malviya\u2019s tweet \u2013 the broken statue was neatly placed for her \u2013 is misleading because we have already substantiated from earlier videos that though the statue was placed inside a glass enclosure, the enclosure was broken and the statue was hurled right outside the wooden doors. #Vidyasagar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bust was kept in a glass chamber inside a room (as reported by Telegraph) in the college campus but Mamata Banerjee inspected the broken statue, which was neatly placed for her and media outside. Question is why did she not go to the site? #SaveBengalSaveDemocracy pic.twitter.com/0CQOzM3uxg \u2014 Chowkidar Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 15, 2019 Why Allow PM\u2019s Rallies?: Mamata, Yechury Slam EC\u2019s WB Campaign Ban", "lang": "en"}
