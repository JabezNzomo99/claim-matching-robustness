And do online attacks cost the country billions a year?\n\nSabric \u201chas never made a public statement about South Africa having the third highest cybercrime victims in the world, or that cybercrime victims in South Africa are losing about R2.2 billion a year to cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Louise Tordiffe told Africa Check.\n\nShe said the organisation did not have enough information on the number of victims, as many crimes were not reported.\n\nThe Timeslive story was based on a press release by public relations firm\n\n. The firm provided four news articles as the source of its numbers.\n\nAll circled back to Sabric but one, by BizConnect,\n\nthe numbers to a report by digital security company\n\nThe report said 73% of South Africans were victims of cybercrime in 2013, the third highest rate in the world after Russia (85%) and China (77%). It estimated the cost of cybercrime in South Africa at US$300 million, or about R2.9 billion at\n\nThe data was collected from an online survey of 13,022 adults aged 18 to 64 in 24 countries, from 4 July 2013 to 1 August 2013. In South Africa, 500 people who owned at least one mobile device were polled, Duffourg said.\n\nThe survey asked people to identify if they had experienced different types of online crime. The examples they were given included:\n\u2022 None Computer viruses or malicious software appeared on my computer.\n\u2022 None I responded to a forged, \u201cspoofed\u201d or fake email or website which captured my personal details such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information thinking it was a legitimate request in order to access information or provide information to a legitimate organisation, such as my bank, etc.\n\u2022 None An app appeared on my smartphone that I didn\u2019t download.\n\u2022 None My smartphone was lost or stolen and someone found it and used it without my permission. \n\n\n\nDuffourg noted that \u201cthis data would now be considered out of date as the survey was carried out five years ago\u201d.\n\nShe said Norton\u2019s most recent survey was\n\n\u201coverall, 67% of South Africans have experienced some form of online crime - compared to 48% globally\u201d. It raised the annual cost of online crime to R35.2 billion.\n\nBut South Africa was not ranked that year as it was surveyed six months after other countries, she said.\n\n(NMU), told Africa Check it would be impossible to tell if the ranking were reliable without knowing the full methods the researchers used.\n\nHow the people in the survey were chosen would be significant, he said. \u201cIf approaches were made in places where victims of cybercrime, or even people interested in cybercrime, hang out, there may be a selection bias. If not done properly respondents can be primed to provide answers in a certain direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I do know that even if it was 100% accurate in 2013, five years later it will not be accurate anymore \u2013 the field is just moving too fast.\u201d\n\nfor email phishing in 2017 and eighth for spam. But the country does not feature in the top 20 for overall cybercrime. (\n\n\u201cSome [reports] cite the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but don't offer a credible source, and also differ on the ranking,\u201d Goldstuck said. \u201cUltimately, our third-placed ranking looks like an urban legend, which has been quoted often enough for people to assume it to be fact.\u201d\n\nWhat of the billions of rands in losses?\n\nR2.2-billion a year figure \u201cwas a misquote that occurred some years ago, and keeps being re-used\u201d.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, once information is on the internet, it is there permanently, and Sabric has no control over this.\u201d\n\nthat while the amount does not seem \u201ccompletely out of the way\u201d, it \u201cis notoriously difficult to estimate ... as disclosure of losses is not always made\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is a fact is that cybercrime is growing and that we indeed need greater precautions.\u201d\n\nConclusion: No reliable data on South Africa\u2019s global cybercrime ranking or cost\n\nA news site claimed South Africa had the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide and lost about R2.2 billion a year in cyber attacks.\n\nThe global ranking was traced to a report by digital security firm Norton which surveyed 24 countries. The R2.2 billion figure comes from an incorrect quote made years ago and repeated online.\n\nAs the money lost is not always disclosed, it\u2019s difficult to know how much cybercrime costs South Africa.\n\nWhile we rate this claim as unproven, analysts say the cost of online crime in the country is likely much higher.", "lang": "en"}
