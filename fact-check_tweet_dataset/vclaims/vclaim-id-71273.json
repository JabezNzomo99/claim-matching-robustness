The April 1 Facebook post, along with an accompanying article from the website News Break, claims that the library is in danger of never reopening.\n\n\u201cThe Ronald Reagan Library and Museum is asking for help during this coronavirus pandemic,\u201d reads the article. \u201cThe Simi Valley facility has been closed since mid-March, depriving it of much-needed cash since it\u2019s not federally funded.\u201d\n\nThat is not the case, however. The Ronald Reagan Foundation issued a statement April 2 debunking the claim.

The Los Angeles-based affiliate based its original story on a letter obtained by TMZ that said the library was losing $150,000 per week due to its temporary closure, according to the Ventura County Star. The letter was asking donors for money.\n\nFOX 11 has since updated its article to reflect that the library is not in danger of permanently closing.", "lang": "en"}
