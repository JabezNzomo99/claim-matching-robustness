No, that's not true: a UK satire website published an article claiming it happened but it was a joke mocking a different couple who actually named their child \"Adolf Hitler\". The \"Farage Rees-Mogg\" story is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NewsThump on November 13, 2018 titled \"Couple who named child Farage Rees-Mogg face jail\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA couple with extreme beliefs face jail after it was revealed they had named their child Farage Rees-Mogg. The couple, Simon Williams and wife Simone, will be sentenced after a court found them guilty of being 'just awful'. \"The couple obviously harbours some seriously sick beliefs,\" said court official Eleanor Gay.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they may have thought it was actual news:\n\nNigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg are two well-known pro-Brexit politicians in the United Kingdom and naming your child after them is not a jailable crime (even though it would probably be weird and slightly creepy). But the story was actually mocking a different couple who gave their child an unusual name. That couple is actually facing jail but on terrorism charges:\n\nNewsThump comes with an about page that explains what is going on:\n\nWelcome to NewsThump! No, really, we mean it.
