And what better way to illustrate this profligate spending than ... ant research?\n\n \n\n Yep. Ant research. And what\u2019s worse, it\u2019s not research on your run-of-the-mill picnic-destroying ant. It\u2019s exotic ant research.\n\n \n\n Republican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman took a page out of Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s book, dinging Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden in a recent television ad for voting to fund a study of exotic ants.\n\n \n\n After an ominous intro about Oregon\u2019s unemployment rate and the growing national debt, the ad takes its entomological turn: \"Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants,\" a man says to his wife, while shaking his head. \"And you thought he was out of touch.\"\n\n \n\n So does Wyden have a thing for ants or is Huffman making a mountain out of an anthill?\n\n \n\n Well, before we get into all that, let\u2019s take a look at how, exactly, ants found their way into our political picnic in the first place. Back in August 2010, Sens. McCain and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., released a list their top \"100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues.\"\n\n \n\n On Page 6, the Republican senators take aim at a favorite target, San Francisco, and a $1.9 million ant research project based out of the California Academy of Sciences. In short order, this bit of stimulus spending then found its way into the California Senate race and into the political discourse down in Texas.\n\n \n\n So how does it relate to Oregon\u2019s Senate race?\n\n \n\n Wyden did, indeed, vote in favor of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with 60 other senators (including three Republicans and two Independents).\n\n \n\n But that vote, it turns out, didn\u2019t release any money to ant research -- not directly.\n\n \n\n The federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009, according to the foundation\u2019s Website. The foundation is distributing the money using the same peer-review process with which it normally decides on which research to fund.\n\n \n\n As it turns out, one scientist\u2019s study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project\u2019s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.\n\n \n\n \"I think it\u2019s legitimate,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no reason why people shouldn\u2019t challenge this and question what we\u2019re doing.\"\n\n \n\n What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.\n\n \n\n Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. \"You can\u2019t monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,\" he said. \"Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have a functioning ecosystem.\"\n\n \n\n It\u2019s also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher\u2019s last count.\n\n \n\n At Politifact Oregon, we think it would be fair to say that Wyden\u2019s vote did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants. But it happened in such a roundabout way that Huffman\u2019s claim that \"Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants\" is disingenuous. Wyden voted for a bill that, despite being thousands and thousands of words long never mentions the word \"ants.\" Instead it directed more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Oregon rates the claim False.", "lang": "en"}
