Its initial aim was to train 15,000 artisans, water agents and plumbers from 2015/16 to 2017/18. They would fix leaking taps and pipes in their communities, helping promote water conservation. Water agents were tasked with educating the public on how to use water wisely and manage water resources.\n\nZuma was correct when he made this statement in 2016. As of 25 January 2016, 2,897 people were being trained, former department spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase told Africa Check. They included 1,573 artisans, 243 plumbers and 1,081 water agents.\n\nBut how have things progressed since then?\n\nPhase 1 of the project was meant to be completed in the 2015/16 financial year, after 3,000 artisans, plumbers and water agents were trained.\n\nfrom November 2019 show that 1,726 candidates completed their training.\n\nAnother 5,000 were meant to be trained in 2016/17, when phase 2 started.

But a serviced site is not a house. It is a piece of land supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house.\n\nWhen serviced sites were added to Zuma\u2019s figure, the number of \u201chousing opportunities\u201d rose to 4,060,795\n\nHow many more houses has the government provided since then?

These included historically black universities and technikons, historically white universities and technikons, and distance-learning institutions.\n\nAudited data shows that by 2015, enrolment had grown to\n\nstudents at 26 public higher education institutions. Ramaphosa\u2019s claim was therefore correct.\n\nSince then the figure has grown to more than a million. In 2017,\n\nthis claim as \u201ccorrect\u201d based on\n\n.

But he did add that this could be an over or underestimation. Gustafsson was not aware of any updated figures.\n\nBut if early childhood development participation is higher than what is believed, what are the implications? \u201cWe have to worry less about expanding access and more about improving the quality of what already exists,\u201d Gustafsson said.\n\n\u2018The task before us is formidable.\u2019 \u2013 Cyril Ramaphosa, Sona 2019\n\nRamaphosa delivered his second state of the nation\n\nin parliament on 7 February 2019.

Spokesperson Troy Martens said upgrades had been completed at another 88 schools, bringing the total to 787 in 2019.\n\nBut it was difficult to independently verify the department\u2019s numbers. The claim was rated as unproven.\n\nIn October 2019, the department gave an update on the progress so far.\n\nfrom a committee meeting note that when the Safe initiative was launched and a desktop audit conducted, 3,898 schools were identified as needing attention.\n\nFor the 2019/20 financial year, there are 1,007 projects: 880 in the planning stage and 127 under construction. The number of completed projects stands at 188.\n\nThis would bring the total number of completed projects to 975.
