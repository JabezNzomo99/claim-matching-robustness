The tweet has text that reads: \u201cCongratulations to Eton who have achieved their best ever A-Level performance\u201d.\n\nThe false tweet does not appear on Williamson\u2019s timeline. On August 13, Williamson did send a tweet congratulating students who received their grades that day ( here ). However, he did not send a tweet that singled out Eton students.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, the tweet has also not been deleted from his page ( here ).\n\nFalse. Gavin Williamson did not send tweet congratulating Eton students on their \u201cbest ever\u201d A-Level results.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
