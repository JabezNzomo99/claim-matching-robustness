Over at CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said it \u201cwould create several thousand temporary construction jobs and only 35 permanent jobs.\u201d And Barrasso said it would result in \u201c42,000 new jobs.\u201d\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the basics. The Keystone XL pipeline is a construction project, and so the most direct jobs are related to construction. These are basically short-term jobs, lasting on average 19.5 weeks, to assemble the pipeline that would help carry heavy crude oil from Canada\u2019s Alberta province to the Gulf Coast. Over two construction seasons, the main beneficiaries of the project would be Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska \u2014 each would need to hire between 2,700 and 4,000 construction workers \u2014 though Kansas would also hire about 200.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in determining whether the project would last one or two years, the State Department decided to express all of the jobs as an annual figure. So those 4,000 construction workers in Montana who work for 19 weeks were turned into nearly 1,500 jobs on annual basis. All told, 10,400 construction workers, engaged for four- or eight-month periods, are expressed in the State Department report as 3,900 jobs \u2014 one position that is filled one full year \u2014 even though none of the jobs actually last a year.\n\nSchumer thus sticks close to the essence of the report, when he says the pipeline would create \u201cseveral thousand temporary construction jobs,\u201d though he lards it on a bit by adding \u201conly 35 permanent jobs.\u201d That number is in the report, but how many construction projects result in very many permanent jobs?\n\nThis stems from the fact that the project will involve about $3.3 billion in construction contracts and materials, including about $200 million on construction camps. That money would reverberate through the U.S. economy, especially in the states with the construction. About 16,000 jobs (including the nearly 4,000 in construction jobs) would stem from direct spending. For instance, workers in Arkansas have already built about half of the high-strength line pipe needed for the project, some 333,000 tons. (The rest would come from Canada, Italy and India.) Those are clearly jobs that can be attributed to the project, though in the case of the pipe, the work is already done, according to a TransCanada spokesman, Mark Cooper. (See the photo above.)\n\nAn appendix to the State Department report, for instance, says that 634 people would be employed in the \u201carts, entertainment and recreation services\u201d in the United States as a result of Keystone \u2014 and only 138 of those jobs would be in the construction states. No single dancer in New York City is going to get a job because of Keystone, but just as the part-time work of the construction workers adds up to jobs expressed in annual terms, the economic model assumes some of that spending reverberates through the economy and eventually lands in the pockets of people across the country, thus contributing to a portion of their annual wage.\n\nThat\u2019s why the State Department report carefully says the spending during the construction period \u201cwould support a combined total of approximately 42,100 average annual jobs.\u201d It\u2019s not really \u201c42,000 new jobs,\u201d as Barrasso expressed it. In fact, as we noted, some of those jobs have already been completed in anticipation of the project.\n\nThe State Department report adds an important bit of context \u2014 this represents just 0.02 percent of annual economic activity across the nation. Indeed, even the 42,000 figure, inflated though it may be, does not seem very large when compared to the 321,000 jobs added to the economy just in November.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the Keystone XL pipeline will create thousands of jobs for out-of-work Americans who have suffered in the Obama economy,\u201d said Barrasso spokesman Emily Schillinger. \u201cIn fact, the president\u2019s own State Department has confirmed that the Keystone XL pipeline will support over 42,000 jobs. While Washington Democrats champion endless delay and dissect the precise wording of every positive jobs projection, unemployed Americans are demanding action. Instead of ridiculing these good jobs, President Obama and Democrats in Congress should support this project and help more Americans get back to work.\u201d\n\nYes, that 42,000 figure is in the report, but the number requires more context, especially if supporters want to pitch Keystone XL as an infrastructure project that will bring new jobs to the economy. Using the State Department math, it\u2019s safe to say nearly 4,000 construction jobs will be created, at least temporarily. One could even say that 16,000 jobs would be or have been supported from direct spending on the project, such as those pipe makers in Arkansas.\n\nBut \u201c42,000 new jobs\u201d is going too far. Most of those jobs are far from the construction site, and it\u2019s hard to argue they are new. Moreover, under State\u2019s accounting, they only last for a year. For some workers, it would be a good but brief payday. In the context of the U.S. economy, the impact is barely a ripple.", "lang": "en"}
