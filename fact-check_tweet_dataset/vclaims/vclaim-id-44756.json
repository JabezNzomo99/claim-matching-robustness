House Bill 2739 is under consideration and, if passed, it would allow farmers and landowners to sue biotech patent holders like Monsanto for essentially trespassing on their property. The House Bill 2739 summary states that it \u201cAllows cause of action against patent holder for genetically engineered organism present on land without permission of owner or lawful occupant.\u201d Defenders of the bill believe it is a step in the right direction to remedy problems caused by GMOs\n\nThat information was true as far as it went, but some readers who encountered the Natural News article in 2020 \u2060\u2014 particularly through undated reprints on other websites \u2060\u2014 didn\u2019t realize that the article was originally published in March 2017. The bill that article referenced, HB 2739, died in committee without being voted upon in mid-2017 and therefore is no longer before the Oregon Legislature. A similar bill, HB 2882, was introduced in Oregon\u2019s House of Representatives in 2019 and met the same fate of languishing in committee.\n\nDespite the emphasis in the Natural News article\u2019s headline, the Oregon bill simply referenced \u201cgenetically engineered organisms\u201d and did not mention or single out Monsanto (or any other company). Also, Monsanto has since been acquired by Bayer, who opted to drop the Monsanto brand name.", "lang": "en"}
