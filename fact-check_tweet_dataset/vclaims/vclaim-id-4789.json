Tammy Baldwin concerns the Iran deal that President Donald Trump recently withdrew from.\n\nThe deal, Nicholson declared, had \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\"\n\n\n\nNicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are running in the August 2018 Republican primary for the right to challenge Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the November 2018 general election.\n\nThe Delafield businessman made the statement on May 30, 2018, to conservative Green Bay radio talk show host John Muir. It is one he has made repeatedly.\n\nAbout three weeks before Nicholson made the radio claim, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal failed to contain the regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions and regional meddling.\n\nThe easy part of Nicholson\u2019s claim to check is Iran\u2019s connection to terrorism. Iran has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\"\n\nBut let\u2019s get to the thrust of Nicholson\u2019s claim -- that the deal merely \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes\" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it.\n\nThe deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future.\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t just merely turning over cash to Iran.\n\nAs part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets \u2014 but the vast majority of those assets are Iran\u2019s own money.\n\nAnd what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions.\n\nAs our PolitiFact colleagues have reported:\n\u2022 The deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value \u2014 worldwide \u2014 of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\u2022 According to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States \u2014 $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered.\n\u2022 Many news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran.\n\nAs for Baldwin\u2019s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn\u2019t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015 \u2014 after 13 other senators had done so.\n\nNicholson says the Iran deal \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\"\n\nIran is on the United States\u2019 list of state sponsors of terrorism. As part of a 2015 deal aimed making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, Iran got access to tens of billions of dollars of its own assets that had been frozen \u2014 there weren\u2019t billions of dollars sent on a plane.\n\nThe United States, in a transaction indirectly linked to the Iran deal, did send on a plane $400 million in cash to Iran. Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered.\n\nFinally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal. Thirteen other senators had announced their support before she did.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Nicholson a Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
