However, there is no evidence Rajoelina made such comments and a spokesman for the Madagascan presidency flatly denied the claims.\n\nOne of the articles in Tanzanian newspaper Fahari Yetu was shared as a screenshot here. According to the Swahili article, Rajoelina made the allegations during an interview on French news channel France 24.\n\nA similar article, headlined \u201cWHO offered $20m bribe to see COVID-19 medicine poisoned - Madagascar President\", appeared in another newspaper, Tanzania Perspective, on May 14, 2020. A screenshot of the publication was shared hundreds of times on Facebook here and here.\n\nMadagascan President Andry Rajoelina last month launched a herbal concoction he claims can prevent and cure the novel coronavirus. The drink, which was developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), is derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment -- and other indigenous herbs.\n\nPresident Rajoelina has defended the supposed COVID-19 remedy and even shipped the herbal concoction to Tanzania upon request by President John Pombe Magufuli. As reported by AFP, several African nations have also expressed interest in the purported remedy, known as Covid-Organics.\n\nAlthough the Madagascan leader is on record questioning WHO concerns about the herbal drink, there is no evidence he accused the agency of trying to bribe him to poison Covid-Organics.\n\nWhile the Tanzanian Perspective\u2019s article did not mention where Rajoelina made the supposed claims, there was no trace of any such statement in local media or on his social media channels, where the president posts regular updates.", "lang": "en"}
