The photo has the trio\u2019s shadows on the ground seen as that of lions and the post claims it is not photoshopped and it is a message from nature. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of PM Narendra Modi, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief MM Naravane with shadows as that of lions. Fact: The photo is photoshopped. In the original photo, the trio have their own shadows on the ground and not the shadows of lions. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe photo posted has Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief MM Naravane in it. It was taken during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s recent visit to Ladakh to address the Indian soldiers. The photo can be found in a tweet on the official Twitter account of the Press Information Bureau of India (PIB India). But in the photo, the trio Narendra Modi, Bipin Rawat and Naravane have their own shadows on the ground and not the shadows of lions. So the photo posted is edited using tools like \u2018Photoshop\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of PM Narendra Modi, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief MM Naravane having their shadows as that of lions is photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
