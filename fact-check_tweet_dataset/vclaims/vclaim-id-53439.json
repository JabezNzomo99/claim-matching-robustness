This is misleading; no vaccine exists yet for COVID-19, while the demonstration in question was organised for other reasons.\n\nThe video, posted on Instagram and archived here, alleged that Americans wanted Gates arrested after he \u201cproduced the COVID-19 vaccine\u201d.\n\nThe same video appeared in an article, which has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. The article claimed that Gates aimed to profit from a vaccine and was concealing the \u201cmotivation behind the widespread virus\u201d.\n\nThe claim has also been shared here, here, here and here.\n\nUsing video verification tool WeVerify, AFP traced the clip to this tweet, which reads: \u201cSecond protest in Austin, TX. Alex Jones leads chants of \u2018Arrest Bill Gates\u2019 #ReopenTexas\u201d.\n\nThe video was taken at a Texas protest led by Infowars host Alex Jones, who has been banned from all major social media networks, except Twitter.\n\nIt was first published by a Twitter user, and reproduced in one Infowars article. This was the second such protest; the first was reported by AFP here.\n\nThe protests were primarily in opposition to coronavirus lockdowns and called for the reopening of the US economy. A few people carried placards denouncing vaccines.\n\nGates is indeed funding vaccine development but none has been fully developed yet. His involvement in public health has made him a target for online misinformation.\n\nIn a February 2020 press release, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said it was pledging up to $100 million in immediate funding toward \u201cthe global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus\u201d, including vaccination research and development.\n\nIts best-case scenario suggests that if \u201ceverything goes to plan, 12 to 18 months from now [April 28, 2020], the first COVID-19 vaccines will start to roll out of one of those plants in bulk\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is leading research and development for a COVID-19 vaccine but has not had a breakthrough yet.\n\nIn May 2020, the WHO said that \u201cthe COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on the need for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, at least 43 of which are currently in development\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter the necessary trials in humans, the hope is that one or more of these candidate vaccines will emerge as a safe and cost-effective response to the pandemic \u2013 possibly in the next twelve months.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
