A photo with a caption suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated free air travel for soldiers of the Indian Army is false. BOOM found that the soldiers in the photos belong to the paramilitary forces who were deployed to Kerala in 2016 as part of election duty. The above photo has gone viral with a caption that translates to, \u201cFor the past 60 years, army soldiers used to travel in the general compartment of trains, and that too near the toilet. After sending those pictures, the (Narendra) Modi government has arranged flight for the army personnel to travel. A welcome step!\u201d The post has been shared by various Facebook pages since 2016 with the same caption.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the uniformed men in the photo are not from any unit of the Indian Army but actually belong to the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Force. Unlike the Indian Army, the ITBP personnel are Central Armed Police Force, which in turn, falls under the broad umbrella of paramilitary forces. This means that the ITBP is managed and headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and not the Ministry of Defence. ITBP soldiers in uniform similar to that worn by the personnel in the viral post. BOOM contacted Vivek Pandey, spokesperson of ITBP, who confirmed that the uniformed personnel in the photo belong to the paramilitary force. He further said that the photo is from 2016 and was clicked during the Assembly elections that were held in various parts of the country. \u201cDuring elections, the Election Commission requests for companies of ITBP and other paramilitary forces to be deployed to the states which are going to polls to ensure law and order. What you see in the photo is a certain section of the ITBP company which was sent to Kerala during the 2016 Assembly elections held in the state. They had boarded the flight from West Bengal and were on their way to Kerala,\u201d Pandey said.

In certain cases, if the matter at hand is urgent or there will be considerable time to reach the place via rail then they are sent by flights,\u201d he said. He also informed that there is \u201cno free flights policy\u201d for ITBP and that the expenses for travel (by air and rail) when the ITBP personnel are deployed to various states during elections is borne by a fund with the Election Commission called \u2018election funds\u2019 in common parlance. \u201cThe money to these funds are contributed by both the state and the Centre since elections are a national event.\u201d BOOM also accessed news reports from May 2016 when elections were held in Kerala which inform that \u201cAir India would be flying 3,000 troopers to Kerala from Kolkata for elections\u201d.

In all, there will be 10 flights that will land in Thiruvananthapuram with these forces and once here, they will be posted in various places of the state.\u201d (Read here, here and here) Are Reports of Sonia Gandhi Being 4th Richest Politician True?", "lang": "en"}
