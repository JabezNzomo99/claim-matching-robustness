{"title": "Club for Growth\u2019s attack on a GOP lawmaker", "subtitle": "The Club for Growth has labeled Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) a \"liberal\" for some of his votes.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2014-03-22T22:11:19Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81241", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/24/club-for-growths-attack-on-a-gop-lawmaker/", "vclaim": "What we have here is a battle of two different narratives, in which each side is calling attention to particular votes to make their case. The Fact Checker faulted Simpson on the claim about TARP vote because he highlighted a procedural vote of little importance, compared to the actual vote for the legislation.\n\nThis is fairly typical congressional behavior, but Todd Cranney, a senior adviser to the Simpson campaign, denied that Simpson was swayed by partisan concerns. He says during the Bush years the country was fighting two wars and the deficits were smaller, but that Simpson shifted his position once annual deficits exceeded $1 trillion. However, Simpson more recently voted in 2013 to \u201csuspend\u201d the debt limit, in effect raising it.\n\nClub for Growth is an organization that looks for ideological consistency, whereas Simpson is trying to explain that his votes need to be examined in context. In his own ad, Simpson sidesteps questions about the debt limit and instead emphasizes his support for a balanced budget amendment and for voting from spending cuts.\n\nOn this matter, it\u2019s a draw. Simpson sometimes did vote as Club for Growth claims, but he has also opposed increasing the debt limit. Despite the campaign\u2019s claims, we suspect the party of the president is an important factor, as it is for many Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCranney says that there were spending items in the bill, such as funds to clean up the Idaho National Lab and to stem wildfires, which Simpson supported. He also noted that Simpson voted against the overall stimulus bill in committee and on the floor of the House. He accuses Club for Growth of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d a vote.\n\nStill, this is a vote that Club for Growth rated on its scorecard, and Simpson\u2019s campaign previously has touted the fact that the \u201crepeal and repay\u201d TARP vote also was on the scorecard. One could quibble with the phrasing of the ad, however, because it sounds like Simpson wanted to make the stimulus bigger, when in fact he voted against an effort to make it smaller.\n\nOddly, Simpson has been inconsistent in talking about stimulus. Once, he went to the floor of the House to denounce spending in other states that he implicitly supported by voting against the amendment. But he also touted the funds that Idaho had received from the stimulus, such as highway funds.\n\nSimpson may win few points for consistency, but he did vote against the stimulus bill. For the Republican voters of his district, that may be more important than this specific vote on an amendment. The Club for Growth, however, did consider this an important vote and has been critical of GOP lawmakers who opposed the amendment.\n\nThe park in question is the Presidio, a former military base that, with federal funding, was converted to a privately funded enterprise. The amendment that Simpson opposed in 2011 aimed to eliminate $23 million in federal funding, forcing the park to immediately be supported by private funds. Cranney explains that Simpson, who chaired a congressional panel overseeing national park spending, had supported the original agreement on the Presidio and wanted to stick to the deal. He said the only reason the Club for Growth is highlighting this vote is because Pelosi, the former House Speaker, is considered \u201ca bad person in a conservative world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Simpson isn\u2019t disputing a single fact in the ad,\u201d said Club for Growth Spokesman Barney Keller. \u201cHe voted for trillions in debt limit increases without spending cuts. He voted with Democrats for a bigger Obama stimulus. He voted to spend millions on a park in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district. Mike Simpson\u2019s desperate and pathetic attempts to explain away his actual votes are simply his recognition that his liberal record is completely out of step with a Idaho\u2019s conservative electorate.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker takes no position on the accuracy of such labels as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d as that is up to voters to determine. Club for Growth, for instance, rates Simpson at about 52 percent on its scorecard, so by their definition that makes him a liberal; other scorecards would probably rate him more of a conservative.\n\nBy the standards of attack ads, this sticks relatively close to the facts. Simpson voted for TARP and supported Presidio funding. Depending on the year, he has backed increases in the debt ceiling without seeking spending cuts. The most questionable assertion is that he worked with Democrats to boost the stimulus, since it highlights a relatively minor vote while ignoring the fact that he opposed the overall stimulus bill (while apparently liking the parts that applied to his state).", "lang": "en"}
