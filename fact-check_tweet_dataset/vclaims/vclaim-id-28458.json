Two images showing pf weapons and ammunition are shared with the claim that these were recovered from Jamia Milia Islamia campus.\n\nMany other individuals on Facebook have posted the image with the same Malayalam text.\n\nWe reverse searched the images on Google and here\u2019s what we found:\n\nThis photograph was posted along with an article titled, \u201cMardan university reopens after Mashal murder; weapons recovered during hostel search\u201d. It\u2019s a report published by Pakistani newspaper Dawn on May 22, 2017. The weapons were recovered from the hostel of Abdul Wali Khan University in Pakistan\u2019s Mardan district.\n\nAccording to the report, police arrested 53 suspects for their involvement in Mashal Khan murder. He was a 23-year-old student who was lynched over accusations of blasphemy.\n\nWe found an image similar to the one viral posted on Pakistani media outlet Samaa TV\u2019s website. \u201cSeven arrested for opening fire at local court in Islamabad\u2019s F-8\u201d, said the title of the article published on February 23, 2019. Thus, this image too is from Pakistan.\n\nHowever, with a keyword search (\u201ccourt firing Islamabad weapon\u201c) on Google, Alt News found the exact image on the website Lead Pakistan.\n\nIn conclusion, two old and unrelated images from Pakistan were circulated on social media with a false narrative that they depicted weapons recovered by the police from the Jamia Millia Islamia university campus.
