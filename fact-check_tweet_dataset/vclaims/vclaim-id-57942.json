A Nike spokesperson confirmed that the company did not say the quote attributed to it in the post.\n\nThe sports apparel company announced Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a movement of players protesting police brutality during the national anthem, as one of the faces of an advertising campaign in 2018, according to The New York Times. President Donald Trump said at the time that Nike was sending a \u201cterrible message\u201d by featuring the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback in the ads.\n\nThe viral post falsely alleges Nike said it \u201ccan afford to let go of all \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 customers,\u201d despite no evidence the company made such a remark.

A search of Nike\u2019s social media accounts didn\u2019t turn up any matches for the alleged statement, and the company hasn\u2019t said anything to that effect in a press release. In an email to Check Your Fact, a Nike spokesperson confirmed the quote is fake.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Nike\u2019s market capitalization is over $175 billion \u2013 not $76 billion \u2013 at the time of publication, according to Nasdaq.\n\nThe claim that Nike made the statement appears to have started circulating in 2018, shortly after the deal between Nike and Kaepernick got announced. A Twitter user claimed in September 2018 that a Nike spokesperson made the statement during an interview with NPR, though NPR segments from the morning of the announcement contain no such quote, according to Snopes.\n\nThe fake quote may have stemmed from a comment made by sports writer Justin Tinsley, who told NPR, \u201cI don\u2019t think Nike\u2019s going to take too much of a financial hit.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
