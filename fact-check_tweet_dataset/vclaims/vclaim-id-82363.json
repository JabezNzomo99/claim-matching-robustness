The same video has been posted on Goyal\u2019s official Twitter and Facebook accounts.\n\nThe video was also retweeted by National General Secretary of BJP, Ram Madhav.\n\nRepublic TV also published an article based on Piyush Goyal\u2019s tweet with the title \u201cWATCH: Piyush Goyal Gives A Glimpse Of Bird And Plane-like Vande Bharat Express\u201c.\n\nSoon after Piyush Goyal, posted this video, comments on the minister\u2019s Facebook page suggested that the video posted is not original, and has in fact been speeded up.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nWe looked up the YouTube link posted by the Facebook user in the comments section of Piyush Goyal\u2019s video post. The video has been posted on a YouTube channel called \u201cThe Rail Mail\u201d on December 20, 2018. The about section of this YouTube Channel suggests that the videos on this channel are posted by Train enthusiasts, also known as \u2018Train spotters\u2019. The YouTube channel also has its Facebook page, and the Facebook user who contested the minister is an admin on the Facebook page.\n\nThe portion of the video that Piyush Goyal tweeted starts at the 26th second in the video below.\n\nFrom the above video, it is clear that the video posted by the Railway Minister was a clipped portion of the above YouTube video, which was then speeded up to twice its original speed. A side-by-side speed comparison of the video posted by Piyush Goyal and the original video can be seen below.\n\nThe video was shot at Asaoti railway station in Haryana. The original YouTube video also bears a trademark watermark, which matches the Facebook user who claimed it was his video.\n\nThe video posted by Piyush Goyal has been circulating on social media since January end. A Facebook user had posted the same video on his timeline on January 30, 2019 and can be seen below.\n\nThis is not the first time that Piyush Goyal has posted misleading information on social media. In the past, he\u2019s been charged on multiple occassions for posting misleading images and information, trying to portray the development efforts of the Union Government in a positive light.", "lang": "en"}
