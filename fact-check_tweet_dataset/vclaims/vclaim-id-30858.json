Per comments from Pelosi\u2019s office and the pen supplier, the total cost ranged somewhere between $450 and $600.\n\nPelosi used 30 custom pens engraved with her name to sign the articles of impeachment against the president Jan. 15, Business Insider reported. Shortly thereafter, she handed them out to other House Democrats for keepsakes, drawing criticism from some Republican members of Congress.\n\nOn Jan. 17, a Facebook post alleged the House speaker spent thousands of dollars on those pens, claiming, \u201cHere is PROOF that this Impeachment Sham is all about pushing Nancy Pelosi\u2019s agenda! $15,000 for pens to sign the impeachment doc\u2019s. Look who\u2019s name is on them!\u201d\n\nHowever, the total cost cited in the Facebook post is much higher than the amount Pelosi\u2019s office actually spent on the pens.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told FactCheck.org that \u201cthe cost per pen is just under $15,\u201d which equates to roughly $450 in total.\n\nGarland Writing Instruments, a Rhode Island-based company, told WPRI Eyewitness News it produced the customized pens Pelosi used. Owner Rick Becker said the pens cost roughly $20 each, according to the local Fox affiliate. That price would mean Pelosi\u2019s office spent approximately $600 on the 30 pens.\n\nIndeed, both of those figures are significantly lower than the $15,000 total cost cited in the Facebook post.

In 1998, Republican senators received souvenir pens after signing oaths for then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, according to BBC News.", "lang": "en"}
