Since then, social media has witnessed relentless attempts to justify or criticize the move, often through misinformation. A set of photographs has been shared on social media to portray normalcy in Kashmir, nearly two months after the dramatic step of August 5.\n\nThe above post is by Ashish Kohli (@dograjournalist) who is followed on Twitter by the Office of Nirmala Sitharaman. Kohli describes himself as a journalist who \u201cReports Border Conflicts and Terrorism from J&K\u201d, and his Twitter bio reads, \u201cA Proud Jammu Citizen blocked by my former CM Mehbooba Mufti\u201d. He has tweeted three photographs which, he claims, have been clicked today (October 3). He calls these photographs a response to \u201cfake tweets\u201d and \u201cAnti India propaganda\u201d.\n\nA comment by a user on Kohli\u2019s tweet suggested that the photographs are old. Based on this information, Alt News found that the photographs tweeted as recent, were indeed clicked earlier. Let us take a look at each of these pictures.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the above photograph and came across a tweet from March 2019 by a journalist, Sameer Yasir. The same photo was tweeted on March 22, 2019, more than four months before the Central government\u2019s move on Article 370.\n\nThe above photograph had appeared in an article on Kashmir Life, in April 2017.\n\nAlt News found that the above photograph had appeared in an article on Daily Excelsior, a J&K daily, in November 2016. The report is from Srinagar.\n\nOld photographs from Kashmir have been falsely shared as recent, in a bid to portray normalcy in the region, weeks after the revocation of key provisions of Article 370.", "lang": "en"}
