He told us:\n\nNaively thought it too ridiculous to be believable. Says a lot, really. Was going to delete it but it was everywhere within minutes: feels like I need to leave it up in its place of birth.\n\nPresident Trump has legitimately tweeted about the stock market in the past, however:\n\nCreating fake tweets is extremely easy and can spread virally within minutes \u2014 as Usher has now demonstrated, even if unintentionally.", "lang": "en"}
