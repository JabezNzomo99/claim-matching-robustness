The nonpartisan pro-democracy group Freedom House said the balloting amounted to a mock election of a dictator.\n\nAs questions about the legitimacy of Putin\u2019s victory swirled, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Trump\u2019s outreach was beneath the office of the presidency.\n\n\"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said in a March 20 statement. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin's regime.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s outreach comes as Special Counsel Robert Mueller and multiple congressional committees investigate Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to defend himself by pointing out that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had also congratulated Putin after his successful presidential run.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),\" Trump tweeted March 21.\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders also drew attention to Obama's outreach to Putin following his win.\n\n\"Media so dishonest,\" tweeted conservative pundit Laura Ingraham, who linked to a March 2012 Weekly Standard article, which noted that Obama phoned Putin from Air Force One to extend his congratulations.\n\nAn archive of the the Obama White House website shows Obama did in fact talk with Putin on March 9, 2012, following his election win.\n\n\"President Obama called Russian President-elect and Prime Minister Putin to congratulate him on his recent victory in the Russian Presidential election,\" according to the official summary, or \"readout\" of the call.\n\nInternational observers had also raised doubts about the legitimacy of Putin\u2019s 2012 win. Obama\u2019s own State Department, while congratulatory, noted concerns about \"the conditions under which the campaign was conducted, the partisan use of government resources and procedural irregularities on election day.\"\n\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush called Dmitry Medvedev following his successful presidential bid. But one account of their phone call said Bush \"appeared to stop short of offering the customary White House congratulations to the president-elect.\"\n\nSome commentators pushed back on the notion that Trump\u2019s outreach is akin to that of his predecessors, noting Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"2012: Obama congratulates Putin on his \u2018win\u2019. R\u2019s attack. D\u2019s silent,\" tweeted Ana Navarro. \"2016-2018: Putin complicit in Assad\u2019s genocide. Putin meddles in US elections. Putin poisons opponents in Eng. 2018: Trump congratulates Putin on his \u2018win\u2019. D\u2019s attack. Most R\u2019s -not McCain- crickets.\"\n\nThis story has been updated following a tweet from President Donald Trump.", "lang": "en"}
