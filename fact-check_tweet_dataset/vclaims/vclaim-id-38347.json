Ferret Fact Service has looked at them.\n\n\u201c68 million people now live in England and going up\u201d\n\nThe latest figures for population in the UK are from mid 2018, showing 66.4 million people living here. Population levels have increased year-on-year since 1982, and projections suggest the population is due to hit 68 million in 2022.\n\nThe population of England is just under 56 million.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people flooding into this country who cannot speak English.\u201d\n\nData from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford shows that in 2018 around half of foreign-born adults living in the UK spoke English as their first language at home. However this does not tell us about how many immigrants cannot speak English at all.\n\nThe information comes from the annual Labour Force Survey, which does not ask specifically about proficiency in English.\n\nThe most recent available statistics on how many people in the UK can speak English well come from the 2011 census.\n\nThen, 138,000 people in England and Wales said they could not speak English, representing 0.3 of the population, however 118,000 of these were born outside the UK. The rest were born inside the UK and may use another language, such as sign language, to communicate. In Scotland, the proportion who could not speak English was 0.2 per cent. These statistics are now nine years out of date, so likely will not reflect current proportions.\n\nInformation on the amount of immigrants to the UK each year who cannot speak English is not available. The latest yearly rolling estimates up to September 2019 showed an estimated net migration of 240,000.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of country is allowing this tourism to come in. You arrive on a plane. You get free service, you can have your babies, you can just carry on having it all for free.\u201d\n\nNon-residents who are in the UK and require treatment from the NHS will be charged for some types of care, but not all. Some services are exempt from charges, and the NHS website lists A&E, family planning services, treatment for infectious diseases, and treatment for conditions caused by torture, female genital mutilation, domestic or sexual violence as non-chargeable.\n\nThose within the European Economic Area (EEA) are currently eligible for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which allows a patient to receive free medical care in the UK. This will continue during the Brexit transition period, but will be subject to negotiation after 2021.\n\nThose from outside the EEA who are planning to stay for more than six months have to pay a \u201cimmigration health surcharge\u201d. This does not apply to those who are seeking to stay permanently, often called \u201cIndefinite Leave to Remain\u201d.\n\nThe woman\u2019s claim appears to be a reference to \u2018health tourism\u2019, which is usually defined as people who come to the UK specifically to use free NHS services they are not entitled to, or frequent visitors who use GPs for routine free treatment.\n\nUp-to-date statistics on how much this costs the NHS are not available, but in 2013, the UK government estimated it could cost NHS England between \u00a3100m and \u00a3300m a year. Adjusting for inflation that would be around \u00a3346m in today\u2019s prices using the highest estimate. This would work out as around 0.3 per cent of the annual NHS budget for 2019-20.\n\nIn 2019, the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) found that around \u00a33.2m was spent by NHS Scotland treating non-EEA visitors who were not entitled to it over the last five years.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t they got points set up and you pay [for treatment], like you do in every other country?\n\nSince 2017, patients who are not resident in the UK and do not qualify for free care are charged up front by hospitals. This does not include A&E treatment, general practice and infectious disease treatment, which remains free for all.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
