This message is being circulated on social media, along with a video which shows a group of men mercilessly thrashing a man with long hair and repeatedly tugging at his hair. The message is accompanied by an appeal to share it to the hilt so that mainstream media is compelled to telecast it.\n\nThe above tweet was posted in the afternoon of June 15 and is among the first instances of it appearing on Twitter. It is however on Facebook that the video and the message are being shared, mostly by individual users who have uploaded it on their profiles. This suggests that it is being shared widely on WhatsApp.\n\nWhat is the Truth?\n\nAlt News checked to see whether any Sikh truck driver was assaulted in UP in recent days as claimed. We found no news relating to the incident. We then took keywords \u201cattack on sikh truck drivers\u201d and searched it on YouTube. After scrolling down, we found a video by \u2018akaalchannel\u2019 channel, which was posted three months ago with the title \u2018Truth Behind Viral Video of Beaten Up sikhs in Assam\u2019.\n\nThe clip of the viral video with the false claim can be seen from 7:27 in the above video. To further check the veracity of the video by Akaalchannel, we did a Google search with the same keywords used for the YouTube search and came across the link relating to the incident.\n\nVideo from Assam, not UP\n\nThe video is from Kamrup district of Assam and NOT from Uttar Pradesh as claimed. The incident took place in February 2018 after the man in the video along with another person were suspected of child kidnapping and cornered by the locals. They were also accused of looting the house of a resident in the area. They were later handed over to the police which investigated the matter. It may be noted that there is no communal angle to the incident as alleged. This was reported by News 18 Hindi.\n\nThese kind of videos with false, incendiary messages have been shared multiple times by fake news purveyors in the past, with the objective of inciting communal tension and exacerbating mistrust. Viewers and readers are advised to be circumspect, as violent and gory videos are often accompanied with provocative and false claims.", "lang": "en"}
