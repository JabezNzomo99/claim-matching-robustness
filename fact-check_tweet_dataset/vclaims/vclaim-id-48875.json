In the mere 6 second clip, Gandhi can be heard saying, \u201cThe red zone is actually the green zone and the green zone is actually the red zone.\u201d Patra suggested that Rahul Gandhi had earlier said \u201cpotato from the front and gold from the back\u201d and now he is making another absurd statement. The video drew over 5 lakh views and 10,000 shares (archive).\n\nThe clip has been circulating on social media with the \u2018\u092a\u0940\u091b\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0932\u0942 \u0906\u0917\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e\u2019 caption before Patra shared it on his profile. \u201cAfter the immense success of converting potato to gold, Pappu has another magic up his sleeve,\u201d wrote Twitter user @Divyans47789162.\n\nFrom the Facebook page \u2018\u092d\u0908\u092f\u093e \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0939\u093f\u0928\u2019, the video garnered nearly 5,000 views but has been shared with a slightly different message. \u201cWhat is red is green, what\u2019s green is red. Sometimes I am the party president, sometimes my mother. If mom resigns, I will become [the president] and if I resign, she will become [the president],\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThe above case is an \u2018inception\u2019 of misinformation. A misleading claim has been piggy-backed on another piece of false news. The \u201cpotato-gold\u201d claim is false and has been debunked by Alt News twice in the past. We will elaborate on it later, let us start the fact-check with the video currently viral.\n\nThe video shared by Sambit Patra and a plethora of other users is 6 seconds clipped from an hour-long press briefing by Rahul Gandhi on coronavirus outbreak in India. A video of his interaction with journalists was uploaded by Congress on YouTube on May 7.\n\nAt about 18:45 minutes into the address, a journalist with the Press Trust of India (PTI) questioned Gandhi on decentralisation. The Congress leader stressed the need for strong local leaders and tackling the virus from the ground level. He then went on to talk about the different zones set-up by the central government based on the intensity of the outbreak across the country and why these zones should be formed on the basis of local information.\n\n\u201cThese zones \u2013 red, orange and green \u2013 have been created on a national level. They should be created on a state level. Chief Ministers [of Congress-ruled states] are telling us that the zone which is red in the national level is actually green and the zone which is green is actually red.\u201d This can be heard at 20:00 minutes onward. He further says that since the information is available with state leaders, zones should be formed taking advise from the District Magistrate and the Chief Minister.\n\nThe words \u201cnational level\u201d were clipped from the speech to take out the context of decentralisation and portray that Gandhi was making a silly statement.\n\nIn 2017, a video of Rahul Gandhi saying, \u201cWill install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end. (\u0910\u0938\u0940 \u092e\u0936\u0940\u0928 \u0932\u0917\u093e\u090a\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0907\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0932\u0942 \u0918\u0941\u0938\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0909\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e),\u201d was shared by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya (archive).\n\nThe same \u2018remark\u2019 was referred by an ANI reporter while questioning BJP MP Hema Malini last year.\n\nThe statement was a part of a clipped video of a much longer speech where Gandhi was actually taking a dig at PM Modi during an address in Gujarat\u2019s Patan on November 12, 2017.\n\nThe complete video was uploaded on the Congrees leader\u2019s YouTube channel where at 17:50 minutes he can be heard saying, \u201cA few months ago there was a flood here and he [PM Modi] said he will give Rs 500 crore but not even a rupee was given. He told potato farmers, will install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end\u2026these are not my words but Narendra Modiji\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that Gandhi\u2019s claim amounted to political rhetoric since there is no record of PM Modi ever making any such statement.\n\nTherefore, a clipped video of Rahul Gandhi was shared by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra to mock the Congress leader. Moreover, the misinformation was promoted on the back of the infamous \u201cpotato-gold\u201d remark which was also clipped from a longer speech.", "lang": "en"}
