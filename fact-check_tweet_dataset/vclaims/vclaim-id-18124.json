Just before lunchtime, I got a call from a major UK broadcaster asking if I could help out with a feature on what the producer described as \u201cSweden\u2019s new six-hour work day\u201d. He said he had \u201cspotted a story about it in the Sydney Morning Herald\u201d. I turned down the request politely. I usually love sharing my knowledge of Sweden and my experiences of living here when approached by global media. But on this occasion I was unable to. Because the idea that there\u2019s a been mass shift towards shorter days in my adopted home simply isn\u2019t true. Toyota centres in Gothenburg, Sweden\u2019s second largest city, moved to shorter days 13 years ago. A district council in Kiruna, in Sweden\u2019s far north offered 250 staff a six-hour work day in the 1980s (scrapping the method in 2005). The most high-profile case in recent months is of a retirement home in west Sweden which started trialling a six-hour day in February, following long discussions about the experiment. A hospital in Gothenburg followed suit. Since then a few companies have announced that they are also testing the concept, including a number of startups quite obviously hoping to make a name for themselves. These include Filimundus, an app developer based in Stockholm which must be cracking open some Swedish \u2018snaps\u2019 this week after being quoted by media across the globe, and Background AB, a creative communication agency in Falun, Dalarna. Most of those trialling the idea have reported a positive impact, from increased efficiency to better communication and fewer staff sick days. So, it makes sense that other companies could soon start taking up the mantle. But, the idea that Swedish firms are currently queuing up to offer their staff even shorter contracts than they do now is quite simply wrong.", "lang": "en"}
