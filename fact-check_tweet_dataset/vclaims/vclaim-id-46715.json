Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez only has St. John\u2019s University professor Anthony Pappas challenging her for her congressional seat.\n\n\u201cPlease meme me into office,\u201d reads part of the caption.\n\nFederal Election Commission (FEC) records show that 12 people have filed for candidacy in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district, including four Democratic challengers. Pappas said he has no intention of running \u201cat the moment.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent New York\u2019s 14th congressional district. In the general election, she won 78.2 percent of the votes, according to The New York Times.\n\nA viral image falsely alleges in a post that Ocasio-Cortez has only one challenger in upcoming 2020 congressional elections \u2013 Pappas, an associate professor at St. John\u2019s University that ran for the Republican Party in 2018. The post has been shared more than 10,000 times.\n\n\u201cHi I\u2019m Anthony Pappas, I\u2019m the only person challenging Alexandra Ocasio Cortez (sic) for congress,\u201d reads the post. \u201cShe just bailed out on a debate against me because I\u2019m an economics professor and I would\u2019ve destroyed her socialist position. Please meme me into office.\u201d\n\nThe FEC website shows 12 individuals have filed for candidacy in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district, which encompasses parts of Bronx County and Queens County. Four candidates, including New York City Councilman Fernando Cabrera and activist Badrun Khan, will face off against Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic Primary. Jamaican-American businesswoman Sherie Murray and seven other candidates will vie for the Republican nomination, according to the FEC.\n\nPappas has not filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC for the 2019-2020 time period. Nor has his 2018 campaign\u2019s Facebook page announced his intention to run for office this election cycle.\n\n\u201cThere are many other people who want the GOP nomination for 2020,\u201d Pappas told a commenter on the page. \u201cSo, at the moment I am not running.\u201d (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez And Omar Vote To Take Benefits Away From Seniors?)\n\nOcasio-Cortez has raised approximately $3.4 million dollars so far, with the next closest candidate, former teacher and retired NYPD cop John Cummings raising roughly $425,000, according to FEC records. To date, her Democratic challengers have all reported zero receipts to the FEC.\n\nThe claim has been circulating online since at least 2018, yet its claim wasn\u2019t accurate then either. Crowley and Elizabeth Perri of the Conservative Party also appeared on the ballot, according to the Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
