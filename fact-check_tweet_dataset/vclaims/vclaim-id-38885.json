Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan then demanded that Syrian forces pull back from Idlib by the end of February or be driven back from a de-escalation zone around the city.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. Regime forces continued to attack Turkish positions, and by Feb. 27, a reported 33 Turkish soldiers had been killed. The Syrian offensive continued, with heavy fighting in and around the town of Saraqeb.\n\nAl Jazeera reported that some 950,000 civilians fled the fighting. An estimated 3.6 million Syrian refugees now reside in Turkey, the result of years of civil war.\n\nAs Turkey\u2019s NATO ally, the U.S. has declared support for Turkey\u2019s latest military response. After the Feb. 3 mortar attack, the U.S. Secretary of Mike Pompeo called the event a \u201cgrave escalation\u201d that followed \u201congoing vicious attacks impacting civilians, humanitarian workers, and infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand by our NATO ally Turkey \u2026 and fully support Turkey\u2019s justified self-defense actions in response,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nU.S. diplomats also visited Turkey\u2019s southern border area, where many refugees are located, and voiced support for military and humanitarian aid to Turkey.\n\nRather than encourage retaliation, Pompeo on March 5 said that the U.S. State and Defense Departments and were working to \u201cfigure out how best to deliver less violence, more peace\u201d in Syria.\n\nThe Turkish troops who have been killed were stationed at observation posts in the Idlib area established under an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan, between Turkey, Iran, and Russia in 2017, and reaffirmed by subsequent talks in Sochi, Russia. The United States was not a party to the agreements.\n\nIn addition, since 2014, Turkey and the U.S. have often been at odds over the U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG/YPJ militias in northern Syria that fought against the Islamic State. Turkey sees those militias as an arm of the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States, the European Union, Australia and Japan.\n\nAlso on March 5, Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the recent fighting with Turkey. After several hours of talks, Erdogan announced a new ceasefire to take effect after midnight that day. Since then, a tense calm has been reported in the area, although Erdogan said his forces would retaliate if attacked again.", "lang": "en"}
