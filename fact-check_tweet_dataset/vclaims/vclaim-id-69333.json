And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent.\n\nThe main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on.\n\n\"How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe DNC said that the Republicans \"passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent.\"\n\nThat\u2019s the case by 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. The DNC is cherry-picking by focusing on the tax bill\u2019s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then.", "lang": "en"}
