Just ask incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She\u2019s running against Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley in one of the nation\u2019s most high-profile races.\n\nAn ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican-backed political action committee, questions her voting record on immigration.\n\n\"In Missouri, Claire McCaskill said she was against amnesty for illegal immigrants. In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants without border protections in place,\" the ad said.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment or clarification. However, the ad included a small caption referencing McCaskill\u2019s voting record, noting McCaskill\u2019s vote in favor of the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). It would have provided some of the undocumented immigrants living in America a pathway to citizenship which would have taken at least 13 years.\n\nAlthough the bill would have laid out a path to citizenship, the experts we talked to said it was a stretch to call it amnesty as the Senate Leadership Fund did.\n\n\"I do think this is a type of amnesty, but I would hesitate before using amnesty in our current political environment because it has been so heavily criticized,\" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\"The whole point of the Senate bill was to create a whole series of hurdles that people who were here without status would have to jump through, including background checks, paying significant fines, waiting long periods of times,\" he said. \"It was all linked to securing the border.\"\n\nThe 1986 bill, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, gave the approximately 3 million unauthorized immigrants who had arrived in the country prior to Jan. 1, 1982, a chance to apply for citizenship. As a result of its passage, 2.7 million people obtained permanent residency status, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nUnlike the bill McCaskill voted for five years ago, Alden said the Reagan-era law did not \"prevent people from coming illegally in the future or from working in the United States even if they didn\u2019t have status.\"\n\n\"Not everyone would have been able to meet those requirements and pay those fees (to get citizenship),\" said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Voigt said the lengthy process combined with strict background check requirements would have prevented all from qualifying.\n\nIn 2013, McCaskill voted for a bill that would have given undocumented immigrants living in the country a path, albeit a long one, to citizenship. The Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s claim that she joined \"the liberals\" in supporting a bill that would have given \"amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants\" is deceptive for three reasons:\n\nLastly, in 2013 there were approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, but given the exclusions and restrictions included in the 2013 bill, not all of them would have qualified to start the citizenship process under the Senate bill\u2019s guidelines.", "lang": "en"}
