A variant of these rumours claims that these gangs are into the organ trafficking business, removing the internal organs of abducted children. An incendiary audio clip has been doing the rounds, the message delivered in Hindi by a male voice which says,\n\nTranslation: \u201cTamil Nadu police found bodies of children inside a container. Internal organs were removed from their bodies, like kidney and liver. Tamil Nadu police has said these children were abducted from various countries and brought here. Note: Take care of your children. Send this message to every group. Spread this photograph so much that this dog is caught. Who does not circulate this is not his/mother\u2019s child. Send this to as many groups- 1, 2, 3, 4, or 25. This rascal must be caught.\u201d\n\nAlt News is not posting the audio clip here owing to its provocative nature and scope for misuse. It has been shared along with a photograph showing bodies of children lying on the ground.\n\nSeveral readers of Alt News have requested verification of this image and the accompanying claim.\n\nThere are two aspects of the claim- the audio message, and the photograph circulated along with it. Alt News had fact-checked this message earlier, when it was shared with the same photograph with which it has been circulated now. There is no truth to this claim. It is a rumour which has been circulating online for at least the past two years i.e. since early 2017.\n\nInsofar as the picture is concerned, Alt News had reverse-searched it on Google and found that it pertained to a chemical attack in Ghouta, Syria in August 2013 during the Syrian civil war, in which suburbs of Damascus were targeted with rockets containing the chemical agent Sarin. Alt News found the same photo in a blog from 2013.\n\nThe American fact-checking website Snopes had fact-checked this photo in 2016, when it was being shared with the false narrative of organ trafficking in Thailand.\n\nIn conclusion, a rumour which has been circulating online since 2017, that bodies of children with missing organs were found inside a container by Tamil Nadu police, was clubbed with a photograph depicting the tragic aftermath of a chemical attack in 2013, during the Syrian civil war.", "lang": "en"}
