No, that's not true: Authorities from Moscow's health department did release information about antibody testing of a random population sample of Moscow residents in late May 2020, but they did not make the statement that COVID-19 is a fake pandemic. A misleading headline is not a summary of what the Moscow authorities actually said.\n\nThe claim originated in an article published by eutimes.net on May 24, 2020, titled \"Russia exposes Covid-19 with Scientific Data as a Hoax, says its a Fake Pandemic\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe author's conclusion that the pandemic is fake is based on the premise that a certain proportion of the people who contract the disease must die in order for the pandemic to be real. But the definitions for pandemic and epidemic are not based on the level of mortality, rather they describe the extent of spread of a disease in relation to geography. Merriam-webster.com presents a comparison of the two words (here). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.\n\nThe speech given by the WHO director-general (transcribed in full here), said:\n\nWHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.\n\nThe numbers cited in this eutimes article are accurate according to the references they were taken from at the time they were taken, although some of the conclusions drawn are flawed or lacking context.\n\nThose 1,934 deceased Moscow residents are mentioned again:\n\nThe article uses a quote from Moscow's Department of Health, taken from a May 13, 2020, Reuters article titled, 'Moscow says it ascribed over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes,\" (here) The quote, standing alone and with the eutimes putting some words in bold for emphasis, is used to propose that Russia's strict recording practices, relying on autopsies of all deceased Coronavirus patients, will further reduce the count of 1,934 deaths. It implies that there are autopsies left to complete.\n\nThe entire quote captioned in the Reuters article tells a different story, The start of quote clarifies that any recorded coronavirus deaths would have already passed the strict post-mortem protocol of Russia and the Moscow Health Department. This part of the quote was not included in the eutimes article:", "lang": "en"}
