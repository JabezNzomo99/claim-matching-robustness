{"title": "Four million on hospital waiting lists", "subtitle": "At least 3.7 million patient referrals in England were waiting to receive non-emergency treatment as of November 2016. It may be as high as 3.9 million.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1616", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/four-million-hospital-waiting-lists/", "vclaim": "The latest figures from NHS England show that 3.7 million patient referrals were waiting to be treated as of November 2016.\n\nThe figures count each referral rather than individual patients, so if someone was waiting for multiple treatments or was re-referred for a treatment they may be included in the figures several times. NHS England told us that they don\u2019t collect information on how many patients this might apply to.\n\nNot all hospital trusts submitted information on how many treatments were within the target time. The NHS estimates that the total waiting for treatment could be around 3.9 million.\n\nThe NHS\u2019s target is to treat 92% of referrals waiting for \u201cnon-emergency, consultant-led treatment\u201d within 18 weeks of them being referred. Just over 90% of those on the waiting list (3.4 million) were still within this 18-week target in November, so for that month NHS England had missed the target.\n\nNHS England says that the impact of hospital trusts which don\u2019t report how many treatments are within target times or not is \u201cgenerally minimal\u201d.\n\nThe remaining 10% (354,000) had been waiting for longer than 18 weeks in November. Of these, around 1,200 had been waiting for longer than a year.\n\nThe average length of time patients had been waiting for treatment was six and a half weeks.\n\nJust under 339,000 patients were treated in November. On average they had been waiting for ten weeks since their referral.", "lang": "en"}
