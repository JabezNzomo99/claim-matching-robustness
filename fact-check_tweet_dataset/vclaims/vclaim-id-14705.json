[1]\n\nLabor has vowed to limit negative gearing to new homes from January 1, 2020. (Investments made before this will not be affected and will be fully grandfathered.) [2]\n\nMr Morrison told 2GB his father didn\u2019t own an investment property, but claimed one in five police officers now do.\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Morrison\u2019s claim and found it to be true.\n\nThe Police Federation of Australia (PFA) membership as of December 2018 was 63,105. Membership has grown from 60,871 members at the end of 2016 to 61,811 in December 2017. [3]\n\nAccording to the Australian Tax Office\u2019s most recent data from 2016-17, 60,349 police officers filed tax returns. Of those, 13,204 claimed negative gearing on investment properties, a percentage of 21.88 per cent. [4]\n\nNegative gearing cannot be claimed unless a taxpayer owns an investment property, and submitting tax returns is compulsory. Negative gearing is the practice of investing borrowed money in such a way as to incur a loss that can be claimed as a tax deduction.\n\nAccording to ATO data, Mr Morrison was conservative in his claim about one in five police owning an investment property.", "lang": "en"}
