It also claims the BBC article says these microchips will be initially trialled in measles vaccines.\n\nThis is not true. The BBC article is a speculative piece on how travel might look in the coming years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe excerpts of the article screenshotted for evidence are real but do not mention microchips. The \u201csubdermal record\u201d of the vaccine mentioned in the piece is a dye or tattoo invisible to the eye, but readable by a scanner. This dye could be administered along with a vaccine using a microneedle patch. This patch is a technology currently being developed to administer the MMR vaccine. Researchers have shown a dye could be added to these patches, but this hasn\u2019t been tested on people yet.\n\nIt is true that research into this technology was funded in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. However, this is not a chip and is simply one way the article suggests travel might change in the future. It also says that paper vaccine passports could be a possibility.\n\nIt is also true that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has contributed funding to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. However, vaccines for the virus across the world are still in development, and it is currently unclear how they will be rolled out.", "lang": "en"}
