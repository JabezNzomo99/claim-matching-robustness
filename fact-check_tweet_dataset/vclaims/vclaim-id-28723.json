Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The man who faked being deaf and dumb for 62 years to avoid listening to his wife is now facing divorce from his wife after she found out the truth. Fact: The news being shared is from a website that publishes satirical & fictional stories. This story is also one such. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen one searches for the news on Google, a link to the exact post (World News Daily Report article) is found. The Disclaimer section of that website reads as \u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the nature of its articles and for the nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\u201d So, any news on that website should not be taken seriously. Hence it can be concluded that the posted article is a satire and the reasons being stated are purely fictional.\n\nHowever, the people in the pictures used by World News Daily report are Burton Handelsman & his wife Lucille Handelsman. Burton is a real estate tycoon who owns most of the commercial property in World Avenue, Palm Beach, Florida. Lucille filed for divorce after 67 years of marriage alleging that her husband is in an illicit relationship with another woman. The Daily Mail reported this story.\n\nTo sum it up, man did not fake being deaf and dumb for 62 years. The story is a satirical one.", "lang": "en"}
