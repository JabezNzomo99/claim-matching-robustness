It found that the members of Russia\u2019s U.N. delegation, whose names had been disclosed to the public, were the targets of U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, including a travel ban, and thus the U.S. State Department would have violated U.S. law by issuing entry visas to those who are targeted by sanctions.\n\nAn investigation of RIA Novosti\u2019s most recent claim reveals it is false.\n\nThe Sixth Committee, or Legal Committee, held its meeting on October 14 after a \u201cseveral hour delay.\u201d In his opening remarks, the committee\u2019s chairman, Michal Mlynar of Slovakia, said the delay was related to procedure and the program.\n\nA diplomat present at the Sixth Committee meeting told the Voice of America\u2019s U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer that the RIA Novosti claim \u201cis not quite correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe suspended for a few hours to continue informal consultations on the Program of Work, which in the end was adopted this morning. It was linked to concerns voiced by Iran about the limited ability of their delegation to function in the Sixth Committee due to some visa-related issues. Iran took the floor yesterday afternoon and also last Monday,\u201d the diplomat told VOA.\n\nAfter the Sixth Committee\u2019s chairman opened its morning session on October 14, Iran\u2019s representative took the floor. Confirming the diplomat\u2019s comments to VOA, the Iranian representative\u2019s statement concerned the Iranian delegations\u2019 visa issues.\n\nThe First Committee, or Disarmament and International Security Committee, held its morning meeting on October 14. No delays or suspensions were reported.\n\nRussia was mentioned at the end of the meeting in an announcement by the secretariat, stating that the Russian delegation would be holding an informal consultation at 3 p.m. \u2013 the same time the afternoon session of the First Committee was scheduled to start.\n\nAs video footage of the First Committee afternoon meeting shows, the regular proceedings during the session were interrupted.\n\nHowever, contrary to RIA Novosti\u2019s claim, the suspensions were not in solidarity with Russia, but due to requests by the Ukrainian and the U.S. delegations for \u201cconsultation breaks,\u201d to which the Russian representative objected, demanding the meeting to continue with general debate. After several breaks, the session continued according to its schedule.\n\nA Detailed Debrief of the First Committee Session\n\nPolygraph.info provides below a detailed debrief of the meeting transcribed from the live video feed, which demonstrates that the RIA Novosti claim was indeed false:\n\nUkraine\u2019s representative took the floor after the chairman\u2019s opening remarks and requested a break to consult on the agenda.\n\nRussia\u2019s representative demanded that the chairman provide a clarification on the procedure for holding general debate.\n\nThe chairman of the First Committee, Sacha Llorenty Soliz of Bolivia, responded by saying the committee is paying \u201cdue diligence\u201d to the previously submitted statement by Russia regarding the \u201clack of issuance of visas to the members of their delegation.\u201d\n\nSoliz said that the First Committee leadership held informal consultations at multiple General Assembly levels and with the host country representatives. He said the chair had done \u201ceverything he can do in order to resolve the situation,\u201d but that the issue was beyond the remit of the committee. He underscored that the Ukrainian delegation proposed proceeding with the adoption of the general debate schedule.\n\nThe Russian representative then took the floor, demanding again that the First Committee continue its proceedings with general debate, according to the agenda adopted on October 8.\n\nA U.S. representative then took the floor requesting a ten-minute suspension of the session \u201cjust to get the sense of really what is going on here.\u201d However, Cuba\u2019s delegation objected to the break request, after which the chairman granted a five-minute break.\n\nThe session resumed with the Ukrainian delegation requesting \u201cnot to suspend but to adjourn the meeting\u201d to discuss the adoption of the work program.\n\nThe U.S. representative then requested a 30-minute suspension \u201cto further discuss the issue.\u201d\n\nThe Russian representative again demanded that the session continue with general debates, but agreed to the U.S. delegation demand to take a 30-minute break.\n\nThe delegations of Egypt, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Syria and Iran supported the Russian proposal to continue with the general debate.\n\nThe chairman announced a ten-minute break for consultations after which the session continued according to its schedule.\n\nThus, the RIA Novosti claim that the U.N. General Assembly First and Sixth Committees suspended their work on October 14 in solidarity with the Russian delegation\u2019s visa situation is false.", "lang": "en"}
