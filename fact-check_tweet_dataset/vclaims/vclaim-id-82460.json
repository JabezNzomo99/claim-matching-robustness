Guy was a fucking loser.\u201d\n\nAs the article spread on social media, President Trump took to Twitter to issue a denial, and said that he never called McCain a loser:\n\nWhile Trump writes that he \u201cnever called John [McCain] a loser,\u201d this simply isn\u2019t true. In fact, Trump himself once tweeted an article quoting Trump saying that McCain was a loser.\n\nThe article Trump shared in July 2015 was referring to an appearance then-candidate Trump made at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa. Conservative pollster Frank Luntz asked Trump if it was appropriate for a man running for the country\u2019s highest office to refer to McCain \u2014 a war hero and navy pilot who became a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over Vietnam \u2014 as a \u201cdummy.\u201d\n\nTrump said: \u201cHe lost [the 2008 election], so I never liked him as much after that because I don\u2019t like losers.\u201d\n\nWhen Luntz repeated that McCain was a war hero, Trump said: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nAs for the comments reported in The Atlantic article, Goldberg cites \u201cthree sources with direct knowledge of this event.\u201d News outlets such as The Associated Press have been able to confirm some of The Atlantic\u2019s reporting with other military officials, and Miles Taylor, a Republican Trump appointee who served as the chief of staff to the United States secretary of homeland security until he resigned after allegedly witnessing Trump offering pardons to those who implemented illegal immigration policies, said that he could confirm that Trump was angry about lowering the flags for McCain after his death:", "lang": "en"}
