This is then used to train a person\u2019s immune system to produce antibodies so that he or she develops immunity without having to get the disease first. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Five things you need to know about COVID-19 antibodies)\n\nOnce a vaccine is administered to an individual, the body\u2019s adaptive immune system \u201cstudies\u201d the \u201cforeign and potentially dangerous\u201d substance and \u201cfigure[s] out the best way to deal with the invader,\u201d molecular biologist Denise Mirano-Bascos, whose research interest is immunology, told VERA Files in an earlier interview. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Five questions on COVID-19 vaccines, answered)\n\nThis process involves the production of antibodies, or proteins produced by the immune system, that have the ability to recognize and neutralize the foreign substance.\n\nIn his first media briefing about the COVID-19 crisis on Feb. 3, Duterte downplayed the issue, \u201cassuring\u201d the public that the virus will just \u201cdie a natural death\u201d even without a vaccine.
