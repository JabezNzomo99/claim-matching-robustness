The claim is false; the video has been circulating online since at least 2010.\n\nThe 2:40 video has been viewed more than 8,500 times since it was posted here on a Facebook page with more than 27,000 followers on August 13, 2019.\n\nThe caption of the post reads: \u201cBijapur Solapur Takali bridge collapsed, Maharashtra, India 13August2019\u201d.\n\nBijapur, also known as Vijayapura, is a city in India\u2019s Karnataka state, while the city of Solapur is located in Maharashtra.\n\nThe caption is referring to the Takali bridge which is along the Bijapur-Solapur highway that connects Maharashtra and Karnataka.\n\nMuch of India was hit by deadly floods in August 2019. AFP reported here on August 10 that at least 27 people were killed in Maharashtra.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nLonger versions of the video have been viewed thousands of times here on Facebook and here on Youtube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. The video does not show a bridge collapse in August 2019 -- the footage has been circulating online since at least 2010.\n\nA speaker of Odia, a language widely spoken in the eastern Indian state of Odisha, analysed the video for AFP and identified the language being spoken in the video as Odia.\n\nA Google keyword search about flooding in Odisha led to the same video published here on YouTube on November 13, 2010.\n\nThe video, entitled \u201cGumuda Bridge Collapse.3gp\u201d, states that the bridge collapsed after flooding in the Bandhasara River.\n\nBut the 2010 video purports to show the Gumuda Bridge, which runs across the Bansadhara River. It was washed away in 2007 and reopened to traffic in 2016, according to Indian newspaper The Times of India.\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the 2010 YouTube video (R):\n\nThis is not the first time the footage has appeared alongside false claims.\n\nIndian news website The Quint wrote that the video also went viral in 2017, alongside a claim that it was shot in the eastern state of Bihar.", "lang": "en"}
