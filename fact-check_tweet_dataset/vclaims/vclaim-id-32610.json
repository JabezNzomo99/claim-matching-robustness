Two Union territories of J&K and Ladakh were born.\n\nThe new map of India was released by the Survey General of India on October 31. Since then, another map of India with a bifurcated J&K has been shared widely on social media.\n\nFacebook user Vishwa Mohan shared a map of India along with a claim in Hindi, which in English translates to, \"New map of new India which is a glimpse of one India, best India.\" The map shows the erstwhile state of J&K divided into two almost equal halves.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the authentic map released by the government is different from the viral map. The union territory of Ladakh is larger than J&K in the actual map.\n\nThe viral map has a 'copyright 2019 www.mapsofindia.com' written on it. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Many Facebook users uploaded the same map with similar claim.\n\nAFWA found that the website 'Maps of India' does have the viral map. The archived version can be seen here. Right above the map, the website clearly says, \"We are awaiting changes on Government's own websites and official notification. The boundaries are illustrative. Refer to official maps from GOI.\"\n\nAFWA searched the Internet for the latest political map of India and found that Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh had tweeted a photo of the latest map showing \"the Union Territories of #Jammu & #Kashmir and #Ladakh, as these exist after 31st October 2019.\"\n\nNews reports of The Times of India and Live Mint show that the new map is very different from the viral one.\n\nClearly, the map of India that has been shared by many social media users is not the official map of India. The viral image is only an illustration.", "lang": "en"}
