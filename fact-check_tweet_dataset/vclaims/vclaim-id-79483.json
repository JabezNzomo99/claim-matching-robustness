Scott Walker in the November 2018 election, claims Walker is spending too much on debt payments. The former state lawmaker, who won a straw poll among the gubernatorial candidates at the state Democratic Convention, made that attack about a month before the convention.\n\nHer claim came May 2, 2018 in a Wisconsin Eye television interview during this exchange with host Steven Walters:\n\nRoys: I think we\u2019re seeing the effects of putting things on the credit card when it comes to our roads. Now we\u2019re spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance --\n\nRoys: Right. And I think when he (Walker) came in, it was something like 10 or 11 percent.\n\nSo, using percentages, is the state under Walker \"spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance\"?\n\nOn transportation, Walker has been criticized for refusing to raise gas taxes or vehicle fees to bring more revenue into the state\u2019s road fund, opting instead to borrow more money and to delay some road projects.\n\nThe Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan state agency, warned in analyzing Walker\u2019s 2017-\u201919 state budget that \"continued reliance on bonds over a sustained period can result in debt service costs that consume an increasing share of transportation revenue.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Walker has made good on two promises -- to stop \"raids\" on the state transportation fund, and to pay back money that had been transferred from that fund to the state\u2019s general fund under his predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle.\n\nTo assess Roys\u2019 statement, we examined the latest available figures from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which were produced in November 2017.\n\nIn analyzing 2017-\u201919 two-year state budget enacted by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, the bureau provided figures on the total of all transportation debt service as a percentage of gross transportation fund revenue -- in other words, what portion of transportation revenue for road work would be going to paying off debt.\n\nTo look at what\u2019s happened during Walker\u2019s tenure, we use as a base the 2010-\u201911 state fiscal year -- the second year of the final state budget under under his Doyle:\n\nDoubling would be 23 percent, so 20.9 percent is pretty close.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the figures for 2017-18 and 2018-\u201919 are estimates, though they are based on the 2017-\u201919 state budget and are not expected to change much.\n\nRoys says that under Walker, on a percentage basis, Wisconsin is \"spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance\" than before he took office.\n\n \n\n The portion of road revenue being used for debt service was 11.5 percent during the final budget year for Doyle, Walker\u2019s predecessor.\n\nThe figure is projected to reach 20.9 percent during the second year of the current two-year state budget Walker signed, which is nearly doubling.\n\nWith the caveat that the figure for the current budget is an estimate, we rate Roys\u2019 statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
