The photo has been shared in a misleading context; it actually shows a sculpture made by a Thai artist who told AFP it was taken during preparations for an exhibition in Bangkok in 2014.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on December 24, 2019. It has been shared more than 700 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSnake eats tortoise, may those who share win a lottery.\u201d\n\nThe same photo was also published here alongside a similar claim in April 2016 in another Facebook post that has been shared more than 250,000 times.\n\nIt was also shared on Twitter here in May 2014 with a similar caption that translates to English as: \u201cA snake ate a tortoise, they both died eventually. It was probably starving.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe photo has been circulated in a misleading context; it actually shows a sculpture of a snake created by Thai artist Chatchawan Amsomkid.\n\nAmsomkid told AFP via Facebook Messenger on December 26 that he created the metal sculpture entitled \u201cGreedy\u201d. It can be seen here in the pamphlet (pg. 8) for his 2014 solo exhibition, \u201cIn The Serpent's Belly.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\n\u201cThe photo that has circulated in social media posts was shot during the preparation of the event. As you can see there are two metal pieces in the photo, they were used to carry the sculpture up to the exhibition,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt was just about noon, the building\u2019s staff were on break and they came down. I imagine that they found the sculpture interesting, so they took some photos.\u201d\n\nA reverse Google image search found the exact photo was published here on May 20, 2014, in an article by International Business Times that debunked a claim that the snake had eaten a wok.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline reads: \u201c'Python Swallows A Wok' is Hoax, Photo of Snake is a Sculpture\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the International Business Times report (R):\n\nIn June 2014, the Thai Public Broadcasting Service also covered the misinformation about the sculpture, reporting on Facebook here that it was created by a Thai artist.\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai caption translates to English in part as:\n\n\u201cChatchawan Amsomkid does not take offense to the public for misunderstanding, and admitted that reading comments from audiences outside the art scene actually helps him to create new ideas for his future works.\u201d\n\nThe post adds that the sculpture is a \u201cmetaphor of greed, which destroys everything\u201d and is a \u201csatirical take on a society of corruption.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Thai PBS\u2019 post:", "lang": "en"}
