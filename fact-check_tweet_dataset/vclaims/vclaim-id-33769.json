In the image, one can also see two packets of cigarettes placed on the table right next to the girl. Posting the image, Twitter user Ravinar opined, \u201cThe liquor bottle in her hand apart.. This JNU junkie has 2 packs of \u201cClassic\u201d on the table as she smokes one\u2026Each pack costs 300 bucks.. And these castards are whining about fee hike?\u2026\u201d It was retweeted close to 400 times so far.\n\nOne more photograph of a girl who seems to have tied her with a condom is also being circulated on social media. BJP\u2019s State Executive Committee member for Telangana, Karuna Gopal, tweeted the image with a message, \u201cJNU \u2018s fall cannot be explained better than this \u2013 Condom to tie hair & Naked protests\u201d. It is being claimed that the woman in that particular photograph is a JNU student.\n\nThe images are also circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News reverse searched the images on Google and found that both the images are unrelated and old. We were able to trace back the images at least till two years from now.\n\nThe above image was posted on a blog in August 2016 with no context or information whatsoever about the photo. \u201cToday girls\u2026\u201d, reads the title of the blog which includes multiple unidentified images of women smoking or drinking liquor.\n\nThis image was posted by a Twitter user on December 30, 2017. Apart from a generic message, no details about the girl\u2019s identity are unveiled. Hence, if one of the earliest instance of this image on the Internet that Alt News could find doesn\u2019t identify the girl as a JNU student, it is most likely lifted from the Internet and circulated with a misleading context.\n\nIn conclusion, two old and unrelated images were shared on social media to claim that JNU students are splurging money on alcohol and other pleasures of life but they don\u2019t have money to pay their hiked fees.", "lang": "en"}
