But Bush has said that America ought to give priority to Christians fleeing the ravages of religious militants under the command of the Islamic State.\n\nAsked on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation if a Christian preference wouldn\u2019t play into the ISIL narrative that their war was a struggle between Islam and Christianity, Bush said this wouldn\u2019t represent any real change.\n\n\"It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen for religion,\" Bush said . \"This is the practice of our country. There was a bipartisan bill that of course didn't pass in Congress this year to provide preference for Christians who are being slaughtered in the Middle East, persecuted based on their faith. Religious minorities, I think, should have some preference.\"\n\nWe decided to look at whether American officials are legally bound to ask refugees about their religion.\n\nThe short answer is, it depends.\n\nIf a refugee says he or she fears religious persecution, then their religion absorbs a lot of time in the interview process. But if their fear stems from their political views, then there is no obligation to ask about their religion.\n\nStill, experts said it is standard practice to ask refugees about their religion, even if they are not specifically escaping religious persecution.\n\nThe Bush press office pointed us to an opinion piece in the that paraphrased the relevant part of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( ) this way: \"An alien applying for admission must establish that \u2026 religion [among other things] \u2026 was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\"\n\nThe full list of possible grounds for persecution includes \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that there is no legal requirement for refugees to indicate a religious preference. But if they make religion the basis of their claim, then many questions about their religious background follow.\n\nIn some particular cases, the State Department designates certain groups as ones of \"special humanitarian concern\" and in the past, religion has helped define such groups. Examples include Soviet Jews and Iranian religious minorities.\n\nFor those special groups, religion is an essential aspect of the person\u2019s background, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a refugee assistance group that began over a century ago to help Jews fleeing Eastern Europe. (HIAS today works with people of any faith from around the world and has worked with both the UN and the State Department to help refugees.)\n\n\"But this is not due to a legal requirement,\" he said. \"This is to see if they fit in the parameters of the program.\"\n\nMost refugees begin their formal path to resettlement with an interview conducted by staff of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. If a person is headed toward the United States, their next stop is a Resettlement Support Center overseen by the U.S. State Department.\n\nAccording to the department\u2019s press office, the resettlement centers routinely ask about religion. Hetfield affirmed that.\n\n\"There is a data field for religion which is always filled in,\" he said. \"If it is not directly relevant to the claim, U.S Citizenship and Immigration (staff) won't ask about it, but it will be in the applicant's file.\"\n\nWe reached Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch, when he was in Bulgaria interviewing Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers. Frelick said religious affiliation is a typical but optional question for refugees.\n\nThe practitioners we reached found Bush\u2019s emphasis on the legal dimension of asking about religion problematic. To them, simply asking is not screening. It provides information that might ease a refugee\u2019s transition to life in America and finding a place of worship. Screening in the sense of vetting takes place only when the refugee says he or she fears religious persecution.\n\nRefugees are tracked based on the countries they have fled, not their religion, so we don\u2019t know the fraction of refugees claiming religious persecution. Anecdotally, religion plays a role in many refugee applications in the Middle East, whether the person is Sunni or Shia Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Baha'i, or some other faith.\n\nBush said that there is a legal requirement to screen for religion.\n\nU.S. immigration law does state that American officials must dig into a person\u2019s religion if their refugee status is based on a fear of religious persecution. However, there is no formal requirement if the person bases the claim on other grounds. In practice, questions about religion are common even if they are not required.\n\nHis statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
