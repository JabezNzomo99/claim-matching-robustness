This image was actually taken in 2014, and shows a clash between police and protesters in Ukraine.\n\nA post by Donald Trump\u2019s official Facebook account purports to show violence in the US but is in fact of an event in another country. The advert shows one image of Mr Trump in a calm setting talking to police officers beside another of a security official being surrounded by protesters, saying: \u201cPublic safety vs chaos and violence\u201d. However, the image is a photo from a pro-democracy protest in Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThis photograph was taken by photographer Mstyslav Chernov in February 2014 during a protest in Kyiv, Ukraine. The image is available via Wikipedia under a \u201cCreative Commons\u201d license. The terms for this photograph state that it is free to use \u2014 as long as the photographer is given proper credit. But the advertisement on Trump\u2019s Facebook page offered no mention of the photographer.\n\nChernov confirmed to Business Insider that the Trump ad did indeed use his photograph from Ukraine in 2014. Chernov went on to say that the only way to combat this sort of deception is through \u201ceducation and media literacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhotography has always been used to manipulate public opinion. And with the rise of social media and the rise of populism, this is happening even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to combat this is through education and media literacy. When people learn to independently distinguish truth from lies, then the number of manipulations will decrease.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
