School year 2020-2021 is still slated to begin on Aug. 24.\n\nWhat the chief executive said in his 2020 SONA is that he will not \u201callow face-to-face teaching or learning\u201d until a COVID-19 vaccine is available. He clarified an earlier statement where he expressed support for face-to-face classes, saying he was referring to classes resuming in January next year as he expects a vaccine by September.\n\nFB page Freedata was among the first to post the untrue claim on July 27, hours before the president\u2019s SONA took place. Its now-deleted post reads: \u201cNO classes for ALL in 2020-2021. Memorandum Already signed by President Duterte According to His SONA\u2026\u201d\n\nAt least four other pages\u2014Davinci Quotes, SH8T POST \u30c4, Fucking Feelings., and Ily\u2014published the same spurious status update that afternoon. They have collectively garnered more than 36,000 shares and over 2,700 comments, and could have potentially reached more than 2.3 million FB users.\n\nMany netizens, however, were quick to correct the FB pages in the comments sections and accused the pages of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nDuterte recently signed a law allowing him to reopen schools at a date later than August during a \u201cstate of emergency or state of calamity.\u201d This was welcomed by the Department of Education (DepEd), but Education Secretary Leonor Briones has maintained, as of July 21, that classes will proceed beginning Aug. 24.\n\nTeachers\u2019 group Alliance of Concerned Teachers has criticized DepEd saying students were bound to suffer due to the department\u2019s \u201cunprepared\u201d learning modalities under the new normal.\n\nAs of July 29, DepEd has reported over 22.2 million enrollees for the upcoming school year, or about 80 percent of last year\u2019s enrollment.\n\nFreedata was created on Feb. 14, Davinci Quotes on Dec. 27, 2016, SH8T POST \u30c4 on March 25, 2019, Fucking Feelings. on July 30, 2017 and Ily on July 31, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
