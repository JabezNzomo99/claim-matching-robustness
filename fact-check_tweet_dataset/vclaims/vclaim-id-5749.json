Mayor Ted Wheeler has called the intervention an abuse of federal power and blamed it for escalating violence in the city. ( here ). President Donald Trump has accused local leaders of losing control of \u201canarchists and agitators\u201d and said the deployment was necessary to protect federal property ( here ).\n\nThe posts, which feature a photograph of Obama, read: \u201cWhen everyone just blames Trump but forgets who actually signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protestors off the streets in Portland.\u201d Examples are visible here and here .\n\nThe false claim most likely stems from a misleading connection to the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA ( here ). The bill raised concerns over the authorization of indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial ( here ) and was opposed by civil liberties groups and human rights advocates ( here , here ).\n\nAt the time, Obama said he signed the bill \u201cdespite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists\u201d. In his statement Obama also mentioned that his administration would not \u201cauthorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens.\u201d ( here )\n\nProfessor Stephen Vladeck from the University of Texas School of Law told Reuters via email that while the full authority of this law is controversial, \u201cit doesn\u2019t come within a lightyear of what\u2019s happening in Portland, Chicago and other American cities,\u201d adding the claims are misleading, offensive and inflammatory.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security has the legal authority to deploy federal agents to Portland based on 40 U.S. Code \u00a7 1315 (statement visible youtu.be/aOjAX7NTvBU?t=199 , Code visible here ), a law that was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and signed by then-President George W. Bush ( here ).\n\nSome users on social media directly connect recent events in Portland to Obama\u2019s signing of the NDAA ( here , here , here , here ). These claims falsely say that Section 1021 allows the president \u201cto detain anyone he wants, for any reason he wants, without a trial, without a lawyer, without ever seeing any family member again, to be held anywhere in the world, indefinitely.\u201d\n\nProfessor Vladeck pointed out that Section 1021 sets specific criteria according to which individuals can be detained by the military - namely, if they are linked to al Qaeda or related groups.\n\nThe section ( here ) allows the President \u201cto use all necessary and appropriate force\u201d including the authority for U.S. Armed Forces to detain individuals who \u201cplanned, authorized, committed, or aided\u201d the 9/11 attacks in 2001, or were \u201cpart of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners\u201d.\n\nThese provisions are not applicable to protesters in Portland.\n\nFalse. Obama did not sign a law allowing federal agents to \u201csnatch protesters off the streets\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
