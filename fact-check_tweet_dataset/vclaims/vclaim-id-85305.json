His allegation was found baseless by a collaborative Alt News-Newslaundry investigation. But this hardly discouraged Malviya.\n\nTwo days hence, he shared a photograph of an elderly man eating biryani at Shaheen Bagh. In a bizarre tweet, Malviya wrote, \u201cProof of Biryani being distributed at Shaheen Bagh!\u201d Was the BJP leader alluding that the act of eating food at a protest site is an offence or morally incorrect? Should the protesters be participating on empty stomachs? Only he can answer.\n\nMalviya\u2019s misleading tweets are not limited to Shaheen Bagh. Alt News has been monitoring his social media presence for a while now and has found that he repeatedly uses misinformation to discredit individuals, communities, opposition parties, leaders and movements. With him being the official ring leader of BJP\u2019s online propaganda machinery, the misinformation promoted by Malviya has a dangerous ripple effect. His false claims are echoed by party members and supporters of the BJP thus giving rise to large-scale misinformation campaigns.\n\nOn December 28, 2019, Malviya tweeted a video of anti-CAA protest at Lucknow\u2019s Clock Tower and claimed that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised in the rally.\n\nAlt News found that the claim was false. The protesters did not raise pro-Pakistan slogans but said \u2018Kashif saab zindabad\u2019. Kashif saab aka Kashif Ahmad is the Lucknow AIMIM chief. In a conversation with Alt News, AIMIM UP president Haji Shaukat Ali informed that Kashif Ahmad was leading the December 13 protest. In a conversation with Alt News, AIMIM UP president Haji Shaukat Ali informed that Kashif Ahmad was leading the December 13 protest.\n\nThe complete fact-check can be read here.\n\nA video of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act was circulated on social media with a claim that they raised slogans against Hindus. A,ong those who shared it was Malviya.\n\nThe students were actually raising slogans against Hindutva, Savarkar, BJP, Brahminism and casteism. They said, \u201c\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092f\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930. (Grave of Hindutva will be dug on the chest of AMU, grave of Savarkar will be dug on the chest of AMU, this BJP\u2019s grave will be dug on the chest of AMU, Brahminism\u2019s grave will be dug on the chest of AMU, Casteism\u2019s grave will be dug -translated)\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Islamists want CAA protests to be \u2018inclusive\u2019 only till the time you, the non Muslims, start accepting their religious identity, beliefs and supremacist slogans as gospel,\u201d tweeted BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya while sharing a video of journalist Arfa Khanum.\n\nThe speech delivered by Arfa Khanum at Aligarh Muslim University was clipped and misrepresented. They claimed that the journalist was promoting the establishment of Islamic society and urging protesters to maintain a pretence of support to non-Muslims until such a society is created. However, Khanum was stating the complete opposite. She urged protesters to not use religious slogans to maintain the secular character of the movement.\n\n1. Attempts to portray Nehru as an immoral man\n\nIn 2017, the BJP leader had shared a collage of images of first Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru with women. Most of the photographs were of the former PM with his sister or niece. Malviya later took down his tweet but this hardly stopped others from sharing the collage.\n\nAmit Malviya tweeted a video of Dr Manmohan Singh on November 27, 2018, where the former PM can be heard saying, \u201cThe Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were very good.\u201d This clip seemed to suggest that Singh was appreciating the BJP state governments.\n\nAs it turned out, Malviya shared a mischievously clipped video of the former PM\u2019s speech made the previous day. The former PM\u2019s exact words were, \u201cMy relationships with the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good. We never discriminated against BJP-ruled states.\u201d\n\n3. Falsely claimed that Rahul Gandhi signed the Somnath temple register as a non-Hindu\n\nCongress is one of the favourite targets of Malviya. In another tweet from 2017, he had claimed that then party president Rahul Gandhi had signed the register at Somnath temple as a \u2018non-Hindu\u2019.\n\nHowever, handwriting analysis showed that the handwriting in the register did not match with Gandhi\u2019s publically available handwritten notes.\n\nIn 2017, a video of Rahul Gandhi saying, \u201c\u0910\u0938\u0940 \u092e\u0936\u0940\u0928 \u0932\u0917\u093e\u090a\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0907\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0932\u0942 \u0918\u0941\u0938\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0909\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e \u2026(Will install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end.)\u201d was shared by the BJP IT cell head.\n\nThis was a clipped video of a much longer speech where Rahul Gandhi was actually taking a dig at PM Modi during an address in Gujarat\u2019s Patan on November 12, 2017. The complete video was uploaded on the Congress president\u2019s YouTube channel where at 17:50 minutes he can be heard saying, \u201c\u0915\u0941\u091b \u092e\u0939\u0940\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u093e\u095d \u0906\u092f\u0940 \u096b\u0966\u0966 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u095c \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u0926\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e, (\u092a\u0940\u090f\u092e \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0928\u0947) \u090f\u0915 \u092d\u0940 \u0930\u0942\u092a\u092f\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e. \u0906\u0932\u0942 \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0939\u093e \u0910\u0938\u0940 \u092e\u0936\u0940\u0928 \u0932\u0917\u093e\u090a\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0907\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0932\u0942 \u0918\u0941\u0938\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0909\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0921 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e\u2026\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u0939\u0948. (A few months ago there was a flood here and he (PM Modi) said he will give Rs 500 crore but not even a rupee was given. He told potato farmers, will install such a machine that if a potato is inserted from one end, gold will come out from the other end\u2026these are not my words but Narendra Modiji\u2019s words.)\u201d\n\nIn an August 2017 tweet, Amit Malviya claimed, \u201cRahul Gandhi visited Dera Sacha Sauda as recently as Jan 2017 to seek support.. Congress rules Punjab. What quid pro quo did they promise?\u201c He later deleted the tweet.\n\nThe screenshot of the article that Malviya posted is originally an Indian Expressarticle dated January 29, 2017. The article states, \u201cWith just a week to go for the Punjab Assembly elections, AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi Saturday visited Dera Sach Khand Ballan in Jalandhar, the biggest and the most influential among the Dalit Ravidassia community.\u201d Gandhi did not visit Dera Sacha Sauda but Dera Sach Khand Ballan, whose head is Sant Niranjan Dass and not Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.\n\nAlt News\u2019s complete fact-check can be read here.\n\nA video of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was shared by Amit Malviya ahead of 2019 Delhi elections. He claimed that a man was lynched at a Kejriwal roadshow.\n\nMalviya did not tweet the complete picture. Other clips from the video show that Kejriwal was slapped by a person who was then thrashed by the CM\u2019s supporters. Contrary to social media claims, the man was not lynched. However, he was brutally beaten.\n\n2. Misinformation ahead of polling in West Bengal during 2019 Lok Sabha elections\n\nAhead of the Lok Sabha 2019 elections, Malviya tweeted an alleged \u2018first-person\u2019 account of a student of Vidyasagar College about the violence that erupted in the campus during BJP chief Amit Shah\u2019s rally. The \u2018student\u2019 blamed the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for vandalising the bust of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar inside the varsity campus.\n\nIncidentally, the same message was shared by numerous other individuals in the first person. The circulation of the identical message was also noticed by Twitter users. One of them sarcastically wrote, \u201cToday, entire Facebook is \u2018I am a Vidyasagar student\u2019.\u201d\n\nAlt News published an investigative report after analysing visuals of the violence and speaking with faculty members and students of the college. We found that the allegations raised in the post shared by Malviya were misleading.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Telangana assembly elections in 2018, in which the BJP suffered a setback, Malviya tweeted that the party, despite having a 7 percent vote share in Telangana managed to win just one seat, whereas the Owaisi led AIMIM with a vote share of merely 2.7 percent bagged 7 seats in the election.\n\nWhile the numbers cited by Malviya were correct, the claim was misleading. This is because while the AIMIM had a vote share of 2.7%, the party had contested on merely 8 seats, of which it won 7. On the other hand, BJP had contested 118 out of 119 seats in the state assembly. AIMIM thus has a far superior strike rate of 87.5 percent (7 out of 8) in comparison to the BJP\u2019s dismal strike rate of 0.85 percent (1 out of 118). The complete details are available on the website of the Election Commission.\n\n1. Falsely claimed PM Modi is the first \u2018head of the state\u2019 to visit Kumbh\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi took a holy dip in the Ganges in the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh on January 24, 2019. Soon after, Malviya tweeted that PM Modi is the \u201cfirst head of state to visit Kumbh in all these years.\u201d\n\nMalviya\u2019s claim was incorrect on two accounts. First, the prime minister is not the head of the state. S/he is the leader of the cabinet of ministers and the head of the executive branch of the government. The president of India is the head of the state. Based on this, the first head of the state to visit Kumbh was the first Indian president Rajendra Prasad. Second, PM Modi is not the first prime minister to visit Kumbh. The first prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Kumbh in 1954.\n\nAlt News\u2019s complete fact-check can be read here.\n\n2. Attempt to use Nobel winner\u2019s name to endorse demonetisation\n\nThe BJP IT cell head claimed that Richard Thaler, the winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics, praised demonetisation.\n\n\u202a\u201dReally? Damn.\u201c, tweeted Thaler when he was told about the introduction of Rs 2000 note in place of the discontinued Rs 500 and 1000 notes. Malviya\u2019s tweet did not include this bit.\n\nThaler\u2019s statement on demonetisation was in fact as follows: \u201cThe concept was good as a move to a cashless society to impede corruption but the rollout was deeply flawed and the introduction of the Rs 2000 note makes the motivation for the entire exercise puzzling.\u201d\n\nIn a TV debate, Amit Malviya had accused Yogendra Yadav of playing caste politics. In response, Yadav challenged Malviya saying he would withdraw from public life if Malviya was able to produce any evidence to back his claim. Malviya posted a video of Yogendra Yadav where he Yadav is seen and heard speaking to a crowd in Muslim dominated Mewat about his Muslim identity. \u201cI usually don\u2019t carry TV debates to social media but making an exception to expose Yogendra Yadav\u2019s Janus face,\u201d tweeted Malviya attaching a short video clip. The clip ended with the question, \u201cWhen are you withdrawing from public life?\u201d \u2018\n\nIn trying to \u2018expose\u2019 Yogendra Yadav for using his Muslim identity for votes, Malviya used an edited clip which was not even a part of an election rally.\n\n2. Tries to malign Ravish Kumar by sharing a mischievously edited video clip\n\nBelow is a tweet posted by Malviya after the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh. In video, Kumar makes the following statement, \u201cJab tak yeh vyakti mafi nahin mangega aur mein apne party ke logo se kehta hoon ki yeh nationalist hindutva, nationalist nahin hai\u201c.\n\nHowever, if one hears the complete speech, the statement that Kumar made was, \u201ccheen aur burma se jab woh laute to pehla kaam yehi kare ki woh dadhichi ko unfollow kare aur woh bataye ki unse kahe ki hamse galti hui hai. Jab tak yeh vyakti mafi nahin mangega aur mein party ke logo se kehta hoon ki yeh nationalist hindutva, nationalist nahin hai, yeh hum sab ko ek nagrik ki taur par pradhan mantri se maang karni chahiye.\u201d Here, \u201cwoh\u201d refers to PM Modi and Ravish Kumar is urging the prime minister to speak to his own party workers and tell them that people like Dadhichi are not true nationalists.\n\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya while managing the party\u2019s social media activities has shared a deluge of misinformation mainly targetting the opposition. In most of the above examples, he has not taken down his tweets despite fact-check stories debunking false claims. This not only shows a blatant disregard for the truth but also an intent to mislead.", "lang": "en"}
