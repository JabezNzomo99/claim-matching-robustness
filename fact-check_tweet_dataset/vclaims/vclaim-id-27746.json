The video is from Belagavi (or Belgaum) city in Karnataka, and not Gorakhpur.\n\nThe message with the video reads, \"Hathi ka button dabane par vote ja raha hai phool ko, EVM ka virodh karne par laathiya barsaati police, yeh ghatna Gorakhpur ward No 17 ki hai.\"\n\nENGLISH TRANSLATION: When the elephant symbol is pressed, vote goes to flower. On protesting against EVM tampering, police lathi-charged the people. This incident is from Gorakhpur ward No 17..\n\nThe video has been shared more than 35,000 times and viewed by almost 9,00,000 people at the time of filing this story.\n\nThe video was widely circulated in November 2017 too when Facebook page 'Bheem Sena' uploaded it. It has resurfaced and gone viral again.\n\nWith the help of InVid tool, we found that the video dates back to September 4, 2015. On the suspicion of indulging in prostitution and other offenses, these women were beaten up by the Belagavi Police when they tried to escape. The video was circulated at that time too after which four policemen were suspended for their action.\n\nThe incident was widely covered by regional and national media.\n\nBased on the facts, it is established that neither the video is from Gorakhpur nor these women were beaten up for protesting against EVM tampering.", "lang": "en"}
