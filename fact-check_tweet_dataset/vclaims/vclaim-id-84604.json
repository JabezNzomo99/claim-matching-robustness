The story went on to say that \u201cthe Imam of Dimapur is contacting the Rohingya rebels and has commenced collecting huge amount of arms and ammunitions from Bangladesh\u201d and that \u201c2,000 Muslims have volunteered to take up arms against the Nagas, if the latter try to drive them out.\u201d It did not end there. ANI went on to say that around 20 ISIS terrorists had entered Nagaland and were training the volunteers and suicide bomb attacks and bomb blasts were likely throughout Nagaland. ISIS training camps? Bomb attacks throughout Nagaland? Even before we could react to the claims made, the news was deleted by ANI.\n\nThe story disappeared from the ANI website almost as mysteriously as it had appeared but not before it was picked up by websites like Postcard News and India Times. You can read the now deleted ANI story here. We did not find the ANI report in any national newspapers or news channels other than Times Now. Even though the original ANI report has been deleted, the Times Now story is still available.\n\nThe story was also tweeted by several Right-wing handles.\n\nLocal publication Morung Express raised the flag about ANI falling for fake news. It reported that the so-called \u201cnews\u201d was circulating widely on Facebook and WhatsApp groups before ANI reported it. Idgah Committee, the apex body of all the Mosques of Dimapur District had called it false propaganda that was being spread with a malafide intention. The publication also reported that the state Police was not aware about the \u201cintelligence report\u201d and was trying to trace the origin of the social media messages.\n\nAlt News found messages dating back to October 10th on Facebook which claimed that Rohingyas are going to attack Nagaland. The following image is an example of one such chain message. The ANI story as we mentioned earlier was dated October 12th.\n\nYet another North Eastern Portal, Time8 spoke to Renchamo P Kikon, IGP, Intelligence Department of Nagaland Police who said, \u201cWe have not issued any such statement, also the Muslim Council and Idgah Committee of Dimapur have issued statements informing that these news are fake and they didn\u2019t receive any inputs in the matter of Rohingyas. Most importantly, Police has a certain procedure in notifying an issue.\u201d\n\nSo far ANI has not clarified why it deleted its story. Did ANI fall for a fake whatsapp forward? If it was later found to be based on unverified reports, ANI has the responsibility to say so. Quietly deleting a story is not the answer. The deleted story has set into motion the rumor mills, right wing handles and websites like Postcard News who are continuing to share and outrage about it. Interestingly, the breaking of this \u201cnews\u201d came at the time of the Supreme Court hearing on deportation of Rohingya refugees. With so much of fake news around us on social media, if news agencies like ANI also delete stories without a clarification, who do we trust anymore?\n\nSubsequent to our story, Smita Prakash who is the Editor News at ANI has put out a clarification on Twitter which we are presenting here in full. Unfortunately, this news has already reached many because multiple media organisations and fake news portals have republished it and haven\u2019t bothered to pull down their stories.", "lang": "en"}
