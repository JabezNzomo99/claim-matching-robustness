No, that's not true: the story originated on a parody website but it has since been copied by a wide variety of mostly foreign-run copycat sites that push the story without the parody disclaimer in order to generate outrage clicks to earn ad money.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) on So Right It Hurts where it was published on January 1, 2019 under the title \"Supreme Court Rules Muslims can't use The Quran for Swearing into Federal Office\". It opened:\n\nIn a huge victory for Christians everywhere. The Koran has been deemed an invalid and potentially illegal use of a \"religious\" manuscript. Although Jesus taught his disciples to avoid making judgements of others with different faiths he didn't know that these Islamic worshipers were going to be burning people alive! So the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled 5-4 against using the Koran for anything other than scrap paper. the tie-breaker was none other than Brett Kavanaugh who struck down the use of the Quran like a Lib at a Trump rally!\n\nThe author of the story has following bio, giving a first hint the story might not be real:\n\nHugh Parsons\n\nHugh Parsons is a retired brick layer / mason and has had it with all the liberal garbage out there! He hates fact-checkers that tend to ruin the party he brings. His stories fit the far-right narrative so well that you may have to ask, is this really good or even real at all?\n\nA second hint is the slogan \"Parody through mockery\" in the site header, which links to following disclaimer:\n\nEverything on this site is paradoxical, meaning it's a parody of the pain and pleasure points of every person who supports Donny Trump. We do this by using any number of common logical fallacies through patterns of deception. Our goal is to create the most outlandish stories we can think of and see who will still believe them.\n\nAlso note that the website for the United States Supreme Court at present has no search results (archived here) dating after Brett Kavanaugh's tenure that even mention the word \"quran\".", "lang": "en"}
