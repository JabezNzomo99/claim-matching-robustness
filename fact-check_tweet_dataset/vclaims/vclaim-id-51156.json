Functional extinction is when a population becomes so limited that they no longer play a significant role in their ecosystem and the population becomes no longer viable. While some individuals could produce, the limited number of koalas makes the long-term viability of the species unlikely and highly susceptible to disease.\n\nThe story circulated as people shared emotional news about koalas being killed and injured by the fires, a tragedy symbolized by widely seen video of a woman rescuing a koala from bushfire flames. The animal, who was given the name Ellenborough Lewis, was taken to Koala Hospital Port Macquarie for treatment but had to be euthanized on Nov. 25 due to his injuries, despite efforts to save him.\n\nThe term \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d in this context, according to ecologist Diana Fisher, \u201cis used in several different senses. It can mean that a species has declined to a point where it can no longer play the role it once did in [an] ecosystem, with significant effects on that ecosystem.\u201d Speaking to the New Scientist, Fisher said the animals are not functionally extinct in this sense, but noted, \u201cmany populations of koalas are falling sharply due to habitat loss and global warming.\u201d\n\nIt is indisputable that the Australian wildfires in late November 2019 had a devastating impact on the country\u2019s koala population. But experts weighed in to dispute reports that the animals were \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d after that claim went viral. For example, The New York Times reported that \u201csome scientists warned that exaggeration can hurt, rather than help, conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nThe Times quoted Jacquelyn Gill, associate professor at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute and School of Biology and Ecology, saying, \u201cWhat is particularly frustrating about the term \u2018functional extinction\u2019 is it indicates a population that is basically past the point of no return, so it means that nothing really can be done. That might seem like scientists quibbling over terms or trying to argue for nerdy levels of precision, but a strong statement like that should mean something.\u201d\n\nFollowing pushback, Forbes changed the article headline to read, \u201cFires May Have Killed Up To 1,000 Koalas, Fueling Concerns Over The Future Of The Species,\u201d and added an editor\u2019s note stating, \u201cSince publication, the headline and lede of this story have been changed to better reflect the content of the reporting, and some clarifications have been made.\u201d\n\nThe chief source for the Forbes article was Deborah Tabart, who chairs the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF), a non-profit organization that strives to protect the animals. But Forbes failed to note that Tabart made the statement it cited in a May 2019 AKF press release, which was published before the wildfires took place.\n\nIn press interviews following the fallout from the Forbes story, Tabart defended the claim that koalas are \u201cfunctionally extinct,\u201d telling the Times, \u201cI absolutely know that there\u2019s not one koala population that\u2019s safe. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. I have been there. I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve written about it. I\u2019ve been dedicated to this job for 31 years.\u201d\n\nBut Tabart also released a statement on Nov. 14 in which she indicated the impact of the bushfires on the koala population was not yet known. \u201cIt is difficult for the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) to make any meaningful comments regarding the current Australian bushfires until the fires are over and people on the ground have evaluated the situation. We will await their advice. The AKF believes that any Koala losses at this time will be significant, given the Koala is already listed as Vulnerable under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\u201d\n\nThe dispute over the term \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d should not diminish the fact that experts agree the koala population is in jeopardy. As the Times reported:\n\nNoah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said there might have been around 300,000 koalas in Australia in 2016. But things may have changed since then \u2014 especially given the recent fires. \u201cThey\u2019re in a lot of trouble, and they need our care and our help if they\u2019re going to survive,\u201d he said. Koalas evolved to exist alongside wildfires, but the animals are facing new threats from human development, which has dislocated local populations and impaired their ability to survive fires, as well as climate change.\n\nAlthough experts agree that koalas are vulnerable and need to be protected, the Forbes article that reports koalas are \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d as the result of recent Australian bushfires is misleading. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
