The video shows an interview in which Rizza Islam claims that the MMR vaccination program in Africa is part of a \u201cdepopulation agenda\u201d.\n\nFor something to cause depopulation, it must reduce the birth rate and/or increase mortality rates. Firstly, no evidence exists to support the notion that the MMR vaccine reduces fertility. Secondly, there is also no evidence showing that the MMR vaccine leads to death. While many have claimed that data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is proof to the contrary, it is important to keep in mind that VAERS only tracks deaths occurring after vaccination \u2013 on its own, the data does not imply that the MMR vaccine caused the deaths.\n\nThe MMR vaccine has been found to be safe and effective. In fact, the vaccine saves lives \u2013 the latest findings from a 2019 study on the measles vaccination campaign in India also back this up, reporting that \u201cthe campaign averted up to 41,000\u201356,000 deaths during 2010\u201313, or 39\u201357% of the expected deaths nationally\u201d[1]. Additionally, the vaccine also protects people from potentially disabling conditions, such as measles encephalitis, which occurs in a small subset (0.1%) of measles cases, as well as potentially life-threatening infections arising from measles-induced immunosuppression[2,3,4].\n\nHistorical observations show how measles infection resulted in widespread death and depopulation during \u201cvirgin soil epidemics\u201d (e.g. during Christopher Columbus\u2019 expedition to the New World)[5,6], something that could have been prevented if the measles vaccine had been available then. All these facts show that the MMR vaccine would prevent depopulation, not cause it.\n\nWe previously reviewed claims about the MMR vaccine, which were found to be mostly accurate, inaccurate or incorrect:\n\u2022 Human error in vaccine preparation led to the deaths of two children in Samoa after MMR shot \u2013 MMR vaccine itself is safe and effective\n\u2022 Contrary to popular video claim, vaccine ingredients are safe, not linked to encephalopathy\n\u2022 Article wrongly claims that measles vaccine claims more lives than measles infection, misinterprets epidemiological data\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Wong et al.
