You had a number of things that were appropriate to this campaign, were part of what Mr. Trump has been talking about. ... Instead, you took an aside that the Clinton narrative told you was something, Mr. Trump told you he didn't mean, and you played it out for two days.\"\n\nWe hadn\u2019t seen the terrorist attack covered either and wondered if the media had neglected a major story in order to wax on about Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nIndeed, reputable news outlets didn\u2019t cover this story \u2014 because it didn\u2019t happen as Manafort said.\n\nManafort seems to be fumbling an errant story from Russian state media.\n\nThe weekend of July 30, RT.com and Sputnik reported 7,000 armed police with heavy vehicles had surrounded Incirlik air base in Adana, Turkey, where 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed and some 50 U.S. nuclear weapons are stored.\n\nThe two Kremlin-funded outlets suggested that the lockdown was in response to another coup attempt after a faction of the Turkish military failed to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nSo already Manafort is wrong about two key points: The incident occurred two weeks before Trump\u2019s Second Amendment remarks and did not involve terrorists.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Russian outlets\u2019 reports were not exactly reliable.\n\nThere were anti-U.S. demonstrations outside of Incirlik the night before the maneuver, but Turkish authorities said these were small and largely peaceful. They also dismissed speculation of a second coup and explained that police were conducting safety inspections in preparation for a top U.S. military official\u2019s visit, according to Stars and Stripes and Bloomberg.\n\n\"It does appear that RT and Sputnik exaggerated their stories. Perhaps Putin was attempting to inflame emotions between Turkey and America. Which is certainly believable,\" said the conservative blog Right Scoop.\n\nGranted, Incirlik\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons has been a cause for concern, especially after the July 15 coup. Media reports have also documented how the internal Turkish struggle caused some logistical headaches for U.S. troops stationed at Incirlik (including, for example, power outages).\n\nBut that\u2019s a far cry from a terrorist attack that flew under the news radar.\n\nOfficials at the Pentagon and NATO told us there have been no terrorist attacks at Incirlik or NATO\u2019s Allied Central Command (LANDCOM) in Izmir, Turkey. The NATO official also pointed out that Incirlik is actually not a NATO base, though U.S. and Spanish troops are stationed there.\n\nManafort said there was a \"NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists\" the week Trump made his comments about \"Second Amendment people.\"\n\nRussian media speculated that there was a second attempted coup at Incirlik air base in Turkey. That incident was exaggerated and occurred two weeks before Trump\u2019s comments. Furthermore, though it houses NATO troops, Incirlik is not a NATO base. Neither Incirlik or NATO\u2019s central headquarters in Izmir, Turkey, have been attacked by terrorists.\n\nThe event Manafort described did not happen.
