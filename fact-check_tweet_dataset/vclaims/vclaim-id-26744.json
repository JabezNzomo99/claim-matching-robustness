As social media users started talking about the incident, some people encountered an image that supposedly showed a screenshot of a CNN broadcast featuring the chyron \u201cTrump Kills Unarmed Father of Three.\u201d\n\nThis is not a genuine image from CNN but a hoax featuring a fake chyron that never actually aired on the cable network.\n\nA few aspects of this image indicate it\u2019s a work of digital forgery: The red border near the words \u201cBreaking News\u201d is blurry and partially opaque and digital artifacts can also be seen surrounding the main chyron \u201cTrump Kills Unarmed Father of Three.\u201d This indicates that the above-displayed image is not simply a screen capture of a CNN broadcast, but that portions of it were digitally altered.\n\nAnother indication this image is fake: Lemon\u2019s show, \u201cCNN Tonight,\u201d didn\u2019t air on Oct. 27 (a Sunday) when news about al-Baghdadi\u2019s death broke.\n\nThe biggest giveaway, however, comes from Lemon\u2019s photograph. That image is at least a years old and has been used as a thumbnail for a variety of YouTube videos featuring conservative commentators such as Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino:\n\nWe have been unable to pinpoint exactly when that picture of Lemon was taken, but it does not come from CNN\u2019s actual broadcast that announced the death of al-Baghdadi.\n\nThat broadcast featured CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who reported on Trump\u2019s announcement concerning the IS leader\u2019s death. And the chyron for that broadcast: \u201cPresident Trump Announces ISIS Leader Al-Baghdadi Is Dead.\u201d\n\nThe forged chyron appears to have been intended as a joke at the mainstream media\u2019s expense in the wake of a Washington Post gaffe in which a headline described al-Baghdadi as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d instead of the leader of a terrorist organization.", "lang": "en"}
