I don\u2019t want that. I want local education. \u2026 It has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way [led by states]. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d\n\nDepending on which candidate was talking at the most recent Republican presidential debate, viewers may have gotten three different versions of Common Core. Is it a program that states have adopted only because they were \u201cblackmailed\u201d or \u201cforced\u201d to do so? Is it a program that has been taken over by the federal government? Or is it a program that states and local school boards can craft for their students?\n\nCruz says states were blackmailed and forced into adopting Common Core because of Race to the Top, an Obama administration initiative that allowed states to compete for education grants totaling $4.3 billion, using stimulus money. To qualify for full points in the Race to the Top application, states had to commit to adopting standards set at college and career-ready levels and standards that were common to multiple states. Basically, it described Common Core without naming it.\n\nMost states, especially the ones more desperate for money, decided to adopt the standards \u2014 the easiest way to qualify for full points. The Washington Post\u2019s Lyndsey Layton wrote it was a \u201cclever way around federal laws that prohibit Washington from interfering in what takes place in classrooms. It was also a tantalizing incentive for cash-strapped states.\u201d\n\nCruz goes too far in saying that the Obama administration abused executive power. Race to the Top was structured as a possible reward for states that opted in, not as a penalty for those that didn\u2019t. For example, Congress in 1984 passed legislation that reduced highway funding for states that did not set the drinking age at 21, while another law in effect from 1974 to 1995 prohibited federal funding for highway repair in states that allowed a speed limit above 55 miles an hour. The net effect was that every state was forced to raise the drinking age or reduce the speed limit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairest to say that Race to the Top \u2018incentivized\u2019 or \u2018strongly incentivized\u2019 or \u2018coerced\u2019 the states into Common Core,\u201d said Michael Petrilli, president of the Fordham Institute, a right-leaning education-policy think tank. \u201c \u2018Blackmail\u2019 or \u2018force\u2019 \u2014 no, states could decide not to try for the big jackpot of money. But they were broke, it was a lot of money.\u201d\n\nCruz says he would direct the Education Department to \u201cend\u201d Common Core \u2014 that is, before he would get rid of the department. But it\u2019s not possible for a president to do so, Petrilli said, \u201cunless they proposed a bill that would override states\u2019 authority to choose their own standards \u2014 which, of course, would be a gross act of federal micromanagement.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, Congress took measures to scale back the federal government\u2019s power. The Every Student Succeeds Act explicitly says multiple times that the federal government can\u2019t influence local decisions about academic standards. So what Cruz and Trump are proposing already was done by Congress, and there is no longer any federal connection to Common Core.\n\n\u201cOur Constitution has always allocated to states the right of education. They can pass it on to school boards or not, as they see appropriate,\u201d said Andy Porter, director of the Center on Standards, Alignment, Instruction and Learning at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKasich\u2019s characterization of how the system works in Ohio is accurate, said Damon Asbury, director of legislative services for the Ohio School Boards Association, which represents elected public school board members. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the federal government should be telling us what to do,\u201d he said. There were incentives posed by Race to the Top, but \u201cno one put a gun to your head and said, \u2018You have to adopt these standards.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe state board develops the standards in Ohio, and local school boards are free to follow them or develop their own. But most districts end up using the state standards or something close to it, Asbury said, because the state-level assessments are based on state standards.\n\nCruz creates a misleading impression saying the Obama administration \u201cabused executive power\u201d by using Race to the Top funding to \u201cblackmail and force\u201d states into Common Core. States did have a strong incentive to adopt the standards, because they were linked to their chance of receiving Race to the Top education grants. But such incentives are nothing new. Cruz would have a better argument that Obama \u201cabused\u201d his executive power if the administration had decided instead to penalize a state for not opting in.", "lang": "en"}
