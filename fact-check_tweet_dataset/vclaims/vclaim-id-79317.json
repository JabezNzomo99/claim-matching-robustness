Then, she stirred a bit of a tizzy about herself and 49-year-old Kid Rock. \u201cThings got crazy then \u2014 my boy Kid Rock was there and we\u2019ve always teased about getting ourselves married,\u201d the caption read. \u201cWell, the preacher was already there so we had some fun with it. Sorry girls, he\u2019s taken now!\u201d\n\nThat description of Lynn\u2019s Instagram post was accurate:\n\nThe Facebook page for Lynn\u2019s ranch and campground, in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, posted a short video of the moment when the pastor announced the pair as \u201cMr and Mrs. American Badass.\u201d\n\nHowever, as CNN also reported, Lynn later clarified that the \u201cwedding\u201d was no more than a bit of fun. In a second Instagram post, she wrote:\n\n\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t last long, y\u2019all but it sure was fun! I guess I better get on here and let y\u2019all know that it was just a joke \u2014 Kid Rock and I didn\u2019t get married over the weekend, but we had a blast.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
