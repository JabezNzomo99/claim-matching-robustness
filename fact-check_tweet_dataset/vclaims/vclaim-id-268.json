This is false.\n\nMathieu Shamavu and Patrick Ndakasi are rangers for Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is home to more than half of the total population of mountain gorillas, an endangered species facing threats from poachers and armed groups (here).\n\nIn 2019 a selfie the rangers took with two female orphaned gorillas standing upright and posing like humans was shared widely on social media (here).\n\nPosts on Twitter and Facebook, shared more than 47,000 times, have wrongly suggested that Shamavu and Ndakasi have since been killed in an ambush in April, 2020 (here , here).\n\nThe post shows four photos - three of Shamavu and Ndakasi posing with the gorillas, and a fourth of a row of coffins. It has the following caption: \u201cRemember the \u201cGorilla selfies\u201d of two Gorillas posing with anti-poaching rangers who guarded them? They were ambushed and killed amongst 12 other rangers who also dedicated their lives to service and protect endangered gorillas and preserving biodiversity.\u201d\n\nOn April 24, 2020, suspected members of a Rwandan militia did ambush a convoy of civilians in the park (here).\n\nHowever, the Virunga National Park website does not name Ndakasi and Shamavu in the list of the park rangers and employees killed in the attack (here).\n\nWhen asked for comment, the park confirmed to Reuters that neither Ndakasi and Shamavu, nor the gorillas in the viral pictures, died in the ambush.\n\nFalse. Mathieu Shamavu and Patrick Ndakasi did not die in the April 2020 attack in Virunga National Park.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
