As of writing, the claim has been shared on Facebook 79 times, accumulating total interactions (shares, reactions, and comments) of 13,3117.\n\nThe Senate's official website has not published any press release in relation to this alleged statement by Hontiveros. Rappler checked for news reports on the senator's statements but none contained a call for Duterte's ouster through people power.\n\nRappler asked the Facebook page Duterte News Trends \u2013 the newsboxesph.blogspot.com's account \u2013 for their source of the statement. But they did not reply. They did not also specify in their post where the statement was made. The website does not contain any other information about how their authors can be reached.\n\nBoth websites have a disclaimer typical of many hoax sites Rappler has fact checked. The disclaimer says, \"Contributed articles does (sic) not reflect the view of duterteglobalnews.blogspot.com.
