The article\u2019s headline proclaims: \u201cPresident Trump Says He Hopes The NFL Season Gets Canceled Due To Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe article is about Trump\u2019s recent interview with Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis, who asked Trump how confident he was that the NFL would be able to hold its season. Trump replied: \u201cWell they want to open, and they want to open badly and they've been working with government. I would say this: if they don't stand for the national anthem I hope they don't open, but other than that I'd love to see them open and we're doing everything possible for getting them open.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Snark article accurately describes the interaction between Travis and Trump, saying: \u201cTrump also took time to once again rip the NFL, saying that the league may want to have a 2020 season despite the fallout of the Coronavirus outbreak, but if the players kneel, he hopes the league doesn\u2019t open.\u201d However, the headline errs in claiming that Trump said he hopes the coronavirus pandemic shuts down the NFL season.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
