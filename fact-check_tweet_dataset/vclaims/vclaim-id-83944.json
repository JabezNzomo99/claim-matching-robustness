Here is what has happened:\n\u2022 The Presidential Order: The President of India has issued an order that removes some of the special provisions that have been extended to Jammu & Kashmir over the years. It also amends Article 367 of the Constitution, effectively giving more powers to the Delhi-picked Governor \u2013 rather than an elected government \u2013 to decide what happens next. Can a Presidential Order amend the Constitution? This question remains open.\n\u2022 The Article 370 resolution: Home Minister Amit Shah introduced two resolutions in Parliament. \n\nThe first recommends that the President issue another order deleting all the clauses of Article 370 \u2013 which carves out Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special status in India \u2013 and replaces it with a line that effectively brings the state in line with the rest of India.\n\u2022 The Reorganisation: Shah\u2019s second resolution does one complicated thing, that Sruthisagar Yamunan explains here. Because President\u2019s Rule is in effect, the Parliament of India has the powers of the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly. Normally only state assemblies are expected to ratify a call for reorganisation of their own states, but with the power of President\u2019s Rule, Shah is using Parliament in the character of the Jammu & Kashmir Assembly to ask for the state\u2019s status to be changed. \n\n\n\nHow? By splitting it into two: The new-look state would see the region of Ladakh become a Union Territory with no legislature. The regions of Jammu & Kashmir would also become a separate Union Territory, but with a legislature. Either way however, the democratic powers of both these regions would be curtailed, with more power vested in Delhi.\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nIn effect, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government is using\n\na legal technicality \u2013 since Jammu & Kashmir is under President\u2019s\n\nRule \u2013 to remove the autonomous powers that the state had within the\n\nIndian Republic. And it is doing this without involving any\n\nelected representatives from the state and in fact while some of the\n\nmost prominent leaders are under house arrest. It does not even need a\n\nConstitutional Amendment, which would require the support of two thirds\n\nof Parliament for it to pass, and is instead passing an ordinary Bill.\n\nWhether this will stand up in court is an open question.\n\nWhy was Jammu & Kashmir treated differently in the first place?\n\n370 and Article 35A, the main provisions that carved out a special\n\nposition for Jammu & Kashmir within the Indian republic, were never\n\nfavours granted down to the state. Instead, they were the foundation on\n\nwhich the state decided to enter the Indian Union. The history is\n\nobviously incredibly complex, but to put it quite simply, the newly\n\nformed Union of India, in the years after Independence, allowed a number\n\nof states previously headed by maharajas and other leaders (known as\n\nthe \u201cprincely states\u201d) to join on their own terms.\n\nKashmir was poised between Pakistan and India, its position was\n\ninitially ambiguous, but after the invasion of tribesmen and Pakistan\n\nArmy men in disguise, Raja Hari Singh signed an Instrument of Accession\n\nand the state eventually made its way into the Union. It did so,\n\nhowever, on the basis of a number of special conditions. Entire books\n\nhave been written about this process and the fact that a plebiscite was\n\npromised to the people of the state, but the ultimate outcome was that\n\nJammu & Kashmir become a part of India, albeit with a unique status\n\nThe Indian Express has a good explainer on this history, and Scroll.in has covered the various debates over these provisions at length.\n\nWhy is this being done?\n\nremoval of Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special status has been a\n\nlong-standing demand of many on the Right, who believe that it\n\nperpetuates an unfair compact within the Republic and is responsible for\n\nallowing militancy to flourish in the state. It was also a promise in\n\nthe BJP\u2019s manifesto. Amit Shah, while introducing the changes, also\n\nclaimed that the special rules for the state have meant that groups\n\nwithin it, like Scheduled Castes and women, were discriminated against.\n\nthe proposed changes do not just alter the special status of Jammu and\n\nKashmir. They also seek to turn it into a Union Territory. This means it\n\nwould not have full federal, democratic rights within the Indian Union,\n\nand instead will be subject to much more power being wielded by New\n\nDelhi \u2013 including over subjects of land and law and order.\n\nthe city, is itself a Union Territory with a legislature, the same\n\nmodel proposed for Jammu & Kashmir. This situation, where it doesn\u2019t\n\nhave full rights, has led to tremendous conflict between the elected\n\ngovernment of Delhi and the Centre, and it is quite likely that the same\n\nwould happen as a result of this change \u2013 with the balance of power\n\nlying clearly on the side of the Centre.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nwill spend the day debating the proposed resolutions and the Bills, but\n\nbecause they have not been proposed in the form of a Constitutional\n\nAmendment, it seems likely that the government has the numbers to make\n\nMeanwhile, the government has ensured a complete\n\nclampdown in Jammu and Kashmir, curtailing all communication, movement\n\nand gathering. Whenever information does trickle through into the\n\nValley, though, it is likely to receive tremendous amounts of pushback\n\nfrom the state \u2013 which is why the government curtailed civil liberties\n\nin the first place.\n\nThis article was originally published on scroll.in and has been republished with permission.", "lang": "en"}
