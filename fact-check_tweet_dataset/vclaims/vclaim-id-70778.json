Still, Andy Brown\u2019s claim in a mailer stopped us short: \"Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas.\"\n\nBrown, an Austin lawyer running for Travis County judge, aired his statement under an arrow suggesting county tax bills steadily escalated while his Democratic primary opponent, Sarah Eckhardt, served on the Travis County Commissioners Court.\n\nWe\u2019re focusing here on whether the county has the highest tax rate of the state\u2019s urban counties.\n\nBy email, Brown\u2019s campaign manager, Jim Wick, told us the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rate in other counties that are home to the state\u2019s five largest cities. Wick included a chart indicating that in this subset, the Travis County rate of $0.5001 per $100 property valuation exceeded the rates in Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and El Paso counties. El Paso County, Brown\u2019s chart indicates, had the next-highest rate, $0.40887 per $100 valuation.\n\n\"Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a \u2018big city\u2019 in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas,\" Wick wrote. By phone, he said: \"We were trying to compare apples to apples.\"\n\nWe took our own, broader look. Online, the Texas Association of Counties drew on data collected by the state comptroller\u2019s office to listing the \"general fund property tax rates\" for every Texas county for 1996 through 2012. Among the , the chart and our own web research suggested that in 2012 and 2013, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate--topped only by Hidalgo County, which is home to McAllen near the Texas-Mexico border. Hidalgo County\u2019s rate of $0.59 per $100 valuation in 2012 and 2013 compared with Travis County\u2019s respective rates of $0.5001 and $0.4946 per $100 valuation. Among these 15 counties, Travis-neighboring Williamson County had the third-highest 2013 rate, $0.49029 per $100 valuation.\n\nTravis County\u2019s rates in 2012 and 2013 far outpaced the total rates in the state\u2019s four more populous counties. In this subgroup, the next-closest 2013 rate--$0.40021 per $100 valuation--was levied by the most populous county, Harris. The other more populous counties and their total tax rates: Dallas ($0.2431 per $100 valuation); Tarrant ($0.2640 per $100 valuation); and Bexar ($0.296187 per $100 valuation).\n\nWe noticed another wrinkle in that Travis County has long had one of the highest tax rates among the urban counties. There wasn\u2019t a change in this respect in Eckhardt\u2019s time as a commissioner.\n\nAccording to the information compiled by the counties\u2019 association, Travis County had the highest total rate among the five most populous counties every year from 1996 through 2012. Travis County\u2019s total rate even exceeded the Hidalgo County rate from 1996 through 1999, the chart indicates, though Hidalgo has had a higher rate every year since.\n\nWhen we pointed this out, Wick told us the mailer\u2019s use of \"now\" was intended to mean at \"this very moment.\"\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that however the county\u2019s tax rate compares to others, it would take more research to tell whether Austin-area residents pay more in property taxes than other Texans. Each local resident\u2019s tab includes taxes collected by governmental entities including, perhaps, the city of Austin and a school district.\n\nBrown said Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas.\n\nTravis County had the second-highest total property tax rate of the state\u2019s 15 most populous counties in 2012 and 2013, we found, also levying the highest rate of the state\u2019s seven most populous counties.\n\nBut in contrast to Brown\u2019s message, Travis County's tip-top ranking isn't new. The county\u2019s rate has exceeded the rates of more populous counties every year since 1996.\n\nWe rate this claim, which lacked these clarifications, as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
