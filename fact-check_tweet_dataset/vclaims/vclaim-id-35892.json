And the broom-balancing myth has likewise grown to encompass days other than the equinox on which \u2014 according to NASA, supposedly \u2014 \u201cgravitational pull\u201d and/or a \u201cplanetary alignment\u201d creates just the right conditions for brooms to stand on their ends unsupported:\n\nAs with the egg-balancing myth, this broom-standing phenomenon has nothing to do with equinoxes or planetary alignments. With some practice and patience, anyone can make a broom (or an egg) stand on its end any day of the year.\n\nAs explained in this video, a broom typically has a low center of gravity positioned just above the bristles. So if you stand a broom on end and spread the bristles just right, you can form a tripod-like structure which will hold up the broom:", "lang": "en"}
