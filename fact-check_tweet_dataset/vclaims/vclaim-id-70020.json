A day after, reports of clashes in Norway breaking out during an anti-Islam rally also surfaced.\n\nAmid this, an image purportedly showing Muslim refugees in Switzerland burning the Swiss flag went viral on social media. According to the claim, Muslim men burnt the Swiss flag in 2019, demanding the removal of the Cross from the flag.\n\nThe caption to one such image uploaded on Twitter read, \u201cLast year #Muslim #refugees in #Switzerland demanded removal of #Cross from the #SwissFlag. How thankless a community can be to a country which has given them refuge on their homeland?\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is false. This is an old image from Pakistan. The flag being burnt in the image is not Swiss but Danish.\n\nSimilar claims are also shared on Facebook.\n\nThe archived versions of the claims can be seen here, here, here and here.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found that the picture in question is almost 14-years-old, dating back to 2006. But the image has been circulating on social media since at least 2016 with claims that Muslim men are burning the Swiss flag.\n\nAlso, with a simple Google search, it was clear that the flag in the viral image is not the flag of Switzerland but the Denmark flag.\n\nThe flag of Switzerland has a white cross with equilateral arms in the centre of a square red field. On the other hand, the flag of Denmark which is also red in colour has an off-centre white cross that extends to the edges of the flag - as seen in the viral image.\n\nOn further search, we found that the image is part of a 2006 outrage that hit several Muslim countries following the publication of cartoons featuring prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper.\n\nWe found the image uploaded on the British-American stock image site, Getty Images in the year 2006. According to the site, the image was taken in Pakistan on February 23, 2006, by photographer Rizwan Tabassum for AFP.\n\nThe description of the photograph titled, \u201cPakistani Muslims torch a Danish flag\u201d reads, \u201cPakistani Muslims torch a Danish flag during a demonstration in Karachi, 23 February 2006. Pakistani hardline Islamic parties continued countrywide protests denouncing the publication of cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed in several European newspapers.\u201d\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad Cartoon controversy exploded after a Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a dozen cartoons of the Prophet under the headline \u201cThe Face of Muhammad\u201d on September 19, 2005.\n\nThousands protested and hundreds died in a worldwide protest against the cartoon in 2005 and in 2006. Several western newspapers reprinted cartoonist Kurt Westergaard's cartoon, the one that had caused the controversy, in protest of an alleged plot to kill him.\n\nThe image in question was taken during one such protest against the reprinting of the cartoon by the western newspapers. The protestors were angry about the cartoon, not the cross on the flag. Also, no credible media report was found regarding the torching of the Swiss flag by the Muslim community in Switzerland.", "lang": "en"}
