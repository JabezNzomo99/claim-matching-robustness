Both claims are correct.\n\u2022 None Ohuabunwa\u2019s claim that Nigeria has 69 research institutes is unproven. A fourth claim, that the federal government is not funding any Covid-19 research, is incorrect. \n\n\n\nNigeria is struggling to mount an effective response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a top pharmacist.\n\nSam Ohuabunwa, the president of the\n\n, said in a May 2020\n\nnewspaper that the government could have done more to reduce the spread of Covid-19.\n\nTwo months earlier, Ohuabunwa had poked holes in Nigeria\u2019s readiness after its\n\nwas confirmed on 28 February. As of\n\n, the country had more than 17,000 cases and 455 deaths.\n\nThe pharmacist made a number of claims in the interview, covering research and vaccines. We took a closer look at four of them.\n\nto Ohuabunwa for his evidence for the claims, but he is yet to respond. We will update this report when he does.\n\nHis claim that Nigeria had made vaccines decades ago was in response to a question on whether the country could have been part of the global race to find a vaccine if a production laboratory in Lagos was still functional.\n\nOhuabunwa described it as a \u201cshame\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can see that we are going backwards in every aspect. If in the 70s and 80s we were producing vaccines and in 2020 we are not producing any,\u201d Ohuabunwa said.\n\nis a biological preparation that helps the body\u2019s immune system recognise and fight viruses and bacteria.\n\n\u201cThe Yaba laboratory started producing smallpox vaccine in 1930s, followed by anti-rabies vaccine in 1948 and yellow fever vaccine in 1952,\u201d Oyewale Tomori, a professor of virology and former president of the\n\nreport on the laboratory showed that it was making yellow fever vaccines in the 1970s and 1980s. It\n\n316,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine in 1978, reaching a peak of more than 500,000 doses in 1987.\n\nOhuabunwa lamented Nigeria\u2019s inability, in 2020, to have a working lab to make vaccines.\n\nTomori, the regional virologist for the\n\nfrom 1994 to 2004, said there had been attempts to upgrade the Yaba vaccines laboratory in 1991.\n\nBut several national setbacks, including political instability, meant this did not happen, he said.\n\n\u201cThat facility should have been upgraded to produce more vaccines, but it gradually became inactive,\u201d Tomori told Africa Check.\n\nCould there be others making vaccines?\n\nProf Babatunde Salako, the director general of the Lagos-based institute, said it did have a vaccine production laboratory,\n\n\u201cbut it is not functioning well\u201d. He didn\u2019t clarify the lab\u2019s level of functionality. He directed Africa Check to the pharmaceutical firm\n\nIn 2017, the Nigerian government partnered with\n\nto revive the federal vaccine laboratory in Lagos and start local production of vaccines until 2021. This, it said, would make Nigeria less reliant on international donors such as Gavi, the\n\n\"Yaba facilities are being resuscitated for renewal of production of yellow fever and measles vaccines with plans for an ultra modern vaccine plant in Ota, Ogun State,\u201d May & Baker\u2019s website\n\nWe have asked the firm if it has produced any vaccines yet, and will update this report when they respond.\n\nTomori told Africa Check that no human vaccines were currently being produced in the country. Only vaccines for animals were being made.\n\n\u201cThere is no vaccine lab in Nigeria except at the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, which is producing veterinary vaccines. The vaccine lab at Yaba is dead.\u201d\n\nHe said the federal government\u2019s partnership with May & Baker was an attempt to change this.\n\nurging the government to reopen the Yaba facility to help fight diseases such as Covid-19.\n\n, said the laboratory was closed for upgrades in 1991 and remained locked.\n\n\u201cThe House is aware that in 2017, the federal government signed a partnership agreement with May and Baker Nigeria Plc to float a company named Biovaccine Limited for the commencement of local vaccine production in Nigeria, however, the company is yet to commence the production of those life saving vaccines,\"\n\nOhuabunwa urged the government to properly evaluate and fund those who had claimed to have treatments for the virus.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to have 69 research institutes shows that Nigeria understood that research pays, but the question is what are they doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you go to them you would see they are not well funded.\u201d\n\nAfrica Check has asked Ohuabunwa what types of research institute he was referring to, as\n\nfrom public to private and independent, and those at universities.\n\nin Nigeria to the blog\n\n. It says it provides \u201cinspirational quotes as well as the very best of student-related content\u201d.\n\nEnebeli Ifenayi, who works on the blog, told Africa Check that \u201c\n\nthe figure may not be complete. We only listed 69 known research institutes in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut according to Nigeria\u2019s\n\nhead of the bureau\u2019s national accounts and macro-economic analysis unit,\n\ntold Africa Check that according to 2020 data, \u201c\n\nNigeria has 41 research institutes not 69 institutes. That is the figure we have in our data.\u201d\n\nWe also looked for publicly funded institutes in budget documents. Nigeria\u2019s\n\nBut without clarification of what type of research institutions Ohuabunwa meant, we can only rate this claim as unproven.\n\nExperts, however, agree that research institutes are not adequately funded.\n\n\u201cRather than talking about the number, I\u2019ll talk about a merger,\u201d Prof\n\n, the head of the\n\nHe said in his view, all health research institutes in Nigeria should be collapsed into one to save public funds and strengthen collaboration.\n\nTanimola Akande, a professor of public health, said research institutes in Nigeria were not funded to \u201cbe really productive\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe enabling environment for high impact research is scarce,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\nI can tell you conclusively and authoritatively that to date, no single research [into Covid-19] has been sponsored in Nigeria. None, the government has not sponsored any,\u201d\n\nBut he is off the mark here.\n\nof the coronavirus strain in Nigeria\u2019s first Covid-19 case. \u201cIt proved it to be a match with the virus circulating in Italy and Wuhan,\u201d the centre said.\n\n\u201cIt would not be right to say no single Covid-19 research has been sponsored by the Nigerian government,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\nHe said the NIMR was conducting a trial of chloroquine and erythromycin, funded with a donation from the minister of works and housing,\n\nSalako added that scientists at the institute were also trying to come up with a diagnosis kit and working on a candidate vaccine.\n\n\u201cAll this research is happening in NIMR and is being done with government funds, not ours. As I speak to you, researchers are conducting research on Covid-19, and it isn\u2019t their money they are using to do research.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
