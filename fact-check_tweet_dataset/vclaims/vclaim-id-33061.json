It was posted on August 8, 2016, and had over 2.8 million views as of writing. It also garnered over 88,000 shares, 10,000 reactions, and 5,000 comments.\n\nThe video is being circulated again on Facebook despite being posted 3 years ago.

Her whole speech lasted for 38 minutes and 46 seconds.\n\nThe video posted by Pinoy Republic omitted key parts of De Lima\u2019s speech and arranged it in such a way that it presents a whole new narrative.\n\nAt the same time, the senator also praised the President for his \u201cdetermination\u201d in eradicating the drug problem in the country. She said that she also spearheaded the operations to clean up the New Bilibid Prison of drugs.
