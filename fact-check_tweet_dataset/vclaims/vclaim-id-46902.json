The claim is misleading; paying blood donors is not illegal in the US but the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says hospitals \u201cchoose not to use products from a paid donor\u201d over safety concerns; blood donations in the US are subject to strict labelling laws enforced by the FDA.\n\nThis image has been shared over 4,800 times since being posted to Facebook on December 17, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala-language text in the image translates to English as: \u201cAmericans don't donate blood for free. The American blood bank pay 30 USD - 50 USD per unit of blood. The American blood bank also does not provide blood to hospitals free of charge. They sell each unit of blood for a price of 180 - 300 USD to each hospital. Even the hospitals sell the blood to needy patients at a very high price. / But Sri Lankans donate blood without any expectation of a payment. / Long queues are formed whenever a blood camp is held to donate blood free of charge, even Lankan hospitals provide blood free of charge. How much greater are we than Americans?\"\n\nSimilar claims were also published here, here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim is misleading, While the US has not banned paying for blood donations, hospitals choose not to use products from paid donors, according to the FDA, a federal agency responsible for protecting public health and regulating medical and food supplies.\n\nThe FDA began requiring strict labeling for paid blood donations in 1978.\n\n\u201cAll blood and blood components that are intended for transfusion and collected during the donation at which the donor received the monetary payment must be labeled with the 'paid donor' classification statement,\u201d according to the FDA\u2019s policy here.\n\nThe \"paid donor\" label, the FDA adds here, must be in \u201cno less prominence than the proper name\u201d of the blood type or blood byproduct.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, hospitals choose not to use products that are labeled from a paid donor for liability reasons,\u201d the FDA notes in a separate policy document here.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, authorities began controlling paid blood donations after it was determined that a monetary system increased the spreading of diseases.\n\n\u201cRecipients of blood from paid donors were at higher risk of developing post-transfusion hepatitis than were recipients of blood from non-paid donors,\u201d the CDC, the US\u2019 health protection agency, stated here.\n\nThe CDC added that the \u201cshift from a paid to a non-paid blood donor base substantially reduced\u201d the incidences of post-transfusion disease.\n\nMultiple nonprofit health organisations also note that blood donors are not paid in the US.\n\nThe American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), a group that has developed standards concerning blood collection in the US, states on its website that \u201cblood collected for transfusion in the US is collected from volunteer blood donors.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the AABB\u2019s website\u2019s Blood Donation FAQ page. AFP has highlighted the relevant portion in red:\n\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) also asserts that \u201cblood from paid donors cannot be used in the United States for transfusion purposes.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the ACS website:\n\nThe effort to eliminate paid blood donations is a global movement. In 2010, the World Health Organization and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies announced a global framework aimed at achieving 100 percent voluntary blood donations worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe donation of blood by voluntary non-remunerated blood donors is recognized as being crucial for the safety and sustainability of national blood supplies,\u201d the organisations noted in their 2010 report.\n\nThe report adds that paid blood donations pose \u201cserious threats to the health and safety of the recipients\u201d and that \u201cpaid donors are vulnerable to exploitation and commercialization of the human body as they usually come from the poorer sectors of society and become paid blood donors due to economic difficulties.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
