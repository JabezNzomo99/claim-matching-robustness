Auspicious Akhilesh, happy country, happy state. Advertiser \u2013 Sunil Singh \u2018Sajan\u2019 MLC, Lucknow Unnao.)\u201d\n\nSeveral individual users and Facebook pages also circulated the imagery.\n\nA few Twitter users have also shared the photograph of the hoarding.\n\nA journalist with The Hindu, Nistula Hebbar, also circulated the image of the hoarding while tweeting, \u201cCan Hindi pundits (who poke holes in other non Hindi speakers\u2019 Hindi posts) please explain this\u2026?\u2019\n\nAlt News found images of the same hoarding with a different text shared by social media users in January 2019. \u201c\u0928\u0935 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0916\u093f\u0932\u0947\u0936 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935 (A heartfelt possibility of the new year Shri Akhilesh Yadav.)\u201d \u2013 read the actual text of the billboard. It appears that the hoarding was installed with a grammatical error in the sentence. Instead of the word \u2018\u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e (possibility)\u2019, the hoarding should\u2019ve carried the word \u2018\u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902 (best wishes).\u2019\n\nThe distinction in the text on the two hoardings is evident in the photo montage below.\n\nSP\u2019s Sunil Singh Yadav, MLC Lucknow and Unnao, whose name was mentioned on the billboard, called out the misinformation on Twitter. He wrote in Hindi, \u201cAfter being boycotted by the public, BJP\u2019s IT cell (internet terrorist)l, which is trying to capture EVMs, has stooped low. They have meddled with an old hoarding of mine and circulating rumours. Such cheap tactics will not weaken but strengthen society\u2019s fight.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Alt News had debunked photoshopped images of hoardings targetting Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal.", "lang": "en"}
