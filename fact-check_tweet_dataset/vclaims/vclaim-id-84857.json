On several occasions, especially in the evening session of the 11-hour hearing, Clinton suggested this figure came from the State Department. (For instance: \u201cThe State Department was beginning to turn over to this committee my e-mails because they had between 90 and 95 percent of all my work-related e-mails in the State Department system.\u201d)\n\nFirst of all, the State Department is correct. The \u201c90 to 95 percent\u201d figure comes from the Clinton campaign. There has never been a calculation made by the State Department of the 55,000 pages of the e-mails provided by Clinton from her private e-mail account. So Clinton got that wrong.\n\n\u201cOf the more than 30,000 e-mails that Secretary Clinton provided to the State Department last year, more than 90 percent were sent to or from a state.gov e-mail address,\u201d a Clinton campaign spokesman said. \u201cThat is observable by looking at the e-mails that were provided for release by the department. These messages would have been captured in the State Department\u2019s record system. It has since been learned that the State Department\u2019s archiving system did not maintain every e-mail, but that does not change that these messages were captured by State\u2019s system and thus should have been available.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unpack that statement. Essentially, Clinton\u2019s lawyers looked through the e-mails and found that at least one person in the e-mail chain \u2014 either sending an e-mail to Clinton or receiving it \u2014 had a state.gov e-mail address. So in theory, if a search was requested of the e-mails of person who corresponded with Clinton, Clinton\u2019s e-mails would have shown up.\n\n\u201cWhat I did was to send e-mails to people at their government accounts, which I had every reason to believe would be captured on the government systems. And when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I\u2019m the one who said, okay, great, I will go through them again. And we provided all of them. And more than 90 percent were already in the system.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also not unreasonable for Clinton to assert that most of these e-mails resided somewhere in the State Department\u2019s systems. Gowdy referenced an 2015 inspector general\u2019s report concerning poor e-mail retention at the State Department, but that report concerned the e-mails of lower-level officials, under a system known as SMART (State Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset). A footnote in the report makes that clear: \u201cThese assessments do not apply to the system used by the Department\u2019s high-level principals, the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, and their immediate staffs, which maintain separate systems.\u201d (A statement from the National Archives also emphasizes that high-level memos are not captured by SMART.)\n\nSo, when the State Department received a request for e-mails concerning 2012 Benghazi attacks, officials used those systems to search the records of three people who were closest to Clinton then: Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan and Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, according to a declaration filed in federal court by John F. Hackett, director of the Office of Information Programs and Services, concerning a lawsuit by Judicial Watch. Officials searched their records for terms containing words such as \u201cambassador,\u201d \u201cattack,\u201d \u201cBenghazi,\u201d \u201cLibya\u201d and \u201ctalking points.\u201d Any document that contained these terms would be returned as possibly responsive to a FOIA request.\n\nThis search turned up four documents. After the State Department obtained Clinton\u2019s e-mails on her personal server, the same criteria was used to search them and no documents were deemed relevant. Interestingly, after the department asked Mills, Sullivan and Abedin to search their personal e-mails, Hackett said that one of Sullivan\u2019s personal e-mails helped officials realize that a Clinton e-mail previously deemed as not relevant actually concerned the infamous Benghazi talking points. But that wasn\u2019t previously clear in the e-mail chain contained in Clinton\u2019s records. (Sullivan had not forwarded that part of the message to Clinton.)\n\nUnder FOIA, agencies are not necessarily expected to find every record; rather, they are expected to produce records based on a \u201creasonable search\u201d of what\u2019s in its custody and control at the time. So at the State Department, FOIA searches are generally custodian-based, which means that individuals and offices are tasked with FOIA requests. Each custodian is responsible for producing any responsive records they have \u2014 regardless of medium (e-mail, paper or other electronic records). Since the Clinton e-mail issue emerged, though, the State Department says it is now automatically preserving the records of Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his senior aides.\n\nWhile not all of the e-mails she submitted to the State Department have been released, what has been made available so far suggests that a substantial majority are to and from at least one \u201cstate.gov\u201d e-mail address. It is not an unreasonable assumption that these e-mails are contained somewhere within the bowels of the State Department. But Clinton cannot make a definitive statement and certainly cannot attribute that to the State Department.", "lang": "en"}
