Carona (sic) virus vaccine invented.\u201d\n\nThe video does not show either Sause or Trump announcing the launch of a vaccine to fight SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.\n\nThe short clip -- lifted from NBC News\u2019 80-minute live coverage of Trump declaring a national emergency in the U.S on March 13 -- shows Sause thanking the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for authorizing the emergency use of Roche\u2019s newly developed SARS-CoV-2 testing kits.\n\nA March 12 press release on the company\u2019s website says the FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their testing kits, meant to detect positive cases of COVID-19. The EUA means the kits are not yet cleared or approved by the FDA but are authorized for use in laboratories given the current emergency.\n\nRoche\u2019s testing kits can supposedly provide up to 96 test results in about three-and-a-half hours, the news release read. There are currently over 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases detected in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins case tracker.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), which conducts tests on suspected COVID-19 patients, takes 24 to 48 hours to produce test results.\n\nThe false FB post surfaced following reports that American pharmaceutical company, Kaiser Permanente, started conducting on March 16 the first trial of a coronavirus vaccine in humans in the U.S.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s false and misleading post has already been shared over 2,700 times, gained over 1,100 reactions, and viewed more than 311,000 times since March 18.", "lang": "en"}
