No, that's not true: While the labeling on an ear loop mask box does say the wearer is not protected from COVID-19, the purpose of a mask is to protect other people from viruses that may be spread by the wearer. Studies concluded the mask protects other people who are near the person wearing the mask. Research published on June 24, 2020, found the health payoff would be enormous if 95% of Americans wore face masks in public during the 2020 pandemic.\n\nThe latest \"masks-don't-help\" claim appeared in a photo (archived here) of a mask box label published on Facebook on June 21, 2020, under the title \"Just saying.\" It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nIf 95% of Americans wore masks in public, it could prevent 33,000 deaths by October 1, 2020, according Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation:\n\nFurther, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new recommendation on June 25, 2020, saying\n\nThe evidence is mounting in favor of universal mask-wearing because even non-surgical (cloth, ear-loop and tie-back) models do block people's exhalations from reaching others. A Cornell University study found that if 70% of the general public wore masks and contact tracing were conducted efficiently, epidemic growth would be flattened within four days in the hardest hit countries.\n\nThis is because aerosolized mist and larger droplets expelled during conversation or coughing/sneezing would not escape into the air that others breathe.The CDC points out that in a room with other people,\n\nIt is true that the cloth masks with ear loops do not offer the same degree of protection as, say, an N-95 facial respirator. But they serve the purpose of blocking the expulsion of droplets during conversation, singing, coughing/sneezing, according to the CDC and respected medical experts at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nA Mayo public information page affirms that wearing masks does slow the spread of Covid-19. \"Ear loop\" masks made of multiple layers serve a purpose. Mayo advises making the mask snug (which can be done by adjusting the loops).\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines state that cloth/non-respirator masks\n\nTesting shows that 25 percent of people who catch Covid-19 don't show any symptoms at all. Yet they walk among others and spread the virus. If they wore masks to block the droplets they exhale with every breath and conversation, all those in the store or room or elevator with them would be safer. (CDC)\n\n\"Feeling healthy doesn't necessarily mean you don't have it,\" the agency states.\n\nLead Stories has debunked several stories making the same false claims that masks do not help. One such story debunks five reasons not to wear a mask.\n\n\n\nOSHA addresses the role masks play in preventing viral spread from asymptomatic carriers. The agency recommends:\n\nOSHA recommends using facemasks to cover a person's mouth and nose to prevent spread of respiratory secretions because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. Now, source control measures are recommended for everyone in a healthcare facility, even if they do not have symptoms of COVID-19 according to a June 19 CDC publication.\n\nA CDC video shows what happens when someone coughs or sneezes and gives visible proof of the value of a mask that covers the lower face. It proves that exhaled drops both spray outward andy upward where they hang in the air (as aerosolized droplets) for someone to pass by and inhale.\n\nAnyone who watches it would want other people to block the spray by wearing a mask.\n\nFact-checking organization Politifact rated this Facebook post 'False' because people misinterpret such information to mean the masks are worthless.\n\nRead earlier Lead Stories articles about false claims concerning face masks and COVID-19:\n\nFact Check: Meme Claiming Five Reasons Not To Wear A Face Mask Is Misleading\n\nFact Check: OSHA Did NOT Say Cloth Masks Don't Work And Will Reduce Oxygen To Danger Levels\n\nFact Check: Video Showing Dr. Anthony Fauci Saying, 'No Reason To Be Walking Around With A Mask' Is From Early March, NOT Recently\n\nFact Check: It Is NOT Illegal For Businesses To Require Customers To Wear Masks, Masks Are Not A Health Hazard, And COVID-19 Is Not A Plot To Kill Everyone\n\nFact Check: Hypercapnia Does NOT Occur From Constant Use Of A Mask As Advised During The COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nFact Check: Card Does NOT Exempt Anyone From Wearing A Mask In Public\n\nFact Check: Not Wearing Masks For Tuberculosis In The U.S. Does Not Mean Masks Are Not Needed For COVID-19\n\nFact Check: The CDC DOES Recommend That People Who Are Healthy Wear Facemasks", "lang": "en"}
