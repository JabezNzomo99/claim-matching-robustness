Now, a video has gone viral on social media showing a group of health workers walking out of a corridor and removing their surgical caps in joy.\n\nAt the end of the 46-second video, two of the health workers can be seen closing the door of the corridor, while the others clap. It is being claimed that this is the video of the corona ward being shut after the last patient recovered in New Zealand.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video is not from New Zealand but from a hospital in Italy\u2019s Matera city.\n\nAmong others, Facebook user \u201cHarsh Desai\u201d posted the video which has been shared over 3,000 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nA closer look at the video reveals a \u201cvisititaly\u201d logo on the top right corner of the video. Through this, we found a Facebook page named \u201cVisit Italy\u201d.\n\n\u201cVisit Italy\u201d had uploaded the same video on June 8 with the caption, \u201cMatera\u2019s hospital closes last coronavirus ward.\u201d Matera is a city in the region of Basilicata in southern Italy.\n\nUsing related keywords and reverse search, we found the same video on multiple Facebook pages. The Facebook page of an Italian news website \u201cTRM network\u201d had also posted the video and said the Covid-19 ward in Matera\u2019s \u201cMadonna delle Grazie\u201d hospital has been closed.\n\nItalian Newspaper \u201cLa Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno\u201d also published an article on the video showing this symbolic gesture by the medical staff after the corona ward in \u201cMadonna delle Grazie\u201d hospital was closed.\n\nFacebook page \u201cMateraNews\u201d also uploaded the video on June 5 with the same information.\n\nAll the above evidences prove that the video is from Italy and not New Zealand.\n\nOne of the worst affected countries due to coronavirus, Italy has been flattening the curve lately, and growth of cases has slowed down. According to \u201cWorldometer\u201d, Italy reported more than 2.36 lakh cases and over 34,000 deaths till June 13 evening.\n\nNew Zealand has declared itself coronavirus-free and it does not have a single active case as of now. The country reported a little over 1,500 cases and 22 deaths. All the lockdown restrictions have been lifted, except those related to border closure.", "lang": "en"}
