Football\u2019s governing body has strict rules\u2014at least in theory\u2014on players wearing what it considers to be political symbols.\n\nThe offending rule is to be found in FIFA\u2019s 100-page Equipment Regulations. They\u2019re detailed, covering almost every conceivable aspect of playing kit.\n\nRule 5.7, for instance, insists that \u201cthe Colour of any tape or similar material temporarily applied to a Playing Equipment item must be of the same group of a basic Colour as the predominant Colour of the same Playing Equipment item\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re no sports lawyers, but the translation seems to be that if you tape up yellow boots, the tape has to be some shade of yellow as well.\n\nRule 6.11 ensures that breathing holes in shirt numbers can\u2019t spell out a slogan or sponsor\u2019s logo.\n\nThe motivation may be to ensure a consistent commercial product. In 2004, FIFA hit Cameroon with a six-figure fine for wearing a one-piece kit instead of separate shorts and jerseys.\n\nSo it\u2019s not entirely surprising to see a rule on advertising. Rule 57.1 says that\n\nFor good measure, the same applies to \u201cDecorative Elements\u201d on kit.\n\nSome may wonder why this rules out poppy badges but not the poppy armbands that FIFA permitted Home Nations players to wear the last time this row broke out in November 2011.\n\nOn that occasion, public figures from the Sports Minister to Prince William argued that the poppy isn't political or religious.\n\nBut Dr James Fox, an art historian at the University of Cambridge, argues in a 2014 book that \u201cthe poppy has always been, and continues to be, a profoundly political symbol\".\n\nFIFA had held out against poppies on jerseys on the basis that \u201caccepting such initiatives would open the door to similar initiatives from all over the world, jeopardising the neutrality of football\u201d.\n\nA poppy embroidered on a black armband was the eventual compromise.\n\nThe Football Associations of England, Wales and Scotland are reportedly in talks with FIFA over poppies in the teams\u2019 World Cup qualifying games on 11 and 12 November.", "lang": "en"}
