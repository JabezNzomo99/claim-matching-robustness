Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Aaj Tak telecasted a news in which the Chinese PM said, \u2018Reading Quran and offering namaz is the only cure for COVID-19\u2019. Fact: It is a clipped video of Aaj Tak\u2019s fact-check. In the full version, it can be seen that Aaj Tak has debunked the claim and concluded that no such statement was made by the Chinese PM. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords shown in the video, the full version of the video was found on the \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019 website. In the video, it can be seen that they have fact-checked a video with the same claim. They have debunked the claim and concluded that no such statement was made by the Chinese PM. Also, Aaj Tak has published a fact-check article on the same claim. FACTLY has also debunked the same video in the first week of February. The fact-check article can be read here.\n\nAlso, in the posted video, the photograph of Xi Jinping (President of the People\u2019s Republic of China) was added. While the claim talks about the Prime Minister, the video shows the photo of the President.\n\nTo sum it up, Aaj Tak\u2019s fact-check video was clipped to falsely claim that Chinese PM said, \u2018Quran is the only cure for COVID-19\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
