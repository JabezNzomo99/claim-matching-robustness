But Forbes released no such report and a spokesman said they do not list the richest children of sitting presidents.\n\nThe incorrect posts, which have been shared at least 4,000 times between dozens of accounts on Facebook and Twitter, originated on some news websites in Nigeria. One story (archived here, here and here) claimed that Forbes \u201cis about to publish a list of the richest president\u2019s/despot\u2019s kids on the planet and Yusuf Buhari made it to number 4 with a net worth of $2.3bn US dollars\u201d.\n\nOther accounts, including this, this and this, claimed that Forbes already made \u201cthe list of the richest president's/despot's kids on the planet and Yusuf Buhari made it to number 4 with a net worth of $2.3bn US dollars\u201d.\n\nDaily Independent, a local newspaper, also reported the story, archived here.\n\nFestus Keyamo, spokesman for the Muhammadu Buhari re-election campaign, denied the claim, stating it was being promoted by the opposition.\n\nA spokesman for Forbes said they do not list the richest children of sitting presidents.\n\n\u201cForbes licensees have not published and have no plans to research such a list,\u201d Matthew Hutchison, senior vice-president of corporate communications told AFP.\n\nYusuf Buhari, and Muhammadu Buhari are not on any Forbes wealth list for 2019 or any other year in the magazine\u2019s history.\n\nAFP found no report stating that Yusuf Buhari\u2019s worth as $2.3 billion.\n\nAccording to Forbes African Billionaires List for 2019, there are only four rated dollar billionaires in Nigeria: Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man with $10.3bn; Mike Adenuga, telecoms and oil mogul in control of $9.2bn; Abdulsamad Rabiu, Dangote\u2019s prime cement competitor in Nigeria at $1.6bn; and Folorunsho Alakija, vice chair of Famfa Oil, estimated to be worth $1.1bn.\n\nBuhari declared his assets after taking office in 2015.\n\nThese included $150,000 in his personal account, five homes and two mud houses, as well as farms an orchard and a ranch with 270 head of cattle, 25 sheep, five horses and a variety of birds. He also stated that he had shares in three firms, two undeveloped plots of lands, and two cars bought from his savings.\n\nThe article also claims that Isabel dos Santos, daughter of Angolan President, was \u201cthe only other African to beat him to score 3rd on the list with a net worth of $10bn\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Isabel dos Santos, the oldest daughter of Angola's longtime former president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is rated by Forbes as the richest woman in Africa. Her wealth is, however, estimated to be 2.3 billion -- not $10bn as claimed by the viral post.\n\nThe post also claims that the daughter of former Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, is also on the list for her $6bn wealth or \u201cloot\u201d. We found no record of any of Chavez\u2019s children on the Forbes lists.\n\nAn article published by Forbes in 2011 says \u201cthe richest people in Africa could easily be former and current presidents and rulers of African countries,\u201d but they do not make it to Forbes list.\n\nAccording to Forbes, it \u201chas long separated rulers and dictators from our annual rankings of the World\u2019s Billionaires, distinguishing between personal, entrepreneurial wealth and wealth derived largely from positions of power, where lines often blur between what is owned by the country and what is owned by the individual\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
