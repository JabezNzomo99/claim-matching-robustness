I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can\u2019t get information off the classified system in the State Department to put on an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that. And when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain thought that this was classified and that was not the case.\u201d\n\nAs the saga has dragged on, Clinton\u2019s terminology has become ever more nuanced. When she first discussed her private-email arrangement in detail last March, her staff distributed a Q&A that flatly stated that no classified material was sent or received by Clinton at her private email address. Now she says the emails were not marked classified: \u201cWhen you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain thought that this was classified and that was not the case.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has both classified and unclassified systems \u2014 known informally as the \u201chigh side\u201d and the \u201clow side.\u201d The classified system has tight controls, often housed in what is known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF); it is not possible to \u201ccut and paste\u201d from the classified system into the unclassified system. Instead, one would have to extract the information from the classified system and then reenter it manually into the unclassified system. Thus far, no one has alleged that happened.\n\nThe various intelligence agencies since have been arguing about what should be disclosed, with at least seven email chains (22 separate emails) \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 labeled as unfit for any public disclosure. Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee who says he has reviewed the emails, told Fox News on Feb. 3 that the emails \u201cdo reveal classified methods, they do reveal classified sources, and they do reveal human assets.\u201d Other sources who have viewed the emails do not describe the emails as strongly, though one official said Clinton\u2019s aides might have put their security clearances at risk.\n\nDifferent government agencies often may disagree about the level of classification. One good example are the memoirs of former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and former vice president Richard B. Cheney. Both discussed a policy debate over North Korea. Cheney mentioned traces of enriched uranium on materials obtained from North Korea \u2014 which had been reported years earlier in The Washington Post \u2014 after receiving clearance to do so from the CIA. But to her frustration, Rice was not able to mention the uranium, though she wanted to, because the State Department refused to give her clearance \u2014 even though the information was already in the public domain.", "lang": "en"}
