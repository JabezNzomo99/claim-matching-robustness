The court said the petition be transformed into a representation and forwarded to the ministries.\n\nThe directive came in response to a plea seeking to amend the Constitution and replace the word India with \u2018Bharat\u2019 or \u2018Hindustan\u2019. The plea was filed by a Delhi-based businessman.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s argument was that the name \u2018India\u2019 had not been derived from within the country; it is a name of Greek origin born from the word \u2018Indica\u2019 and hence it symbolizes \u2018slave mentality\u2019.\n\nThe above information proves that the court did not order a change in India\u2019s name to Bharat from June 15. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
