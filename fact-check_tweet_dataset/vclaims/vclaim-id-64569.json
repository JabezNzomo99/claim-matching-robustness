The station was reporting on local groups marking international awareness days dedicated to the\n\nin Port Harcourt, the capital of\n\nin the south of the country.\n\nTo show the national burden of sickle cell disease, the news report\n\nAfrica Check has asked the station for its evidence for the claims and will update this report when we receive a response.\n\nOrganisations such as the country\u2019s\n\nare urging the government to reduce this statistic, TVC News\n\n. The foundation also called for affordable blood testing centres.\n\nThe \u201cburden of disease\u201d is a measure of how a disease or other health problem affects a population,\n\nor WHO. This can include death or the loss of health. It is useful for making policy.\n\nThe disease burden is comparable across regions because it considers several factors such as the number of deaths,\n\nand life expectancy. Prof Tanimola Akande, of the\n\nin western Nigeria, explained this to Africa Check.\n\nin the US, publishes data on the\n\n. To do this,\n\nwith the WHO.\n\nIts most recent data from 2017 shows Nigeria has t\n\npeople with sickle cell disease and those who die from its complications.\n\nWhat does this look like in numbers? A measure called the\n\n, or DALY, is used. This is\n\nadding the number of years a person loses by dying prematurely from a disease, and the years lost due to living with disabilities linked to the disease.\n\nOne DALY represents the loss of a full year lived healthily and it is expressed per 100,000 of a population.\n\nFor sickle cell disorders, Nigeria had an average of\n\ndisability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people, the highest globally. For deaths it had\n\nThe country\u2019s population size and the incidence of the sickle cell gene and the resulting sickle cell disease play a significant role in its burden, Collins Boakye-Agyemang from the WHO\u2019s communications team told Africa Check.\n\nHe directed us to\n\nis the most prevalent genetic disease in Africa, with between 10 and 40% of the population carrying the gene. An estimated 2% on the continent had the disease.\n\nwere \u201cchallenging because of the lack of federal newborn screening programmes\u201d, it was estimated that every year, at least 150,000 newborns in Nigeria had sickle-cell disease. There are about 7 million births in Nigeria annually.\n\nAlthough limited data was available, Boakye-Agyeman said one newborn screening programme in Africa showed that the prevalence of the disease in newborns was 3%.\n\nThe claim that Nigeria accounts for 50% of the global sickle cell burden is incorrect, Prof\n\ntold Africa Check. He is the director of the\n\na community of clinicians and scientists who study the disease globally\n\n, and the Alexandra Yeo Chair in Hematology at the\n\n\u201cNo, Nigeria bears 30% of the global sickle cell burden,\u201d said Odame.\n\nEven if only the number of newborns with sickle cell anaemia were considered, Nigeria still wouldn\u2019t have half the global burden.\n\non the global burden of sickle cell in children under age five\n\nin 2010, Nigeria, India, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo represented 57% of the annual number of newborns with sickle cell anaemia.\n\nAccording to the\n\npublished in 2013, these countries will account for 55% of the total by 2050, with Nigeria\u2019s share projected to increase from 30% to 35%.\n\nfrom the University of Toronto, Canada, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cNo, one in every three babies born with sickle cell in the world is a Nigerian,\u201d Odame said. He is also a physician in the division of haematology and oncology at the\n\n, the head of the WHO\u2019s\n\nfor East and Southern Africa, also said the claim is off the mark.\n\nBut the country still has a high number of deaths in children from the disease, Barango said.\n\nHe identified late diagnosis and immunisation gaps, for example against pneumonia and meningitis, as some reasons for this.\n\n\u201cThey are more prone to have adverse outcomes of not being immunised.\u201d\n\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang from the WHO also told Africa Check the claim is incorrect.\n\nIn Africa, deaths from complications of the disease occur mostly in children under five, adolescents and pregnant women, he said. Less than half of affected children reach their fifth birthday, with childhood mortality being between\n\nagainst the disease but many are struggling to follow through on it informing the persistently high burden on the continent, Boakye-Agyemang said.", "lang": "en"}
