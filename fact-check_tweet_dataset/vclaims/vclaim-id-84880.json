But it\u2019s questionable that she played a key leadership role to creating CHIP. While Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address, he later urged senators to kill a plan backed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) when it threatened budget negotiations with Republicans.\n\nAt the time, Hillary Clinton defended her husband\u2019s action: \u201dHe had to safeguard the overall budget proposal,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a luncheon. \u201dHe will look for ways to demand full coverage for minors\u2019 health.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Kennedy brought back a revised version of CHIP. An August 1997 New York Times article on final passage of the bill reported that \u201cparticipants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the First Lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support. But Mr. Clinton did not appear to move on the issue until a meeting at the White House on July 22 with an agitated Mr. Kennedy.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, Kennedy and Hatch were the movers of the program. Hillary Clinton was apparently an advocate for their effort behind-the-scenes, including ensuring the budget for the health plan was as large as possible. It\u2019s clear she played a role, but her actual impact on the legislation is disputed.\n\nIn a post on Medium published after our fact-check, Kennedy\u2019s former health care staff director David Nexon wrote that Hillary Clinton \u201cwas there when it counted.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
