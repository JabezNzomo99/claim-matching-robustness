The viral video is more than two years old and from Udaipur in Rajasthan.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video was viewed almost 73,000 times and the post retweeted more than 1,800 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nSome Facebook users have also shared the video with similar claims.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWith the help of related keywords, we found a YouTube video carrying a report by news channel \"India TV\" on the viral clip. As per the report, the slogans were made during a rally by some Muslim groups at Udaipur's Chetak Circle on December 12, 2017. The crowd had also chanted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena.\n\n\n\nAccording to Scroll the rally was taken out against the killing of Muslim labourer Mohammed Afrazul by a man named Shambu Lal Regar. The murder took place in Rajasthan's Rajsamand on December 6, 2017.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that a two-year-old video with communal slogans is being shared as a recent one. Also, the incident took place at Udaipur in Rajasthan and not Delhi as is being claimed.", "lang": "en"}
