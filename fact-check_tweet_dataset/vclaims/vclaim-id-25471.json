His essays and letters didn\u2019t yield any results either.\n\n\u201cThis quote is misattributed. I\u2019ve read every word Orwell wrote and never encountered it,\u201d Dorian Lynskey, author of \u201cThe Ministry of Truth: The Biography of George Orwell\u2019s 1984,\u201d told TheDCNF via email.\n\nOrwell Society committee member Leslie Hurst confirmed the misattribution as well, telling TheDCNF in an email, \u201cThe quotation, as you suspect, is not from George Orwell.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the first attribution of the saying to Orwell \u2013 sans the word \u201cuniversal\u201d \u2013 to a 1982 book called \u201cPartners in ecocide: Australia\u2019s complicity in the uranium cartel,\u201d published more than 30 years after his death. However, thematically similar quotations appeared earlier.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
