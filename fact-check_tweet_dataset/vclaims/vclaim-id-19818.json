The figures were based on 2012 data from the\n\nWe traced the 165,371 figure to the HPCSA\u2019s\n\nannual report, but it did not differentiate between the public and private healthcare sectors. The health council does not work out doctor to patient ratios, spokesperson Priscilla Sekhonyana told Africa Check.\n\nBoth Yawa and Sekhonyana referred us to the national health department.\n\nTo find the most recent estimates of doctor to patient ratios in the public sector, health department spokesperson\n\nPopo Maja suggested we look at the\n\nThis annual peer-reviewed journal analyses health systems in South Africa. It is published by the\n\n(HST), an organisation that focuses on the country\u2019s health policy and development. The latest edition was published in May 2017.\n\nIn data from government\u2019s personnel administration system (Persal), HST researchers found there were\n\nspecialists on the state\u2019s payroll at the end of March 2016.\n\nTo calculate the number of public health users, the organisation compared medical aid coverage in Statistics South Africa\u2019s\n\nThe medical aid coverage rate of 17.5% was calculated against the 2016\n\nof 55.9 million to get 9.78 million people on medical aid.\n\nThis meant the difference - an estimated 46.12 million people- relied on public health facilities.\n\nAlthough data from two different years was used, the share of the population covered by medical aid didn\u2019t change much, Candy Day, a technical specialist with HST, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe percentage medical scheme coverage varies a bit by year and between sources but has overall remained remarkably similar and stagnant over a long time at around 16%,\u201d said Day.\n\nUsing this coverage data, the HST then estimated that South Africa had a\n\nof 40.7 doctors \u2013 both general practitioners and specialists \u2013 per 100,000 people. This was one doctor for 2,457 people in the public healthcare sector,\n\nBut Day added that the estimate had not considered \u201cuse across sectors (that some insured people use public sector services and vice versa) as that introduces even more assumptions and uncertainties\u201d.\n\nWith data pointing to one state-employed doctor for every 2,457 people not covered by medical aid, we rate the claim of \u201cone doctor to over 4,000 patients\u201d in the public healthcare sector as incorrect.\n\ndid not estimate private sector ratios because there wasn\u2019t \u201creasonably accessible or available data\u201d, Day told Africa Check.\n\nMost doctors in private healthcare each have a\n\nthat allows them to claim from medical aid schemes, Dr Mzukisi Grootboom, the chair of the\n\nThe list of doctors with these identification numbers is administered by the\n\n\u201cSo you can find the private practitioners [on the list], but some colleagues do practise [both] in the private and public sector,\u201d Grootboom said.\n\nNot all doctors working in the private sector are registered on this system, Lamees Scholtz, the head of the practice code numbering system at the board, told Africa Check.\n\nThe organisation\u2019s head of research, Charlton Murove, said that in December 2017 they had \u201capproximately 13,000\u201d general practitioners and 8,000 specialists on their books.\n\nTo estimate the number of people on medical aid, the organisation rounded up the\n\n\u2019 2016/17 annual report to nine million people. This yielded a ratio of 429 people per doctor.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the same doctors (GPs and specialists) may be seeing cash-paying patients, which will therefore increase the ratio significantly,\u201d Murove told Africa Check. It is difficult to estimate how many of these patients are there, he said.\n\nPractice code numbers are not open to the public and the number of doctors and specialists was provided to us on request.\n\nThe most recent publicly available data can be found in the\n\nan estimated yearly average of 1.75 doctors per 1,000 patients in the private sector between 2010 and 2014.\n\nAfrica Check calculates this to be one doctor per 571 patients. We have asked the commission if they have more recent data and will update this report with their response.\n\nWith data from two sources pointing to one doctor for either 429 or 571 patients in private healthcare, we rate the claim of \u201cone doctor to less than 300 patients\u201d in the private healthcare sector as incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Claim misses the mark for both public and private healthcare\n\nThe Treatment Action Campaign claimed there was \u201cone doctor to over 4 000 patients\u201d in the public healthcare sector and \u201cone doctor to less than 300 patients\u201d in private care in South Africa.\n\nThis was to highlight a need to reform the system that allows foreign doctors to practise in the country.\n\nThe most recent data estimates one government-employed doctor for every 2,457 people not covered by medical aid. In private care, one medical aid-registered doctor sees between 429 and 571 people.\n\nWe therefore rate both claims as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
