The same clip is being shared with altered narratives, the first one claiming that \u201cRavan Rajya\u201d has arrived in Rajasthan and \u201cworse is yet to come for Hindus.\u201d\n\nA second narrative sarcastically professes that \u201cRam Rajya\u201d has arrived in the state. A video posted by individual user Ravi Gupta Hindu has over 11,000 views.\n\nThe video has also been circulated by a few in Kannada, with similar narrative propagating that riots broke out in Jodhpur after Congress\u2019 victory. A Twitter user Girish Bharadwaj whose bio reads \u2018Vishwa Hindu Parishad\u2019, also posted the video with the caption stating \u2013 \u201cvia WhatsApp\u201d.\n\nThe video is from Gujarat\n\nAlt News found that another Facebook user who shared the video added a few more lines to the narrative floating across social media platforms. \u201cSome friends said that this incident took place in Gujarat,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAlt News broke down the video into multiple frames using InVid software and reverse searched the images using the keyword \u2013 \u2018Gujarat\u2019. We were then directed to a YouTube video captioned in Gujarati, which said \u2013 \u201c\u0aae\u0acb\u0ab0\u0aac\u0ac0 \u0aa8\u0ac1\u0a82 \u0ab2\u0abe\u0a88\u0ab5 \u0aa4\u0acb\u0aab\u0abe\u0aa8 (Morbi riot live).\u201d\n\nOn looking for the same video with the keyword \u2013 \u2018Morbi, Gujarat\u2019 \u2013 we found a tweet by Gujarati magazine Chitralekha that said \u2013 \u201cA group clash took place last night in Morbi\u2019s Kalika plot due to an old animosity/rivalry. A 13-year-old boy was killed in the shootout, four others were injured (translated).\u201d Chitralekha also published a report on the same.\n\nWe found that a riot had indeed broken out in Morbi and three persons were booked for the murder of a teen on December 8.\n\nAnother clue that pointed to the origin of the video was the crowd shouting in Gujarati. If one listens closely, the crowd can be heard saying \u201c\u0a8f \u0a89\u0aad\u0abe \u0ab0\u0ab9\u0acb\u201d at 0:57 seconds. In Gujarati, the term means \u201chey, wait\u201d.\n\nAssembly elections recently concluded in five states, with the results giving birth to misinformation. Earlier, Alt News had debunked false claims suggesting that Rahul Gandhi took a U-turn on farm loan waivers after his party\u2019s victory. Another false claim suggested that Pakistani flags were waved at a Congress celebration rally in Rajasthan. This time, a video that had nothing to do with the election and is actually from a state where the ruling BJP government is still in power who shared to malign Congress. Alt News has observed that pre-election months are usually ripe with disinformation, however, fake news is also travelling across social media channels post-elections.", "lang": "en"}
