People on social media circulated the same claim and link, criticizing the alleged memo as yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s discriminatory tactics to oppress a population that\u2019s already at high risk of homelessness.\n\nThe LGBTQ Nation story alleges the federal memo \u201csays homeless shelters can use \u2018factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam\u2019s apple\u2019 to spot trans women\u201d during the intake process.\n\nYes, a proposal sponsored by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson does list those physical attributes verbatim (see below):\n\nNow, let\u2019s investigate why \u2014 was the language intended to help homeless shelters spot transgender people seeking services?\n\nFirst, to explore that question, we researched the circumstances under which the Trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document. We learned via a July 1, 2020, HUD press release Carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate, and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the claim\u2019s inspiration. The press release stated:\n\nSome context: Housing officials under former U.S. President Barack Obama originally established the Equal Access rule, which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the HUD\u2019s Office of Community Planning and Development to give Americans equal access to services, regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics.\n\nCarson\u2019s proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds, bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer-term stays. His measure would give those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services, no matter how people identify.\n\nNext, we obtained the memo to which the LGBTQ Nation headline and press release were referring: a 29-page document on HUD\u2019s official website titled \u201cMaking Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs.\u201d The docket was signed by Carson, a former neurosurgeon whom Trump appointed to lead HUD in 2016.\n\nThe document details the specifics of his proposal, as well as his rationale for introducing it, amid a series of unrelated initiatives by the Trump administration to weaken federal protections for transgender Americans. \n\n\n\nThe in-question measure, on which HUD was currently soliciting public feedback and so far not finalized as of this writing, would change existing guidelines that, the document alleged, Obama\u2019s administration enacted in violation of administrative law and \u201cminimized local control, burdened religious organizations, manifested privacy issues, and imposed regulatory burdens.\u201d The proposal reads:\n\nAt one point, the document implied that the existing Equal Access rule \u2014 requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing, regardless of incoming residents\u2019 gender identities \u2014 posed a danger to shelter residents; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic claim that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women. However, the document did not explain how or under what circumstances HUD came to that assumption, nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening, aside from a pending lawsuit in Fresno, California, that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior. The HUD proposal stated:\n\nPending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal, the document stated, staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds. In those cases, if intake workers had \u201cgood faith\u201d to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex \u2014 which is literally the definition of being transgender \u2014 and that birth sex was not served by the shelter, the staff could turn them away. It was at that point in the docket HUD wrote:\n\nIn sum, it is accurate to state that under the leadership of Trump, HUD issued a memo in July 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender, and given the language \u2014 it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them, presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female-only shelters \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
