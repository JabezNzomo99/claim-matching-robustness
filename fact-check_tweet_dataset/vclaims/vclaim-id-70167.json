The windows are plastered with what appear to be stickers, including one with an image of CNN commentator Van Jones with the words \"dishonest media\" and \"CNN sucks.\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The van isn\u2019t fake, but the suggestion that it\u2019s a plant to support false flag theories is wrong.\n\nAccording to the federal criminal complaint filed against Sayoc, he was \"arrested on or about Oct. 26, 2018, in Florida, in the vicinity of his white van. The windows of Sayoc\u2019s van were covered with images including images critical of CNN.\"\n\nSayoc was apparently living in the van in Aventura, Fla., The New York Times reported on Oct. 26. Some of the town\u2019s residents reported regularly seeing such a van with windows plastered \"with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers,\" according to the paper.\n\n\"It struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\" the Times quoted former Aventura resident David Cypkin as saying. \"It was unsettling.\"\n\nOther media outlets, including the Washington Post and the Miami Herald, have also reported on the van, posting photos of the vehicle and talking to Floridians who recall seeing the van before the pipe bombs were mailed.\n\nWe rate this statement as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
