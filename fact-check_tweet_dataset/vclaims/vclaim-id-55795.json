Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool, Claim Check, also flagged at least 6 posts containing the graphic as of writing. The earliest was posted on March 26, but it is still being shared as of writing.\n\nThe facts: As of April 13, the World Health Organization (WHO) still says that COVID-19 is not airborne and is mainly transmitted through droplets or little bits of liquid. There are studies that suggest airborne transmission is possible, but none of them are conclusive. The Department of Health (DOH) also earlier said that airborne transmission only applies to a \u201chospital setting.\u201d\n\nAirborne is different from droplet transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO both said that in airborne transmission, the pathogens carrying the disease can remain in the air for long periods of time and can be transmitted to greater distances. Examples are tuberculosis, measles, and chickenpox.\n\nMeanwhile, in droplet transmission, the particles do not have the capacity to stay in the air for long. \u201cThe virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces,\u201d WHO said in its Frequently Asked Questions page.\n\nThe CNBC article included in the graphic also did not say that COVID-19 is airborne. Rather, it said that there is a new study suggesting that the coronavirus can survive in the air in some settings and that WHO is considering \u201cairborne precautions\u201d for medical staff. The article maintained that the virus is mainly passed on through droplets, citing WHO.\n\n\u201cWhen you do an aerosol-generating procedure like in a medical care facility, you have the possibility to what we call aerosolize these particles, which means they can stay in the air a little bit longer,\u201d CNBC quoted Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, as saying. Aerosols are tiny particles in the air such as dust, mists, or fumes.\n\nWHO explained that airborne transmission may be possible in hospital settings because this is where procedures that generate aerosols are conducted \u2013 such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc. Still, WHO says more study is needed to confirm if COVID-19 is airborne.\n\nBoth WHO and the DOH say wearing masks alone is not enough protection against the coronavirus. \u201cIn all settings, masks should be used in combination with frequent hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rubs or soap/water,\u201d the DOH said.\n\nIn late January, WHO said the use of masks in public places is not required because there is no sufficient evidence that it can help prevent infection. But it shifted its position, saying on April 3 that the use of cloth masks at the community-level may help reduce the spread of the disease. Both WHO and DOH said health workers should be given priority access to medical masks.", "lang": "en"}
