While the party name included the word \u201csocialist,\u201d most of its political ideologies were not considered left-wing. Yad Vashem\u2019s website states that Nazism in fact grew out of radical right-wing groups. Once the Nazis gained power in Germany, they arrested and in many cases murdered socialists, communists and others who opposed the party.\n\nBolsonaro sparked further controversy later in April when he said, \u201cWe can forgive. But we cannot forget,\u201d speaking of the Holocaust at a meeting with evangelical pastors in Rio de Janeiro on April 11.\n\nYad Vashem\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, appeared to respond to the comments on Twitter writing, \u201cWe will never forgive and never forget.\u201d He went on to address political leaders\u2019 responsibility in shaping public opinion, in what seemed to be a targeted response to Bolsonaro.\n\nHistorians widely rebuff the notion that Nazism is a leftist movement. Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies at Emory College, called it a \u201cludicrous idea that deserves to be discredited.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro is not the first person to make this claim. Linking Nazism to a political side is a long-running trope. This iteration, where the Nazis are leftist, has spread widely online for almost a decade.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a tactic used by conservatives. Democrats have also called their rivals \u201cNazis,\u201d distorting history in their own way.\n\n\u201cEverybody uses the slur fascism and socialism and Hitler as a method of tarring one\u2019s opponents,\u201d said Gavriel Rosenfeld, a professor of history at Fairfield University. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you\u2019re discrediting your opponents, you\u2019re also trying to separate your own movement from any kind of connection to Nazism.\u201d\n\nMisrepresenting history can set a dangerous precedent. Bolsonaro\u2019s rewriting of Nazism\u2019s past may have been meant as a nod to his base, but it has far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe video above breaks down how this false theory has spread online and explores the potential implications of Bolsonaro repeating the claim.
