A spokesperson told Edinburgh Live: \u201cWe categorically deny that these were created on our behalf and we denounce such hate speech.\u201d They suggested the stickers may have been posted by someone trying to discredit the movement.\n\nThey also denied any links to \u201cantifa\u201d groups (generally loose collectives focused on opposing far right-wing movements through direct action, including violence) as suggested in the stickers and posters. The Scottish Sun reported that local antifa-affiliated groups have also denied any link with the stickers.\n\nFull Fact has also reached out to Black Lives Matter Scotland for comment.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about how Extinction Rebellion had their design used by a group accused of sharing materials that promote white supremacy. It is worth remembering that almost anybody can make a sticker that looks like an official one, whether they may support or oppose the goals of the group in question. It\u2019s relatively easy for people to mimic well-known logos and fonts.", "lang": "en"}
