It was passed by Congress on June 4, 1919, and ratified on Aug. 18, 1920. The president at the time was Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, and the Web site of the Democratic Party uses that hook to also lay claim to the trophy: \u201cUnder the leadership of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. Constitution was amended to grant women the right to vote.\u201d\n\nStill, the GOP, which was responsible for the emancipation of slaves and dominated the presidency in the late 19th century, made a nod to the rights of women in its 1872 party platform: \u201cThe Republican party is mindful of its obligations to the loyal women of America for their noble devotion to the cause of freedom. Their admission to wider fields of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction, and the honest demand of any class of citizens for additional rights should be treated with respectful consideration.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the words that would later become the 19th Amendment were first introduced in the Senate by a California Republican, Aaron A. Sargent, in 1878. But it was buried in committee for years and when it finally emerged for a vote, it was defeated 16 to 34 in 1887. Another vote in the Senate did not take place until 1914, even though supporters repeatedly introduced it in Congress.\n\n\u201cSome Republicans were friends of woman suffrage and did introduce their bills and speak on their behalf,\u201d said Alana Jeydel, a political science professor at American River College who exhaustively studied the debates in her 2004 book, \u201cPolitical Women: The Women\u2019s Movement, Political Institutions, the Battle for Women\u2019s Suffrage and the ERA.\u201d \u201cBut my research indicates that support was largely symbolic and the Republicans really tried to keep the woman suffragists at arm\u2019s length while getting the 15th passed and ratified. And then after it is ratified the support (like the statement in the platform of 1872) was pretty symbolic. There was no serious attempt on the part of the Republican party to get a woman suffrage amendment passed.\u201d\n\nStill, at the same time, there was even less support in the Democratic Party, then a bastion of Southern racists who already were actively thwarting the voting rights of black men just added to the constitution and thus had little incentive to let black women also win voting rights. The Democratic Party at the time also was considered the party of states\u2019 rights.\n\nThe progressive wing of the GOP increasingly became pro-suffrage. When ex-president Theodore Roosevelt broke off from the GOP and created the Progressive Party, the party platform fully endorsed the idea: \u201cThe Progressive party, believing that no people can justly claim to be a true democracy which denies political rights on account of sex, pledges itself to the task of securing equal suffrage to men and women alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican party, reaffirming its faith in government of the people, by the people, for the people, as a measure of justice to one-half the adult people of this country, favors the extension of the suffrage to women, but recognizes the right of each state to settle this question for itself,\u201d said the GOP platform. The Democratic version was: \u201cWe recommend the extension of the franchise to the women of the country by the States upon the same terms as to men.\u201d\n\n\u201cWilson very reluctantly comes around to support suffrage,\u201d Jeydel said. \u201cBut he truly just doesn\u2019t care about suffrage.\u201d She said that militant wing of the movement embarrassed him with marches, violent protests and hunger strikes in prison, at a time when he wanted to concentrate on the conclusion of World War I. Here\u2019s a video of pickets outside the White House:\n\nSo Wilson, who previously had said that voting rights were a state issue that did not require the attention of the federal government, decided to call for passage of an amendment in a speech on Sept. 30, 1918. Sending the measure to the states for ratification, he reasoned, was in keeping with Democratic Party beliefs in states\u2019 rights.\n\nBut the measure fell two votes short in the Senate despite his plea. Meanwhile, the National American Woman Suffrage Association, in an effort to appear nonpartisan, targeted one Democratic senator and one Republican senator for defeat \u2014 and was successful in 1918. Further Democratic losses in the midterm elections shifted the balance of power, with the GOP winning narrow control of both the Senate and the House.\n\n\u201cI would never call Wilson a convert. I would call him a pragmatist,\u201d Jeydel said. \u201cYes, many Democrats voted for it, they could do so and look like they were supporting the war effort (and voting for it only meant it was going to the states). But overall, the progressives within the Republican Party were always the most supportive.\u201d\n\nBroadly speaking, Fiorina gets her history right. The Republican Party was generally more supportive of suffrage, despite mainly paying it lip service, while Democrats, especially in the South, were hostile. Yes, a Democrat was president when the amendment passed, but he was boxed in on the issue \u2014 and the amendment only passed once Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. Calling the GOP \u201cthe party of women\u2019s suffrage\u201d might stretch the history a tad, but not enough for a full Pinocchio.", "lang": "en"}
