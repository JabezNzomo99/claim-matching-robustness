Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image posted.\n\nClaim: Rahul Gandhi was seen eating with Imran Khan on the same dining table. Fact: It is a photoshopped image.

This photo is edited to misguide people.\n\nWhen googled for Rahul\u2019s photo that has been cropped and put alongside Imran Khan, it was found in \u201cThe Hindu\u201d article. The photo was taken when Rahul Gandhi was having his food along with Karnataka\u2019s the then CM Siddaramaiah at Indira Canteen in Jayanagar, Bengaluru in the year 2017.\n\nEarlier, a similar claim of Modi eating with Imran Khan on the same dining table was shared on Facebook. Factly has debunked it and the article can be found here.\n\nTo sum it up, Rahul Gandhi was not having lunch with Imran Khan. It\u2019s a photoshopped image.", "lang": "en"}
