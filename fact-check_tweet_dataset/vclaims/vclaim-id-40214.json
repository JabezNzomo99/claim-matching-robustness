Many people in the comment section have linked it to the ongoing protests by JNU students over hostel fees hike.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photograph is almost three years old. It was clicked in Delhi when some students' organisations were protesting outside the RSS headquarters against the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a PhD scholar at University of Hyderabad.\n\nThe post by Facebook user \"CA Bipin Singh\" has been shared more than 200 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. The photo is viral on Facebook with similar claims.\n\nTo verify the claim along with the viral photo, AFWA ran a reverse search and found a news article published by Catch News in February 2017.\n\nAccording to the report, a group of students was protesting outside the RSS headquarters in Delhi against the death of Rohith Vemula, who committed suicide on January 17, 2016.\n\nWe also found other media reports with the viral photo narrating the same story.\n\nMany unrelated images have been going viral on social media linking them to the ongoing agitation by JNU students. \"AajTak\" has debunked some of them.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral photo is almost three years old and has no relation with the ongoing protests by JNU students against hostel fees hike.", "lang": "en"}
