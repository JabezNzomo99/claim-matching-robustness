She also said that by inhaling the aroma of camphor at home, we can help reduce pollution in our homes.\n\nUse more and more camphor (kapur) at home... lighting a wee bit of camphor and inhaling its lingering aroma helps. You may make a beads (mala) of camphor with cotton and wear it around your neck to counter #AirPollution it helps a lot. \u2014 Sadhavi Khosla\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00ae\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00b3 (@sadhavi) November 3, 2019\n\nTo verify this claim, FIT spoke to Dr. Arvind Kumar, lung surgeon and founder of Lung Care Foundation and here's what he had to say.\n\nWe also reached out to Dr. Kalyan Banerjee, a homeopathic doctor who has won a Padma Shri for his contribution to medicine. He said that while natural camphor has benefits, its more commonly found synthetic counterparts harm us.\n\nCamphor is used in many Indian households, especially while offering prayers to the Gods. However, owing to its religious significance, its side effects are often overlooked. In fact, as is seen from the tweet above, its benefits are sometimes even exaggerated. However, as a scientist, Dr. Arvind Kumar says he just cannot subscribe to this theory.\n\nIn an earlier video interview to Fit, Dr. Kumar had said that by stopping any source of smoke, we can reduce the level of indoor pollution in our homes.", "lang": "en"}
