Indeed, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account issued a tweet at the very same time shown on the screenshot (6:31 PM Eastern Standard Time on 22 February 2016), but it had nothing to do with Canadians and made no mention of \u201csnow Mexicans\u201d:\n\nIt is fairly obvious the \u201csnow Mexicans\u201d comment was not an authentic Trump tweet, but rather an altered version of a tweet that referenced sending \u201cillegals\u201d out of the U.S. And given the news media\u2019s intense coverage of Trump\u2019s sometimes incendiary remarks (on Twitter and elsewhere), it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely the GOP candidate could have issued such a comment without its having generated widespread media interest.", "lang": "en"}
