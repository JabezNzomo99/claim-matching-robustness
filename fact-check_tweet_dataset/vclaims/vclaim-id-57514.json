It says:\n\n\u201cSpeed of light: 299,792,458 m/s. Coordinates of the Great Pyramid of Giza: 29.9792458\u00b0N. Coincidence?\u201d\n\nThis figure for the speed of light (in a vacuum) is correct. And, as the post implies, it is not necessarily a coincidence that it matches the latitude of the Great Pyramid. This is not because the ancient Egyptians somehow shared our modern understanding of metres, light and latitude, but because it takes some deliberate work to make the numbers fit.\n\nIn fact, the post only gives one coordinate, not the two we would need for a precise location. This means we have to look along the line of latitude at 29.9792458\u00b0N, which does pass through the Great Pyramid, but also through many other places around the world.\n\nGiven that we\u2019re looking at such precise coordinates, other lines also pass through the pyramid. This particular line passes slightly to the north of the pyramid\u2019s peak. When the fact checking site Snopes looked into this, they found that the line at 29.9791750\u00b0N would be closer to the apex, but of course that would not match the speed of light so neatly. The numbers in this claim are expressed to seven decimal places, which would allow you to draw about 20,000 lines with different numbers, between roughly 29.9802000\u00b0N and 29.9782000, all passing through the pyramid.", "lang": "en"}
