No, that's not true: an old video on YouTube making that claim in the description seems to have been embedded in an article that originated on a satire website. The video itself is possibly from Vietnam. Eating dog meat is illegal in New York (or anywhere else in the United States) under the Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act of 2018.\n\nThe video from 2015 (archived here and here) recently went viral again under the title \"NEW YORK CHINESE RESTAURANTS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO SELL DOG MEAT!\" and with a description that read:\n\nThis is the video in question (viewer discretion advised):\n\nThe background sounds of the video don't really sound like New York and a close-up of a newspaper in one of the shots also suggests the footage was not shot in New York:\n\nThe word \"h\u00f4i\" is not English but according to Google Translate it means \"foul\", \"smelly\" or \"tainted\" in Vietnamese. And in 2013 the exact same video (archived here) was already uploaded to YouTube with a title that read: \"K\u00f6pek Yiyen Vietnaml\u0131lar\" which Google translates from Turkish to English as \"Vietnamese eating dog\".\n\nThe link in the video description goes to http://dopevidz.com/new-york-chinese-restaurants-are-now-allowed-to-sell-dog-meat/, which is no longer online but a version from 2015 can still be found in the Internet Archive:\n\nSnopes already discovered earlier versions of this article in 2014 which originated on two known fake/satire websites:\n\nWe did not find any trace of the Supreme Court case mentioned in the story so the whole thing is likely made up.\n\nIn any case there is no reason to worry about dogs being eaten in New York (or anywhere else in the United States) because in 2018 President Donald Trump signed a farm bill that makes it illegal to eat dogs (or cats):\n\nThe full text of the bill can be read here:", "lang": "en"}
