As this photo spread across the internet, its context appeared to have been lost. Some users shared the image thinking it applied only to certain states. Others took it to mean that this was a nationwide legal change. Most commenters appeared to have assumed the claim referred to all potential users of cannabis.\n\nIn reality, the claim that THC will be removed from drug-test screenings starting Aug. 30 (2019) applied only to people who are residents of Oklahoma and who have valid medical-marijuana licenses (note the Oklahoma City-based KOCO 5 television station logo appearing in the above screenshot). The law in question \u2014 Senate Bill 2612 \u2014 was introduced in the Oklahoma legislature on Feb. 4, and was signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt on March 14.\n\nA lengthy compromise bill about the future of medical marijuana in that state, the law does stipulate that \u201cno employer may refuse to hire, discipline, discharge or otherwise penalize an applicant or employee solely on the basis of a positive test for marijuana components or metabolites\u201d unless:\n\u2022 the applicant or employee is not in possession of a valid medical-marijuana license;\n\u2022 the licensee possesses, consumes or is under the influence of medical marijuana or medical marijuana product while at the place of employment or during the fulfillment of employment obligations, or\n\u2022 the position is one involving safety-sensitive job duties.\n\nAccording to The Oklahoman, the law actually took effect on Aug. 29, 2019. Because the law applies only to a very narrow subset of the American population despite being shared across the country without these caveats, we rank the claim \u201cMostly false.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
