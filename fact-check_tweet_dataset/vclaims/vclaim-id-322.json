We still need to do the kinds of studies that definitely prove whether any intervention, not just this one, any intervention is truly safe and effective.\u201d\n\nThe study Fauci referred to in the above quote was an online survey of doctors conducted by Sermo (www.sermo.com/about/), with the results released on April 2, 2020 ( here ).\n\nAccording to Sermo, 37% of COVID-19 treaters surveyed chose hydroxychloroquine from a list of 15 drug options as the \u201cmost effective\u201d therapy against COVID-19. However, the respondents were not asked whether it \u201ccures all CV-19\u201d patients.\n\nThe second statement in the social media post reads: \u201cAs soon as the CV-19 vaccine is manufactured it must be immediately delivered to health care professionals world wide for immediate human injection. Proper studies can be performed later.\u201d\n\nWhile vaccine efforts are being fast-tracked, it is untrue that Fauci or the NIH said that a vaccine should be distributed and administered without proper testing.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate on May 12, Fauci mentioned \u201ceight candidate COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development,\u201d highlighting the NIH\u2019s collaboration with the biotech company Moderna in particular. A video and transcript of his full testimony can be found here , with his remarks on vaccine development starting at 28:10. Fauci says that Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate \u201cwould take about one year to 18 months if we were successful in developing a vaccine,\u201d and that \u201cwe are now in Phase I clinical trial with the two doses already fully enrolled. [\u2026] The Phase I will directly go into Phase II-III in late spring and early summer. If we are successful, we hope to know that in the late fall and early winter.\u201d\n\nAccording to Healthline\u2019s explanation of clinical trial phases ( here ), Phase I of a clinical trial investigates for several months the effects of the treatment on \u201cabout 20 to 80 people who have no underlying health conditions.\u201d Phase II \u201cinvolves several hundred participants who are living with the condition that the new medication is meant to treat,\u201d and Phase III \u201cusually involves up to 3,000 participants who have the condition that the new medication is meant to treat.\u201d\n\nIt is true that traditional rules and timelines in vaccine production have changed amidst the global pandemic in 2020. A Reuters special report ( here ) found that: \u201cHistorically, just 6% of vaccine candidates end up making it to market, often after a years-long process that doesn\u2019t draw big investments until testing shows a product is likely to work\u201d.\n\nIn his May 12 testimony, Fauci mentioned \u201cthe NIH has launched a public-private partnership called Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV). The purpose of that is to prioritize and accelerate clinical evaluation of therapeutic candidates with near-term potential.\u201d ( visible at 29:39 here ) ACTIV aims to \u201cdevelop a collaborative framework for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates, streamlining clinical trials, coordinating regulatory processes and/or leveraging assets among all partners to rapidly respond to the COVID-19 and future pandemics\u201d and \u201cto identify, prioritize and facilitate the entry of some of the most promising candidates into clinical trials.\u201d ( here ). While the efforts aim to speed up research collaboration and the process of getting a vaccine ready for market, these guidelines do not appear to side-step safety and testing prior to a vaccine approval.\n\nMore of Reuters recent coverage on the development of vaccines to treat COVID-19 can be found here ,\n\nhere , and here .\n\nPartly false. Fauci did say that further studies on the benefits of hydroxychloroquine were required. Fauci did not say that a COVID-19 vaccine should be injected as soon as it is manufactured. While a vaccine acceleration framework is in place, it still features phased clinical trials.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
