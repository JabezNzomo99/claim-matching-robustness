The claim is false; the photo actually shows a 14-year-old girl at an event hosted by India\u2019s Buldhana Police in Maharashtra state to mark International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on September 1, 2020.\n\nIt shows a young woman in a white hijab at a desk, alongside several uniformed officers standing in front of a blue board that reads Maharashtra Police in Hindi.\n\nThe Hindi text overlay translates to English as: \u201cWhat allows someone to ignore the dress code and sit in a police station in a Burqa?\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi caption translates to English as: \u201cThe first Muslim SP who cleared the IPS exam in Urdu.
