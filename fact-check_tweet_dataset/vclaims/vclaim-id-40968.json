The post also claims that he was beaten up by the police for misbehaving with a nurse in Ghaziabad.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the picture and found that it is old.\n\nOn putting the image through Reverse Image Search, we found that the same picture was shared by people back in 2019.\n\nThe same picture was earlier circulated with a claim that he was beaten by Bengal police for flouting lockdown. Rubbishing the claim, Bengal police had then urged people to not share this picture with false narratives.\n\nNewsMobile independently couldn\u2019t verify the origin of the picture but it is clear that the picture was in circulation way before the lockdown was even announced. Hence, it is clear that the claim attached to the picture is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
