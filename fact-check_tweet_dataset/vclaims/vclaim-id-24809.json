This comes ahead of a Turkish military incursion into Syria against those it considers terrorist threats. Among those perceived threats are Kurdish fighters, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been allied with the United States in fighting the Islamic State, or ISIS. (USA Today)\n\n@PaulLidicul responded to a number of comments on Twitter pointing out that the video was fake, arguing that \u201cwhether that banner was physically or digitally put there is irrelevant \u2014 the statement is MADE, the public outrage is REAL and the message is spread.\u201d\n\n@Paullidicul, who previously went by the handle @PaulLeeTicks, created a similar digitally altered video in June 2019 that supposedly showed a banner reading \u201cConcentration Camps\u201d hanging from Trump Tower:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision not to help the United States\u2019 Turkish allies was widely criticized by both Republicans and Democrats, including some of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), for example, said that the \u201cmove ensure(d) the reemergence of ISIS\u201d and urged President Trump to \u201cchange course while there is still time.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) asserted that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria is having sickening and predictable consequences\u201d and vowed that lawmakers \u201cmust and will act to limit the catastrophic impact of this decision.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
