No, that's not true: A meme listing 40 Jewish members of the 112th congress (in 2011) falsely claims that each one has dual U.S. and Israel citizenship and therefore holds \"dual loyalty\" between the two nations. None of the senators and representatives named were born in Israel and one only was born outside of the United States -- Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat born in New Delhi, India. None of these politicians carry Israeli passports.\n\nWhile the false claim has circulated since 2011, it was being shared again in 2019 by followers of Q, the purported intelligence source who is leaking messages from the inside about President Trump's war against the \"Deep State.\" This post (archived here) was shared on October 29, 2019 listing the 40 Jewish members of congress with the message:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThis is the text in the meme:\n\nThe list of Jews in congress originated in a January 2011 article by JewishCurrents.org titled \"Jews in the 112th Congress\" The website said the list was \"based on research by Alyssa Goldstein, our magazine's intern at Bard College.\" The list with the same names in the same order was then published as a graphic in a September 23, 2018 article on Conservative-Headlines.org titled \"Senators and Congressmen Who Hold Dual Citizenship with Israel\" which suggested that all of the Jewish members of congress were \"real traitors\":\n\nThe 2018 article neglects to acknowledge that several of those listed had been out of congress for several years, and one -- Sen. Frank Lautenberg -- had died five years earlier.\n\nThe claim that these Jewish politicians were inherently disloyal to the United States because they were Jewish was boosted in 2018 when \"Q\" posted a \"Q drop 916\", which read \"We are saving Israel for last.\" It was interpreted by Q followers as a message that Israelis would be dealt with last by President Trump in his battle to destroy the \"Deep State.\"\n\nSome Q followers put the list of Jewish members of congress together with that message to suggest a day of reckoning was coming in which those Jews would find no refuge.\n\nThe claim has major flaws -- not the least of which it predicts that President Trump will round up all Jewish politicians for treason. None of those politicians were born in Israel or have otherwise applied for Israel citizenship. If they are not born there, they would have to apply.\n\nThere are two notable examples of U.S. senators who had dual citizenship and renounced their second one in recent years. Both were Republican candidates for president in 2016. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was born in Canada and was legally a Canadian citizen until he renounced it in 2016. Senator Michele Bachman became a citizen of Switzerland automatically when her husband, who has applied for and was granted Swiss citizenship, registered their marriage with the Swiss government in 2012. Bachman formally renounced it several days after it was made public in 2012.", "lang": "en"}
