As \u201cproof,\u201d she cited an item published on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow\u2019s website, which gave the route of the march as well as its beginning and end times.\n\n\u200bIn fact, the embassy bulletin was a warning to U.S. citizens to avoid that area of Moscow during the march. After giving the basic details of the event, it stated:\n\n\u201cThe protest rally has not been sanctioned by authorities.Given the possible size of the protest and the large police presence, U.S. citizens should avoid the protest route.\u201d\n\nLater, Zakharova acknowledged that the statement told U.S. citizens to avoid the march, but, overall, her comments clearly implied that the warning was simply a cover, whose real purpose was to incite Muscovites to attend the protest in favor of fair municipal elections. In any case, there was nothing unusual about the embassy\u2019s warning to U.S. citizens in the Russian capital.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Embassy in Paris issued three \u201cdemonstration warnings\u201d in the spring of 2019. One such warning from April 30 read:\n\n\u201cMay Day demonstration will take place on May 1, 2019 in Paris and other major cities in France. The \u2018Gilets Jaunes\u2019 (Yellow Vests) are expected to join labor union marches across the country. Previous \u2018Yellow Vest\u2019 demonstrations have become violent with smaller groups splitting from the main demonstration and causing serious damage to private and public property. Police response has included water cannons, rubber bullets, and/or tear gas. Demonstrations may cause traffic disruptions and impact public transportation throughout France, including significant delays traveling between downtown Paris and the major airports (Charles de Gaulle Roissy and Orly) and access to rail stations. Disruptions to public services and closures of various sites usually open to the public (businesses, museums, tourist attractions) have taken place.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s April 2019 travel advisory for France puts it at Level 2 -- meaning \u201cExercise Increased Caution\u201d \u2013 due to \u201cterrorism and civil unrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemonstrations in Paris and other major cities continue in France and are expected to continue in the coming weeks,\u201d the travel advisory stated.\n\n\u201cProperty damage, including looting and arson, in populated tourist areas has occurred with reckless disregard for public safety. Police have responded with water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas. The U.S. Embassy is advising official U.S. government travelers to avoid travel to Paris and other major cities in France on the weekends.\u201d\n\nLike the Moscow warning this week, the U.S. State Department, in issuing these warning to U.S. citizens in the French capital during the Yellow Vests protests, was advising them to avoid the scene.\n\nUpdate: On Friday, August 9, the Russian Foreign Ministry protested the routine warning by the U.S. Embassy for U.S. citizens, that was the subject of this fact check.\n\nThe U.S. State Department dismissed the Russian objection, in a statement on background, emphasizing that the notice was a \"Safety Alert,\" not meant to interfere with Russian internal affairs.\n\n\"Absolutely not. Our Embassies and Consulates overseas routinely release Alerts as needed to notify U.S. citizens of specific events and changes happening locally,\" the statement said.\n\nWhen the U.S. Embassy in Paris warned of protests in March, the announcement included specific locations where protesters were gathering and the routes they would take.", "lang": "en"}
