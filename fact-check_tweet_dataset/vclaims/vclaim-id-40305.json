The post also has an accompanying message in Hindi whose English translation is- \u2018This poor kid is suffering from cancer. Please provide financial assistance. May God shall not give this agony to your kids.1 Like- Re.1; 1 Comment- Rs 10; 1 Share- Rs 100\u2019. Let\u2019s try to check the claim made in the post.\n\nThe post first appeared on Facebook, on November 16, 2019, seeking financial assistance for a boy (in the image) purportedly suffering from cancer.\n\nWhen the image in the post is cropped and subjected to Google Reverse Image search technique, a link of a news website \u2018Janjwar\u2019 was obtained in the search results. From the article, it was found that the child in the image is Aryan Kumar and he died in August 2018 after a doctor in a clinic at Siwan (Bihar) administered a wrong injection to him when he was brought for the treatment of his illness.\n\nThe information in another news report with the same image also corroborates that the child had died in August 2018. In both the articles, it wasn\u2019t mentioned if the boy suffered from cancer or not. FACTLY also couldn\u2019t independently verify if the boy was suffering from cancer before his death, but it could be ascertained that the boy isn\u2019t alive now and had died in August 2018.\n\n\n\nAlso, when we tried to find out if Facebook gives money for the treatment of sick children when posts with their photos are liked or shared, answers by the Facebook team in the \u2018Help section\u2019 of the platform were found. In these responses, the company has clarified that it doesn\u2019t provide any such thing and these responses can be seen here and here.\n\nTo conclude, the child in the image had died in August 2018 after a doctor administered a wrong injection to him. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
