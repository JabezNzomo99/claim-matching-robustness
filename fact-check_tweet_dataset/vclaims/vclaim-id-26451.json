{"title": "These figures on MP expenses are incorrect", "subtitle": "A post falsely claimed that Scottish Conservative MPs spent far more on travel and accommodation expenses than SNP MPs. Average expenses per MP were lower for Scottish Conservative MPs than SNP ones.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26451", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/snp-conservative-mp-expenses/", "vclaim": "These figures on MP expenses are incorrect\n\nA Facebook post comparing the cost of travel and accommodation expenses between Scottish Conservative and SNP MPs has been shared widely on Facebook. It is a screenshot of a tweet originally published in July 2018 and is similar to a tweet published later that same day by the Campbeltown and Kintyre SNP branch.\n\nGiven the numbers of MPs in the claim and the date of the tweet, the year being referred to is presumably 2017/18. Looking at the parliamentary expenses figures for that year, the amounts quoted in the tweet are wildly inaccurate.\n\nMost MPs can claim expenses for rent on a second residence or hotel costs in London if their constituency is outside London. They may also claim for travel costs, either their own or others\u2019, \u201cwhich are in support of the MP\u2019s parliamentary functions\u201d. For example, MPs whose constituencies are outside London are allowed to claim for the cost of travelling between their constituency and Westminster.\n\nIn 2017/18 the total travel and accommodation costs for the 35 SNP MPs came to \u00a31.3 million, or \u00a337,000 on average per MP.\n\nIn the same year the total travel and accommodation costs for the 13 Conservative MPs from Scotland came to around \u00a3389,000, or just under \u00a330,000 on average per MP.\n\nWe cannot see any reasonable way in which the tweet could have come up with its figures.\n\nEven just accounting for the expenses an MP claims in rent (so not including any additional accommodation costs like utility bills) and the personal travel expenses of the MP (rather than of the MP, plus their staff and any dependents) the numbers in the claim are still incorrect.\n\nSNP MPs\u2019 rental expenses and personal travel expenses totalled just over \u00a31 million in 2017/18, or around \u00a329,000 per MP.\n\nScottish Conservative MPs rental expenses and personal travel expenses totalled around \u00a3291,000, or \u00a322,000 per MP.\n\nTotal parliamentary expenses (beyond just travel and accommodation, also including things like offices costs) for SNP MPs in 2017/18 came to just over \u00a37 million, or \u00a3201,000 on average per MP.\n\nTotal expenses for Scottish Conservative MPs were just over \u00a31.9 million, or \u00a3148,000 on average per MP.", "lang": "en"}
