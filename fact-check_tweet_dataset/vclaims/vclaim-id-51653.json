This is fake.\n\nThe fabricated quote card, dated May 11, 2020, is a manipulated version of a post that day by ABS-CBN News\u2019 official Facebook (FB) page. Gonzaga\u2019s original quote is about how she deals with bashers, saying she \u201cchooses battles wisely\u201d for her peace of mind.\n\nBeginning May 13, a photoshopped version of that graphic made the rounds on social media. Apart from the claim Gonzaga got paid for endorsing Duterte, the quote card said the ABS-CBN talent would leave the network \"immediately\" if she got paid higher, like Margaux \u201cMocha\u201d Uson, a known Duterte supporter and now Overseas Workers Welfare Administration deputy administrator.\n\nA cursory search does not show any records substantiating this claim.\n\nThe earliest traceable copy of the spurious FB post surfaced eight days after the National Telecommunications Commission ordered ABS-CBN to stop operations because its legislative franchise has expired. A House committee denied the company's bid for a fresh license last July 10.\n\nAt least two more netizens and two FB pages\u2014Confeermed and PEOPLE POWER\u2014re-uploaded the fake quote card on Aug. 10 and 11.\n\nGonzaga, who attended in May 2019 a \u201cthanksgiving gathering\u201d in Malacanang hosted by Duterte and his common-law wife Honeylet Avancena \u201cfor artists who support the President,\u201d received criticism from netizens this July regarding a statement she made about her network's shutdown.\n\nThe fake quote cards have collectively been shared over 630 times and could have reached at least 17,000 people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nFB pages Confeermed and PEOPLE POWER were created on July 29, 2015 and Sept. 20, 2016, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
