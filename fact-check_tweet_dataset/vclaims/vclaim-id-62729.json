The video is going around with a claim \u2013 \u2018#Watch: An eye witness, who happened to visit Gandhi hospital in Hyderabad, notices two bodies dumped\u2019. The same video was also found to be uploaded recently on Facebook and YouTube (archived) with the same claim. It is being shared in the context of COVID-19 pandemic as the patients tested positive for COVID-19 in Hyderabad are being treated at the Gandhi Hospital. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Recent video of two dead bodies dumped in the open at Gandhi Hospital (COVID\u201419 dedicated hospital) in Hyderabad, Telangana. Fact: The video is an old one. It is found to be on the internet at least since August 2019. So, it is not related to the current COVID-19 situation at the Gandhi Hospital in Telangana. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was uploaded on YouTube in August 2019 with the title \u2013 \u2018Two dead bodies Gandhi Hospital parking area\u2019. The same video was also found to be uploaded on Facebook in August 2019 with a similar description. Hence, it can be concluded that it is not a recent one and is not related to the COVID-19 situation at Gandhi Hospital in Telangana.\n\nFACTLY could not independently verify the actual context of the video. However, this incident was reported by \u2018The New Indian Express\u2019 when the video went viral in August 2019. Speaking to \u2018The New Indian Express\u2019, the then Superintendent of Gandhi Hospital denied these allegations and termed it as false news.\n\nTo sum it up, a 10-month old video is shared as a present-day video of two dead bodies dumped in the open at Gandhi Hospital (COVID-19 Care Center) in Telangana.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
