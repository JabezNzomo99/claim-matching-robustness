So, my employer was Regal-Beloit Corporation, my employer is Charter NEX. So, every day, I come into the office and it\u2019s focused on how do you bring in raw material, manufacturing, get it out of the door. My focus in particular is business development, and how do you grow the company and how do you grow jobs for those companies?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to be \u201cworking in manufacturing\u201d as a lawyer for a manufacturing company, and we don\u2019t see an issue with Steil\u2019s ad on that account. But the Bryce campaign also pointed out that the manufacturer where Steil spent the most time working, Regal-Beloit, outsourced many U.S. jobs while Steil was an associate general counsel from 2009 to 2017.\n\n\u201cAt Regal Beloit, Bryan was an assistant counsel and worked on business development projects and sales agreements utilizing his business and legal background,\" said Andrew Iverson, Steil\u2019s spokesman. According to the minutes of a November 2017 meeting of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents, on which Steil sits, he has said he also worked on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAround the time Steil was at Regal-Beloit, the company outsourced a substantial number of jobs to foreign countries, or it discontinued some U.S. operations and laid off workers because it began to buy products or parts from other countries, according to notices from the Department of Labor.\n\nIn 2009, Regal-Beloit subsidiary Marathon Electric laid off U.S. workers, as did another subsidiary, Hub City. Both decisions were made before Steil joined the company in August 2009, according to his campaign. However, records show that Steil was named secretary of Hub City after he joined Regal-Beloit, and he disclosed to Wisconsin state officials that he was named a director of the company that owned Marathon Electric.\n\n\u201cHe was not in senior management at Regal Beloit and was not involved in any way with those decisions\u201d to outsource jobs, said Iverson, the Steil spokesman. (Even if Steil was not one of the deciders, these statements don\u2019t go so far as to say he had no role at all in executing the company\u2019s plans to outsource jobs.)\n\nAccording to Regal-Beloit filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had nearly 4,200 U.S. employees at the beginning of 2010 and 5,407 employees at the end of 2017, when Steil left the company. That\u2019s a net increase of more than 1,200 U.S. jobs. The Steil campaign sent us an article showing that some of those new jobs were located in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bryce campaign pointed out comments from Regal-Beloit\u2019s chief executive and chief operating officer, in which they said outsourcing jobs was part of the company strategy. (Outsourcing jobs has been a common thread among many U.S. manufacturing industries over the past decades.)\n\n\u201cSteil is in fact not a manufacturer \u2014 he is a lawyer that did M&A [mergers and acquisitions] for a company,\u201d said Bryce campaign spokeswoman Julia Savel. \u201cThe company happened to ship jobs overseas during his time there and made that a part of their core strategy, but regardless of that, he still misrepresented what he did for the company time and time again.\u201d\n\nSteil in his ad said he had been \u201cworking in manufacturing\u201d before running for Congress. Although he was on the corporate-lawyer side of things, his work was entirely and exclusively for manufacturing companies since August 2009. Steil never claimed in his ad that he, himself, was screwing parts together on the assembly line.\n\nRegal-Beloit outsourced a substantial number of jobs while Steil was at the company, which seems to neutralize his claim during the WISN interview that his role was to \u201cgrow\u201d jobs in part. But there are two big caveats here: No evidence shows Steil had a hand in sending these jobs outside the United States, and Regal-Beloit ended up with roughly 1,200 more U.S. jobs by the time Steil left the company.\n\nHe did, however, work for a manufacturer whose leaders said outsourcing jobs was part of their strategy, and records show Steil did have a role in Marathon Electric and Hub City. Even if he was not part of the decision to outsource those jobs, these records suggest he had a role executing the plan.", "lang": "en"}
