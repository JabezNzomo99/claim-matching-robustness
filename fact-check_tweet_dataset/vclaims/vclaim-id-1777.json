But there is a wider point here, we do have to be realistic in looking at pension ages about the fact that people are living longer...\u201d\n\nThe move to make the state pension age equal for men and women, and increase it to 66 by 2020, means women born in the 1950s onwards are retiring later than they expected.\n\nA law in 2011 brought forward the year when the state pension would increase to 66, from 2026 to 2020. Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) are a group campaigning for a \u2018bridging\u2019 pension for women born in the 1950s affected by the changes and the 2011 timetable.\n\n2.6 million women are affected by the 2011 changes. The government did slow down its proposed timetable so no-one would face new changes of more than 18 months, reducing proposed savings by \u00a31.1 billion.\n\nThe state pension age was originally set at 65 years old for men, and 60 years for women. In 1995 a new law increased women\u2019s state pension age from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020. This meant that women born in the 1950s (and after) would reach retirement age later than they had planned. Research has shown many women weren\u2019t aware they were affected.\n\nA 2007 law then added an increase to the equal state pension age from 66 to 68, to be brought in between 2024 and 2046.\n\nIn 2011 the timetable was sped up, so state pension ages would be equal at 65 by 2018, and rise to 66 for everyone by 2020. The new changes affect around 5 million people born between 1953 and 1960 in Great Britain, 2.6 million women and 2.3 million men. Women born between 1950 and 1953 were affected by the 1995 law and reached retirement age by March last year.\n\nTogether the changes delay women\u2019s state pension age between three and six years compared to retiring at 60.\n\nFurther changes made in 2014 have now brought forward when the equal pension age will increase to 67, from 2034-2036 to 2026-2028. The first version of the 2011 law would have delayed some women's pension by two more years. The government shortened that to a maximum of 18 months, reducing the savings from the changes by \u00a31.1 billion.\n\nSome people, such as the WASPI campaigners, don\u2019t think that went far enough.\n\nThe UK does have an aging population, and despite these changes the number of working-age people per pensioner is expected to fall.\n\nYou can check your state pension age online.", "lang": "en"}
