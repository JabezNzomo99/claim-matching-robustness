In each egg was a fish-shaped cracker, a square of toilet paper, and a piece of candy or powdered juice packet.\n\nDozens of people in Florida's Flagler County reported finding suspicious packages in their mailboxes containing Easter eggs, pamphlets with pornographic images, and other items.\n\nFrom the New York Post to TV news stations, news media nationwide jumped on a story about residents in Florida purportedly finding unsolicited, porn-filled Easter eggs in their mailboxes in April 2020.\n\nNews coverage of the incident began after the Flagler County Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a news release April 6, 2020, asking for the public\u2019s help in finding the perpetrator.\n\nTwo to three dozen people across the northeastern coastal county had called the office the day before, sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Brittany Kershaw told Snopes, reporting the flags to their mailboxes in the upright position, even though those residents had already received the day\u2019s mail. \u201cThey were confused,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were upset because a lot of times their children went out to check the mailboxes.\u201d\n\nAfter opening the mailboxes, the Florida residents reported finding packages that included colorful plastic eggs, paper pamphlets with text and pornographic images, fish-shaped crackers, toilet paper scraps, and either a piece of candy or powdered juice packet, Kershaw said. Not all people received eggs; some only received the paper pamphlets with explicit images.\n\n\u201cThe person who did this is not only a very sick individual but could actually be spreading COVID-19 by their actions,\u201d Sheriff Rick Staly said in a news release referring to the coronavirus global pandemic. \u201cIf anyone else receives something like this or has information on who did this, we ask that you call us immediately.\u201d\n\nNews headlines such as Vice\u2019s \u201cSomebody Is Leaving Porn-Filled Easter Eggs in Florida Mailboxes\u201d began circulating online, and Twitter did what Twitter does with such a story: magnified it. \u201cGives Peeps a whole new meaning,\u201d user @JoeMontelle replied to the New York Post\u2019s story.\n\nBut the stories misreported exactly how the perpetrator distributed the porn: The pamphlets were rapped around the eggs like wrapping paper rather than tucked inside, according to crime-evidence photos obtained by Snopes. \u201cThe pamphlet was folded up and wrapped around the egg,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cIn other instances where there was no egg, the pamphlet was just placed in the mailbox.\u201d\n\nInstead of porn, each egg contained one fish-shaped cracker, a square of toilet paper, and piece of candy or powdered juice packet, according to the photos.\n\nThe placement of the porn aside, the news coverage continued unabated. And so did the Flagler County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s investigation. On April 8, deputies arrested a 42-year-old woman who the sheriff\u2019s office said admitted to distributing the packages \u2014 spurring another round of news stories, such as the New York Post\u2019s \u201cFlorida woman admits to stuffing porn-filled Easter eggs in mailboxes.\u201d\n\nKershaw, of the sheriff\u2019s office, said the woman told deputies \u201cshe was trying to educate the community on the behaviors of churches.\u201d The pamphlets called out some local churches and pastors by name, and the pornographic images were \u201cpretty much everything you can think of \u2026 all different types and very explicit. She was upset that homosexuals were allowed to participate in church.\u201d\n\nAuthorities arrested the suspect on suspicion of 11 counts of distributing obscene material, among other crimes. Kershaw said deputies had no reason to believe the woman was trying to spread the COVID-19 coronavirus disease that was sweeping across the globe at the time; she tested negative for symptoms of the virus.", "lang": "en"}
