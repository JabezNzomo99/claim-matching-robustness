His post had received 17,000 shares then.\n\nThe photograph does not depict Indira Gandhi\u2019s funeral\n\nUpon reverse-searching the image, Alt News found a few sources which claimed that the photograph was shot at the funeral of Pashtun independence activist Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, popularly known as Bacha Khan or \u2018Frontier Gandhi\u2019.\n\nIn 2016, a website named Skyscrapercity had also identified the photograph as Bacha Khan\u2019s funeral in Peshawar.\n\nBacha Khan had passed away on January 20, 1988. A New York Times report published the next day had written that the Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Peshawar to pay tributes to Khan.\n\nAnother article by Outlook mentions Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s attendance. We also found books on Google mentioning that the former prime minister was present at Abdul Ghaffar Khan\u2019s funeral.\n\nComparing Rahul Gandhi\u2019s age at the time of Indira Gandhi\u2019s and Ghaffar Khan\u2019s death\n\nAt the time of Indira Gandhi\u2019s death, Rahul Gandhi was 14 years of age. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan died, Rahul Gandhi was 18. There are numerous photographs of the Congress leader at her grandmother\u2019s funeral, where he clearly looks much younger than in the viral image.\n\nThis suggested that the photo being circulated on social media does not represent Indira Gandhi\u2019s funeral.\n\nFormer Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi died on October 31, 1984, and the family followed Hindu traditions at her cremation. A Washington Post report published on November 4, 1984 described the funeral ritual as, \u201cAs Brahman pundits (those learned in Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy) chanted Vedic hymns and family members climbed the 10-foot-high platform to heap wooden logs atop the slowly smoking pyre, a collective moan of grief arose from thousands of mourners, followed abruptly by stillness as orange tongues of flames leaped higher.\u201d\n\nPhotographs shot at the time by American stock photo agency Getty Images show Rajiv, Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi standing in front of Indira Gandhi\u2019s burning pyre and performing Hindu rituals at the cremation.\n\nIt is therefore evident that Indira Gandhi was cremated following Hindu rituals. But the false claim is viral across social media platforms.\n\nIt is widely being shared on pro-Modi groups on WhatsApp.", "lang": "en"}
