Scott Walker unveiled a folksy sort of contending that many things in Wisconsin have improved since he took office.\n\nOne claim about health care caused a number of readers to contact us.\n\nThe ad, released April 15, 2014, begins with the narrator saying:\n\n\"It had gotten pretty bad four years ago. Over 130,000 jobs lost. A deficit over 3 billion. And taxes going up. Wisconsin's future looked dark.\"\n\nThen come the claims.\n\n\"But it's different now. Wisconsin has turned around. The deficit is gone. Taxes are lower. And more people have gone back to work.\n\n\"Kids are going to college. Families are planning vacations and more are going to sleep knowing they have access to health care.\"\n\nWalker has famously opposed Obamacare. On the other hand, he expanded Medicaid eligibility in Wisconsin.\n\nSo, just how much credit does he deserve for more Wisconsinites having access to health care?\n\nThe lay of the land\n\nWe\u2019ll start by acknowledging there isn\u2019t a universally accepted definition of \"access to health care,\" although the phrase carries a presumption that the care is affordable -- another vague term.\n\nTo take it to an extreme, people could technically have access to health care even if all they could afford is private insurance with premiums that ate up half of their paychecks. But that would be nothing to brag about.\n\nAt the same time, there is little debate that access has increased since President Barack Obama signed the in March 2010, some 10 months before Walker took office.\n\nAmong other things, under Obamacare:\n\nNo one can be turned down for health insurance coverage because of a medical condition; children can be covered under a parent\u2019s policy until age 26; subsidies are available for low- and middle-income people who don\u2019t get insurance from an employer; lifetime caps on health insurance benefits are eliminated; and, quite simply, the law carries a mandate that nearly all Americans carry at least a basic level of coverage.\n\nIn Wisconsin, according to an actuarial firm that did a in 2011 for the state, the Obamacare premium subsidies and mandate are expected to increase the number of residents with health insurance by 340,000 by 2016.\n\nSo, where does that leave Walker?\n\nThe Republican governor in court. And he what was termed a full expansion of Medicaid under the law that would have been paid for 100 percent initially, eventually declining to 90 percent, by the federal government.\n\nTo back Walker\u2019s claim, his campaign cited a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected national authority on health care, and an October 2013 from the state Department of Health Services about the report.\n\nThe news release said that -- even though Wisconsin would not expand Medicaid eligibility as provided under Obamacare -- all Wisconsin residents nevertheless \"will have access to affordable health care\" as a result of the way Walker \"reformed\" Medicaid.\n\nSo, what was the reform?\n\nWalker expanded Medicaid (known as in Wisconsin) to cover adults who previously were not eligible for the program \u2013 basically those below the poverty threshold and without dependent children.\n\nBut adults with incomes above the poverty threshold previously covered by BadgerCare Plus are now required to buy subsidized private insurance on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act. Even after the federal subsidies, they will have higher premiums and cost-sharing \u2013 arguably, less access to health care \u2013 than they had with BadgerCare Plus.\n\nIn other words, Walker is financing his Medicaid expansion with the money the state will save by moving the less-poor adults from Medicaid to the subsidized private plans sold in the Obamacare marketplace.\n\nThe catch is, Wisconsin could have opted to expand the Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act at a lower cost to the state \u2013 roughly $100 million lower in the first two years \u2013 and a lower cost to many of the people who are losing their coverage under BadgerCare Plus.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet.\n\nBut an estimated 83,000 more people became eligible for Medicaid, while 77,000 were removed from Medicaid -- a net gain, of sorts, of 6,000 people, according to the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, a group that is a frequent Walker critic and which advocated for the full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nWalker said that under his leadership as governor, more people in Wisconsin \"have access to health care.\"\n\nHe can take some of the credit, given that everyone living under the federal poverty line is now eligible for Medicaid.\n\nBut far more people are getting access to health care, whether from the government or private carriers, as a result of Obamacare.", "lang": "en"}
