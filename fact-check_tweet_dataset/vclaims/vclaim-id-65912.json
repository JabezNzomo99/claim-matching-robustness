From Facebook to WhatsApp, a fake interview of Uma Kumar, senior doctor of AIIMS hospital, is going viral. It is being claimed that the doctor gave an interview regarding the corona virus.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that Dr. Uma did not give any such interview. Viral interview is fake.\n\nWhat is going viral?\n\nFacebook page Ujjwal Institute uploaded this fake interview\u2019s screenshot on 1 June.

For this, we searched Doctor Uma Kumar\u2019s profile on Google.

We found a post on her Facebook account. On May 31, Dr. Uma Kumar wrote on her Facebook account \u201cI have come to know that someone has circulated a news clip on social media using my photo and professional details without my permission to justify content not detailed by me. Police complaint has already been filed in this regard. However, I would like to emphasize that cough etiquettes, use of mask, hand hygiene, and social distancing remain the key to prevention against corona. Healthy diet and lifestyle definitely builds immune health of an individual but cannot be a substitute to the above-mentioned measures in fight against corona.\u201d\n\nIn the next phase of the investigation, we contacted Dr. Uma Kumar. She told us that she has not given any such interview in this particular context.\n\nFinally, we scanned the profile of Ujjawal Institute Facebook page for fake posts.
