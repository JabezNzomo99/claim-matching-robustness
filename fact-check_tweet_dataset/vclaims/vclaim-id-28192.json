An excerpt from the obituary reads: \u201cAfter his retirement 13 years later in 2003, at the age of 78, he had a stroke and went into a coma, struggling for survival. I believe it was his wife, Mrs Anne Sule\u2019s determination and Mr Sule\u2019s fighting spirit together with the prayers of his family and friends that saw him recover, and after years of physiotherapy he was back on his feet.\u201d\n\nBut Anne Sule isn\u2019t Sadanand Sule\u2019s mother. She is BR Sule\u2019s second wife. In the book \u2018Contemporary Political Leadership in India: Sharad Pawar, the Maratha legacy,\u2019 it is mentioned that Sadanand\u2019s mother is Shashi Bhatt, who died of cancer in 1964, when Sadanand was two years old.", "lang": "en"}
