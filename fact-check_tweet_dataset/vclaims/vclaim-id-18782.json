Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of that video. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Rahul Gandhi eating samosas during his aerial survey of flood-affected regions of Wayanad. Fact: The video of Rahul Gandhi eating samosas in a helicopter is taken during his election campaign for the Lok Sabha Elections-2019 in the state of Madhya Pradesh in April 2019. So, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe directed to the same video uploaded by \u2018ABP News\u2019 channel. From the description present below the video, it was found that Rahul Gandhi has tasted famous Shahdol (a place in M.P) samosa during a break in his election campaign in the state of Madhya Pradesh during Lok Sabha Elections-2019. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the video posted shows Rahul Gandhi eating samosas in a helicopter during his election campaign in the state of Madhya Pradesh for the Lok Sabha elections-2019 not during his aerial survey of flood-affected regions of Wayanad.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
