True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.\n\nNo, that's not true: the purported Buffett tweet seems to have originated on an impostor account. There is no record that Lee ever wrote or spoke those words.\n\nAn example of a printed version of the supposed Buffett tweet can be seen in this Facebook post (archived here) for example:\n\nYou can immediately tell the tweet is not real, just by looking at the image:\n\nWarren Buffett's verified Twitter account is @WarrenBuffet, not @WarrenBuffetHQ. You can see the fake account lacks the telltale blue checkmark.\n\nIn addition to that a search on the real Twitter account in combination with part of the quote returns no results.\n\nAnd the fake account seems to admit the quote was wrongly attributed in this (currently pinned) tweet (archived here):\n\nSocial media memes also attribute the quote to Bruce Lee, including this one:\n\nA spokeswoman for the Bruce Lee Foundation in Los Angeles said the organization has no record of the actor making the statement.", "lang": "en"}
