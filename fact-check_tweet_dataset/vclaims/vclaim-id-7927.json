She also claimed increasing numbers of nurses were facing the same situation.\n\nWe can\u2019t factcheck individual experiences of accident and emergency services, and there\u2019s no way to know how many nurses are having to take measures like this. But the pressures being talked about echo, to an extent, what we do know about the recent situation facing A&Es in England. We haven\u2019t yet seen detailed data from the rest of the UK on ambulance delays.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only anecdotal reports that have come out of A&Es thi s week. A letter to the Prime Minister from 68 senior A&E doctors listed some of their personal experiences too. According to the doctors these experiences include \u201cpatients sleeping in clinics as makeshift wards\u201d and \u201cover 120 patients a day managed in corridors, some dying prematurely\u201d.\n\nAmbulance delays are one key pressure that\u2019s been measured across England in recent weeks.\n\nIn the first week of 2018, nearly 16,700 ambulances were delayed by over half an hour after arriving at an A&E department in England, which is one is six of all ambulances that arrived that week. Nearly 5,100\u2014or one in 20\u2014were waiting over an hour.\n\nThat varies a lot across the country. The most severe case last week was in Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh, where over half of all ambulance arrivals faced delays over over half an hour and over a quarter of over an hour. Meanwhile a handful of other trusts didn\u2019t experience any such delays.\n\nThe picture was similar in the recent Christmas week: overall across England 16,900 ambulances were waiting at least 30 minutes and 4,700 for over an hour.\n\nThese delays have worsened compared to earlier in December and November. At the very start of December for example, about one in nine ambulances were waiting over half an hour.\n\nPart of the reason behind these delays is a lack of available beds. More beds were made available last week than there were over Christmas\u2014around 99,000 across England on any given day between 1 and 7 January. On average, 95% of those beds were occupied. We\u2019re planning to write more about how A&Es fared over the winter period soon.", "lang": "en"}
