[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the treasurer\u2019s claim that NSW contributed the most in GST and income tax, only for it to be \"doled out\u201d to other states.\n\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) is defined as a 10 per cent tax that\u2019s applied to most goods and services. [2]\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, NSW contributed the most GST tax revenue for 2017-18 with $13.8 billion, Victoria was second ($10.6 billion), followed by Queensland ($5.3 billion), Western Australia ($2.4 billion), South Australia ($1.8 billion), Tasmania ($471 million), the ACT ($320 million) and the Northern Territory ($203 million). NSW's revenue represents 39.6 per cent of the GST total. [3]\n\nNSW also topped income tax revenue as a percentage of returns for the 2016-17 financial year - the most recent data available from the Australian Taxation Office. NSW led the nation providing 31.5 per cent of tax revenue ahead of Victoria (25.3 per cent), Queensland (19 per cent), Western Australia (10.7 per cent), South Australia (6.8 per cent), Tasmania (two per cent), ACT (1.9 per cent) and Northern Territory (0.9 per cent). [4]\n\nFor the GST carve-up from the federal government to the states for 2019-20, NSW will receive the biggest share (27.9 per cent) followed by Victoria (25.7 per cent), Queensland (21.1 per cent), South Australia (10.1 per cent), Western Australia (5.4 per cent), Northern Territory (4.1 per cent), Tasmania (3.6 per cent) and the ACT (2.1 per cent). [5]\n\nNSW\u2019s GST share increased from 27.4 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.9 per cent in 2019-20 and the state\u2019s GST entitlement in 2019-20 will rise by \u201c$1012 million ($1.012 billion), or 5.5 per cent\u201d, according to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. [6]\n\nBased on these figures, AAP FactCheck found Mr Perrottet's claims to be mostly true. He is correct in claiming that NSW contributes the most in GST and income tax. However NSW also receives the highest GST allocation from the federal government.", "lang": "en"}
