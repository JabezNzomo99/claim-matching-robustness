The claim is misleading; the image has been doctored from a photo published in a Hong Kong newspaper in December 2019 to make Shum appear emaciated.\n\nThe image was published here on an anti-Falun Gong Facebook page on December 5, 2019. It has been shared more than 300 times.\n\nFalun Gong is a spiritual prictice which has been banned on the Chinese mainland since the late 1990s, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe image shows a portrait of Shum looking sickly and has another photo of a younger Shum, which can be found here on his Facebook page, superimposed on the bottom left-hand side with text that reads \u201cbefore joining Falun Gong\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAfter Lester Shum joined Falun Gong, he takes cocaine everyday, and feels super high.\u201d\n\nThe traditional Chinese text superimposed on the image states the same claim and Shum\u2019s full name.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nShum first came to prominence as a student leader in the 2014 Occupy Movement in Hong Kong, AFP reported here.

The article\u2019s traditional Chinese-language headline translates to English as: \u201cOccupy leader Lester Shum: Hope \u2018weaken leadership\u2019 on district affairs\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by Ming Pao:\n\nThe portrait, which is credited to photographer Lai Tsun-kit, carries the caption: \u201cLester Shum became a district council member from deputy secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students.
