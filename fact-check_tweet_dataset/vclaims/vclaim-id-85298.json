Need I say more?\u201d, said Sarma while tweeting the image. Sarma attended to portray a much larger gathering at the pro-CAA rally,\n\nAlt News found that the image of the anti-CAA protest organized in Dhemaji is misleading. A video of the rally organized by All Assam Students\u2019 Union (AASU) on January 9, 2020, clearly depicts that the picture used in the comparison by Sarma shows a smaller crowd than in reality. Below is a drone video of the rally tweeted by Assam journalist Atanu Bhuyan.\n\nTwitter user Sanjib Gogoi also posted an image that gives an aerial view of the rally in Dhemaji, Assam.\n\nIn the comparison below, a drone\u2019s eye view of the anti-CAA rally is compared with the image shared by Sarma on Twitter.\n\n\n\nThis can also be corroborated with pictures tweeted by Lurinjyoti Gogoi, the General Secretary of AASU.\n\nSeveral other pictures taken from a different angle give a better view of the mass gathering at the anti-CAA rally.\n\nIn conclusion, Himanta Biswa Sarma misleadingly compared a cropped image of an anti-CAA rally with a pro-CAA rally to portray mass support for the newly enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019.", "lang": "en"}
