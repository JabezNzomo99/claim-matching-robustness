It is being claimed as a live suicide from Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. We found that the viral image has been photoshopped, and it has got no link with Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\n\nFacebook page PK Entertainment\u2019 posted the misleading photo with the caption: In Dubai Burj Khalifa live suicide.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nWe reverse-searched the viral image and found that the picture is not of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa but it is Egypt\u2019s Cairo Tower. \n\nIn the viral image, it can be seen that there is an unusual gap between the man and the tower. If a man jumps from a tower, there can\u2019t be so much gap. Also, the size of the falling man is comparatively bigger in front of the tower.\n\nWe then searched with keywords related to the suicide incident at Egypt's Cairo Tower. We found a report published on December 2, 2019, by Middle East Monitor.\n\nAccording to the report, 20-year-old Nader Mohammad, who was going through a psychological crisis, jumped from the top of the Cairo Tower. Nader had informed a friend that he intended to commit suicide.\n\nThere was no such picture of Nader jumping from the Cairo Tower. Hence, it is clear that the viral picture has been photoshopped.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Mainstream media fall for crazy satire story on viagra-filled river", "lang": "en"}
