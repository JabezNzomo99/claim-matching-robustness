Senior journalist Vindo Dua on 20 December aired the seventh episode of his show \u2018The Vinod Dua Show\u2019 on HW News, where he suggested there was brewing discord within the BJP based on a clip from an interview the channel had aired with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. In the show, Dua was heard saying that after Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha, even hardcore RSS workers like Gadkari were displeased with the leadership in the party \u2013 based on an edited clip from the interview. Although the episode has since been removed from Youtube, here is a version of the episode loaded by a user on the platform. In the video, Dua says, \u201cWhen he (Gadkari) was made the minster, there were over 400 projects which were stalled, several loans were about to turn into an NPAs. And he believes that the government is to blame for this.\u201d The video then progresses to Gadkari saying the same things as Dua mentioned. \u201cAt that time, we decided to revive these projects. But I am ready to accept that 75% of the reason behind these issues was the government.\u201d Dua then says that this indicates that there is growing dissent within the ranks of = BJP, drawing on the examples of Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie. \u201cNow those directly associated with the BJP are also voicing their dissent against the leadership,\u201d he said, adding that Gadkari had made it clear that PM Modi could not be made the party\u2019s face in the upcoming 2019 elections. He further claimed that Gadkari had instead wanted to lead the party himself now.\n\nAs mentioned above, the portion taken by Dua in his episode has been edited from a larger interview by HW News. However, Gadkari had not expressed his displeasure with NDA government, but was instead lashing out at the UPA government. This has, however, been wrongly interpreted by Dua, who used the edited clip to further a false narrative. Nitin Gadkari\u2019s office published the longer version of the video on Facebook, where it is clear the Gadkari was blaming the UPA government, not the current government. This ORIGINAL interview clip exposes Vinod Dua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Propaganda U Tube video (paid news) against Shri Nitin Gadkari. Please... Posted by Office of Nitin Gadkari on Saturday, December 22, 2018 The post along with video read: \u201cThis ORIGINAL interview clip exposes Vinod Dua\u2019s Propaganda U Tube video (paid news) against Shri Nitin Gadkari. Please compare the two video clips Propaganda vs Reality. Vinod Dua has doctored the interview to make it appear as if the stalled projects and NPA were in Ganga-related projects and the fault was of the Modi Government. Where as Shri Gadkari has clearly stated in the interview that all the stalled Projects were road and highway projects caused by the UPA government.\u201d Gadkari too took to Twitter to call Dua out for airing a doctored video on his show. Let me make it clear once and for all that conspiracies to create a wedge between me and the BJP leadership will never succeed.\n\n\n\nI have been clarifying my position at various forums and shall continue to do so and expose these nefarious designs of our detractors. \u2014 Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) December 23, 2018 Meanwhile, HW News has issued a clarification and taken the episode down. In its clarification, the channel said the clip had been erroneously sent to Dua, who records his links in New Delhi based on this material, while the video is produced in Mumbai.", "lang": "en"}
