This is false; the man was hospitalized, a prosecutor said he was treated for a head injury and bleeding from his ear, and his lawyer dismissed the idea as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was staged. Dude was a known activist that kept coming at police to get them to react, then when they finally pushed him, he faked his injury,\u201d says a June 6, 2020 Facebook post that includes an image allegedly showing tubing used for the fake blood.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has helped fuel conspiracy theories surrounding the June 4 incident in which 75-year-old Martin Gugino was injured in the city of Buffalo, tweeting without providing any evidence that \u201che fell harder than was pushed\u201d and suggesting that he could be a \u201cprovocateur\u201d from the far-left movement Antifa.\n\nIn footage of the incident published by the WBFO radio station, Gugino can be seen confronting police before he is pushed and falls to the ground during a protest in Niagara Square. Blood runs from his ear as he lies on the ground.\n\nAnother video shows him being transported by paramedics on a stretcher, with a cervical collar around his neck and a bandage over his head.\n\nThe incident came during protests across the country over police brutality against African Americans that were sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.\n\nIt led to assault charges against Buffalo police officers, both of whom pleaded not guilty.\n\nOther posts making similar claims about Gugino faking an injury appear on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nBut the claims are false.\n\nGugino \u201cis still at the Erie County Medical Center (ECMC),\u201d Peter Cutler, its vice president of communications and external affairs, told AFP by phone, saying that the man is now in rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cHis medical status was updated from serious to fair\u201d on June 9, Cutler added.\n\nKelly Zarcone, Gugino\u2019s attorney, said claims that her client faked an injury and staged his fall \u201care ridiculous and absolutely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one from law enforcement has even suggested anything like that,\u201d she told AFP by email.\n\nAnd the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s Office also confirmed that Gugino was injured in a statement on charges against the two police officers involved in the incident.\n\n\u201cThe 75-year-old male victim was taken to ECMC to be treated for a head injury, loss of consciousness, and bleeding from the right ear. He remains hospitalized in critical condition,\u201d the June 6 statement said.\n\nSome social media users raised questions about the speed and volume of blood that came out of Gugino\u2019s ear after the fall\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not at all unusual,\u201d explains Dr Sanjay Dhall, Associate Professor in Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cGiven the way he was stumbling backwards, that itself is enough speed to cause the head to hit the ground pretty hard,\u201d he told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw that video, I immediately thought of the bleeding that was probably going on inside of his head, and I\u2019ve seen many life-threatening injuries in many people who did not survive falls like that,\u201d Dhall added.\n\nAnd the supposed \u201ctube\u201d allegedly used for fake blood appears to actually be the strap of a second mask, similar in shape and color to an N95, worn underneath Gugino\u2019s blue surgical mask, as seen in footage of the incident here.\n\nClaims that Gugino is an activist, however, are accurate. He has been arrested four times but never convicted, according to his blog.", "lang": "en"}
