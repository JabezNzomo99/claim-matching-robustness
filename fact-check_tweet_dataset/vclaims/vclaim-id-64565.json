Facebook statuses and tweets went viral among educators, parents and activists, stating:\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from where, exactly, the claim originated. And first, to measure its legitimacy, we did some back-of-the-napkin math. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government prepared for 56.6 million K-12 students in fall 2019 (50.8 million in public schools and 5.8 million in private education). That means 11,320 \u2014 not 14,740 \u2014 is .02% of the country\u2019s student population.\n\nApart from the statement\u2019s inaccuracy, our analysis of DeVos\u2019 public appearances found no evidence to show she made the comment. We deemed several speeches at the White House, as well as televised interviews on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on July 12, 2020, as the likely sources of inspiration for the rumor, considering the timing and content of those events. In the first of those appearances, which took place on July 7, 2020, for instance, DeVos said:\n\nThe following day, after a meeting of the White House coronavirus task force, she made similar remarks, and praised several school systems for their quick transition to remote learning in the early weeks of the outbreak, including New York City\u2019s Success Academy Charter Schools and Miami-Dade County Public Schools. Simultaneously, she claimed, other local school districts were \u201cdoing next to nothing\u201d to teach students during the unprecedented rules against in-classroom learning.\n\nThree days later, DeVos addressed CNN\u2019s audience via an interview on why she believed schools should fully reopen in the fall, even though the country\u2019s daily spike in COVID-19 cases was on the rise and did not show signs of a decline. There, DeVos mostly re-emphasized talking points she made during the White House briefings and downplayed the health risks to students should schools fully reopen, essentially affirming the underlying sentiment to critics\u2019 claim about the projected death toll. DeVos stated, referring to \u201cdata\u201d that she did not define:\n\nIn both the CNN and Fox News interviews, DeVos pointed to research that suggests children are less likely to suffer severe symptoms due to COVID-19 compared to adults.\n\nWhile people of any age with certain underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illnesses should they catch COVID-19, children are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses, and patients over the age of 18 may have different symptoms than youth, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAccording to a study of U.S. children infected with COVID-19 between February and April 2020 by the CDC, for instance, the youth population made up less than 2% of the country\u2019s cases, totaling 150,000. Additionally, three COVID-19 patients under the age of 18 died during that time frame, compared to roughly 5,450 fatal cases among adults. The study stated:\n\nIn other words, the CDC says: \u201cIf children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk. Children can pass this virus onto others who have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nDeVos said school systems should consider those recommendations on a case-by-case basis, and urged local leaders to consider \u201cgranular data\u201d that depicts COVID-19\u2019s impact on their community, specifically.\n\nHowever, at no point during the broadcast interviews or the previously-mentioned White House speeches in July 2020 did the education secretary make the alleged statement about a percentage of students dying as a result of COVID-19 when schools fully reopen. Additionally, there was no evidence that she had made the statement on social media accounts, nor via press releases, around the time the claim went viral. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
