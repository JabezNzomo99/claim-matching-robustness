The actor was 43 years old.\n\nAn image shared on Facebook appears to show a screen grab of a Toronto Today article titled, \u201cAUTOPSY: Chadwick Boseman was POISONED, homicide investigation begins.\u201d The article goes on to claim that while originally his death was thought to be from cancer, the coroner \u201cdiscovered the actor was actually poisoned, and otherwise healthy\u201d during an autopsy.\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to corroborate the claim. The article, which is listed under the \u201cConspiracy Files\u201d category, does not disclose any credible sourcing for its allegations. (RELATED: Did Mel Gibson Say Hollywood \u2018Is An Institutionalized Pedophile Ring\u2019?)\n\nThe article, published on Aug. 29, also alleges that police \u201cwill be holding a press conference in the next 48 hours,\u201d to announce a homicide investigation. As of Sept. 1, no such press conference has occurred, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.\n\nIn reality, Boseman died of colon cancer. He was \u201cdiagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV,\u201d according to a statement posted on Boseman\u2019s verified Twitter account.\n\n\u201cA true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cFrom Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson\u2019s Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nWhile he had not spoken publicly about his diagnosis, fans noticed he appeared to have lost weight in the months before his death, a common side effect of colon cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Celebrities, politicians and fans posted emotional tributes to the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d actor upon the news of his death.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
