Half True.\n\u2022 Pro-abortion rights group has dinged Biden in the past.\n\u2022 Did Joe Biden campaign for a $15 minimum wage?\n\nSanders is clearly not the only one to worry \u2014 and the facts are on his side. Public health experts are sounding the alarm that if the virus infects people quickly, and enough show symptoms, the system will be overwhelmed.\n\nIn a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts pointed out that the nation has insufficient hospital beds, even if only 5% of the country contracts the illness. The authors \u2014 Ezekiel J. Emanuel at the University of Pennsylvania, James Phillips of George Washington University Hospital and Govind Persad at the University of Denver \u2014 specifically pointed to worries about \"shortages of medical staff and equipment.\"\n\nThose worries are widespread. In New York State, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has suggested temporarily halting elective surgeries and re-certifying retired doctors and nurses. And if the virus afflicts health care workers, too, that would further constrain the system\u2019s capacity.\n\nPut simply, \"we do not have anywhere near capacity to take care of tens of thousands of people with [COVID-19] who might need hospitalization,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, a health policy researcher at Harvard University, recently told WBUR, the local NPR station.\n\nA February report put out by researchers at Johns Hopkins University tallied a total of 46,500 intensive care unit beds across the entire United States. If the virus spreads at a moderate pace, the researchers estimated, 200,000 Americans would ultimately need ICU beds. A separate Hopkins report found only 160,000 ventilators in the country \u2014 enough for a moderate outbreak, but not enough if it spirals into something worse.\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t necessarily need those beds all at once, of course. But it\u2019s still a lot more sick people than beds \u2014 especially when you consider that many ICU beds are already in use for people with other medical conditions, such as the flu.\n\nJoe Biden: \"They (the military) did it in the Ebola crisis. They have done it. They have the capacity to build 500-bed hospitals and tents that are completely safe and secure and provide the help to get it done to this overflow.\" Biden is right that the military added to hospital capacity during previous epidemics, but it\u2019s not clear they were as large or as effective as he said they were. We asked the Biden campaign for details but didn\u2019t hear back. But there are a couple of potential past examples. First, the Ebola crisis. While Biden was vice president, the U.S. military helped increase capacity for treatment in Liberia. According to a 2014 White House press release, American efforts to curb the spread of the disease included \"build(ing) additional Ebola Treatment Units in affected areas,\" \"establish(ing) a site to train up to 500 health care providers per week\" and sending a \"field-deployable hospital to Liberia.\" But it\u2019s also important to note that the efficacy was limited, especially regarding the treatment units. An April 2015 New York Times report found that of the 11 Ebola treatment units the military built, nine had never treated a single patient with the disease. In total, they had treated only 28 patients. It\u2019s unclear, though, whether the Ebola units are the same as these 500-person tents Biden was referencing. We checked his campaign\u2019s coronavirus plan. It does allude to deploying another existing resource: \"multi-hundred-bed temporary hospitals\" known as Federal Medical Stations. These stations have been used in previous public health crises, including countless hurricanes over the past 15 years. They are, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an important resource in building the health system\u2019s holding capacity, especially in times of such difficulty. Biden\u2019s numbers are off, though. These temporary medical facilities can house between 50 and 250 patients and are treated as a stopgap when hospitals overflow. They can provide low-acuity care and other support. But that\u2019s far short of 500-bed hospital equivalents.\n\nThis leaves out context and ignores Biden\u2019s subsequent positions in opposition to such cuts.\n\nSanders emphasizes old statements by Biden, some decades ago, that show a willingness to slow spending in an effort to reduce the federal deficit. (Sanders calls this a \"cut.\")\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to reign in all spending to reduce the deficit. For instance, Biden said in 1984 that \"the only way that Congress will ever be able to come to grips with deficits is by dealing with all federal programs as a package.\"\n\nSanders has also used audio of Biden saying in 1995, \"When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veteran\u2019s benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government.\"\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s focus has changed to protecting Social Security from cuts since he became vice president in 2009.\n\nBiden\u2019s message in the current campaign is that he is firmly against cuts to the program. Sanders has also called for expanding Social Security.\n\nBiden called out Sanders during the debate for an ad \"saying I'm opposed to Social Security, that PolitiFact says is a flat lie, and that The Washington Post said is a flat lie.\" PolitiFact rated the ad about Biden\u2019s record over 40 years Mostly False.\n\nThis is Half True. Sanders has a point that he has consistently voted in favor of abortion rights when it comes to stand-alone votes on the Hyde Amendment. The amendment is a long-standing measure that bars federal dollars from being used to pay for most abortions.\n\nBut when broad spending packages that include a version of the amendment have come up, Sanders has voted to send them through numerous times. The amendment\u2019s language is often plugged into the annual bills that fund the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCNN\u2019s Dana Bash, a moderator of the March 15 debate, asked Sanders about his voting for broad spending bills in June. He said that sometimes, \"in a large bill, you have to vote for things you don\u2019t like. But I think my record as being literally 100% pro-choice is absolutely correct.\"\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders are exaggerating here.\n\nThe Biden camp pointed to a coalition of nine groups that have been widely reported to be supporting Sanders, including the Democratic Socialists of America, the Sunrise Movement, Our Revolution, the Center Popular Democracy Action, Make the Road Action, People's Action, Student Action, Progressive Democrats of America, and Dream Defenders.\n\nOfficially, only three of the nine groups in the pro-Sanders coalition have a super PAC: Dream Defenders, People\u2019s Action, and Make the Road.\n\nSuper PACs proliferated after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Citizens United case. They can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees.\n\nThe other groups supporting Sanders are organized in different ways, such as 501(c)4 groups that are regulated by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nMany of these other groups are unofficially called \"dark money\" by critics, since there are gaps in transparency about where the money is coming from. But they are not technically super PACs.\n\nBiden, for his part, benefits from the super PAC Unite the Country. Neither candidate, under law, can coordinate with these outside groups.\n\nBiden did earn 100% ratings from NARAL, the abortion-rights group, four times during his final years in Congress, but his framing in the debate left out several ratings that were much lower.\n\nBiden received a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006. That is based on how closely his votes aligned with the group\u2019s priorities. Meanwhile, Biden was just below that in 2000 with a 90% rating, and had a 75% rating in 2007.\n\nIn other years, however, Biden\u2019s ratings from NARAL were significantly lower.\n\nFor instance, 17 years ago, in 2003, he earned a 36% rating. In 1999, his rating was 46%. In 1997, his rating was 34%. And in 1996, Biden\u2019s rating was 43%.\n\nIt was only in 2019 that Biden backed off his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortions. In 1994, for instance, Biden wrote to constituents that he had \"on no fewer than 50 occasions\" voted against federal funding for abortions. \"Those of us who are opposed to abortions should not be compelled to pay for them,\" he wrote, according to NBC News.\n\nSanders, for his part, has earned a 100% rating from the group consistently, going back to 1996.\n\nThis is not fully accurate. Sanders\u2019 claim oversimplifies a complex government response to the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nBy our calculations, the total spent to stem the crisis ranged from roughly $1.4 trillion to about $3.1 trillion, depending on whether you count direct government bailouts authorized by Congress and the Federal Reserve\u2019s purchase of mortgage securities in addition to the Fed\u2019s recession lending programs.\n\nBut while the biggest Wall Street players benefited greatly, banks and other businesses across the country also got some help. Finally, the interest rates for most of the loans \u2014 and there were different types \u2014 were very low. But they were not zero, according to Fed data.\n\nBiden is right about his efforts in New York, despite Sanders\u2019 suggestion that Biden has only \"come around\" to supporting a $15 hourly minimum wage \"since the campaign.\"\n\nIn 2015, Biden as vice president campaigned with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to boost the state of New York\u2019s minimum wage to $15 per hour, according to the state\u2019s government website. Cuomo eventually signed legislation to gradually increase the hourly minimum wage to $15 for all New Yorkers.\n\nThe effort was widely covered by local and national news organizations at the time. During the event with Cuomo, Biden spoke for nearly 30 minutes and called \"stagnant wages\" the biggest issue facing the economy.\n\n\"The single most rapid, important thing that we can do to deal with wage inequity and start this virtuous cycle is what the governor did today, raising the minimum wage,\" Biden said. \"The higher it\u2019s raised, the more impact it has immediately on the lives of individuals.\"\n\nJoe Biden: \"Part of that was bailing out the automobile industry \u2014 saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. (Sanders) voted against that as well.\" Sanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout \u2014 though the funds\u2019 primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed. But Biden left listeners with the impression that Sanders\u2019 opposed bailing out the auto industry. Sanders voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed. Joe Biden: \"I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress, PolitiFact said was a game changer.\" Yes, and no. We rated True his claim in May 2019 when he said he was \"one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill.\" But we did not describe his bill as a \"game changer.\" Experts gave him credit for being an early supporter of climate change action, but also warned against inflating his bill\u2019s impact.", "lang": "en"}
