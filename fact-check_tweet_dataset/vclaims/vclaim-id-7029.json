Correct, although this refers to growth in all UK health spending, rather than just for the NHS. It compares the periods 1955/56 to 2015/16 (when health spending grew by an average of 4% in real terms each year) and 2009/10 to 2015/16 (when it grew by an average of 1.3% a year).\n\nThere are 16,481 fewer beds in hospitals since 2010. This is in the right ballpark, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the best comparison. It seems to compare the number of beds at different times of the year, but the number available fluctuates seasonally. Comparing July-September in 2010 and 2017, the decrease in beds available overnight in England is closer to 13,200.\n\n66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. We don\u2019t know, as this information isn\u2019t collected nationally. In 2014, there were reportedly plans to close or downgrade 66 in England, but while some have been, others have stayed open.\n\n103 NHS walk-in centres have closed or been downgraded since 2010. We don\u2019t know exactly, as this information isn\u2019t collected centrally. Research from an NHS regulator and from campaign group 38 Degrees suggests more than 90 have been closed or downgraded.\n\nThere are around 1,000 fewer GP practices in England in 2017 than in 2010. Some practices may have merged together, rather than closing completely, but we don\u2019t know how many have done so.\n\nA&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010/11 and 2017/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.\n\nThe number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017/18.\n\nSpending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009/10 and 2016/17, councils\u2019 spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We\u2019ve asked it for more information.\n\nThere are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010. This seems to be looking at different months in 2010 and 2017, which isn\u2019t the best comparison. Comparing the number of full-time equivalent mental health nurses between January 2010 and January 2018 (the latest figures), the drop is closer to 4,500.\n\nThe number of operations classed as urgent that have been cancelled twice have doubled since 2010. Correct. The number of urgent operations in England cancelled for the second time or more for non-medical reasons more than doubled between 2011/12 and 2017/18.\n\nThere has been a 22% drop in ambulances meeting their 15 minute transfer target since 2010. The decrease is actually greater\u201428%. In 2010/11 in England 80% of ambulance transfers were done in 15 minutes, in 2015/16 it was 58%.", "lang": "en"}
