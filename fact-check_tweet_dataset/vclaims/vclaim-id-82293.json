The average income for the top 1 percent rose while the average income for the 99 percent fell, and \u201cso far, all of the gains from the recovery have gone to the 1 percent,\u201d the article said. This is where Sanders\u2019s \u201c99 percent\u201d figure comes from.\n\nWolfers\u2019s article analyzed research by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Saez, along with Paris School of Economics professor Thomas Piketty, has produced research that is one of the most widely cited sources for assertions that the economic recovery has disproportionately benefited the richest 1 percent of Americans. Wolfers said he used Saez\u2019s research to generate his findings; Saez confirmed the calculation in an e-mail.\n\nThe Saez/Piketty research defines income as the sum of the pre-tax cash income reported on individual tax returns, such as wages, salaries, pensions and capital income. It used realized capital gains, but also provided numbers that excluded them. It does not include any government transfer programs. The 2013 data was preliminary tax filings from the Internal Revenue Service. This is a narrow definition of household income that skews toward the top of the income distribution and is likely to show the most extreme rise in income inequality.\n\nCritics of this research say the method is too narrow. Others have used the Current Population Survey by the Census Bureau that does not show as big of a gain in the top 1 percent, but census data is known to be unreliable for this information because not enough people in that population respond to census surveys.\n\nAlthough these benefits are not provided in cash, they are included in the income calculation because they \u201cincrease people\u2019s ability to purchase consumer goods and services,\u201d according to the November 2014 CBO report. This calculation includes automatic stabilizers (such as food stamps, unemployment insurance and earned income tax credit) that more lower-income families qualified for through the recession and the slow recovery, to make up for lost income.\n\nWhen asked why he used an income calculation that disregards steps taken to help Americans in the 99 percent, his spokesman Michael Briggs wrote: \u201cSaez and the senator both are looking at how the market economy is distributing income gains. Yes, there are programs that help keep some families afloat. But the senator\u2019s remarks were focused on the unevenness of the recovery and the extent to which income gains are flowing directly to the 1 percent. The fact that there is redirection via transfer programs does not undercut the accuracy of what he said.\u201d (Update: Sanders now cites updated figures that Saez released in June 2015, that the top 1 percent captured 58 percent of total real income growth from 2009 to 2014. This shows how income data can change coming out of a recession. Kudos to Sanders for citing updated figures.)\n\nThe various income-inequality measures make it difficult to draw accurate comparisons between studies. In addition, there is no comparable research for 2012 and 2013 (the years that Sanders uses) to compare how the recovery would look under a broader definition of \u201cincome.\u201d Sanders is correct that the top 1 percent of Americans have benefited disproportionately, but there is dispute over just how much.\n\nThe calculation Sanders cites is one measure, but it is a specific and narrow one that skews toward a more extreme portrayal of income inequality. His statement also disregards the impact of programs that were designed to mitigate the impact on Americans with far less cash income than the wealthy, which provides context in the debate over income inequality. He earns One Pinocchio.\n\nThey should have dug deeper. Whether the Washington Post likes it or not, that fact is correct. Professor Justin Wolfers, an economist who works for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, came up with this figure by analyzing the income inequality research of Professor Emmanuel Saez, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on this issue. Just this week, Professor Wolfers said again \u201cThe numbers that Sen. Sanders cited are exactly right \u2013 I calculated them myself, double-checked my figures and confirmed them with other leading economists. There are other measures one could analyze but none are sufficiently timely that they can speak to the distribution of gains through the economic recovery.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
