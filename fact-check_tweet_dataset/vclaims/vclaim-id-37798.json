Many state legislatures also maintain this tradition.\n\nThe Facebook post alleges that 10 men identified in the image are Democratic congressmen refusing to stand for the pledge. It has been shared more than 10,000 times.

The photo, taken by The Associated Press photographer Tim Roske in 2009, captures New York state senators remaining seated during the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n\u201cDemocratic state senators, top, except for Pedro Espada, D-Bronx, remain seated as Republican senators and staff begin a session with the Pledge of Allegiance at the Capitol in Albany, N.Y., Tuesday, June 23, 2009,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nDemocrats controlled the New York State Senate by a 32-30 margin at the beginning of the 2009 summer, but Republicans took control June 8 after State Sens. Pedro Espada and Hiram Monseratte voted with them to elect Republican State Sen. Dean Skelos as the majority leader, reported The New York Times. Democrats protested the leadership change by refusing to stand for the recitation of the pledge June 23, 2009.\n\nBoth Monseratte and Espada rejoined the Democratic Caucus on June 15 and July 9 respectively, restoring Democratic control of the State Senate, according to The Times.", "lang": "en"}
