Hi VVP\u201d in Russian. McFaul, a registered Democrat who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s top Russia policy adviser before being appointed ambassador, was responding to preliminary election results, with his party having taken control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years.\n\nVVP are the initials of Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet regarding the outcome in the House, McFaul tweeted \u201cyes\u201d in Russian.\n\nIn a \u201cUS News\u201d article with no byline, RT wrote that McFaul, whom the broadcaster included on its \u201cTop 10 Russophobes of 2018\u201d list and accused of \u201cplaying the drama queen,\u201d is \u201capparently convinced that Putin would be upset with the results\u201d of the U.S. congressional elections.\n\nRT listed a number of issues -- from the U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to sanctions against Russia for annexing the Crimean peninsula and allegedly employing a nerve agent in a botched attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy in Salisbury, England -- to argue it is difficult to believe Putin was saddened by the results of the U.S. vote given that, in RT\u2019s words, \u201cTrump has in many ways actually taken a tougher stance on Russia than his predecessor.\u201d\n\nRT then turned to Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, who also made RT\u2019s top ten list as a \u201cnot for profit\u201d Russophobe.\n\nRT said \u201cinvestor shark\u201d Browder had \u201crebranded himself as an anti-Putin human rights crusader\u201d after being accused of financial crimes in Russia.\n\nThe article also found fault with a Browder tweet regarding Dana Rohrabacher, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California's 48th congressional district who lost his bid for re-election on November 6.\n\n\u201cBrowder celebrated a victory in a \u2018proxy war in Orange County\u2019, because \u2018Putin minion\u2019 Dana Rohrabacher failed in his reelection bid there. It\u2019s really convenient when you can declare, with impunity, that people you disagree with are minions.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the RT claims deserve our attention. First, both Browder and McFaul are wanted for questioning by the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office as part of a criminal case against Browder, Sputnik reported.\n\nRT\u2019s charge that McFaul is a \u201cdrama queen\u201d stems from the fact that U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to consider a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow Russian authorities to question McFaul in exchange for allowing U.S. investigators to question 12 Russian nationals indicted for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The request came in a private meeting between the two presidents at the Helsinki Summit earlier this year.\n\nMcFaul tweeted that he considered that request \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nAs Bloomberg News noted at the time: \u201cAllowing the interrogation of a former American ambassador, who held diplomatic immunity while in Moscow, would be an unprecedented breach in protections traditionally provided to the nation\u2019s foreign service.\u201d\n\nRT writes about McFaul often and even has a \u201ctrend\u201d on its Website called \u201cMichael McFaul news.\u201d\n\nBrowder, born in the U.S. and now a British citizen, was once considered the largest investor in the Russian stock market and a supporter of Putin. He was first blacklisted from Russia in 2005, for being an alleged \u201cthreat to national security.\u201d His fund, Hermitage, subsequently closed its Moscow operations. Browder would later charge that a cabal of corrupt Russian officials, using materials seized during police raids, took possession of three Hermitage companies in Russia, after which the officials fraudulently claimed $230 million that Hermitage had paid in taxes. That tax refund, the largest in Russian history, was approved in under 24 hours and paid out the following day.\n\nThat investigation of those moves against Hermitage was spearheaded by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor from the Moscow-based law firm Firestone Duncan. Hermitage would go on to file 35 complaints against those implicated in the fraud case.\n\nBut in January 2008, Magnitsky himself was arrested after arriving to provide evidence to the prosecutor overseeing that case.\n\nMagnitsky would go on to spend 11 months in pre-trial detention, where he was beaten and denied medical care. He ultimately died on November 16, 2009. A 2011 report from Russia\u2019s human rights council found there was reasonable suspicion that Magnitsky had been beaten to death.\n\nBrowder\u2019s advocacy ultimately led to the Magnitsky Act, which targets Russian officials implicated in human rights and corruption cases. After extensive lobbying, that U.S. legislation was passed in June 2012.\n\nLater Russia, for the first time ever, put a dead man on trial, finding Magnitsky and Browder guilty of tax evasion in July 2013. That case was organized by many of the officials that Magnitsky had exposed.\n\nAmnesty international called the posthumous trial of Magnitsky \u201cfarcical\u201d and \u201csinister.\u201d\n\nRussia subsequently sought Browder\u2019s arrest on numerous charges. Browder told Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year that Russia\u2019s continued campaign against him, including his arrest in Spain this past May at Russia\u2019s request, showed the \u201cMagnitsky Act is working and we\u2019ve found the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Putin regime.\u201d\n\nAs Rolling Stone put it: \u201cWhat is the point of stealing a fortune from the Russian people if you can\u2019t buy homes in Miami or Manhattan and educate your kids at Ivy League schools all because of some lousy sanctions?\u201d\n\nBut to say Browder became a human rights campaigner in response to being charged with financial crimes is false. The very instrument of his campaign is named after the man who died after exposing malfeasance on the part of Russian officialdom.\n\nAdditionally, the accusations against Browder of financial crimes came after he left Russia, not before as implied in the RT article.\n\nAs for Rohrabacher, the conflict between he and Browder is much deeper than simply a difference of opinion.\n\nRohrabacher has worked against the 2012 Magnitsky Act. As noted in a complaint filed by Hermitage Capital, on May 18, 2016, when the Global Magnitsky Bill (an international version of the Magnitsky Act) was under consideration by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rohrabacher proposed \u201can amendment seeking the removal of Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s name from the title of the Bill.\u201d\n\nIn April 2016, Rohrabacher had traveled to Moscow, where he met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to discuss the Magnitsky Act, an account she herself verified in an interview with a pro-Russian Crimean new service.\n\nVeselnitskaya represented Prevezon, a Russian holding company accused by U.S. authorities of laundering money that was part of the funds embezzled from Hermitage. She also lobbied to get the Magnitsky Act repealed. Veselnitskaya worked with Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS \u2013 the Washington, DC-based opposition research firm which, ironically, produced the unverified dossier detailing President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia. Browder has charged that Fusion GPS was hired by Veselnitskaya and a U.S. law firm to conduct a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him and Sergei Magnitsky.\n\nOn June 9, 2016, Veselnitskaya, met with Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower in New York, after promising incriminating information against Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump Jr. said she used that meeting to criticize the Magnitsky Act, the New York Times reported.\n\n\u200bVeselnitskaya was quoted as saying that Trump Jr. said they could return to the issue of the Magnitsky Act if Trump won the election.\n\nAlso in April 2016, Rohrabacher met with Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American U.S. lobbyist and former counter-intelligence officer tasked with overturning the Magnitsky Act, and Andrei Nekrasov, whose film \u201cMagnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes,\u201d has been viewed as an attempt to smear Browder and Magnitsky, and to undermine the eponymous act.\n\nWhile U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce barred Rohrabacher from showing that film to Congress, Rohrabacher\u2019s office promoted a screening of the film that took place at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on June 13, 2016.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, as early as 2012, the F.B.I. and senior members of the House Intelligence Committee warned Rohrabacher that Russian intelligence was attempting to recruit him.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s spokesman, Ken Grubbs, also confirmed that the congressman and an American delegation attended a breakfast in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on August 2015 with Alexander Torshin, an influential deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank.\n\nThat breakfast was organized by Maria Butina, who has been charged in the U.S. for acting as an unregistered Russian agent. Rohrabacher called Butina\u2019s indictment \u201cridiculous and stupid,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is an attempt to undermine the president\u2019s ability to have better relationships with Russia.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher has also called Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, who recently pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct justice, an \u201cold friend\u201d.\n\nFollowing a March 2013 meeting involving Manafort and Rohrabacher, during which Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine was discussed, Rohrabacher admitted that Manafort gave him a \u201cmodest campaign contribution.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing U.S. congressman also once famously tweeted that \u201cif a majority of people legally residing in Alaska want to be part of Russia then its [sic] OK with me.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher has responded by saying his constituents do not care about his links to Russia.\n\n\"They are not concerned about Russia. They are concerned about the taxes on their home. They are concerned about illegal immigrants coming into their neighborhood and raping people,\u201d he said.\n\nSo while Browder\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cPutin minion\u201d might not be to everyone\u2019s liking, Browder\u2019s criticism of the outgoing representative goes beyond the question of Rohrbacher only being someone with whom \u201cyou disgree.\u201d\n\nIn its totality, we find RT\u2019s statement to be misleading, and portions of it to be flatly incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
