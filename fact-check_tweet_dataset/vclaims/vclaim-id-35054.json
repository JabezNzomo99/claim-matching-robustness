He\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe meme offers no citation for the quote, and we couldn\u2019t find anything to lend it credibility: We searched online and through news archives and found no such statement from Mary Trump, who died in August 2000.\n\nTrump\u2019s mother criticizing her son and forecasting his potential entrance into politics \u2014 not to mention calling such a move a \u201cdisaster\u201d \u2014 would have no doubt made the quotation newsworthy, if she had said it, at the time and again later. Before Mary Trump died, Donald Trump already had become a wealthy developer and casino owner who gained celebrity status and publicly considered running for president in the late 1990s, before deciding not to run. The supposed quote also would have likely resurfaced during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cA mothers choice words,\u201d wrote one user whose post of the meme earned about 1,000 shares. Another user remarked in a comment: \u201cShe knew full well what she gave birth to.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written about many bogus quotes relating to politics that have gained virality on social media.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
