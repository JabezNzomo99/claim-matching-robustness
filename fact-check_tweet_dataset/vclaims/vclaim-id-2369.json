In December 2015, a very similar video went viral, this time featuring Irish weather reporter Teresa Mannion:\n\nAlthough Mannion is a real reporter, she wasn\u2019t actually hit by a stop sign during a storm.\n\nMannion\u2019s original report was broadcast on \u201cRT\u00c9 News: Nine o\u2019Clock\u201d during Storm Desmond in December 2015. Her emotionally charged reporting, coupled with some very obvious, yet necessary, pieces of advice (\u201cdon\u2019t swim in the sea\u201d), made Mannion an overnight viral sensation:\n\nInternet users turned her into a meme remixed her original report, and on 6 December 2015 ,YouTube user Gerard Walsh uploaded the video above featuring Mannion getting hit by a stop sign at the end of her report.\n\nAlthough Mannion has repeatedly confirmed that the video is fake, this video continues to circulate during major storms. It took another lap around the Internet in September 2017 amidst a series of massive tropical storms and hurricanes:", "lang": "en"}
