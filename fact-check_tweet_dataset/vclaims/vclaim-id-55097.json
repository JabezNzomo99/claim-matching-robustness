The photo has been shared in a misleading context; it actually shows Muslims praying in a parking lot in Israel in May 2020 while mosques were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on July 19, 2020.\n\nThe post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English in part as: \u201cA horrendous news came from Israel. Apparently, Israel has changed the historic building of Al Amar Mosque into a wedding hall or bar since 2019.\n\n\u201cAl Amar Mosque is one of the 13th century Palestinian historic buildings located in Safed. The mosque has been under Israeli authority since 1948.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian text superimposed on the photo translates to English as: \u201cShocking, Israel turned the historic mosque into a bar.\u201d\n\nThe Al-Ahmar mosque was located in the Israeli city of Safed and was converted into a nightlife venue, according to this report by Gulf News in April 2019. The New Arab, a news website covering the Arab world, also reported on the conversion here in an April 2019 article which cited reporting from Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a UK-based Arabic newspaper.\n\nThe same photo was also published alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe photo, however, has been shared in a misleading context.\n\nReverse image and keyword searches on Google found the photo was taken by the Associated Press(AP) on May 10, 2020.\n\nAP's caption states it shows Muslim men offering pray in a parking lot in Jaffa. The photo was published on the AP Images website here.\n\nBelow is screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the AP photo (R):\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cMuslim men keep social distancing as they pray after breaking their daytime fast, at a parking lot as mosques remain closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus pandemic during the holy month of Ramadan, in the mixed Arab Jewish city of Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, Israel, Sunday, May 10, 2020.\u201d\n\nJaffa is about 170 kilometers (105.6miles) south of Safed, as seen on Google Maps here.", "lang": "en"}
