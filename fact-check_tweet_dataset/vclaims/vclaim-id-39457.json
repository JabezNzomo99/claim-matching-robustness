No, that's not true: the doctor and the study don't exist, the whole thing was made up by a \"fauxtire\" website as a joke. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by HMedia on October 18, 2018 titled \"New Scientific Study Shows 95% Of Men Who Wear Skinny Jeans Are Attracted To Men\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSan Francisco, CA - A new study lead by Dr. Felipe Maybals shows 95% of men who wear skinny jeans find other men who wear skinny jeans attractive. The study, led by Dr. Felipe Maybals from the Department of Psychology at the University of San Francisco, involved 400 men who were tested in numerous ways one which included showing them images of other men wearing skinny jeans. 380 of the men either smiled and said things like \"those are cute jeans\" when shown images of other men wearing skinny jeans.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might have confused it with a real lifestyle article (if they didn't catch the pun in the good doctor's name):\n\nBut as you can see for yourself here the faculty and staff page of the Psychology Department at San Francisco State University does not list his name.\n\nThe exact same story already appeared on Huzlers.com in 2015:\n\nHuzlersmedia is a sister site of \"fauxtire\" website Huzlers.com, using the same adverstising tags and being promoted through the same Facebook pages. It carries a disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nSo you probably shouldn't believe anything on the page...\n\nWe wrote about huzlersmedia.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 28 Year-Old Rapper MGK Was NOT Found Dead At Recording Studio Due To LIGMA Overdose\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Die From E.
