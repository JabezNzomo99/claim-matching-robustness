Here\u2019s an excerpt from one popular iteration:\n\nWhile we are arguing over the efficacy of masks, a vile group of people are trying to make pedophilia a sexual orientation and believe it is 100% ok to be age fluid. I just discovered age fluidity last night. Being age fluid means that a full grown man could \u201cidentify\u201d as an 8 year old boy\u2026OR an 8 year old girl if he is also feeling gender fluid on any particular day. So, if a 50 year old man \u201cidentifies\u201d as an 8 year old girl, and is attracted to an 8 year old boy, then these sickos feel it is natural and should be legal for him to act on those feelings.\n\nThis is inaccurate. No concerted effort exists to normalize \u201cage fluidity\u201d as a way for adults to engage in sexual relationships with children. This is transphobic hoax that was created in an attempt to smear the LGBTQ community by linking them to pedophilia.\n\nThis smear is not a novel one. In fact, there have been repeated attempts to spread the long-disproven idea that homosexuality is linked to pedophilia, despite the lack of scientific proof to support this claim.\n\nIn 2017, for example, a false rumor was circulated on social media claiming that the LGBTQ community was working to change their acronym to \u201cLGBTQP,\u201d with the \u201cP\u201d standing for \u201cpedosexual.\u201d In 2018, a troll Tumblr page created and spread a pride flag for \u201cMAPS,\u201d a term meaning \u201cMinor Attracted Persons,\u201d and falsely claimed that the group was earning currency with the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe above-displayed meme, which was created from a stock image of a \u201cfather talking with son silhouette\u201d (the white outline of a little girl was not present in the original image), started circulating on social media circa early 2017. At the time, a troll campaign was underway by bad actors who were falsely claiming to be \u201cclovergendered,\u201d an imaginary medical term that supposedly referred to a person whose mind stopped developing at a young age. These \u201cclovergendered\u201d people were now adults, but since their minds stopped developing at a young age, they claimed it was acceptable for them to be attracted to minors.\n\nOne 4chan thread from Dec. 31, 2016, informed social media users that they were creating a \u201cnew gender\u201d to troll \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d and defined \u201cclovergender\u201d as \u201ca child trapped in a man\u2019s body who is attracted to other children.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter account @clovergender, which has since been suspended, was one of the first to start sharing the \u201cAge Fluid\u201d meme shown above.\n\nThis meme was created as part of a troll campaign that aimed, in part, to spread the repeatedly debunked notion that a link exists between the LGBTQ community and pedophilia. Live Science addressed this persistent myth about homosexuals in a 2011 article, writing:\n\nAn especially pernicious myth is that most adults who sexually abuse children are gay. A number of researchers have looked at this question to determine if homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals, and the data indicate that\u2019s not the case. For example, in a 1989 study led by Kurt Freund of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Canada, scientists showed pictures of children to adult gay and straight males, and measured sexual arousal. Homosexual men reacted no more strongly to pictures of male children than heterosexual men reacted to pictures of female children. A 1994 study, led by Carole Jenny of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, surveyed 269 cases of children who were sexually molested by adults. In 82 percent of cases, the alleged offender was a heterosexual partner of a close relative of the child, the researchers reported in the journal Pediatrics. In only two out of 269 cases, the offender was identified as being gay or lesbian.\n\nIn short, no concerted effort exists by any group to normalize \u201cage fluidity\u201d in order to legally engage in sexual relationships with children. This is a transphobic piece of anti-LGBTQ propaganda that originated in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
