Please don\u2019t accept a second friendship demand from me, I have only one account.\n\nIt is true in a general sense that some scammers have engaged in Facebook cloning, a process in which the scammer creates a new Facebook account using a profile picture and similar name taken from an existing user, then sends out friend requests which appear to originate from that user. (The requests often claim the sender has just set up a new Facebook account or was locked out of his previous account.) The end purpose of such scams varies: it may be to send Facebook users links to malicious websites that propagate malware, to perpetrate phishing schemes, or to collect personal information from users that can be used for identity theft.\n\nHowever, contrary to the example texts reproduced above, Facebook cloning is not a \u201cnew scam,\u201d nor is there any evidence that its occurrence has increased greatly in recent days. (It also isn\u2019t a \u201chack,\u201d as the scam requires no special privileges nor breaking in to any Facebook accounts to accomplish.)\n\nIn general, Facebook users should always be cautious with friend requests: attempt to verify their validity before accepting them, be wary of additional requests from persons you have already befriended, and take care about what information you share with friends on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
