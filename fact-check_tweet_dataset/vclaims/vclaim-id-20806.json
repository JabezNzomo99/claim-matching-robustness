The remaining 36% said they would either oppose it, or that they didn\u2019t know.\n\nIn a survey of around 1,500 adult in Great Britain, pollster BMG asked: \u201cWould you support or oppose re-nationalising the railways so they are not run by private companies but run in the public sector?\u201d 64% of people said they would support it, and 19% said they would oppose. 17% said they didn\u2019t know. The survey was commissioned by the Independent.\n\nThey asked just under 1,500 people of various ages and voting intentions, then weighted the results to reflect the general population.\n\nThose surveyed were also asked: \u201cIn your view, has the privatisation of Britain\u2019s railways been a success or failure?\u201d 56% said it had been a failure, 16% said it had been a success, 18% said it was neither a success nor a failure, and 10% said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe poll was conducted between 5 and 8 of June, during which delays and cancellations for commuters using certain Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway routes were being widely reported. The day before, on 4 June, transport secretary Chris Grayling said passengers on these franchises were \u201cfacing totally unsatisfactory levels of service\u201d following timetable changes.\n\nThe pollster BMG said: \u201cThese findings could be the result of the perception of poor rail, but readers should be aware that a majority of respondents will not use trains regularly, and so there is a distinct possibility that the results will have been influenced by negative public discourse surrounding rail travel in the media at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe survey also asked people how frequently they\u2019d travelled by train in the last three months. Those who had used trains in that time were slightly more likely to say they supported renationalising (65%) than those who hadn\u2019t (63%).\n\nThose who hadn\u2019t used trains recently were more likely to say they weren\u2019t sure (22%) than those who had (13%). They were also more likely to say they opposed renationalising the railways (22%) than those who hadn\u2019t (15%).\n\nIn 2017, polling company YouGov polled just under 2,000 adults in Great Britain on whether they thought certain industries should be \u201cnationalised and run in the public sector, or privatised and run by private companies\u201d.\n\n60% said railway companies should be run in the public sector, 25% they should be run by the private sector, and 15% said they didn\u2019t know. In 2014, a similar poll by YouGov found that 60% said they would support renationalising the railways and 20% would oppose.\n\nIt also found similar results when polling the public in 2013.\n\nBefore 1994, in England, Scotland and Wales, the rail industry, including infrastructure, passenger and freight services were run by a single publicly owned company\u2014British Rail.\n\nWhen the railways were privatised, British Rail was divided into Railtrack, which owned and managed infrastructure and was sold to the private sector, and a residual company to run services before they were sold or franchised.\n\nRailtrack eventually went into administration and Network Rail took over in 2002.\n\nNetwork Rail runs tracks, signals, level crossings, bridges and tunnels, devises the national rail timetable, and manages 20 major railway stations. It\u2019s a public company, \u201canswerable to the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland.\u201d\n\nPassenger (and freight) trains are owned and run by train operating companies. They apply for franchises to run particular routes from the Department for Transport.\n\nYou can read more about who owns the train operating companies here. The House of Commons Library has also produced a briefing looking at ownership of the railways.", "lang": "en"}
