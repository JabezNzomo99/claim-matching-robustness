Rick Perry draws mention in GOP consultant Karl Rove\u2019s autobiography with attention focused on Perry\u2019s win for lieutenant governor in 1998 and Rove's role in his pivotal earlier switch from the Democratic to Republican party while he was a third-term member of the Texas House.\n\nRove writes: \u201cRick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner.\u201d His book, \"Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in the Fight,\" was published March 9.\n\nWe wondered if Perry\u2019s 1989 party shift and his 1990 challenge to Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower played out so simply.\n\nPerry didn\u2019t comment, but Weeks, a long-time Perry friend who\u2019s been a consultant in Perry\u2019s statewide campaigns, said Perry was seriously considering retirement, perhaps to become a lobbyist, partly because his wife, Anita, was saddled with raising their young children at the time.\n\nWeeks said Rove was part of a group of Republicans who encouraged Perry to switch parties and make the statewide run. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one,\u201d Weeks said.\n\nPublished stories also single out Weeks and Rove.\n\nPerry considered working as a lobbyist or high-level Capitol aide rather than leaving Austin entirely, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman. Instead, Weeks and others encouraged him to run for ag commissioner, the newspaper said. Perry told the Statesman: \u201cI'll give David the bulk of the credit. He came and sat down with me and said, 'You ought to run for statewide office.'\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2003 Rove profile published in Texas Monthly magazine, Rove and Weeks \u201cpersuaded Perry, an obscure Democratic legislator from Haskell who had co-chaired Al Gore's 1988 Democratic presidential primary campaign in Texas, to switch parties for the election. West Texas was swinging Republican anyway, and Perry, who was discouraged by his failure to advance in the House leadership and thinking of becoming a lobbyist, had nothing to lose.\u201d\n\nThe rest is dramatic Republican history: Perry, whose advisers included Rove, upset Hightower and has now held statewide office for nearly 20 years. Rove went on to help Bush to the White House.\n\nOthers were involved, though, in Perry making his initial leap. We rate Rove\u2019s statement as Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
