Currently, Gableman is among the conservative justices who have 5-2 control on the seven-member court.\n\nIn his first radio ad of the campaign, Screnock attacked both Dallet and Burns while also alluding to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Screnock to the bench. In the spot, released Jan. 29, 2018, Screnock introduces himself and then makes a two-part claim about Dallet and Burns:\n\nThey have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench.\n\nIs that what Burns -- who has been especially outspoken about his political views -- and Dallet have been doing?\n\nIt's worth noting that Screnock has hired GOP consultants and has received a $31,152 in-kind donation from the state Republican Party. He also released a radio ad that points out he was appointed to the bench by Walker.\n\nBut to evaluate his claim, here\u2019s a look at statements made by Burns and Dallet since they announced their candidacies and up until Screnock made his claim about them.\n\nWe found that Burns has been repeatedly critical of laws signed by Walker:\n\nBurns\u2019 campaign told us this part of Screnock\u2019s statement, as it applies to Burns, is accurate.\n\nIn contrast, we found only one Dallet statement about a Walker law. But her criticism was of the Supreme Court, not Act 10.\n\nDallet told us in a statement: \"I\u2019ve been careful to limit my criticisms to decisions the court has already made, in cases that have been completed,\" such as the Act 10 case.\n\nNow to the second part of Screnock\u2019s claim.\n\n\u2018Campaigning to implement policies from the bench\u2019\n\nBoth Burns and Dallet have made statements indicating positions they hold on issues, though Burns has been considerably more direct.\n\nBurns\u2019 campaign rejected this part of Screnock\u2019s claim.\n\nA spokeswoman pointed out that Burns has said he believes in giving great deference to the Legislature, but must closely scrutinize cases when a \"law infringes on a protection outlined in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights,\" or \"makes it so democracy cannot repair itself\" or \"infringes on a group that historically does not have political power.\"\n\nNevertheless, some of Burns\u2019 statements call for specific actions, such as being a \"champion of liberal\" values, saying his goal is to create a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, saying taxes on the wealthy should be raised and outlining his position on abortion.\n\nDallet, meanwhile, has said justices shouldn\u2019t be elected based on party ties and has criticized Burns for taking positions. For example, she told the 2017 Wisconsin Democratic Party convention:\n\nSome will tell you that the solution to partisan judges on the right is to elect more partisan judges, just from the other side. I have a different view of the world, in that I think judges really do need to be independent \u2026.I don\u2019t think the answer is just to come here and tell you that judges need to vote like partisan Democrats to counteract partisan Republican judges. If we fall into the trap of politicizing the third branch, we turn our backs on our true progressive history.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Dallet has stated which issues are important to her.\n\nSo, Dallet suggests she would be inclined to act against Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law, but otherwise has more generally stated which issues are important to her rather than indicating she would take certain actions.\n\nIn her statement to us, Dallet said voters \"want independent, nonpartisan judges who share their values, and ... I won\u2019t be afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and Scott Walker, or whomever is in power, when I\u2019m on the Supreme Court bench.\"\n\nScrenock says Burns and Dallet \"have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench.\"\n\nBurns has been explicit on both counts. Dallet hasn\u2019t criticized laws signed by Walker or campaigned to implement certain policies, although she has identified certain issues that are important to her.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
