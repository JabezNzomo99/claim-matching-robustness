No, that's not true: the rumor was started by a fake news site pretending to be BBC Radio. The fake site is likely part of a larger network of fake news sites. The news is not real, Biti is alive and there was no assasination attempt.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by a site named radio-bbc.com (not the real BBC) on August 10, 2018 titled \"Zimbabwe opposition leader survives assassination attempt - BBC\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nHarare- Senior Zimbabwean opposition figure Tendai Biti on Friday morning narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by unknown people who broke into his home. This came a day after he was released on $5,000 bail following court charges of inciting public to protest on the Zimbabwe's presidential election outcome.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut at the time of writing, this was the latest story mentioning Biti on the website of BBC News, dated August 9, 2018:\n\nWe wrote about radio-bbc.com before, here is our most recent article that mentioned the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Did NOT Say Real God Is Not A Religion, The Relationship With Your God Is What Matters\n\nBack then we remarked that the site shared several traits with another network of fake news website we wrote about earlier:\n\nThe fake BBC Radio website seems to have several themes in common with several sites of that network:\n\u2022 A domain name of the form [REAL NEWS BRAND] in combination with a dash and [tv/radio/news/television]\n\u2022 Stories aimed at various parts of the world (Philippines, USA, UK, various African countries).\n\u2022 Similar javascripts to prevent right clicking (now apparently removed)", "lang": "en"}
