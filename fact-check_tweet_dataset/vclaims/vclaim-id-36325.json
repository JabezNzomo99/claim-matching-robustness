(Translated from Hindi: 13 \u0930\u093e\u0909\u0902\u0921 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 72000 \u0935\u094b\u091f \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0917\u0947 \u091a\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964)\n\nThe first line in the viral image was originally tweeted by Amanatullah Khan on Feb 11, 2020, the day Delhi election results were declared. Khan had won the Oakhla constituency with a margin of 71,827 votes.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the viral image.\n\nThe viral image of the fake tweet reads 'Leading by 72,000 votes after 13 rounds. Today, Shaheen Bagh has won, today Islam has won. Insha Allah, soon Islam will win across India. I thank all my Muslim brothers and sisters for uniting and showing their strength. We have to maintain this unity, and history shall repeat itself.\n\nThe fake screenshot has been viral from several social media pages.\n\nAlso Read: Shariya Or Zariya: What Did Aap Mla Amanatullah Khan Say?\n\nOne look at the viral screenshot makes it clear that different fonts have been used to create the fake image. When a tweet is composed, Twitter uses one font and not a mix of several fonts. BOOM composed the same message on Twitter and compared it with the viral image. The difference in the fonts was stark.\n\nBOOM could not reach Khan for a comment. The story will be updated upon receiving a response.", "lang": "en"}
