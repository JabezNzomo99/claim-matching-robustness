None of those states has announced plans to do so.\n\nFor example, while Spain (which spent .93% of GDP on defense in 2018) previously committed to ramping up its military spending by 80% over the next seven years, the newspaper El Pais reported in late 2017 \u201cthe best possible scenario\u201d would see the country reach the 2% goal by 2028.\n\nAccording to NATO, the biggest defense spender is the U.S., which spent 3.39% of GDP on defense in 2018 (based on 2010 prices and exchange rates).\n\nIn March, President Trump requested $750 billion for national security for the 2020 fiscal year, $718.3 billion of which is for the Department of Defense (DoD). By contrast, Trump had requested $716 billion for national security, $686 billion of it for the DoD, for fiscal year 2019.\n\nThat would represent a 4.7% defense spending hike, if both are adopted by the U.S. Congress. The fiscal year military budget was approved at $716 billion for the current fiscal year. Congress is yet to act on the 2020 budget.\n\nGermany, which Trump has criticized for failing to reach the 2% target, is on the other end of the spending spectrum. Its military budget is \u20ac43 billion for 2019, up \u20ac4 billion year-on-year. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cabinet in March approved a plan that would boost that figure to \u20ac45.1 billion \u2013 1.37% of GDP \u2013 and not \u20ac140 billion, as claimed by Volha.\n\nRather than hitting the 2% spending target by 2024, Germany is aiming to spend 1.5% of GDP on defense during that benchmark year.\n\nAccording to Newsweek magazine, nearly every NATO member has increased its defense spending since Trump came to office in 2017, with 16 on track to reach the 2024 spending goal.\n\nTo be sure, military spending is up globally. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in its annual report said overall spending had risen to $1.82 trillion in 2018.\n\nDefense spending by Bulgaria, the Baltic states and the Netherlands jumped approximately 20% from 2017 to 2018, although Canada\u2019s defense spending dropped 11% during the period.\n\nNATO states (excluding the United States) are expected to increase defense spending collectively by $100 billion between 2016 and 2020.\n\nStill, while NATO states have largely continued to increase defense spending in recent years, claims that they are committed to doubling defense spending starting this year are false.", "lang": "en"}
