Almost certainly not because the only source for this \"news\" is a website with an extremely unreliable reputation that claims it got the info from an unnamed \"BBC production staff\" member.\n\nThe story appeared on YourNewsWire where an article was published on March 30, 2018 titled \"Queen Elizabeth: Imminent War Being Planned By Powerful Forces\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nQueen Elizabeth has written and recorded a speech addressing an \"imminent global war\" that she claims has been \"planned by certain forces with the necessary means to bring about fundamental global change\" and create a \"new dawn\" for humanity. During the recording the Queen says, \"One must now make the necessary preparations to say goodbye to loved ones as the nature of war in 2018 does not permit one to assume who will live and who will die. Many will die in this war,\" according to BBC production staff. \"2018 is a very special year. It will go down in history as the start of World War 3,\" the Queen warns her subjects in the recorded speech. This is the second World War 3 speech the Queen has written, after a 1983 version, written during the height of the Cold War.\n\nIt has been at least ten days since the article was published and no mainstream news sources have reported on this supposed new speech. No recording has leaked of it. It is also highly unlikely a speech to be broadcasted in an emergency would contain anything else beside general messages of encouragement and patriotism. The fact that the supposedly leaked speech contains references to where a conflict would take place make it extremely unlikely to be real.\n\nAnd as the saying goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and the article is totally lacking in that department. No source is mentioned except an unnamed BBC production staff member, no date or place for the supposed recording was provided and no supporting documents or recordings were provided.\n\nIn addition YourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: CDC Doctor Found Floating In River Did NOT Expose Flu Shot\n\u2022 Reporter Baxter Dimitri Kidnapped By Russian Deep State Aliens On Orders From Pope Francis\n\u2022 Fake News: Russia And China Did NOT Roll Out 100% Gold-Backed Currency\n\u2022 Fake News: NOT Busted, Soros Did NOT Pay March For Our Lives Protestors $300 Each\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Forgive 4,444 Pedophile Priests In Australia", "lang": "en"}
