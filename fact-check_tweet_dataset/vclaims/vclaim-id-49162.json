However, a social media post is going viral with the claim that one can catch fire due to the sanitiser as it contains high amount of alcohol.\n\nThe viral Facebook post shows a pair of hands with the claim, \"The lady here applied sanitizer on her arms and went to the kitchen to cook. The moment she turned on the stove, her hands caught fire due to the alcohol contained in the sanitizer.\"\n\nThis post is also viral on WhatsApp.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral post is a hoax. The alcohol in the hand sanitiser evaporates completely once rubbed over the hands and leaves nothing to catch fire.\n\nWe found that the viral photograph is of a burn victim whose forearm was harvested for skin grafts. One can see the sharp edges on her forearm which can never be the result of an actual burn. Skin grafting is a surgical procedure that involves removing the skin from one part of the body and transplanting it to another.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral image is not of a woman whose hands caught fire while she was putting on the stove after applying hand sanitiser. In fact, alcohol-based hand sanitisers do not catch fire as the alcohol evaporates completely once applied on the hands.\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: Image of Covid-19 testing kit passed off as vaccine on social media\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: No, Putin has not unleashed lions on Russian streets to enforce Corona lockdown", "lang": "en"}
