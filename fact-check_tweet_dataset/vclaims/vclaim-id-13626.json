But Butina\u2019s solitary confinement does raise troubling questions.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 30, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13626", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-butina-us-passport-nra-russiagate/29631014.html", "vclaim": "Update: On Thursday, December 13, 2018, Maria Butina appeared before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she pleaded guilty to conspiracy and acting under the direction of the Russian government.\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Butina faces the maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation, waived her right of appeal.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Tanya Chutkan, said that upon completion of the sentence, Butina will be denied the possibility of obtaining U.S. citizenship or a U.S. visa. That runs contrary to Russian journalist Vadim Gorshenin\u2019s claim that Butina was set to receive U.S. citizenship \u201cafter months of torture in an American prison.\u201d\n\nHer lawyers had previously argued that \"prolonged depravation of human contact and interaction is starting to have a profound psychological impact\u201d on their client. But when asked, in the courtroom, if she was of sound mind to make the plea, Butina said that she was not suffering from mental illness or undue psychological stress. Accordingly, we have changed the verdict of the fact check from \"unclear\" to \"false.\"\n\nThe original wording of the fact check:\n\nAs the Russian Foreign Ministry uses her photograph for its profile picture on social media accounts, Maria Butina is set to be granted U.S. citizenship, \u201cshame for Fatherland\u201d \u2013 a Russian journalist wrote in his channel in the Telegram messenger on November 29. The post instantly became viral, shared by the most influential Telegram channels. We find no evidence to back this up.\n\nIn July, Maria Butina was arrested and charged with conspiracy and working as an undeclared foreign agent of the Russian government. Prosecutors allege she sought to cultivate ties with U.S. political groups and individuals -- primarily conservatives -- on behalf of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank and a former Russian senator with alleged ties to the Russian mafia.\n\nTorshin and Butina worked to establish a relationship between the National Rifle Association and a Russian analog which Butina set up in 2011 \u2013 \u201cRight to Bear Arms.\u201d That relationship was allegedly used as the springboard to establish a \u201cbackchannel\u201d that \u201ccould be used by the Russian Federation to penetrate the U.S. national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nTorshin was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April along with other Russian businessmen and politicians for \u201cadvancing Russia\u2019s malign activities.\u201d\n\nButina\u2019s attorneys say their client was \u201cnothing more than a student with an interest in U.S. politics who hoped to improve bilateral relations.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, November 28, a federal judge rejected Butina\u2019s request that she be removed from solitary confinement and moved to general population at a detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, where she is being housed.\n\nIn a filling submitted by her lawyers on Tuesday, November 27, Butina\u2019s lawyer said \u201cshe has now been in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day for 6 consecutive days with no prospective release date.\u201d They added that if the court fails to intervene, \u201cshe will continue to be held in this manner and ultimately require the attention of mental health professionals.\u201d\n\nHer lawyers said she had briefly been placed in general population after spending over two months in solitary confinement, only to be returned to solitary confinement on November 21 after allegedly providing another inmate her lawyer\u2019s cell phone number.\n\nOn Thursday, November 29, Russia\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova requested that Butina\u2019s \u201charsh\u201d conditions be eased.\n\nAlso on November 29, Butina\u2019s father Valery told the Tass news agency he expects his daughter to make a pretrial deal with the prosecution. Press accounts earlier in the month indicated a similar outcome.\n\nThe same day, Russian journalist Vadim Gorshenin wrote in a post on Telegram that it was the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s \u201cshame\u201d that it was not \u201cprepared for real actions to protect the rights of Russian citizens.\u201d\n\nStating \u201cit is not clear what\u2019 Butina was arrested for, Gorshenin said it would be possible to \u201carrest more than a dozen American citizens\u201d in Moscow on the same grounds given for Butina\u2019s arrest.\n\nHe concluded that Butina \u201cwill be granted American citizenship\u201d after months of torture in an American prison, adding that he is \u201cashamed for my Fatherland.\u201d\n\nThere is a basis for saying Butina\u2019s extended time in solitary does constitute torture.\n\nIn 2013, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Juan M\u00e9ndez, urged that solitary confinement, if imposed at all, is only used \u201cin exceptional circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Mendez said solitary confinement should be banned as \u201ca punishment or extortion technique.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pretrial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that conclusion is not universal, as some scholarly studies have concluded otherwise. For example, a study by University of British Columbia scholars found that there are no \u201cdramatic differences\u201d between convicts who have experienced solitary confinement versus those who haven\u2019t. The authors studied actual convicts, whose experiences they found \u201cdo not support the view that [solitary confinement] in prisons is universally damaging, aversive, or intolerable.\u201d\n\nGorshenin\u2019s claim of Butina being granted U.S. citizenship appears to be baseless, possibly confusing her case with those of a few spies who have secured citizenship. Butina is not specifically accused of spying, but instead acting as an undeclared foreign agent.\n\nFor argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s look at spies and citizenship. As a general rule, individuals caught spying under diplomatic cover are arrested and then expelled. Spies caught operating without diplomatic cover are open to prosecution and incarceration, although they can be exchanged in spy swaps, as was the case in the so-called \u201cIllegals Program\u201d.\n\nThe history of when and how former Russian agents and defectors have secured U.S. citizenship is complicated, as demonstrated by the case of Janosh and Victorya Neumann, in particular. The couple offered information to the CIA, but in complicated set of circumstances ended up hiring a lawyer in order to win \u201cimmigration status\u201d in the U.S.\n\nEven if Butina were to reach a plea agreement, that would not be equivalent with working to help a U.S spy agency. And no federal prosecutor or any other U.S. official has suggested Butina will be granted U.S. citizenship, either as a part of a yet-to-be-finalized plea deal or for any other reason. Nor has the government said the opposite\n\nPolygraph.info, therefore, finds Gorshenin\u2019s claim on citizenship to be unclear, though his claim of \u201ctorture\u201d in reference to the solitary confinement is a subject of the ongoing debate.", "lang": "en"}
