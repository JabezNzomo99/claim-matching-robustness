{"title": "The government\u2019s education funding figures need context", "subtitle": "Figures given by the Department for Education about the amount of weekly funding for schools do not give the full picture.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-49334", "url": "https://fullfact.org/education/school-funding-figures-context/", "vclaim": "In a press release, the Department for Education (DfE) said an extra \u00a314.4 billion in funding had been announced for schools over three years, translating to \u00a3135 million a week. The \u00a3135 million a week is the increase by the third year (2022/23) and not an immediate increase. Neither figure accounts for the change in prices (inflation) over that time. The UK Statistics Authority has told the DfE to provide \u201cappropriate context\u201d on statements about school funding before.\n\nDfE has made this claim before\n\nAt the end of August 2019, the government announced more than \u00a314 billion in funding for schools in England over three years. As we wrote at the time, this is a cumulative figure. It does not mean the budget will increase by \u00a314 billion a year. The announcement set out that, compared to 2019/20, spending would be \u00a32.6 billion higher in 2020/21, \u00a34.8 billion higher the year after, and \u00a37.1 billion higher in 2022/23. This is without taking inflation into account.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, adding several years of spending together is simply not the normal way politicians talk about spending increases. They most commonly refer to spending on a per-year basis, or talking about the difference between the first and final year of spending. It\u2019s not factually wrong to add up multiple years of spending\u2014but it could be misleading.\n\nIn October, commenting on the DfE\u2019s use of the \u00a314 billion figure, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) said it was \u201cvital that data and information on school funding published by the DfE are presented clearly and not open to misinterpretation\u201d.\n\nThe per week figure is in cash terms and not for all three years\n\nFull Fact asked the DfE how it calculated the figure of \u00a3135 million a week. We were told this figure was for 2022/23\u2014not all three years\u2014and was calculated by dividing \u00a37.1 billion by 52 (for each week in the year), which gives approximately \u00a3136.5 million. It is not clear in the press release that the reference to \u00a3135 million a week was not for all three years, and the release makes no mention of the figure of \u00a37.1 billion.\n\nThe other issue with this figure is that \u00a37.1 billion does not account for inflation (the change in how much things cost over time). In 2019, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this \u00a37 billion increase in spending by 2022/23 is actually \u00a34.3 billion once inflation is accounted for. Using the same calculation as the DfE, this would equate to \u00a382.7 million a week in 2022/23.", "lang": "en"}
