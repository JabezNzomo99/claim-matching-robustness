But the lie slowly unraveled over the course of 2018, earning the president\u2019s lawyer a jail term and imperiling the presidency. At first, Trump\u2019s aides said he had no knowledge of the payments. Michael Cohen, his attorney, then said he had used his own funds to make the payoffs, but Trump still insisted he knew nothing about it. Then the White House said Trump had been aware of \u201cthe general arrangement.\u201d Trump tweeted that it was related to a monthly retainer, not the campaign. But that was false; Cohen had sought and received reimbursement from the Trump Organization. Cohen in court eventually admitted that the payments were intended to aid Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nTrump says many things that are factually incorrect, but he sometimes says things that are mind-blowingly false. Despite having access to more information than anyone on Earth, he persists in making claims with literally no foundation. He has repeatedly claimed that U.S. Steel announced it is building new plants \u2014 anywhere from six to nine \u2014 but that\u2019s not true. He said that as president, Barack Obama, gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear-deal negotiations, but that\u2019s not true. Over and over, Trump claimed that the Uzbek-born man who in 2017 was accused of killing eight people with a pickup truck in New York brought two dozen relatives to the United States through \u201cchain migration.\u201d The real number is zero. Finally, Trump has repeatedly attacked Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) over his Vietnam record, saying Blumenthal claimed to have fought in Danang (false) and that Blumenthal for 15 years described himself as a \u201cwar hero\u201d (false). Blumenthal was in the Marine Corps Reserve, and before he became senator said or implied at some points that he had gone to war in Vietnam. But he never said he was in a battle, was a war hero or had near-death experiences.\n\nTrump\u2019s fixation on the U.S.-Mexico border has dominated the news cycle this year and certainly added to his tally of false claims. Trump and his aides claimed they did not have a family separation policy, when in fact they did. They said U.S. laws or court rulings forced them to separate families that crossed the border illegally, but that was not true. When a caravan of more than 5,000 migrants from Central America started making its way to the border, another series of dubious claims was spawned, including that people of Middle Eastern descent were involved. The president also falsely claimed that he had started building his border wall, but Congress has not appropriated the necessary funds.\n\nThroughout the special counsel\u2019s investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the president has sought to deflect attention by asserting that the Democrats were the ones colluding with Russia. Many of his GOP allies have made the same claim. But Trump has little evidence to make his case, which largely rests on the fact that the firm hired by Democrats to examine Trump\u2019s Russia ties, Fusion GPS, at the same time was working to defend a Russian company in U.S. court. In fact, U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russian entities hacked Democratic leaders' email accounts during the campaign, and the special counsel has indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers.\n\nDuring the confirmation hearings on Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) took aim at comments he made regarding \u201cabortion-inducing drugs\u201d while discussing a case brought by an antiabortion religious group challenging Obamacare rules on providing employees health coverage for contraception. In a highly misleading tweet, she included a video that snipped out a key part of his statement. But a plain reading of Kavanaugh\u2019s answer during the hearings shows that it was broadly consistent with his written opinion. From the context, it is clear he was quoting the views of the plaintiffs rather than offering a personal view \u2014 a point he made when later answering questions submitted for the record.\n\nMore than a dozen states and cities and a range of groups have sued to block the Trump administration from adding a question about a person\u2019s citizenship to the 2020 Census. They say it\u2019s a ruse by the Trump administration to weaken the political power of heavily Democratic states with large immigrant populations. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in sworn testimony before Congress, said that the Justice Department initiated the request to add a citizenship question to beef up enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. But emails released as part of the court challenge show that Ross worked behind the scenes to add the citizenship question months before the Justice Department sent a formal request. In other words, Justice was taking its cues from Ross all along \u2014 the opposite of what he told Congress.\n\nJust before the midterm elections, Trump promoted a campaign ad on border security based entirely on a false narrative \u2014 that Democrats were responsible for allowing a police-killer into the United States. The reality is that Luis Bracamontes sneaked over the border under both a Democrat (Bill Clinton) and a Republican (George W. Bush) and was deported under both presidents. He returned again when a Republican (Bush) was president. Then he remained in the country through Barack Obama\u2019s term \u2014 but it was a Republican local official who dropped the pending case. Pinning the blame on any political party for Bracamontes\u2019s killings is a fool\u2019s game. (We\u2019ve documented that there is no evidence that undocumented immigrants commit crime at a higher rate than U.S. citizens; in fact, immigrants in general have lower rates of crime.)\n\nIn an 11th-hour attack ad, Republican senatorial hopeful Bob Hugin suggested there was \u201cshocking\u201d FBI evidence that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) had slept with underage sex workers. But the FBI affidavit cited in the ad simply listed allegations from a shadowy tipster that the FBI said it could not confirm. The FBI added that no minors could be identified. Indeed, The Washington Post had reported that the CIA and FBI had received intelligence that Cuba fabricated the tipster claims as part of a cloak-and-dagger operation to tar Menendez, a political foe. The Justice Department charged Menendez with other alleged crimes \u2014 for which he was not convicted \u2014 but never raised the prostitution allegations. The ad did not pay off for Hugin, who was swamped by Menendez.\n\nIn a crude and incendiary attack ad, senatorial hopeful Don Blankenship attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d during the Republican primary in West Virginia. What was his evidence? Actually, he had none. He could point only to the fact that authorities in Colombia in 2014 had found 40 packages of cocaine, or about 90 pounds, aboard the Ping May, a bulk carrier with 91,385 tons of cargo capacity owned by New York shipping company Foremost Group. No one was ever charged. What\u2019s the connection to McConnell? He is married to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whose family owns Foremost. That barely qualifies as six degrees of separation. Blankenship finished a distant third in the primary but did bequeath to McConnell a memorable nickname.\n\nDuring the midterm election campaign, at least seven Republican lawmakers under fire for their votes to repeal Obamacare tried to mislead voters about our fact checks. Somewhere, somehow, a memo must have gone out to Republicans who voted for the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the GOP bill to repeal and replace Obamacare: If you are attacked for undermining protections for people with existing health problems, jab back by saying the claim got Four Pinocchios from The Washington Post. But that was not true. In the end, the gambit did not work, as five of the seven lost their reelection bids", "lang": "en"}
