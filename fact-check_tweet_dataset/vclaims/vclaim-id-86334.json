On March 3, he tweeted a video with the caption, \u201cWe can\u2019t sit by and lose this country to Donald Trump. Today, we take it back \u2014 together.\u201d However, while the caption is standard political rhetoric, the attached video included two clips of the president that meet the Fact Checker\u2019s standards for manipulated video. Our guide includes three broad categories: Some video is taken out of context; other content is deceptively edited; or, in the worst instances, it is deliberately altered.\n\nAt the 10-second mark, the camera shows a tight shot of the president saying \u201ccoronavirus\u201d and then cuts to a wide shot where he says, \u201cthis is their new hoax.\u201d Both clips are from Trump\u2019s Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., but he never said \u201ccoronavirus, this is their new hoax.\u201d Rather, Biden\u2019s ad clipped a large part of Trump\u2019s speech to make it seem as though he had. Here\u2019s the president\u2019s full quote (emphasis added to show the omission):\n\n\u201cNow the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019, \u2018Oh, nothing, nothing.\u2019 They have no clue, they don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa, they can\u2019t even count. No, they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u2019 That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they\u2019ve been doing it since he got in. It\u2019s all turning, they lost. It\u2019s all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that\u2019s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\u201d\n\nMoreover, at a news conference Feb. 29, the day after the rally and three days before Biden\u2019s ad was released, Trump was asked about the \u201choax\u201d comment. He clarified, \u201c \u2018Hoax\u2019 referring to the action that [Democrats] take to try and pin this on somebody, because we\u2019ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not -- I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here [the virus]; I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax. \u2026 But the way they refer to it -- because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don\u2019t like it when they are criticizing these people. And that\u2019s the hoax. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nGranted, Trump and members of his administration have played down the spread of the virus and falsely touted the strength of their response, as our numerous fact checks have pointed out. But that does not excuse this kind of video manipulation. This is a clear example of deceptive editing, specifically what we label \u201comission,\u201d according to our guide. It edits out large portions of a video but still presents it as a complete narrative. This effectively skews reality and leaves the viewer to wonder what or who related to coronavirus is, in fact, a hoax?\n\nThe second clip and the audio appear to be from Trump\u2019s June 2015 announcement that he would, in fact, run for president. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump repeated the phrase \u201cthe American Dream is dead.\u201d However, each time \u2014 including during his announcement \u2014 the then-candidate followed that line with some variation of: \u201cIf I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\u201d\n\nThis is an example of \u201cMissing Context\u201d: The video is unaltered, but the way it is presented to the viewer lacks or misstates the context in which events occurred. In this specific case, this is an example of what we labeled as \u201cisolation\u201d \u2014 a brief clip from a longer video to create a false narrative that does not reflect the event as it occurred.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, defended the ad. \u201cDonald Trump is the most dishonest president in American history and one of the least credible human beings in the world,\" Bates said. \"We don\u2019t trust his next-day cleanup attempt, and he has made many comments in that same vein. And the claim that the American Dream was \u2018dead\u2019 in the final year of the Obama administration -- during the longest streak of job growth in American history -- is categorically untrue and another reminder of Donald Trump\u2019s deep cynicism.\u201d\n\nWhile the first, \u201ccoronavirus, this is their new hoax,\u201d is a clear example of omission, we were torn between Three and Four Pinocchios. On one hand, the administration continues to promote falsehoods about the virus and vilify Democrats for criticizing its response. However, the video doesn\u2019t point that out or explain what is wrong with this characterization. Rather, it just puts the words \u201ccoronavirus and \u201choax\u201d close together, leaving the viewer to assume Trump meant that the novel coronavirus itself was a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
