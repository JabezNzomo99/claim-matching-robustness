The article based its claim on petitions for compensation due to alleged vaccine injury, taken from a December 2018 report by the United States Department of Justice.\n\nThe article is misleading the reader in several ways. Firstly, the article does not make it clear to the reader that petitioners do not need to prove that their injuries were caused by vaccination; a petition can be made even if an individual is not certain that the injury was caused by a vaccine. The list in the report is therefore not authoritative evidence of the flu vaccine\u2019s harms.\n\nSecondly, it solicits comments about the flu vaccine\u2019s purported harmful effects from an individual with previous medical training, whose medical license was revoked by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for \u201cadministering to the children a treatment protocol that has a known substantial risk of serious harm and which is not consistent with evidence-based medicine\u201d. Moreover, a vaccine court found the individual to be \u201ca professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience\u201d.\n\nThe article does not cite any peer-reviewed scientific evidence that shows a causative relationship between the flu vaccine and the diseases listed. In summary, its claim about the flu vaccine\u2019s harms is baseless.\n\nThe flu vaccine, like all medical interventions, comes with side effects. However, contrary to the claim made in the article, most of these side effects are actually mild, comprising of a slight fever, muscle aches and soreness at the injection site. These side effects are well-documented by health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Service.\n\nIt is true that severe allergic reactions (also called anaphylaxis) to components of the flu vaccine, particularly egg protein, can and do occur, but these can be managed safely in the medical setting and are no different from the severe allergic reactions that some people have towards certain foods, like eggs and peanuts (curiously enough, no one has ever organized protests or resistance against these foods).\n\nThere is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence showing a causative association between the flu vaccine with most of the diseases in the list such as multiple sclerosis and transverse myelitis, much less death \u2013 with the exception of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). The concern appears to be centered on a particular strain of flu virus \u2013 and not all flu virus strains \u2013 used in vaccines[1,2,3,4]. This concern has also been addressed in a study that CDC scientists also participated in[2], despite the article\u2019s claims of a governmental cover-up. It is also interesting to note that flu infection itself has been found to carry a higher risk for GBS than the flu vaccine[5], and may suggest that flu vaccination is more likely to prevent than cause GBS.\n\nThe article states \u201chow ridiculous it is to spend billions of dollars on a vaccine that might, at its best, save about 50 lives a year\u201d, without citing any supporting evidence. This statement is incorrect. In fact, the flu vaccine has been estimated to save more than 40,000 lives over a 9-year period in the US[6] and diminish the risk of influenza-associated mortality for at-risk populations such as children and heart failure patients[7,8].\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Vellozzi et al.
