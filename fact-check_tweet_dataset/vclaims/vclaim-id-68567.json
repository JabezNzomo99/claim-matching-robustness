WHERE IS ERIC BRAVERMAN?!\"\n\nA photo of Braverman is placed in the center next to the word \"MISSING.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe found no evidence that Braverman is missing or hiding out from the Clintons. The rumor has been previously debunked by fact-checkers, and Braverman currently serves as the chief executive of Schmidt Futures, a California-based charity. A reverse-image search on TinEye.com indicates even the meme itself is going on two years old.\n\nWhile Braverman hadn\u2019t posted on social media for a while, he took to Twitter on Jan. 19, 2017, to announce he had accepted a position with the Schmidt Family Foundation.\n\nHe is still listed on the organization\u2019s website as the chief executive of Schmidt Futures, the foundation\u2019s philanthropic arm.\n\nIn one story, the only evidence offered was Braverman not responding to press inquiries and his lack of social media use. That does not indicate a person is missing. We found no police reports listing Braverman as a \"missing person\" and no reputable media reports detailing his disappearance.\n\nEric Braverman is an attorney and businessman who headed the Clinton Foundation from 2013 to 2015 when he resigned from the post.\n\nThe rumor of his disappearance has been shared by social media users since at least October 2016.\n\nThat timing suggests it likely evolved out of the John Podesta emails that WikiLeaks dumped in October and November 2016. In one of the emails, Podesta (who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman) suggests that Braverman could be a journalist\u2019s unnamed source. But in the same email thread he also throws out other names.\n\nAround the same time, in the fall of 2016, conspiracy websites started another false rumor, saying that Braverman applied for asylum in Russia after his name was revealed in the WikiLeaks dump. That claim has also been discredited.\n\nA meme says that Braverman has been \"missing for 70+ days\" after being rumored to be the source of the quote \"follow the money and find the real HRC scandal.\"\n\nWe could find no evidence that Braverman ever was or is missing, and he is currently listed as the chief executive of a California-based charity.\n\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
