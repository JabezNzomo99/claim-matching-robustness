In 2014/15, 46% of pupils in London known to be eligible for free school meals got between a C and an A* in five or more GCSE subjects, including maths and English.\n\nIn Kent, it was 27%.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many grammar schools in London, whereas Kent is one of the few areas of the country to have a selective system.\n\nBut London outperforms the rest of England as a whole when it comes to the exam results of free school meals pupils\u2014not just selective Kent. Across English regions outside of London, 30% get 5 good GCSEs, not much higher than Kent.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t take away from the argument as a whole. In Kent and neighbouring Medway, \u201cpoorer children lag further behind, richer children move further ahead\u201d than both London and the rest of England, as research by Chris Cook for the BBC has shown.\n\nChildren eligible for free school meals are far less likely to get into grammar schools in the first place.", "lang": "en"}
