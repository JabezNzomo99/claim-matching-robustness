The story originated on Huzlers.com under the title \"Chinese Engineer Contracts STD After Having Sex With Sex Robot Prototype\" (archived here) and it opened:\n\nCHINA - A Chinese engineer has reportedly contracted an STD after having sexual intercourse with a sex robot prototype. Phuck Yu Mang, pronounced \"f*ck you mang\", has reportedly tested positive for HIV after he had sex with a sex robot prototype. According to reports, Phuck is a sex robot engineer for a Chinese local company, and would regularly have sex with the sex robot prototypes to ensure they will be safe for human use.\n\nThe first hint the story is fake is that the name \"Phuck Yu Mang\" sounds exactly like \"F*ck you, man!\". The second hint is that the photo of the supposed \"Chinese engineer\" actually shows Dr. Ma De, a Chinese scientist working on advanced computer chips. And the \"sex robots\" in the background are just sex dolls from RealDoll (which is an American company), not prototypes from a 'Chinese local company'.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nSo don't get screwed by this fake story...", "lang": "en"}
