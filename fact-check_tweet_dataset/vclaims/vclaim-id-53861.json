We have contacted Sony, but are yet to receive a response.\n\nThe post claims that the shutdown began on 23 March and will last \u201cuntil the foreseeable future\u201d. To check if this was true, staff at Full Fact logged onto online games using both consoles on 24 March, and can confirm that they were able to gain access during school hours.\n\nThere have been reports that an increase in the number of players since the new coronavirus outbreak have led to disruptions in online gaming.", "lang": "en"}
