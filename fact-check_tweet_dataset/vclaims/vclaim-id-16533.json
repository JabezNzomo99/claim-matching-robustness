Is Mamata Banerjee not there at all?\" (Translated from Bengali - \u0995\u09bf \u09b9\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 \u09a7\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09b7\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 ??? \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be \u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u099c\u09bf \u0995\u09bf \u09a8\u09c7\u0987???)\n\nIn the image, a visibly scared and badly injured woman can be seen bound to a tractor as an angry mob tries to tonsure her head.\n\nThe archived link of the post can be viewed here. BOOM has decided not to include the same.\n\nA reverse image search on the photos showed that the incident is nearly two years old and does not have any communal angle.\n\nThe images are of Otera Bibi, a middle-aged woman who was lynched on suspicion of being a child kidnapper. Otera Bibi, a mentally challenged woman was stripped, heckled, tonsured and beaten to death in West Bengal's Raghunathganj by a mob in June 2017, after rumours of child kidnappers entering the state from Jharkhand started doing the rounds in the area.\n\nThe depraved crime was widely reported at the time. News reports on the lynching can be accessed here, here, and here.\n\nBelow is an extract from an article by the Hindustan Times.\n\n\"The incident occurred around 3 am on Tuesday, when a villager noticed Otera entering the house of one Dilip Ghosh with something in her hand. Word spread that the woman had come bearing chloroform to abduct Khushi, Ghosh\u2019s minor daughter. A mob rushed into the house and caught her \u201cred-handed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe villagers started beating the woman mercilessly. She was trying to say something, but we couldn\u2019t understand it. In fact, her incoherent speech fuelled suspicions that she was a trafficker from Bangladesh. Some youngsters ripped off the woman\u2019s clothes and partly tonsured her. Then they tied her to a tractor and beat her for three hours,\u201d a local resident told HT on the condition of anonymity.\" -\n\nRumours of child kidnappers particularly on WhatsApp have had brutal real world consequences in India since 2017. In all cases, the victims were attacked on mere suspicion with police finding no evidence of the victims being child kidnappers.", "lang": "en"}
