But we are going to make an exception in this case, in part because this is an interesting case brought to our attention by our old colleague Michael Dobbs, who first started The Fact Checker in 2007.\n\nThe issue is this: When new primary source documents demonstrate that a historical myth has been proved incorrect, shouldn\u2019t people who repeat the discredited myth admit their error? An even odder element here is that the Times has previously publicized the fact that the myth was wrong, citing this very research, and yet it refuses to correct the error in Friedman\u2019s column.\n\nOf course, President John F. Kennedy and his aides did not know that on the morning of Oct. 24 as they awaited a potential clash. An aircraft carrier group led by the USS Essex had orders to intercept the Kimovsk and her submarine escort. Kennedy nervously canceled the intercept, issuing an order to the Essex: \u201cSecret. From Highest Authority. Do Not Stop And Board. Keep Under Surveillance.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Dobbs concluded, Kimovsk was nearly 800 miles away from the Essex, not \u201cjust a few miles.\u201d This was all eventually figured out by U.S. intelligence analysts \u2014 here are the CIA records obtained by Dobbs \u2014 but the White House failed to correct the historical record. After all, the eyeball to eyeball imagery was simply too good for political memoirs.\n\n\u201cKennedy was certainly bracing for an \u2018eyeball to eyeball\u2019 moment, but it never happened,\u201d Dobbs wrote. \u201cThere is now plenty of evidence that Kennedy \u2014 like Khrushchev \u2014 was a lot less steely-eyed than depicted in the initial accounts of the crisis, which were virtually dictated by the White House. Tape-recorded transcripts of White House debates and notes from participants show that Kennedy was prepared to make significant concessions, including a public trade of Soviet missiles in Cuba for American missiles in Turkey and possibly the surrender of the United States naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\u201d\n\nSewell Chan, deputy editor of Op-Ed/Sunday Review, even cited Caro\u2019s book as example of the fact that the historical debate is not settled. \u201cYour conclusion that the ships never got that close remains very interesting, but the distance from the blockade line hardly seems like a matter of settled historical fact, notwithstanding your commendable research,\u201d Chan wrote to Dobbs. \u201cEven if it were settled fact, frankly, Tom\u2019s point was an anecdote surrounding Dean Rusk, not an account of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\u201d\n\nAs we noted, Caro was not relying on primary documents for this fact. Chan willfully ignores the actual records of the CIA analysts tracking the ships \u2014 as well as Khrushchev\u2019s order to turn around the ships the day before. None of that is in dispute, and it easily trumps official White House propaganda from a half-century ago (which simply asserted the ships were a few miles apart without providing documentation to back up that claim). Since 2008, other historians, such as David Coleman of the University of Virginia, have cited the same CIA data about the Kimovsk and other Soviet ships when writing about the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nAs my editors explained to Michael Dobbs, I used the Dean Rusk quote \u2014 \u201cthe other fellow just blinked\u201d \u2014 in the context in which Dean Rusk made it \u2014 that he believed Soviet naval vessels had gotten very near our blockade in 1962 and turned around, averting a crisis. My column was not about either Rusk or the precise longitude and latitude of the Soviet ships per se. I was writing about another moment in history when our statesmen thought the leader in the Kremlin blinked. Obviously historians have different views on this, since Robert Caro, as Dobbs notes, used the same story in the 2012 edition of his giant biography of Lyndon Johnson. Michael disputes that and we printed his essay saying so. I have not done a survey of the historical literature to know whether all historians now agree on that fact. It was not what I was writing about. I was writing about what Rusk said and believed when he said it.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment at the height of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 when Soviet ships approached to within just a few miles of a U.S. naval blockade and then, at the last minute, turned back \u2014 prompting then-Secretary of State Dean Rusk to utter one of the most famous lines from the Cold War: \u2018We\u2019re eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe often knock politicians for refusing to admit error. But journalists appear equally reluctant to admit a mistake. It would not take much to correct the record, and one would think that historical accuracy would be important at a newspaper that prides itself on being the newspaper of record. Friedman, as a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for writing on foreign affairs, should be equally dedicated to making certain that readers know ground historical truth.", "lang": "en"}
