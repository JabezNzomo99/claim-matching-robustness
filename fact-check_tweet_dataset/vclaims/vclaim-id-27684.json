It did not consider religious freedom to be in \"imminent peril\" but it did accept that the protection of people's rights to their religious beliefs required \"constant vigilance\".\n\nThe Morrison Government promised to introduce a bill into Parliament before the end of the year and commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission to review the framework of religious exemptions in anti-discrimination laws across Australia.\n\nIn the meantime, the Government has released its draft legislation.\n\nAustralia's patchwork of protection exists on a number of levels.\n\nAt the international level, Australia has a legal obligation to protect the right to religious freedom under a treaty known as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nDomestically, there are a variety of laws that protect religious freedom.\n\nThe Australian constitution provides some protection; state and territory laws address religious discrimination in a variety of ways and to differing extents.\n\nFurther to this, federal law also affords protection through anti-discrimination laws, human rights legislation and fair work legislation.\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n\nAustralia is a party to seven international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nArticle 18 of this treaty states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; that no one should be subjected to coercion that would prevent them from having this freedom; and that only laws that are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or the morals or fundamental rights and freedoms of others, can limit this freedom.\n\nAustralia encourages consideration of this right through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights which scrutinises all bills, acts and legislative instruments for compatibility with human rights, as outlined by all seven treaties.\n\nThe Australian constitution protects religious freedom to some extent.\n\nSection 116 of the constitution prohibits the Commonwealth from:\n\u2022 Prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\n\u2022 Requiring a religious test as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\n\nBut according to George Williams, a constitutional law expert at the University of New South Wales, these prohibitions only apply to the Commonwealth, not the states and territories.\n\nIndeed, section 116 does not prevent any state enacting a law that infringes on religious freedom, he told Fact Check.\n\nProhibitions on religious discrimination are inconsistent across Australia.\n\nLegislation that prohibits discrimination specifically on the basis of religion exists in all states and territories, except NSW and SA.\n\nIn all jurisdictions, other than NSW and SA, the attribute that is specifically protected is religious belief, religious activity or religious conviction.\n\nNSW prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, including \"ethno-religious origin\", while South Australia prohibits discrimination based on \"religious appearance or dress\".\n\nThe Religious Freedom Review last year recommended that New South Wales and South Australia should amend their anti-discrimination laws to make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a person's \"religious belief or activity\".\n\nIt's important to note that legislation in the states and territories contains exemptions for religious bodies, that are similar to those that apply to discrimination laws at the federal level.\n\nIn addition, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland and the ACT also have laws prohibiting public religious vilification (with some exceptions) while New South Wales prohibits vilification on the grounds of ethno-religious origin.\n\nHere is a list of anti-discrimination legislation in each state and territory:\n\nIn the employment context, section 351 of the Fair Work Act 2009, prohibits an employer from taking \"adverse action\" against an employee or prospective employee on the basis of religion.\n\nSo, for example, an employer cannot sack someone on the basis of their religion.\n\nMelbourne Law School's Beth Gaze, an expert in equality and discrimination, told Fact Check the act also provides that awards and enterprise agreements cannot contain discriminatory terms.\n\nHowever, the adverse action prohibition only applies if the conduct is also prohibited under anti-discrimination law in the jurisdiction where the conduct happened, she said.\n\nBecause of the lack of specific anti-discrimination legislation in NSW and SA, it would not be possible to bring a claim of \"adverse action\" on the basis of religion in these states, she said.\n\nThere are four federal anti-discrimination acts:\n\nThese acts protect certain attributes, for example, race, sex, marital status, disability or sexual orientation. Religion, however, is not an explicitly protected attribute under these acts.\n\nNor is there a stand-alone Religious Discrimination Act \u2014 which means discrimination on the basis of religion is not prohibited by federal anti-discrimination legislation.\n\nBut discrimination laws impact the right to freedom of religion and belief in another way, says Monash University's Luke Beck, a constitutional law scholar.\n\nHe told Fact Check: \"prohibitions on discrimination can limit the ability of individuals and institutions to engage in religiously-motivated discriminatory conduct.\"\n\nThe requirement by the Catholic church to ordain only men as priests is one such example that he provides in a new chapter in the forthcoming book, Contemporary Perspectives on Human Rights Law in Australia (second edition).\n\nIn recognition of this \"religiously-motivated discriminatory conduct\", there are general exemptions for religious bodies, found within the Age Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\nThis means discrimination on the grounds of the attributes protected under these acts, under certain circumstances, is not deemed unlawful.\n\nThey apply \"where the discriminatory act or conduct conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of a religion or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion.\"\n\nThere are also specific exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\nSection 37 allows \"religious bodies\" to discriminate in relation to internal religious practices, such as the ordination or the appointment of priests or ministers, or the training and education of people seeking such positions.\n\nSection 38 provides an exemption for \"educational institutions established for religious purposes\" - and this exemption has been controversial.\n\nReligious educational institutions can discriminate on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy, in relation to employment of staff or in connection with providing education and training.\n\nBut this discrimination must be in \"good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed\".\n\nAs a Law Reform Commission report notes, the effect of these exemptions is that a \"religious school, for instance, may lawfully choose not to employ a pregnant, unmarried teacher, in circumstances where this would be discriminatory conduct for a non-religious school\".\n\nFinally, there are also exemptions for religious bodies contained in the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, the legislation that allows same-sex marriage.\n\nSection 47 of the legislation enables ministers of religion, religious marriage celebrants, chaplains and religious bodies to refuse to solemnise or provide facilities, goods and services for marriages on religious grounds.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the laws that apply in all Australian jurisdictions.\n\nWhere does the Australian Human Rights Commission fit in?\n\nThe president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent statutory body, is responsible for inquiring into and attempting to conciliate complaints of unlawful discrimination, as outlined in the four federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe anti-discrimination laws, as well as the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, (which established the commission) do not make discrimination on the basis of religion, unlawful.\n\nNonetheless, the Human Rights Commissioner can still inquire into and conciliate an act or practice that might constitute religious discrimination.\n\nTo this extent, the Human Rights Commission provides a level of protection against religious discrimination.\n\nMonash University's Associate Professor Beck told Fact Check that while Australia's legal framework to protect against religious discrimination was patchwork in nature, it nonetheless provided protection.\n\n\"In almost every situation you wouldn't be able to get away with religious discrimination because of state laws and federal laws,\" he said.\n\nAssociate Professor Beck said a new religious anti-discrimination law would strengthen the legal framework and act as a \"gap-filler\" where state laws were weak.\n\nHe said Mr Zimmerman's claims \u2014 that Australia didn't have \"a law\" against religious discrimination, and that there was a \"missing link in our legal regime, that there's currently not that protection in place\" \u2014 was only partially correct.\n\nThe Melbourne Law School's Professor Gaze told Fact Check that while there was a piecemeal legal framework of protections across the country, there was a \"missing link\" in NSW and South Australia, because they are the only states that do not have legislation that specifically prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion.\n\nConstitutional law expert Professor Williams said there was some merit in Mr Zimmerman's claims, because in his view current state and federal laws were inadequate.\n\u2022 Inquiry into the status of the human right to freedom of religion and belief, Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (lapsed)\n\u2022 Submissions to the Inquiry into the status of human right to freedom of religion or belief by the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (lapsed).
