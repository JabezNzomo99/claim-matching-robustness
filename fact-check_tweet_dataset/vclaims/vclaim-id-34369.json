The video has been circulated in a misleading context; media reports state the incident involved a driver who was driving recklessly in the Philippines; a police spokesperson in the Philippines told AFP the driver was charged with \"reckless\" driving and was \"not drunk\".\n\nThe video was published in a post here on Facebook on October 30, 2019. It has been viewed more than 600,000 times and shared more than 8,000 times.\n\nThe 24-second video, recorded by a CCTV camera inside a hair salon, shows a white SUV crashing through the wall, hitting a male hairdresser, other employees, several customers and children. The incident happened on Monday April 8, 2019 at 6:34 pm, according to the CCTV\u2019s timestamp.\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cWhen you\u2019re drunk and cause trouble to others (the clip was originally shared from Malaysia, but I am uncertain of where and when the incident happened).\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe video is being circulated in a misleading context.\n\nOther videos of the same incident have previously circulated in reports about a reckless driver, not a drunk motorist, crashing into a hair salon in the city of Iloilo in the Philippines.\n\nKeyword searches found this April 10, 2019 report published by CNN Philippines.

Warning to viewers, you may find this video disturbing.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the driver and claims she mistakenly accelerated the vehicle. It did not refer to the driver being drunk at the time of the incident.\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons of the misleading Facebook post (L) and the video broadcasted by CNN Philippines (R):\n\nAnother video of the incident was also published here by Philippine news network ABS-CBN.
