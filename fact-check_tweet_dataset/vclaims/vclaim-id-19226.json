In the post, the video has the following description \u2013 \u201cThis should be an eye opener for all the Hindu girls eloping with Muslim boys. Another #LoveJihadShe was beaten brutally & was forced to drink urine! Hindu girls must avoid interacting with Momoz as much as possible. Who knows you may be their next target!\u201d. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe lead to the same video in a tweet by Twitter user \u2018Aurora Borealis\u2019 on August 15, 2019. The tweet had the text- \u201cAlishba Khan Italian-Pakistani girl who went through extreme domestic violence and was made to drink her husband\u2019s urine ( in a viral video on social media ) has been rescued by police and now in protection in Italian consulate her husband Ali Jabir Moti who belongs to an influential family, is still at large\u201d.\n\nA thread in the comments section of that tweet leads us to Pakistani journalist Iqrar ul Hassan Syed\u2019s tweet on August 13, 2019, that had the same video. In his tweet, he mentioned that the girl in the video is an Italian of Pakistan origin and she was subjected to domestic violence by her husband Ali Jaber Moti.\n\n\n\nIn another tweet by him on the same day, Hassan Syed has enclosed an FIR copy filed against the girl\u2019s husband Ali Jaber Moti at Darakhshan Police Station in Karachi.\n\nWe checked if this incident was reported in the media, a newspaper article of \u201cSamaa Tv\u201d was found. The article mentioned that the incident was first brought to light by journalist Iqrar ul Hassan Syed and it was taken into cognisance by the Italian Ambassador Stefano Pontecorvo. The article also had the tweet of Pontecorvo mentioning that the matter will be looked into by his officials in Karachi.\n\nPontecorvo in another tweet mentioned that the Italian Consulate was dealing with the issue and they have rescued the girl while her husband is still absconding.\n\nTo sum it up, video from Pakistan shared as Hindu girl brutally beaten by Muslim husband.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
