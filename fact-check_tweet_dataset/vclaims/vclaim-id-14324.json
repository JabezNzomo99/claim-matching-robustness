The first is that the Congress government had no money to procure weapons for the Armed Forces in 2014.\n\nThis part of the post is true.\n\nIn February 2014, when the UPA government was in power, the then defence minister AK Anthony had said that his ministry had used up 92 percent of the defence budget and major acquisitions may have to wait till the next fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere is no money left. All major projects have to wait till 1 April,\u201d Antony said, reported The Indian Express.\n\nThis was one reason why India was not able to sign a $20 billion deal to acquire Rafale jets at that time. The decision to buy 126 Rafale jets had been taken in January 2012.\n\nTalking about the medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) deal, the defence minister said there was a \u201cdelay\u201d but \u201cnegotiations are going on, because of shortage of funds, the deal will finalise in the next financial year\u201d, according to the report.", "lang": "en"}
