The president was discussing his poll numbers from the latest Rasmussen daily tracking poll, saying \u201cpeople are smart\u201d because they \u201csee the jobs.\u201d\n\nThe increase in job openings is not \u201call of a sudden.\u201d The number has been steadily increasing since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009.\n\nThe recession began in December 2007, when the number of job openings was 4.12 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During the recession, the number of openings declined sharply \u2014 falling to 2.77 million by January 2009, when President Obama took office. (The chart below illustrates the impact of the recession on the number of job openings.)\n\nJob openings continued to decline in the first several months under Obama, reaching a low point of nearly 2.2 million in July 2009. The recession ended a month earlier in June 2009.\n\nBut in the post-recession period, the number of job openings has increased at a pretty steady pace. It broke the 3 million mark in April 2010, the 4 million mark in October 2013, and the 5 million mark in January 2015.\n\nBy April 2015, the number of job openings reached 5.62 million \u2014 the highest since BLS began publishing the data in December 2000. During Obama\u2019s eight years, the number of job openings nearly doubled from 2.77 million in January 2009 to 5.44 million in January 2017, an increase of 96 percent.\n\nUnder Trump, the number of job openings has continued to climb \u2014 breaking the 6 million mark in April 2017 and establishing a new high of 6.55 million in March, the most recent month available.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of 20 percent under Trump.\n\nAs we wrote on Inauguration Day in \u201cWhat President Trump Inherits,\u201d Trump won the election while claiming \u201cour country is stagnant,\u201d even though he inherited an economy that was \u201cexperiencing steady if unspectacular growth in output, jobs and incomes.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, Trump said employers \u201cweren\u2019t hiring for years and years and years,\u201d when in fact the unemployment rate was 4.8 percent when he took office \u2014 close to what economists consider \u201cfull employment.\u201d And he said that \u201call of a sudden, we have jobs,\u201d even though the number of job openings has been steadily increasing since mid-2009.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the job market has continued to improve under Trump. The unemployment rate, now at 3.9 percent, is the lowest it has been in nearly 18 years, and the number of job openings reached new heights. But the president disregards the facts when he claims these economic improvements have suddenly happened.", "lang": "en"}
