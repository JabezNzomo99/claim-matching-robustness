The word \u201cdhimmitude\u201d is not found in the ACA or any other bill.\n\nThe post makes several dubious claims suggesting that the ACA, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature 2010 health care law, stipulates that Muslims receive preferential treatment when it comes to taxes and health care.\n\nIt claims the word \u201cdhimmitude,\u201d which allegedly appears on page 107 of the law, establishes that purportedly preferential treatment. The word \u201cdhimmitude\u201d appears to come from the word \u201cdhimmi,\u201d which the Harvard Religious Literacy Project defines as \u201ca non-Muslim subject of the Ottoman Empire\u201d afforded protection by the state in return for paying specific taxes. The status was legally abolished in 1839, according to the Harvard Religious Literacy Project.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched the text of the ACA and found no mention of the word \u201cdhimmitude\u201d on any page. No other bills, proposed or enacted, have any instances of the word either. (RELATED: Are Muslims Barred From Holding Public Office In The US?)\n\nThe post appears to be outdated. It alleges that, thanks to \u201cdhimmitude,\u201d Muslims \u201care specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty for being uninsured!\u201d\n\nThat references the individual mandate component of Obamacare, which required most Americans to have health insurance or face a penalty tax. But the penalty tax was eliminated in December 2017 through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effectively nullifying the individual mandate, according to AFP Fact Check.\n\nWhile some religious groups such as the Mennonites and the Amish were granted exemptions from the individual mandate, there is no evidence that any Muslim sect received such an exemption, FactCheck.org reported. Only religious groups that the Social Security Administration had already recognized as conscientiously opposed to accepting insurance benefits could be considered for the individual mandate exemption, according to the HealthCare.gov website.\n\nThe post also erroneously states that Christians will face \u201chard prison time\u201d for refusing to buy health insurance or pay the penalty tax under the law. That federal penalty tax has been eliminated.\n\nVersions of the claim have circulated online since at least 2010 and have been debunked by other fact-checking websites.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
