It originated on the satire website Taters Gonna Tate.\n\nThe website Englishwire.today published the article, titled \u201c163 Paid Protesters Just Filed A Lawsuit Against George Soros For Not Paying Their Bail,\u201d on June 12. It alludes to the debunked theory that Soros, a billionaire investor who donates to progressive causes through his Open Society Foundations, has paid people to protest at certain events.\n\n\u201cAccording to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses,\u201d reads the article. \u201cThey found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Recruitment Flyer For \u2018Professional Anarchist\u2019 Job Funded By George Soros)\n\nSocial media users shared the story amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nBut the Englishwire.today article\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up. There is no news reporting to corroborate such a lawsuit, and Paid Liberal Trolls of America, the company mentioned that purportedly belonging to Soros, appears to be fabricated. A reverse image search of the article\u2019s featured image reveals it was taken in France in 2018 during the yellow vest protests.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found a nearly identical article posted on Taters Gonna Tate, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Englishwire.today appears to have lifted the story from that website without making clear its satirical origins, a common move that propagates misinformation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
