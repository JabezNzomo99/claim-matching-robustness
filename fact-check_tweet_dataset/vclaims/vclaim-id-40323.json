The toilets in question are located in Rizal Stadium and it is not part of the official venues of the 30th SEA Games. Rizal Stadium is still in the continuing process of renovation and refurbishing hence the unfinished toilets.\"\n\nThe facts: The Rizal Memorial Stadium is one of the official venues of the 30th SEA Games, as indicated on the official website of the event. It is the venue of the men's football matches, which kicked off on Monday. It is also the venue for the semifinal and final matches of the women's football games.\n\nAlthough the field of play at the Rizal Memorial Stadium had been match-ready days before the start of the games, several other facilities within the venue were still under construction when they began.

That same day, ABS-CBN posted a follow-up tweet clarifying that a construction worker they talked to said a wall would be put up between the toilets since they made the mistake of putting a second toilet bowl instead of a sink.\n\nThe stadium is part of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, which was renovated for the 30th SEA Games for the first time since it opened in 1934. However, the renovations at the 85-year-old facility remained unfinished even as the football matches began.
