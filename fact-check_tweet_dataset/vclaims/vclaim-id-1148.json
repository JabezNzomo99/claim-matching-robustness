The 53 second video contains authentic scenes portraying Joe Biden from 1985 to 2020, but some of the footage has been misleadingly cropped or edited, with some remarks taken out of context.\n\nThe video has been shared multiple times on Facebook ( here , here ) and Instagram ( here , here ).\n\nThe videos were originally posted as separate clips on TikTok by user @magacuddy ( bit.ly/3eT1R4X ). Cuddy then posted the video compilation on his Instagram account ( here ).\n\nThis clip has been misleadingly cropped to appear like Biden\u2019s comments reflect his own opinions. The full footage is visible here ( cs.pn/2NIvJ8c ,exact moment at 17:14). Biden is reading a confidential staff memorandum at William Reynolds\u2019 nomination for becoming Associate Attorney General on June 5, 1985 (see memo on page 440, bit.ly/3gemWqR ). He quotes the words allegedly used by a white legislator who opposed to the Louisiana redistricting plan in 1981.\n\nDuring the two-day hearing, Biden often referred to the Louisiana redistricting case, which was criticized for being biased against Blacks, to argue against Reynolds\u2019s nomination ( here ).\n\nBiden mentioned this quote at least twice during the hearing ( bit.ly/38kHeMo ), with the intent to show that Reynolds, then U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights (AAG-CR), dismissed \u201cclear evidence of intent to discriminate against black folks.\u201d ( cs.pn/3g8NlX4 ,minute 18:15)\n\n00:06 - 00:09 \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids\u201d - True\n\nThis clip shows Joe Biden during a town hall in Iowa organized by the Asian & Latino Coalition on August 8, 2019. Biden was speaking about education and the need to challenge students equally in the U.S.\n\nThe full footage ( here ) shows that after this remark, Biden quickly continued to add \u201cwealthy kids, Black kids, Asian kids\u201d to his sentence.\n\nBiden\u2019s full quote reads: \u201cWe should challenge these students. We should challenge students in these schools to have advanced placement programs in these schools. We have this notion that somehow if you\u2019re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids \u2014 wealthy kids, Black kids, Asian kids. No, I really mean, but think how think about it.\u201d\n\nAfter the gaffe received widespread criticism, a spokesperson for Biden said he \u201cmisspoke and immediately corrected himself\u201d and that he was defending that \u201call children deserve a fair shot\u201d ( here ).\n\n00:09- 00:14 \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t Black\u201d - True\n\nOn May 21, 2020, Joe Biden said, \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t Black\u201d to The Breakfast Club co-host Charlamagne tha God in a broadcast interview.\n\nThe moment ( bit.ly/3iiZMRW ) captures Biden replying to Charlamagne, who had said he had more questions for Biden ahead of the election ( bit.ly/2YP0rmr ). Biden then said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions? Well, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d\n\nBiden apologized soon after during a call with the U.S. Black Chambers Inc, an African-American business group. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\u201d here .\n\n00:14 \u2013 00:23 \u201cYou cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I\u2019m not joking\u201d \u2013 Misleading\n\nThis clip features Biden at a fundraiser in June 2006. Longer footage shows that Biden made this remark after shaking hands with a man and talking about his support from the Indian-American community ( cs.pn/2YNDsIj , minute 10:18)\n\nThe full quote reads: \u201cI\u2019ve had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I\u2019m not joking.\u201d Biden continued to say the \u201c30% of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are Indian-American\u201d.\n\nOn the matter, a spokesperson told NBC that Biden was pointing out \u201cthat there has been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades.\u201d ( here )\n\n00:24 \u2013 00:34 (When asked about support for gay marriage) \u201cNo. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that\u201d \u2013 Misleading\n\nWhile this clip is authentic, the video lacks context. Biden made this remark during a Vice Presidential Debate with Sarah Palin on October 2, 2008 ( here ). At the time, Biden and Obama did not support civil marriages for same-sex couples, but they did support \u201ccivil unions\u201d, a marriage-like relationship( here ) that would provide same-sex couples with the benefits available for opposite-sex marriages ( here ).\n\nWider footage from the exchange shows that, after being asked if he supported gay marriage, Biden responded: \u201cNo. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. That is basically the decision to be able to be left to the faiths and people who practice their faiths to determination what you call it.\u201d ( bit.ly/3dMPPIZ )\n\nPrior to this question, Biden noted that he \u201cabsolutely positively\u201d supported granting the same constitutional benefits to \u201ccommitted same-sex couples\u201d, such as visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, and life insurance policies. He continued: \u201cLook, in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple.\u201d\n\nHis answer in this debate is confusing, rejecting redefining marriage on a constitutional level or civil level, but in the same clip asserting there should be no constitutional distinction for same sex couples. Reports from the time confirm that Biden did not support civil same-sex marriage ( here ).\n\nBiden\u2019s views on LGBTQ rights have evolved over the last decade ( here ). He has come under scrutiny on his past record on some LGBTQ issues ( here , here ).\n\nOver time, Biden changed his position and later publicly endorsed same-sex marriage during a television interview here . Barack Obama - who had walked a fine, politically sensitive line in supporting gay rights but not gay marriage - also decided in 2012 to support same-sex marriage ( here ).\n\nBiden has been criticized for signing the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 (which defined marriage as between a man and a woman) and the Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell policy in 1993 (which had barred gay people from serving openly in the U.S. military). Both were ended during the Obama-Biden administrations.\n\nThe clip has been cropped and edited from a video visible here ( bit.ly/2CRuDVo ).\n\nThe full footage of the scene ( cs.pn/3eQWBPd ) shows Joe Biden with Kelly Ayotte, former Republican Senator, at the ceremonial swearing-in with Senators in 2011 ( cs.pn/2BvPVYi ). Ayotte is accompanied by her husband Joseph Daley, their daughter and their infant son ( here ). The clip in the claim has been partially muted. In the original audio, Biden is also heard saying to Ayotte\u2019s daughter, \u201care you bored yet?\u201d and mentioning his own granddaughter.\n\nMisleading. This video contains a mixture of true footage and clips that are edited or taken out of context.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
