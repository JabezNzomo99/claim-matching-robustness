It is just one of many falsehoods that have sprung up in the wake of the death and the protests that followed.\n\nOne popular version of the claim, which contributes to a baseless conspiracy theory that the incident was staged, says: \u201cKellie Chauvin is the Wife of Derek Chauvin[.] Tou Thao is Kellie Chauvin\u2019s Brother.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s false. Here are the facts:\n\nDerek Chauvin and Tou Thao were officers in the Minneapolis Police Department on May 25. Both were involved in the events that led to the death of George Floyd in police custody that day. Chauvin was shown in a video of the incident with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck as Floyd repeatedly said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The video showed Thao looking on. Chauvin, Thao and two other officers who were present were fired the next day. On May 29, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nShortly after that, Chauvin\u2019s wife, Kellie Chauvin, filed for divorce.\n\nHer lawyer, Amanda Mason-Sekula, issued a statement on Facebook the night of Derek Chauvin\u2019s arrest, saying:\n\n\u201cThis evening, I spoke with Kellie Chauvin and her family. She is devastated by Mr. Floyd\u2019s death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy. She has filed for dissolution of her marriage to Derek Chauvin.\n\n\u201cWhile Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Mason-Sekula addressed the falsehood linking Kellie Chauvin to Thao, saying in another Facebook post:\n\nThe posts claiming otherwise don\u2019t offer any evidence that the two are related.\n\nIn some cases, the claim is made on its own, while in others it has been wrapped up with other rumors suggesting further connections among those involved. One such rumor says that Floyd and Chauvin \u201cknew each other\u201d and includes a screenshot of a Gateway Pundit story with the headline: \u201cSHOCKING REVELATION: George Floyd and Officer Derek Chauvin Worked Security at the Same Minneapolis Club Up to End of Last Year.\u201d\n\nChauvin and Floyd reportedly worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club in Minneapolis. But the former owner of the club has said that she didn\u2019t think they knew each other and explained that Chauvin worked there for more than a decade, while Floyd had only recently begun working there.\n\nSo, while both men worked at the same club, there\u2019s no proof that Floyd and Chauvin knew each other.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
