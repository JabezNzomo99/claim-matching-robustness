After September, we all look at it and say it was so incredible. I don\u2019t think you will see height that you had at World Trade Center. \u2026 I don\u2019t think there is a market for office space. It will be years before you fill it. \u2026 Most importantly, they will build a memorial, which will be an important one I think, and I hope.\u201d (March 4, 2002) \u201cThe World Trade Center before Sept. 11 was never considered great architecture. On Sept. 11 everyone said the greatest and unbelievable. Even looking back now, say boy, those buildings were magnificent. But they were never appreciated before Sept. 11. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see that again.\u201d (March 11, 2002)\n\nCavuto: \u201cIf you had to sort of break down for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cWell, I\u2019m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we\u2019re going in, we\u2019re not going in, the \u2014 you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. We have to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort like either do it or don\u2019t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we\u2019re going to attack, what routes we\u2019re taking, what kind of planes we\u2019re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I\u2019ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how \u2014 telling the enemy how we\u2019re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n Cavuto: \u201cWell, the problem right there.\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack.\u201d\n\n Cavuto: \u201cThe problem there, Donald, is you\u2019re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cWell, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is \u2014 just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don\u2019t do it, or you \u2014 but I just \u2014 or if you don\u2019t do it, just don\u2019t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.\u201d\n\n Cavuto: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cWell, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
