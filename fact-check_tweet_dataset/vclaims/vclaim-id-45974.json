Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cThe only reason Trump is keeping his campaign promises is to influence the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever saying the quote.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been the subject of numerous fabricated quotations since taking office in January 2019. In this case, the alleged statement attributed to her in the Facebook post appears to question her intelligence, with the caption saying, \u201cAOC gets two Spock raised eyebrows for this comment.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that she ever actually made this statement, however. Searching her social media accounts and ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets didn\u2019t turn up any proof to corroborate the attribution. Nor have any news outlets credited her with saying the comment about President Donald Trump featured in the Facebook post.\n\nThe alleged quote has been circulating online in various forms since at least January, when it appears to have first gone viral on Twitter. It can also be found on meme websites and forums like Reddit, which often indicates that the statement has been fabricated.
