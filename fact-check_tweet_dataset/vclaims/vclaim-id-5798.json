This fact check will explore the safeguards in place in both Michigan and nationwide, that would make potential fraud very difficult.\n\nExamples of the post are visible here , here , and here .\n\nThe claim feeds into a narrative echoed by President Trump previously that mail-in voting, which is expected to nearly double due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will increase voter fraud. After weeks of repeatedly raising concerns about mail-in voting, Trump urged voters in Florida to vote by any means, including voting by mail, on August 4. He claimed the Republican state\u2019s election system is \u201cSafe and Secure, Tried and True.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe post features a photograph of five envelopes from the Official Election Mail and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, allegedly addressed to the same household. The caption reads: \u201cI received 5 ballot applications today. 4 are for people that lived here 7 years ago. I could send all these in and receive 5 ballots to vote. This is why we shouldn\u2019t have mail in voting.\u201d\n\nIt appears the claim has been circulating since at least May 23 ( here ), days after the Secretary of State of Michigan Jocelyn Benson announced absentee ballot applications would be mailed to all registered voters in the state ( here ).\n\nTo allege that this tenant could \u201csend all these in and receive 5 ballots to vote\u201d is misleading. Experts consulted by Reuters explained that while a voter might receive erroneous absentee ballot applications, to send these applications back, receive somebody else\u2019s ballot and then submit it, would be committing a series of crimes.\n\nChristopher Thomas, who served as the state election director of Michigan for 36 years until 2017 and is now member of the MIT Elections Data Lab, called the claim \u201chighly inflammatory and not accurate.\u201d Thomas told Reuters via email that not only would being in possession of a ballot sent to another person be a felony, but \u201cit is also a felony to falsely impersonate a voter.\u201d (A relevant Michigan election law excerpt is visible bit.ly/33x5yKK )\n\nFraudsters would need to know a voters\u2019 personal information, such as date of birth, and be able to forge their signature to match the voter registry. The Michigan Attorney General notes bit.ly/2PonU8F that election officials \u201cconduct careful examinations of these applications to ensure they are authentic, complete and comport with the law,\u201d and that no absentee ballot is provided unless a properly signed application is received.\n\nThomas explained that in the \u201cunlikely event\u201d that the impostor in this Facebook claim received a ballot after sending a fraudulent application (then filled it in and cast it), the person \u201cwould have committed a series of felonies\u201d, including the forgery of a signature on the application ( bit.ly/2ELGp4C and bit.ly/3gvCbfr ) .\n\nJennifer Morrell, an election consultant and former election official for Utah and Colorado, also confirmed that in the U.S. a person fraudulently signing a ballot application and a ballot return envelope would be violating the law, given they are \u201csigning an oath stating they are the person listed.\u201d\n\nEven if the forger is willing to take this criminal risk, they would need to know the personal details for all the voters they\u2019re impersonating, including matching a signature exactly as it appears in the voter registry. They would have to do this over and over again with thousands of ballots to affect an election outcome.\n\nBenjamin Hovland, Commissioner for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, told Reuters that mail ballot fraud is very rare, precisely because it\u2019s a felony. He explained that it is more common in local races like schoolboard appointments and Sheriff nominations.\n\nHovland noted that, precisely because election officials are aware of these potential issues, there are various safeguards in place. He explained that people often get caught if they do try to forge somebody else\u2019s vote.\n\nSpecific system safeguards in place to prevent this type of fraud include the Electronic Registration Information Center (ericstates.org/) and following NVRA list maintenance procedures ( here , here ).\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures provides information on home voting, including a section on security features in place here . Measures in place to counter voter fraud include hand-marked paper ballots, signature verification, examining and processing ballots ahead of election day to allow for more verification time, up-to-date address information, security cameras during storage, and many more (see Security Features of Voting by Absentee/Mailed Ballots section bit.ly/33vUvBA ).\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a system that has been tested election after election,\u201d Hovland said.\n\nAs with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare. A Reuters explainer going into more detail into why mail-in voter fraud is rare is visible here .\n\nFor example, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has warned of the risks of mail voting, found 14 cases of attempted mail fraud out of roughly 15.5 million ballots cast in Oregon since that state started conducting elections by mail in 1998. According to an op-ed for The Hill here based on an analysis of Heritage Foundation data over the course of 20 years, there has been a national average of seven to eight cases per year of fraud involving mail-in ballots.\n\nLike any other voting method, mail balloting has its drawbacks. States rejected 1% of returned ballots in 2016 for arriving too late, missing signatures or other problems, according to EAC figures \u2014 though that figure was as high as 5% in some states. It can be more difficult to fix errors on mail ballots than on those cast in person, experts say.\n\nMail ballots can pose additional barriers to those who don\u2019t speak English or have disabilities, and delivery can be problematic on Native American reservations, where residents sometimes don\u2019t have street addresses ( here ).\n\nMail-in voting can also lead to voter suppression in other ways. In Florida in 2016, for example, research by the ACLU found ballots by Black and Latino voters were two and a half times more likely to be rejected than those of white voters ( here ). The New Yorker pointed out that \u201cin states with intentionally restrictive \u201cexact match\u201d voter-registration requirements, signature rejections are an easy way to cull legitimate voters.\u201d ( here ).\n\nHovland told Reuters that the timing of this misinformation surge surrounding mail-in voting is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is changing processes and procedures like election deadlines and polling station policies. The changes lead to an increase in misinformation and disinformation taking advantage of the knowledge vacuum. Hovland reiterated the importance of checking in with local election officials for the most accurate guidance.\n\nA recent fact check on a similar claim out of Las Vegas, Nevada is visible here .\n\nMisleading. Multiple safeguards, including criminal penalties, make mail-in voter fraud very difficult. Facebook posts oversimplify the risk of forged ballot votes.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
