A viral picture of a funeral procession is shared on social media with a claim that a doctor from Pune died of coronavirus and was cremated by Muslims. \n\n Vishvas News investigation revealed the claim to be fake. The procession at Meerut, Uttar Pradesh is viral as in Pune, Maharashtra. The picture is viral with false claims as the deceased Dr Ramakant Joshi is from Pune. However, we found out that the deceased person\u2019s name is Ramesh Chand Mathur.\n\nSocial media user \u2018Roman Kravencheko\u2019 sharing the viral picture (archive link ) wrote, \u201c@ sinha_ankit9 this is a case of Pune doctor who died because of Covid-19\u2026 Muslims are performing funeral for this man because his own kids are abroad\u2026 his name is Dr Ramakant Joshi .. would you have done this for any muslim? \u201d\n\nMany users shared this picture with similar claims on different social media platforms .\n\nThe news (archive link )on the website of Kohraam.com also used this picture and claimed that a doctor died of coronavirus in Pune, Maharashtra, after which the people of Tabligi Jamaat came forward to cremate his body.\n\nOn searching the image using Google reverse image search tool, we found this picture in the news published in the Times of India website on 30 April 2020. According to the news, after the demise of Ramesh Mathur, a priest of a temple in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, Muslims came forward to take out funeral procession. Mathur lived with his wife and son in \u200b\u200bShahpeer Gate area in Meerut. \n\n\n\n\n\n On searching the news, we found a detailed report of this matter in the news on April 29 on the \u2018Dainik Jagran\u2019 website. Another picture of the same funeral procession is attached in the news. \n\n According to the report, \u201cAfter the death of the priest, a resident of Kayastha Dharamshala at Shahpeer Gate, relatives could not come to perform his last rites. People from the surrounding Muslim community supported the family and performed funeral at Surajkund Crematorium.\n\nThe news reported added that Mathur was a priest for a temple.\n\nWe contacted our colleague Dainik Jagran\u2019s Meerut reporter. Confirming this, City Reporter Om Vajpayee said, \u201cThis picture is the funeral procession of a priest residing in Kayastha Dharamshala at Shahpir Gate, Meerut.\u201d\n\nJagran\u2019s report clarified that Muslims in the locality supported Mathur\u2019s family with supplies for the funeral procession and former councilor Hifzurrahman had also participated in the funeral. Vishvas News contacted Hifzurrahman and he confirmed the picture and described it as Ramesh Mathur\u2019s funeral.\n\nAfter this, we tried to find the news of the death of doctor Ramakant Joshi from coronavirus through a news search. In the search we did not find any such report. \n\n \n\n The user , who shared the viral picture with the false claim, is a Canadian according to his profile and he is researcher about Indian minority and Islam religion.\n\nConclusion: The viral post claiming about the funeral procession of Dr Ramakant Joshi in Pune is fake. The picture is from the funeral procession of temple priest Ramesh Mathur in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.", "lang": "en"}
