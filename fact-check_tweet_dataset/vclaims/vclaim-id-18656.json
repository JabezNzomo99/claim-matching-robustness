That is true.\n\n\u201cBut the claim that\u2026 and I\u2019ve seen this claim\u2026 that the Secretary asked Lavrov to pass on to Assad our apology is just absolutely not true.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info found no media articles in Arabic or Syrian media about the alleged apology. Syrian state-run media comments about the bombing did not have any reference to an alleged Kerry apology.", "lang": "en"}
