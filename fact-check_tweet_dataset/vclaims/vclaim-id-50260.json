The claim is false; the image has been doctored and the original photo shows Rothschild standing in front of a different painting.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on February 11, 2019. It has been shared more than 250 times.\n\nThe text superimposed at the bottom of the image reads: \u201cLynn Rothschild and her eating babies decor\u201d.\n\nLynn Forester de Rothschild, or Lady de Rothschild, is married to Evelyn de Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild banking family. The family is one of the richest in the world, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe image was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here, here and here alongside a similar claim. Some of the posts also describe Lady de Rothschild \u201cevil\u201d and a \u201cmass murderer\u201d.\n\nThe claim is false; the original photo of Lady de Rothschild does not include the same painting in the background.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a similar photo of Lady de Rothschild posing in front of a different painting.\n\nThe photo appeared in this May 2014 Harper's Bazaar article titled \u201cAt Home With Lady de Rothschild\u201d.\n\nThe photograph's caption reads: \u201cThe main house at Ascott contains Rothschild family heirlooms and art, including the painting Five Brood Mares at the Duke of Cumberland's Stud Farm, by George Stubbs.\u201d The image was credited to Simon Upton, a UK-based photographer.\n\nIn response to an AFP enquiry, Upton\u2019s representative, Karen Howes, said: \u201cThe original portrait taken by Simon Upton of Lady de Rothschild is the one as published in Harper\u2019s Bazaar in 2014.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Trust confirms on its website that the 1765 painting by renowned English artist George Stuggs is part of its collection at Ascott Estate. The Ascott Estate was donated to the National Trust in 1949 but \u201cremains the countryside residence for the de Rothschild family.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ceating babies decor\u201d, as stated in the misleading claim, was in fact a copy of an image at the bottom right-hand corner of The Last Judgment, an early 15th-century painting by Italian Renaissance painter Fra Angelico.\n\nAccording to the website Art in Tuscany, \u201cthe painting depicts the Demons of Hell torturing the souls of the wicked. The very bottom shows Satan chewing on some of the souls\u201d.\n\nThe original photograph of Lady de Rothschild has also been photoshopped in other ways, including here where she appears to be posing in front of a painting of US President Donald Trump, and here with an image of a red devil behind her.\n\nOther conspiracy theories targeting the Rothschilds include one that alleges the family is behind the novel coronavirus pandemic, and another that states it controls the weather to profit off natural disasters, as reported by Forbes and The Washington Post here and here. The family is also often associated with rumours about the Illuminati and satanism.", "lang": "en"}
