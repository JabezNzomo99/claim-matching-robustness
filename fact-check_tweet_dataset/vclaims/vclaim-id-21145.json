The accompanying text says, \u201cDK Shivkumar\u2019s home with just one Locker room opened..Congis whr will u hide ur faces???\u201c. The video posted by this Twitter handle shows a locker full of cash and more bags full of cash on the floor.\n\nThis same video is viral on Facebook as can be seen in the video below. The identical text \u201cShivkumar home with just 1 Locker room opened\u201d across most of the Facebook posts also indicates that this video is widely circulating on WhatsApp. Even DurgaMenon states in a tweet that she got the video via WhatsApp.\n\nIn reality, the video that is being passed around is that of an Income Tax raid on T&T law firm in Delhi founded by Rohit Tandon. In total, Rs 13 crores worth of cash was found in raids on Rohit Tandon\u2019s law firm and residences in Delhi in December 2016. The video that is now being shared as cash found in DK Shivkumar\u2019s house was originally posted by a journalist Shiv Sunny on his Twitter timeline on December 10, 2016. He posted the video with the text, \u201cVideo of over Rs 8 cr cash (Rs 2 cr in new currency) seized by Delhi Police from T&T law firm in Delhi\u2019s GK.\u201c. The video can be seen below.\n\nRecently, after an RSS karyakarta Rajesh was murdered in Kerala, a fake video from Brazil claiming it to be Rajesh was circulated. =", "lang": "en"}
