Her maiden name was Banks. The woman pictured in some of the Facebook posts is this Alice Cummings.\n\nIdox PLC and Idox Trustees Limited both list her as a director, appointed on 14 April 2020. She previously worked for a healthcare services group.\n\nThe company confirmed to us that Alice Cummings is of \u201cno known relation to Dominic Cummings.\u201d\n\nWhat does this company do?\n\nIdox told us it is not in any way involved with the government\u2019s track and trace app. It has helped NHS hospitals establish software for booking Covid-19 tests.\n\nIdox told us it was one of three companies that provides election software to local authorities in the UK. It has previously provided postal vote services for English local elections, by-elections and printing for other elections.", "lang": "en"}
