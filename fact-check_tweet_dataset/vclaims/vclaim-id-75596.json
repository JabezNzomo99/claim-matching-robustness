(don't know.... what sin did we commit in our past life?....we are born in India (audience laughs)... Is this a country? Is this any government?... What kind of people are these? Let's leave... ) And people used to leave.. Some years we also saw industrialists saying that we can't do business here. We can't live here.. And many people had put one leg out of the country already...\"\n\nHis comments in Seoul were a slight variation of his speech in Shanghai from the same foreign trip where he said international economic bodies such as IMF, World Bank had acknowledged India was growing at 7 percent and that a sense of pessimism had ended.\n\nEven in 2015 Modi's comments from that trip were slammed back home. The hashtag #ModiinsultsIndia trended on Twitter at the time. - Modi's comments at past regime invite twitter backlash\n\nThe Bharatiya Janta party rattled by Rahul Gandhi's jibes fielded Union Minister Smriti Irani to take on Gandhi. Irani said Congress vice-president attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a foreign country was \"deplorable.\"\n\nGandhi had attacked Modi and the BJP and said \"The politics of hate divides and polarises India making millions of people feel that they have no future in their own country.\"\n\nGandhi also took potshots against Modi's economic policies saying 'demonetisation and hastily applied GST have caused tremendous damage.'", "lang": "en"}
