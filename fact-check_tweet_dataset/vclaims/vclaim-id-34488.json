The claim is false; the Sri Lankan president's office said they had issued no such directive; the Sri Lankan Prisons Department told AFP that the former army staff sergeant remains in jail.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on November 19, 2019, where it has been shared more than 700 times.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption says: \"War hero Sunil Ratnayake was freed a few moments ago by a special order issued by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\".\n\n\"All those who joined hands with me over the years to free war hero Sunil Ratnayake who was unfairly imprisoned, I thank you for standing with me without even knowing my identity\u2026 That battle has been concluded victoriously\u2026\u201d\n\nFormer army staff sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was sentenced to death in June 2015 for the murder of eight Tamil civilians in 2000 in Mirusuvil, an area outside the northern city of Jaffna.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post contains an image with a \"breaking news\" banner across the top, above two images of a former Sri Lanka Army Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake.\n\nThere is also Sinhala text below the images of Gunawardena saying: \u201cWar hero Sunil Ratnayake was released by a special order issued by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\u201d\n\nThe court ruling on Ratnayake, which came after a 13-year trial, was a rare instance of a civilian court convicting a soldier for crimes committed during the military\u2019s decades-long conflict with Tamil forces. Here is an AFP report on the decision.\n\nIn May 2019, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court rejected Ratnayake\u2019s appeal, unanimously affirming the conviction and death sentence.\n\nPresident Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 70, previously has a long military career and served as Defense Secretary under his brother, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, from 2005 to 2015. Here is an AFP profile of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nThe claim has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here.\n\nSome Facebook users appeared to believe the claim, posting messages of appreciation to Rajapaksa for issuing the pardon.\n\nOne user\u2019s post, seen here, translated from Sinhala reads: \u201cThank you President, for releasing Sunil Ratnayake war hero\u2026\u201d\n\nThe claim is false; the president's office said he had not issued any such directive, and the country's Prisons Department said the inmate remained in jail.\n\nThe Director General of Presidential Media, Mohan Samaranayake, told AFP by phone that there was no such directive.\n\n\"I have checked into the claim with the relevant authorities and can confirm no such decision was made and no such directive has been issued by the President,\" he said.\n\nThe new president tweeted a warning here on November 21, 2019, urging Sri Lankans not to believe any purported presidential statements unless they had been released through official channels.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Prisons Department told AFP they had not received any directive to release Ratnayake or been informed of any presidential pardon issued by Rajapaksa.\n\n\u201cNo such request or instruction has been issued to free the prison Sunil Rathnayake,\u201d K D B Jayasinghe, the Administration Division\u2019s Commissioner of Prisons, told AFP in a phone interview on November 25.\n\n\"The inmate mentioned in the claims is still in prison,\" he said.\n\nThe Prisons Department\u2019s refutation of the misleading claim on social media was also published here in the Daily Mirror, a Sri Lankan media outlet, on November 20.", "lang": "en"}
