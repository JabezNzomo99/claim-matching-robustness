Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump for his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\n\"On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,\" said Cruz. \"As president, I will not be neutral.\"\n\nTrump defended his record on Israel, arguing that there is \"nobody on this stage that is more pro-Israel than I am.\"\n\nCruz has a point: Trump did say he wanted to be \"neutral\" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. However, that doesn\u2019t capture the full spirit of Trump\u2019s comments about Israel.\n\nCruz was using an attack line we\u2019ve seen before in an ad by , which supports Sen. Marco Rubio for president.\n\nTrump made the statement about being \"neutral\" at an in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A Cruz spokeswoman on debate night sent us an about Trump\u2019s town hall comments.)\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other\u2019s right to exist.\n\nTrump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator.\n\n\"Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it,\" Trump said. \"I don't think it helps.\"\n\nTrump made similar comments a couple of weeks later at a February debate in Houston. He said that when negotiating a deal, it wouldn\u2019t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy:\n\n\"It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' \" Trump said, adding that he can\u2019t negotiate as well if he takes sides. \"With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.\"\n\nDuring the debate at the University of Miami, Trump reeled off his pro-Israel credentials, including that he was a grand marshal for the Israeli Day Parade in New York. He stood by his words about his goal to remain neutral as a negotiation strategy.\n\nTrump said although he is \"pro-Israel\", in order to negotiate a peace settlement, \"I would like to at least have the other side think I am at least somewhat neutral to them.\"\n\nIn December, Trump suggested to the Associated Press that to negotiate a deal, the big lift may have to come from Israel.\n\n\"A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things,\" Trump said. \"They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal.\"\n\nTrump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a \"huge sticking point\" in talks.\n\nThe same week, Trump praised Israel by saying it had already \"given a lot\" in a speech to the .\n\nBut he said if elected, as a deal maker he wouldn\u2019t want to give away his position ahead of time.\n\n\"I\u2019d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room,\" he said.\n\nTrump also told the coalition that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013.\n\n\"I am a big fan of Israel,\" Trump said in the . \"And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims.\n\nWhen asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, \"I haven\u2019t been working too much with the Arab leaders.\"\n\nSpokespersons for Trump did not respond on debate night.\n\nCruz said Trump \"has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians\"\n\nTrump did make that statement during an MSNBC town hall in February. He has repeatedly said that in order to be an effective negotiator he believes he must approach the two sides with neutrality.\n\nBut Cruz is omitting Trump\u2019s comments and actions that have shown support for Israel, including that he endorsed Netanyahu.", "lang": "en"}
