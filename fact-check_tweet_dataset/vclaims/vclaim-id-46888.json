Ali's remarks were against the Uttar Pradesh state government's directive that year to record Independence Day celebrations in madrassas in the state.\n\nFurthermore recent viral posts have misidentified Ali as Congress leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui.\n\nMavia Ali was with the Congress in 2016 when he won the Deoband seat and was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in a by-election in February that year. In 2017's UP Assembly elections, Ali represented the Samajwadi Party and lost to a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate.\n\nThe 25 second long clip shows Ali saying, \"firstly I am Muslim. I am an Indian in the second number. If any law clashes with the ideology of Islam, then I am with Islam. I am not ready to abide by the constitution or law. We are not loyal to the country, but we are the leaders of it. Dogs are faithfuls.\"\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook with the caption, \"\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0932\u093e \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0928 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0939 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \"\u0939\u092e \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 ..\u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0940 ..\u0907\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u091f\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0939\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947 ..\u0939\u092e \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0935\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 ..\u0915\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\" \u0915\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u0948 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u092d\u093e\u0908\u0902 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u2066 @RahulGandhi \u2069 & \u2066 @priyankagandhi.\"\n\nThe same video has been tweeted by multiple verified handles, including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Spokesperson Sambit Patra and Canadian Twitter influencer Tarek Fatah. However, Patra and Fatah later clarified that the video is of Mavia Ali and not Siddiqui. \n\n\n\nUpon relevant keyword searches, BOOM came across the same video, that featured in an India Today news bulletin, three years ago. According to the report, Mavia Ali made the controversial statements about giving precedence to the Islamic law instead of following the Indian Constitution on August 14, 2017, after the Yogi Adityanath government issued strict instructions about celebrating Independence Day in madrassas and recording the same. Ali was a Samajwadi Party leader then.\n\nThe same was covered in a prime time debate show of the channel.\n\nMeanwhile Congress leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui is a member of the UP Legislative Assembly and has no relation to the video.", "lang": "en"}
