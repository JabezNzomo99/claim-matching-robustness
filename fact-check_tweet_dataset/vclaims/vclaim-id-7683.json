In April 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy in which the government would pursue criminal charges against any migrant caught making an unauthorized border crossing and take their accompanying children away from them.\n\nSince then, readers have been angered by stories of the federal government failing to account for hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children, and reports that hundreds of children \u2014 including dozens under age 4 \u2014 had been removed from their parents\u2019 care by immigration agents.\n\nHowever, this was not a new image as of 2018. It was taken from a gallery published along with a 12 March 2017 story in The New Yorker and depicts the work of photographer Thomas Kiefer, who used to work as a janitor for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Ajo, Arizona. The rosaries, he explained, were taken from immigrants along with other personal effects when they were arrested by border agents.\n\nKiefer, who quit his CBP job in 2014, fished the unclaimed items out of trash cans as he cleaned. They would later become part of a photography collection he called \u201cEl Sue\u00f1o Americano\u201d:\n\nSpending time with the confiscated items \u2014 collecting them, curating them, looking at them, photographing them \u2014 changed Kiefer\u2019s relationship to his job. Before, he\u2019d been punching the clock so that he could get back to photography; now he felt awakened to hundreds of human dramas playing out around him during each shift. He\u2019d always known, technically, about the C.B.P.\u2019s strict confiscation policies, which were posted on bilingual signs and applied to all items classified as either \u201cnon-essential\u201d or \u201cpotentially lethal.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking about these policies, and he hadn\u2019t realized how broadly they were applied, or just how many of the confiscated items \u2014 including cell phones and wallets, many still containing I.D.s, prepaid debit cards, and cash \u2014 were ending up in the trash, never to be returned. Increasingly, Kiefer felt uncomfortable at work: angry at the system that employed him, sad for the people being \u201cprocessed,\u201d and afraid that he would be caught making off with government property. But he kept sneaking out what he could, kept building his piles, and kept taking pictures, which at first he showed to no one.\n\nCBP spokesman Carlos Diaz told us that items taken away from immigrants upon arrest can be returned if the owner retrieves them \u2014 but according to immigrant advocacy organization No More Deaths, many never see their belongings again. According to a 2014 report authored by the organization:\n\nItems taken may include religious effects, but as No More Deaths points out, they include almost anything but the clothing being worn. Generally, personal property is held for 30 days after an arrest and then destroyed.\n\nIn 2016, David Hill, a volunteer for No More Deaths who is tasked with helping reunite deported migrants with property taken by authorities described to the publication Vice a wide range of confiscated items: \u201cweddings rings, rosaries, and children\u2019s artwork\u201d along with identification cards, money, cell phones and medication:\n\nWe asked CBP for more detail on their policy on confiscation of personal belongings and how items are returned but did not receive a response.", "lang": "en"}
