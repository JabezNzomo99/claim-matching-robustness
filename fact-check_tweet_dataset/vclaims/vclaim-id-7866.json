Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!\" he tweeted.\n\nWe wondered whether Trump was accurate that the Dow\u2019s 1,000-point move in five weeks was a jump of record proportions.\n\nHere\u2019s a table summarizing every time the Dow has crossed a 1,000-level threshold for the first time since its establishment as a stock-measurement statistic in 1896. The chart below only includes the first time the Dow crossed a threshold; in many cases, the market closed below that level before climbing above it permanently.\n\nThe most recent climb to 25,000 is a record, after you exclude weekends and holidays and include only trading days. The climb from 24,000 to 25,000 took 24 trading days. That is one day shorter than the two previous fastest climbs of 25 trading days \u2014 from 10,000 to 11,000 under President Bill Clinton in 1999, and from 20,000 to 21,000 earlier in Trump\u2019s own presidency.\n\nWith each 1,000-level increase, the accomplishment is a little less impressive.\n\nA jump of 1,000 from 24,000 to 25,000 is an increase of just 4 percent in value. By comparison, jumping from 1,000 to 2,000 \u2014 which took more than 14 years \u2014 is an increase of 100 percent in value.\n\nTrump said the Dow Jones Industrial Average \"jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history.\"\n\nHe\u2019s correct about the size of the climb and the fact that it\u2019s the fastest in history, at least when you tally up trading days. The rise to 25,000 beat the old record by one trading day.", "lang": "en"}
