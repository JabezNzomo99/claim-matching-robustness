They are based on figures which actually show the UK\u2019s net contributions are higher than an estimated economic cost so far.\n\nOther reports have made a more defensible claim: that Brexit will \u201chave soon cost\u201d or \u201cis set to cost\u201d the UK more than 47 years of payments to the EU budget. But these still depend on accepting an uncertain estimate for the cost of Brexit so far, plus even more uncertain estimates of the future cost. And even then, the figure at the end of 2020 is still slightly lower.\n\nThe claims are based on analysis by Bloomberg Economics which found that the \u201ceconomic cost\u201d of Brexit to the UK was \u00a3130 billion by the end of 2019. This looks at how much lower GDP is in real terms than it otherwise might have been had previous trends (from before the vote to leave the EU) continued between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThis \u201ccost\u201d, according to the analysis, is set to rise to \u00a3200 billion by the end of 2020.\n\nTo put that in context, the whole UK economy was worth about \u00a32,144 billion\u2014or \u00a32.1 trillion\u2014in 2018.\n\nFollowing the publication of the analysis these figures were then compared on social media (not by Bloomberg) to the UK\u2019s total net contributions to the EU.\n\nBloomberg Economics told us that the \u00a3200 billion figure it came up with was an estimate, as it\u2019s impossible to be sure what the economy would have looked like if the UK had voted to remain in the EU in 2016. Many different estimates have been done of the impact of Brexit on the UK, as we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nWe haven\u2019t looked in detail at Bloomberg Economics\u2019 calculations, but it\u2019s already clear that its estimates are still less than the UK\u2019s net contributions to the EU.\n\nAt the moment we only have figures on what the UK has contributed to the EU up to the end of 2018, so covering 45 years rather than 47. These have been gathered by the House of Commons Library. In that time the UK\u2019s net contribution to the EU between 1973 and 2018 was about \u00a3216 billion in real terms (accounting for the way prices change over time and using 2019 prices). The net contribution was \u00a3156 billion in cash terms (not accounting for inflation).\n\nBoth of these contribution figures are higher than the \u201ceconomic cost of Brexit\u201d estimated by Bloomberg Economics up to the end of 2019. The real terms figure of EU contributions (the more meaningful of the two) is still higher than the \u201ccost of Brexit\u201d estimated up to the end of 2020.\n\nIf you estimate what the UK will have paid in net contributions by 2020, using the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the financial settlement with the EU, then it comes to around \u00a3222 billion in real terms.", "lang": "en"}
