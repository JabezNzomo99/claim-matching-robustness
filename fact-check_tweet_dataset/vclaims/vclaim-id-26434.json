But the image in the posts has been doctored from a genuine news report; the original report's headline only stated the musician \"accepted\" his son was detained for drug use.\n\nThe doctored screenshot was published in this July 26, 2019 Facebook post about Indonesian singer Rhoma Irama. It shows a purported news report from Indonesian news outlet Liputan6.com.\n\nThe Indonesian language headline translates to English as: \u201cRhoma Irama: This Is My Fault, I Told Him Not to Touch Alcoholic Drinks, Not Even a Drop.. But He Ended Up Consuming Crystal Meth.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPak Haji, please be clear when you advise your son... So that he can fully understand what you mean\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cPak Haji\u201d is an Indonesian term widely used to address a Muslim man who has gone on the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.

Based on a Supreme Court ruling, Ridho Rhoma must return to the detainment centre for eight months for drug abuse.\n\n\u201cRidho Rhoma will be detained at the Salemba detention center, Central Jakarta. As a father, Rhoma Irama found it difficult to accept this reality. But the King of Dangdut said he had finally accepted it.\u201d\n\nDangdut is a popular genre of Indonesian music that mixes local, Indian and Malay traditions. \u201cThe King of Dangdut\u201d is a nickname given to Rhoma.\n\nRidho\u2019s detention was also reported by Indonesian news site Kompas on July 12, 2019, here.
