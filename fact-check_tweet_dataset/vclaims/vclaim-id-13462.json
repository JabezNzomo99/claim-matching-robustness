Marcos posted a P150,000-bail a week later and faces a prison sentence of six to 11 years for each count of graft.\n\nThe Pinas Ang Ina Nyo post could have reached over 2.5 million people. The original post made in October was published two weeks after the Supreme Court affirmed the Manila RTC's 2008 decision.\n\nTop traffic generators to the story from social media are the pages PRESIDENT RODY DUTERTE -FEDERAL MOVEMENT INTERNATIONAL and Bongbong Marcos 2022.\n\nPinas Ang Ina Niyo, which posts predominantly anti-Liberal Party material, was created on Aug. 8, 2015.\n\n\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
