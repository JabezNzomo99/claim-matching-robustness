The disturbing video has the man speaking in Hindi and saying, \"Don\u2019t take his name again,\u201d as he continues to hit her. A man possibly filming the video can be heard saying, \"Rohit...stop it\" but no one intervenes to help the woman.\n\nBOOM is not uploading the video as it depicts graphic violence. \n\n\n\nThe video is being shared on Facebook with a caption in Hindi that claims the assault happened at Gujarat's RM VM school in Valsad. Several unrelated violent videos have used the same caption in the past in order to go viral. \n\n\n\n(Hindi Text - \"\u0906\u092a \u0915\u0947 whatsapp \u092a\u0947 \u091c\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0902\u092c\u0930 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092a \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u092d\u0940 \u091b\u0942\u091f\u0928\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f, \u092f\u0947 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0938\u092c\u0915\u094b \u092d\u0947\u091c\u093f\u090f \u092f\u0947 \u0935\u0932\u0938\u093e\u0921 \u0915\u0947 RM VM SCHOOL \u0915\u093e \u091f\u0940\u091a\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u094b \u0907\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0947 \u091f\u0940\u091a\u0930 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0942\u0932 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0964 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u092b\u0940 \u095e\u0930\u094d\u0915 \u092a\u095c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0913\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0947 \u0926\u092f\u093e \u0928 \u0906\u092f\u0947 \u0935\u094b \u0905\u092a\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0939 (\u091f\u093e\u0907\u092a\u093f\u0902\u0917) \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0930\u0916\u0947 \u0964\")\n\nThe same video was viral in 2018 and was widely reported by news outlets as a Delhi cop's son beating a woman in a private office in Delhi.
