Hot on the heels of their previous runaway viral hit article titled \"CDC Doctor: 'Disastrous' Flu Shot Is Causing Deadly Flu Outbreak\" (already debunked by Snopes) they published a followup story on February 22nd 2018 titled \"CDC Doctor, Who Claimed Flu Shot Caused Outbreak, Missing Feared Dead\" (archived here) which falsely claims Dr. Timothy J. Cunningham was the source in the first story and exploits the fact that the real Dr. Cunningham is missing right now.\n\nCunningham has actually been missing for 10 days now, as has been widely reported:\n\nIf you happen to have seen him, do call the Atlanta Police Homicide/Adult Missing Persons Unit at 404-546-4235.\n\nIn the first debunked article YourNewsWire claimed an anonymous doctor warned against this year's flu shot:\n\nA CDC doctor has warned this year's \"disastrous\" flu shot may be responsible for the deadly flu epidemic sweeping the country. \"Some of the patients I've administered the flu shot to this year have died,\" the doctor said, adding \"I don't care who you are, this scares the crap out of me.\" \"We have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.\"\n\nNow in the new article they \"reveal\" the name of the anonymous doctor:\n\nThere is just one problem with that theory. Here is Cunningham's bio on the website of the CDC:\n\nNotice that \"ScD\"? That stands for Doctor of Science, which is an academic degree different from a Doctor of Medicine (MD). It is the second type of doctor that people go to for flu shots or prescriptions. The first type doesn't see patients and typically doesn't administer shots so it is higly unlikely he is the source of the first story (which was already suspect to begin with).\n\nOther than the claim Cunningham was the source of the previous story the article is just a rehash of the original reporting about the disappearance from 11alive.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
