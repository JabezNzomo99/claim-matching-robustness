Let\u2019s fact-check the authenticity of the posted picture.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of Modi bowing down to touch the feet of AIMIM leader MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi. Fact: Modi\u2019s photo of bowing down to touch the feet of Advani, back in 2013, was photoshopped to add Owaisi\u2019s photo in the Advani\u2019s place. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, a newspaper article with a similar photo was found in the search results. In the picture, it can be seen that Modi was bowing down to Advani at a rally in Bhopal in 2013. The video related to the incident can be seen here.\n\nA similar photo with Saudi King\u2019s photo in the place of Advani went viral in 2016 when a News18 journalist has tweeted the morphed photo. The BJP then had filed a formal complaint on the journalist for which the journalist had apologized. Also, many other photoshopped versions of the same picture were found on the internet.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of Modi bowing down to Advani photoshopped to include various other persons in place of Advani.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
