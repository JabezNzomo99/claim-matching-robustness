Good. That means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Churchill ever said or wrote this statement.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence in the nearly 20 million-word record of Winston Churchill\u2019s writings to confirm this quote,\u201d Tim Riley, chief curator at the National Churchill Museum, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.\n\nIndeed, the quote does not appear in the Churchill Archive, which contains around 800,000 original documents related to the statesman, or a complete collection of his written works.\n\nAnother expert, International Churchill Society Director of Publications David Freeman, confirmed in an email to TheDCNF that the saying isn\u2019t original to Churchill: \u201cThat is indeed another chestnut of non-Churchillian vintage.\u201d\n\nSome blogs credit French writer Victor Hugo with penning the quote. A similar expression appears in a passage of his written work \u201cThings Seen,\u201d according to one website. \u201cYou have enemies?\u201d the quote reads. \u201cWhy, it is the story of every man who has done a great deed or created a new idea.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
