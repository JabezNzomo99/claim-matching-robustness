The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on July 20, 2020 by Australian professional boxer Anthony Mundine, who has more than 88,000 followers. The post was shared almost 300 times.\n\nThe post reads in part: \u201cI can\u2019t share a mask picture about how stupid it is to wear one & how it compromises your immune system! The government wants you to get sick so they can manipulate the numbers even more !\u201d\n\nA similar claim was also shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook here, here and here, and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nThe posts circulated as international health authorities continued to encourage the use of face masks to curb the spread of COVID-19. The advice coincided with the emergence of conspiracy theories online that allege wearing masks will negatively affect people's health, as reported by Australian and international media here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nInternational health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.\n\n\u201cMedical masks can protect people wearing the mask from getting infected, as well as can prevent those who have symptoms from spreading them,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) states here.\n\nProfessor Guy Marks, a respiratory physician and epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales, told AFP in an email on July 29: \"Wearing a face mask prevents us from infecting others and reduces the risk of acquiring infection. It has no other effects, including no direct effects on the immune system.\"\n\nThe American Lung Association also notes in this article debunking face masks conspiracy theories that \u201cthere is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.\u201d\n\nAccording to this July 2020 academic paper, since there \u201cis no registered medicine or vaccine against COVID-19, our immune system is the best defense.\u201d\n\nThe report, which was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Infection and Public Health, adds that \u201cwhen our body encounters any germs or viruses for the first time, the immune system cannot work properly and we become sick. The same thing has happened in the case of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nProfessor Marks added: \"When we are infected with the virus, we produce antibodies against that virus in an attempt to overcome the infection. It is not yet clear how effective these antibodies are in preventing future infection and, if they are effective, how long this protection lasts. Spreading the virus to create immunity is NOT a good way to combat the virus because many people will become very ill and some will die along that pathway. A vaccine, when we have one, may be useful for creating immunity. Until then, we have to do everything we can to prevent the spread of the infection.\"\n\nNoting the importance of a healthy immune system, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO specifically encourage immunocompromised individuals to wear face masks as an additional layer of health protection.\n\nAFP previously debunked misinformation about face masks and COVID-19 here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
