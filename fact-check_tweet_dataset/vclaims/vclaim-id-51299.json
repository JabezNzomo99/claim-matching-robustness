The viral message lists out respiratory symptoms of Covid-19 and compares them with other diseases.\n\nMultiple Facebook users have posted the message, which purportedly lists out the differences in symptoms between Covid-19, flu and common cold.\n\nThe viral message goes like this:\n\nPathology department AIIMS, Delhi\n\n*Make this message available to as many people as possible!*\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading claim. AIIMS has not released any such statement, comparing symptoms of different diseases. The message, falsely attributed to AIIMS, also gives misleading information about Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. The post is viral on Facebook.\n\nAIIMS has a separate portal on Covid-19 and it had also released a basic advisory and guideline about the disease.\n\nAIIMS has identified some common symptoms of the disease, including \u201cfever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath\u201d. The guide also mentions that the indications of having Covid-19 are \u201csimilar to the symptoms of any viral infection, like the common cold, influenza\u201d. But nowhere does it compare the symptoms of different diseases.\n\nWe found some similarities between the viral message and an article published on March 18 on the website of former Indian Medical Association president Dr KK Agarwal.\n\nA paragraph about coronavirus symptoms on the website reads, \u201cSymptoms: fever, tiredness, and dry cough (most common); only cough (pollution), cough and cold (allergy), fever with sore throat in children (streptococcal), fever above 100.4 with cough and cold (flu), fever with cough and breathlessness (corona like illness), cough > 2 weeks rule out TB. No fever no flu no corona; No breathlessness no seriousness, no breathlessness no oxygen requirement no seriousness\u201d.\n\nThe symptoms mentioned in the viral post about Covid-19 are also misleading. The World Health Organization (WHO) states, \u201cCOVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.\u201d\n\nThere are also asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 where the patient never develops any symptom but carries the virus in the body. A report published in \u201cThe Lancet\u201d says, \u201cAccording to data from the Indian Government, more than 80% of confirmed cases in India are asymptomatic, making the population vulnerable to community spread of the virus.\u201d\n\nBut the viral post never mentions about asymptomatic cases. Hence, the viral post about Covid-19 symptoms is not only misleading, but also falsely attributed to AIIMS.", "lang": "en"}
