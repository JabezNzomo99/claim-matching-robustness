The blog Conservative Politicus had the stirring headline \"U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident after all,\" on June 17.\n\nThis has the essential ingredients to meet the appetite of any conspiracy fan: Clintons, a legal case and a dead man.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean those elements are on the money.\n\nYes, Ashe died in 2016, and yes, there was a criminal case. But no, he wasn\u2019t going to testify against either Bill or Hillary Clinton.\n\nNow, for the back story.\n\nJohn Ashe represented Antigua and Barbuda at the United Nations and at one time served as president of the General Assembly. In October 2015, the FBI accused Ashe of receiving at least $500,000 in bribes to benefit a Chinese businessman named Ng Lap Seng.\n\nNg isn\u2019t a household name today but back in 1998, a Senate report identified him as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign in the mid 1990s. Ng visited the White House 10 times.\n\nThat is the known extent of any Clinton connection.\n\nIn June 2016, the rumor-busting website Snopes asked the office of the U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York if their case involved either Clinton. A spokesman said not at all.\n\nThe complaint against Ashe makes no mention of the Clintons.\n\nAshe wasn\u2019t scheduled to testify against the Clintons. He was slated for what the spokesman described to Snopes as a standard pre-trial meeting.\n\nAs for Ashe\u2019s death, he died at home in June 2016 when a barbell crushed his throat. That happened near the time he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors. The death was ruled an accident.\n\nSeveral conspiracy-minded posts emerged soon after his death. One about a month afterward included Ashe\u2019s name with two others who allegedly died under mysterious circumstances. The one common thread was a tie to the Clintons.\n\nA conservative blog revived a year-old rumor that a UN official died shortly before he was going to testify against the Clintons. While the man did die and he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors, that\u2019s the extent of the accuracy here.\n\nProsecutors said Ashe had received at least half a million dollars in bribes, and he was headed for trial. The case had no connection to the Clintons, except that the man who allegedly provided the bribe had illegally given to Democrats about 20 years earlier.\n\nThe official autopsy found he died in an accident and no evidence suggests otherwise.", "lang": "en"}
