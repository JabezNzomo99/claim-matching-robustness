This is false; the article in question was posted on a website that describes itself as satirical, but the joke has been lost in transit.\n\nFani-Kayode posted the link on May 17 to the website World News Daily Report, with the caption: \u201cA man is sentenced to death in Pakistan for farting in a mosque during Ramadan. What is the world coming to?\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode\u2019s post (archived here) was shared by more than 400 people and has over 1,200 comments, many of them blaming Islam for the man\u2019s death or praising Christianity for being a more \u201cmerciful\u201d religion.\n\nFani-Kayode, who has verified accounts on both Facebook and Twitter, also tweeted the same story -- but with no link this time. The tweet was shared by more than 1,800 people.\n\nScannews, a Nigerian website with a history of sharing false information, had last year also picked up the story, which was shared on Facebook more than 600 times.\n\nFollowing the link to the original article posted on World News Daily Report, we can see that the website\u2019s own social media counter claims it has been shared at least 160,000 times. But Crowdtangle, a social media tracker owned by Facebook, indicates that the article had been shared only 14,724 times as of May 21, 2019.\n\nAccording to CrowdTangle, the top sharer is the Facebook page \u201cNo sharia law - Never ever give up Australia\u201d. The June 2017 post has been shared at least 1,000 times. Again, many of those commenting on it took the post at face value, saying it was proof of the brutality of Islam.\n\nBut a close look at the World News Daily Report website shows that it bears the tagline: \u201cWhere facts don\u2019t matter\u201d.\n\nIn addition to this, the website carries a disclaimer stating that all its stories are satirical and fictional in nature.\n\n\u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content,\u201d it reads.\n\nAs for the man seen in the photo in the article, a reverse image search led us to this story in the Ottawa Citizen, a Canadian newspaper.\n\nIt names the man as Behnam Yaali, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison in June 2018 for killing his ex-girlfriend Christina Voelzing.", "lang": "en"}
