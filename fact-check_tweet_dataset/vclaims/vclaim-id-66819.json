For example, the crime rate actually ticked up during his first year in office, only to subsequently come down.\n\nFor this fact check we will review the statistics on the number of people shot in the city. (Police do not tally the number of reports of shots being fired, a statistic the city doesn't keep because it can be impossible to tell the difference between a gun going off and fireworks, for example.\n\nThe LeadHERship pamphlet cites , story in The Providence Journal that refers to \"a constant drumbeat of violence in the capital city over the past three years with more than 100 shootings annually.\" That covers 2011-2013.\n\nAnd what about 2014?\n\nWhen we emailed American LeadHERship PAC founder Kate Coyne-McCoy to find out if the total had reach 100 for 2014, she referred us to our July 24 PolitiFact item, which reported 61 shootings through July 12, 2014. The total was 69 as of this writing, so it could hit 100 by year's end, but it's not even close to that yet.\n\nSo the number of shootings has not hit 100 for \"each year\" of the Taveras administration.\n\nThe LeadHERship statement also ignores some significant context: The number of shootings, which peaked at 108 in 2011, declined in the subsequent two years of Taveras' tenure, dropping to 105 in 2012 and 100 in 2013.\n\nBefore Taveras took office, the numbers were lower but steadily increasing. The annual total was 47 shootings in 2006 (during the tenure of his predecessor, David Cicilline), 58 in 2007, 77 in 2008, 86 in 2009, and 90 in 2010, Cicilline's final year, before jumping sharply to 108 during Taveras' first year.\n\nBecause the statement is mostly accurate but ignores important context, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
