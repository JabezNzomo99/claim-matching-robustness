This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.\u201d\n\nExcept Monnet doesn\u2019t seem to have ever said this.\n\nAccording to writer Adrian Hilton, the quote actually comes from his 1997 book \u2018The Principality and Power of Europe\u2019 in which he summarised his impression of Monnet\u2019s intentions. The first line of the supposed quote seems to paraphrase his book, but the second is taken verbatim:\n\n\u201cHe believed in the Catholic vision that Europe should become a federal superstate, into which all ancient nations would be fused\u2026 For this to be achieved without the peoples of Europe realising what was happening, the plan was to be accomplished in successive steps. Each was to be disguised as having an economic purpose, but all, taken together, would inevitably and irreversibly lead to federation.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve not yet been able to verify the text in Mr Hilton\u2019s book.\n\nThe quote image Ms Hoey shared seems to have originated on the website AZ Quotes. It is no longer listed on the \u2018Jean Monnet\u2019 page, but it does appear to have been listed there back in 2015 and 2016. It does appear on other quote websites, attributed to Monnet and has been circulating online for some time, with some people attributing it to Monnet in the 1940s when they post it.", "lang": "en"}
