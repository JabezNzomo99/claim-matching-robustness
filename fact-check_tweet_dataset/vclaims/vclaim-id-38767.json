It then lists various health professions for which the starting salary is under \u00a325,600.\n\nIt isn\u2019t correct to say that these professions are classed as unskilled. Newly qualified people in these roles, with the exception of care assistants, meet the immigration skills threshold. Care assistants do meet the threshold in certain circumstances. These claims stem from the government\u2019s recent announcement that it would be introducing a \u201cpoints-based\u201d immigration system .\n\nWhat is the new system?\n\nNot all the details of the new immigration system have been confirmed.\n\nHowever, what we know is that under the new system, all applicants must:\n\u2022 be applying for a job \u201cat appropriate skill level\u201d,\n\u2022 and have a job offer from an approved sponsor\n\nIn addition they must meet a salary level which varies depending on circumstances.\n\nTheir salary offer must be:\n\u2022 Between \u00a323,040 and \u00a325,999 provided they also have a PhD in a subject relevant to the job or are applying for a job in a shortage occupation, or\n\u2022 Between \u00a320,480 and \u00a323,039, provided they also have a PhD in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subject relevant to the job, or are applying for a job in a shortage occupation\n\nIn general, visa applicants must also have a salary offer at the \u201cgoing rate\u201d, which essentially means that they are paid competitively for the job they\u2019re applying for. However, there will be exceptions to this requirement for some occupations that work on published pay scales, and also for new entrants.\n\nThe tweet implies that as new starters to the NHS in various roles have salaries below the required minimum, and so the government considers nurses, paramedics, midwives, radiographers, care assistants, physiotherapists and occupational therapists \u201cunskilled.\u201d\n\nIt implies this by correctly listing the starting salary of \u00a324,200 for all these roles, with the exception of care assistants who start on \u00a317,600.\n\nBut jobs aren\u2019t classed as skilled based on salary. The skills threshold is set at something called \u201cregulation qualification\u201d level 3 (RQF 3) or above.\n\nAll of these professions listed except care assistants are at RQF 6 and so meet the skills threshold.\n\nCare assistants only meet the government\u2019s immigration skills threshold if they have a certain level of seniority and/or experience.\n\nAdditionally, someone with a job offer to do any of the listed jobs apart from care assistants and physiotherapists would be immediately eligible to apply for a work visa under the new system because they are considered shortage occupations. This is provided they meet the other mandatory criteria of being able to speak English and have a salary offer of \u00a320,480 or above.\n\nAll the starting salaries mentioned in the image are correct, for England in 2019/20.\n\nQualified nurses tend to start on a band 5, which is currently \u00a324,214. Paramedics, midwives, radiographers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists also start at a band 5.\n\nCare assistants tend to start on a band 2, which is \u00a317,652.", "lang": "en"}
