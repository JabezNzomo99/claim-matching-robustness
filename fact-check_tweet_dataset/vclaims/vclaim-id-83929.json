While the Bharatiya Janata Party demands a floor test, the house has been in session for more than a week. Meanwhile JDS-Congress leaders are stalling the floor test while BJP insists on conducting it. The coalition government also missed two deadlines set by Governor Vala to hold the floor test.\n\nThe letter which bears the seal of the government of Karnataka is dated July 22, 2019 and bears Kumaraswamy's signature.\n\nThe letter is addressed to 'His Excellency The Governor of Karnataka' and states, 'Due to my personal reasons, I'm tendering my resignation letter from the post of chief minister of Karnataka. Kindly accept my resignation and relieve the council of the minister of Karnataka appointed by me on 22/07/2019.'\n\nThe CM could be seen holding the letter during the ongoing assembly session.\n\nA few minutes after the letter started doing the rounds on social media, Kumaraswamy addressed the house and denied ever having issued or written such a resignation letter.\n\n\u201cLook at the kind of politics BJP is perpetrating,\" Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, said.\n\n\"They have created a fake resignation letter and the electronic media is showing it. It is on social media.\" Calling the act \"cheap publicity\" he said, \" someone has forged my signature and shared it on social media\"", "lang": "en"}
