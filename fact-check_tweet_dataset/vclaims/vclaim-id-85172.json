The most controversial proposal by the group is an expansion of veterans\u2019 health-care options in the private marketplace \u2014 which critics, including traditional veterans advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers, say could lead to the dismantling of the current VA.\n\nIn 2014, in response to a nationwide controversy over manipulation of appointment wait-time data at VA medical facilities, Congress overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan $16.3 billion bill to overhaul VA. The new law funded a temporary expansion of veterans\u2019 health-care options in the private market, if veterans waited longer than 30 days for appointments or if they live far from a VA facility. The Senate agreed to the conference report on a 91-to-3 vote and the House on a 420-to-5 vote. Takano, the ranking Democrat on the House veterans affairs committee, and Tester, who next year will become the ranking Democrat on the equivalent Senate committee, voted for the legislation, which President Obama signed into law.\n\nMore than 30 percent of VA\u2019s appointments are provided in the private market, VA Secretary Robert McDonald said in a Dec. 3, 2016, interview with Fortune magazine. He said he is \u201cagainst wholesale privatization\u201d but supports \u201ctaking advantage of the private sector to provide the additional capability we don\u2019t have.\u201d VA allows veterans to get non-VA health care in certain circumstances when VA is not available to provide the care.\n\nThe crux of the proposal is to split up the current Veterans Health Administration\u2019s payer and provider responsibilities by creating two entities, one for health insurance (Veterans Health Insurance Program, or VHIP) and another for health delivery (Veterans Accountable Care Organization, or VACO). We described this provision at length in an earlier fact check, so you can read more about it here.\n\nBut there is no requirement in the CVA proposal to divert a certain amount of VA resources to private care or to require veterans to use private care. It does not require VA medical centers and clinics to shut down. It does, however, allow for a panel appointed by the president to review whether certain VA medical centers should be shut down because they are inefficient or unused, on the basis of the distribution of veteran populations. The money saved from closing these facilities would go toward health coverage for veterans.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there is a limited amount of money that can be used to keep VA facilities operating and properly staffed. If those limited dollars are instead diverted to the private sector, which often trails the VA in both quality and timeliness of care, the system will collapse,\u201d Tester spokeswoman Marnee Banks said in a statement. \u201cSen. Tester believes there is a place for supplementing VA care with private care, especially in rural America (as he noted in his speech), but relying primarily on the private market to provide care could lead to the agency\u2019s dismantling.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, it drains the VA of the resources it needs and triggers an inevitable death spiral for the VHA, leaving private care as the primary option for veterans. This is why we are seeing veterans groups speak out against them. CVA\u2019s effort to replace VA\u2019s central role in veterans care with the private sector, thereby starving the VA of resources, is what Rep. Takano defines as privatization,\u201d Weisz said.", "lang": "en"}
