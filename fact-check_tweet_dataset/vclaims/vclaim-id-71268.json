And in this world, will people be rationed 1.2 ounces per week of lab-created protein by a one-world government? No, these claims are not true. Together, the assertions are another example of conspiracy hoaxes that have taken hold since the novel coronavirus spread late last year from Wuhan, China, across the world.\n\nPut simply, the World Economic Forum exists to boost every nation economically, including seeing countries through the coronavirus pandemic that has sent many economies spiraling, including that of the United States.\n\nThe claims surfaced in a video (archived here) posted by Celeste Solum on YouTube on March 30, 2020. The video opens, in part, with:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nSolum, who claims to have previously worked in sensitive U.S. government positions, said that service was meant for her to \"glean information\" to bring to people \"for these days and these times.\"\n\nShe makes a host of assertions after viewing a video by the World Economic Forum. The WEF video on YouTube is captioned:\n\nIn the video, the WEF uses a circular logo with radiating short lines to demonstrate its plan to improve human endeavors through technology. But Solum tells her viewers that the spiky circular design of the logo is the COVID-19 virus, and that \"it is being used to inject, like snake venom, global governance into the world.\"\n\nAlso in her 32-minute video, she says that the global government will \"protect the livelihoods of people within the system, the beast or the new world order.\" Solum also says this forum-led global domination will not allow us to eat groceries as we do now. Instead, it will ration us \"1.2 ounces of a lab-created protein per week - no meat whatsoever - and 36 grams of carbs - no sugar - every 21 days.\"\n\nAmong the broader claims is this:\n\nBut in reality, the WEF is the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation and is \"committed to improving the state of the world.\" The forum's video on YouTube describes ways to end world hunger and improve the environment, with climate activist Greta Thunberg as a guest speaker on \"Averting a Climate Apocolypse.\"\n\nLead Stories has already debunked the idea that a One World Order and 5G are behind the coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
