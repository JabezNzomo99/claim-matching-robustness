No, that's just an absurd story and normally it would be too crazy even for us to fact check. But we are doing it anyway because the photo is interesting and so is the source of the translated and copy pasted text.\n\nThe story appeared in an article published on November 30, 2018 by the Journal des Insolites titled \"Un homme se fait greff\u00e9 le cerveau de sa femme pour conna\u00eetre tous ses amants\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn September, during a revolutionary medical intervention, a man whose brain had been replaced by the brain of his wife, discovered that his wife was cheating on him with more than 27 men, his uncle, his son-in-law and even his boss . Robertson, 53, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was miraculously saved from brain cancer a few months ago by a successful brain transplant from his late wife. He received the brain of his 37-year-old wife who died in a car accident and the operation had unforeseen consequences for the poor man. Mr. Phil says he was shocked by what he discovered in his wife's brain that he had almost committed suicide\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe exact same picture was used yesterday in a satirical story on a Canadian site about a man getting a brain transplant with a female brain and losing the ability to drive (although the picture is from a real patient who had a revolutionary new operation):\n\nFake News: Man Did NOT Have Woman's Brain Transplanted and Did NOT Have Five Car Crashes in Two Weeks | Lead Stories Did a man named Phil Robertson from Scranton in Pennsylvania get a brain transplant of a woman who died in a car accident and did he subsequently have five car crashes in two weeks? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that often posts fictional articles about weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or general oddities.\n\nMost of the rest of the article seems to have been copied and translated as well, with just some edits here and there to add the angle about the lovers.\n\nThe site that posted the story features a disclaimer that reads:\n\n24Jours.com assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of some of its articles and the fictional nature of certain content. All the characters appearing in certain articles on this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.
