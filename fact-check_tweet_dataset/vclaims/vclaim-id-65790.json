{"title": "Was Op-Ed by Hitler Published by New York Times in 1941?", "subtitle": "The publication of the dictator's piece on propaganda wasn't necessarily a tacit endorsement of it.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-04T11:38:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-65790", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hitler-op-ed/", "vclaim": "The piece, which was not published on (or opposite) the New York Times' editorial page, cannot accurately be described as an \"op-ed.\" Rather, the excerpt was meant to elucidate for American readers what the editors described as Nazi Germany's \"psychological war against this country.\"\n\nAn excerpt from \"Mein Kampf,\" Adolf Hitler's manifesto, was published in New York Times Magazine in 1941 under the title \"The Art of Propaganda.\"\n\nOn June 3, 2020, The New York Times published an op-ed by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton entitled \u201cSend in the Troops,\u201d which argued that President Donald Trump should use military force to put an end to the nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice that followed the killing of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nThe op-ed sparked backlash, with many arguing that giving publicity to such an opinion put the lives of protesters, as well as black staffers at The New York Times, in danger.\n\nThe New York News Guild also released a statement that they were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the publishing of this column.\n\nAs the backlash grew online, some argued that The New York Times\u2019 publishing of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise since \u201cThe Gray Lady\u201d had also published an op-ed by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler back in 1941.\n\nThis is a genuine image of an article that was published in New York Times Magazine in 1941. However, \u201cop-ed\u201d may not be the best descriptor for this content, as it is actually an excerpt from Hitler\u2019s manifesto \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d\n\nIt was preceded by an introductory paragraph explaining that Germany was at that time waging a war of propaganda against the United States based on principles Hitler himself outlined in the excerpt:\n\nGermany is now waging a psychological war against this country as well as a military war in other parts of the world. That psychological war is based on the principles of propaganda laid down by Adolf Hitler in his autobiography \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d Below the book\u2019s most important passages on propaganda are published.\n\nThis was therefore not a case of the Times providing op-ed space for a particular political view, but rather to educate its readers about the propaganda methods being used against Americans by the Nazis.\n\nThis article from New York Times Magazine can be found in the newspaper\u2019s \u201ctime machine.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
