Similar claims were made on social media platforms as well. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of a few men cutting a cake engraved with Pakistan flag is that of Malabar Gold directors celebrating Pakistan\u2019s Independence Day. Fact: The photo is that of a celebration event organised by \u2018UAE EXCHANGE\u2019 company. So, the claim that the men seen cutting the cake are Malabar Gold Directors stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo in the post is run through the reverse image search, it is found that the photo is in circulation since 2016. Owing to its virality, \u2018Malabar Gold and Diamonds\u2019 has in a Facebook post provided clarification about the photograph. The post states \u201cMALICIOUS CAMPAIGN AGAINST MALABAR GOLD AND DIAMONDS \n\nLast couple of days a photograph of a cake cutting event, the image shown below, has been circulating in the social media and WhatsApp alleging that it belongs to Malabar Gold and Diamonds. This CAKE CUTTING EVENT is NOT CONNECTED with MALABAR GOLD AND DIAMONDS. The image is that of a celebration event done by UAE EXCHANGE another Indian company based out of Middle East and has NO RELATION with MALABAR GOLD AND DIAMONDS\u201d.\n\nThe company has also attached a collage as a proof to suggest the men cutting the cake are the employees of \u2018UAE EXCHANGE\u2019. This collage can be seen below.\n\nThe Facebook post of \u2018UAEExchange UAE\u2019 seen in the collage can be found here. Newspaper articles that reported about this issue can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, a photograph of \u2018UAE Exchange\u2019 staff cutting a cake engraved with Pakistan flag is falsely shared as that of \u2018Malabar Gold directors celebrating Pakistan Independence Day\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
