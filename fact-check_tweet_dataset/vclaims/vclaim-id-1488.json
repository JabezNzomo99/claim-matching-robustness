Silly us; turns out that money isn\u2019t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we\u2019re off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his \u201cGeorge\u201d magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I\u2019m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking \u2014 and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. Rubio\u2019s press conference yesterday AM was good and should be repeated in its entirety, not just in nibbles. I will attend the Clinton fundraiser here next week but as I can only afford the low level of participation may just get to wave without a \u201chello.\u201d I fear we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be simply explained or fully understood, so it is and will reamin interesting!\n\nAccording to alarmist web sites such as Conservative Tribune, InfoWars, Natural News, and others, Ivey had proclaimed nothing short of a Clinton \u201cmaster plan\u201d for maintaining political control via \u201can unaware and compliant citizenry.\u201d InfoWars summarized his message in particularly damning terms:\n\nTo emphasize, Ivey admits that the left has \u2018conspired\u2019 to \u201cproduce an unaware and compliant citizenry\u201d but that they\u2019re not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem. He characterizes \u201cunawareness\u201d amongst the public as a positive thing for the Clinton campaign. Ivey ends the email by saying he will attend a Clinton fundraiser and that he fears, \u201cwe are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be simply explained or fully understood.\u201d The email is a shocking insight into the elitist and arrogant mindset that pervades the Clinton campaign, with Americans viewed as dumb sheep who need to be herded in the right direction.\n\nA more objective reading suggests that Ivey was actually stating the opposite, however \u2014 that a lack of awareness and a tendency toward compliance on the part of the citizenry in recent years was the result of the conflation of entertainment and the electoral process (as exemplified by the rise of Donald Trump), and these phenomena present a problem for democracy which must be countered.\n\nSnopes.com reached out to Bill Ivey for clarification of his intended meaning. which he rephrased for us as follows:\n\nIf these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this: \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking\u2026\u201d No \u201cmaster-of-the-universe\u201d conspiracy; just a lament that leaders and policy makers have not been sufficiently attentive to some of the basics that make our democracy great.", "lang": "en"}
