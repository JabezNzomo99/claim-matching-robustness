It opened to foot traffic on May 27, 1937, sometimes referred to as Pedestrian Day, and to vehicular traffic the following day, according to the Golden Gate Bridge website.\n\nA reverse image search revealed that this image does not depict the public opening of the Golden Gate Bridge on Pedestrian Day. Taken by photographer Deanne Fitzmaurice for the San Francisco Chronicle, the picture actually shows a large crowd at the celebration of the bridge\u2019s 50th anniversary in 1987, according to its caption.

However, it did not cause permanent damage nor were there any serious concerns from engineers that the bridge would collapse under the crowd\u2019s weight, according to Mercury News.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen,\u201d Mark Ketchum, a San Francisco bridge engineer, told Mercury News in 2012. \u201cBut it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
