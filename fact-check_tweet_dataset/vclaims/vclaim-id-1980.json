Tom McArthur (R-N.J.), which helped the plan attract votes that led to its passage. The amendment allowed states to seek waivers from a \u201ccontinuous coverage\u201d provision that otherwise would boost insurance rates by 30 percent for one year if a person has a lapse in insurance coverage for more than two months.\n\nA person who fell into this category would face insurance rates that could be based on their individual condition, for one year. (States that seek a waiver would need to provide ways to help make up the difference in costs.) After that, people would qualify for prices at the community rate, rather than based on their individual conditions. This would not affect people with employer-funded health coverage; the individual market, including the Obamacare exchanges, currently serves about 18 million Americans.\n\nOne prominent example is Christina Turner, former insurance underwriter who was prescribed anti-AIDS medicine as a precaution after she was sexually assaulted. Turner, then 45 years old, was quoted in news reports in October 2009 saying she was unable to obtain insurance coverage because insurers told her that the HIV medication raised too many health concerns. Recent media coverage all linked back to one Huffington Post article, even though health coverage has changed since then.\n\nRoland pointed to these pre-Obamacare conditions, when insurers \u201ccould discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 including sexual assault, rape and domestic violence. Under the Republican plan, states would be able to opt out of protections for pre-existing conditions \u2014 meaning insurers would once again be able to discriminate against survivors of rape and sexual violence.\u201d\n\nUnder Obamacare, insurers are prohibited from discriminating against a host of health status-related factors for the purposes of eligibility. This list of factors includes a broad term called \u201chealth status,\u201d and then other specific factors such as medical conditions (both mental and physical), claims experience, genetic information, disability and evidence of insurability, including conditions relating to acts of domestic violence. Obamacare also says insurers can only use four basic factors, such as age and geographical location, to determine rates for premiums and deductibles.\n\nAHCA specifically addresses states\u2019 abilities to get a waiver so that \u201chealth status\u201d is no longer protected from underwriting, according to a House Energy and Commerce aide. But other protections remain in place \u2014 including for mental conditions and conditions relating to acts of domestic violence \u2014 and are still protected from being incorporated into insurance underwriting, according to the aide.\n\nStates and the Secretary of Health and Human Services would decide how to interpret \u201chealth status.\u201d State waivers must be approved by the federal government. Opponents of AHCA say that because \u201chealth status\u201d is up for interpretation, there is no control in the bill to prevent rising costs for survivors of rape and sexual assault.\n\n\u201cDomestic violence\u201d is not always interchangeable with sexual assault, including rape. All but two states (Idaho and Vermont) enacted key provisions of a 1999 model legislation by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to ban insurers from discriminating against sexual abuse survivors, according to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade association for 1,300 health insurance companies. The organization, which said AHCA \u201cneeds important improvements,\u201d said: \u201cOur perspective is that of course survivors of domestic abuse and rape should be covered.\u201d\n\nBottom line: Almost all states (at least 45 to 48) have their own laws protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Even if AHCA became law as currently written, state law still determines what can and cannot be used for rating, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nSexual assault survivors depend on a range of ambulatory and emergency services and hospitalization. They experience trauma linked to poor health outcomes that last for years after the assault. And not all survivors may disclose in the underwriting process that their symptoms are related to sexual assault. So that does leave some uncertainty as to how survivors would be affected under AHCA.\n\nAt least 45 states prohibit insurance discrimination like this. Then, it takes several leaps of imagination to assume that survivors of rape and sexual assault will face higher premiums as a result of conditions relating to their abuse. A person would need to be in the individual or small-group market (most Americans under 65 are on employer-provided plans), in a state that sought waivers, and in one of two to five states that did not prohibit insurance-company discrimination against survivors of sexual abuse.\n\nWe always say at The Fact Checker that the more complicated the topic, the more susceptible it is to spin. Both media coverage and hyperbole among advocates are at fault for creating a misleading representation of the House GOP health bill. We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios, but the out-of-control rhetoric and the numerous assumptions pushed us to Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
