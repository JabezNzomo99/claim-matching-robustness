It was \u201ca torn piece of copy paper with black handwriting on it,\u201d as she puts it in her 2012 book, \u201cGrace and Grit.\u201d The note, she said, listed her salary, along with three managers, and her salary \u201cwas exactly correct, down to the dollar.\u201d The document indicated that she was making much less money than her male counterparts.\n\nIn June of 1998, Ledbetter was involuntarily transferred to a new position \u2014 a technology engineer. She then was suspended for three days after making an error that required the company to scrap 200 tires. (She said she had not been properly trained and her suspension was more severe than similar mistakes by men.) She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that she had been a victim of sex discrimination, eventually citing the job transfer, the suspension and the fact her pay was less than male area managers.\n\nSt. Clair: \u201cSo you knew in 1992 that you were being paid less than your peers?\u201d St. Clair: \u201cAnd you knew that throughout 1993, 1994 and 1995?\u201d Ledbetter: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much at that time. \u2026 I didn\u2019t learn that until \u2013 how much difference until probably about 1994 and \u201995.\u201d St. Clair: \u201cAnd when you came to know in 1994 or 1995 exactly how much you were earning less than your peers, how did you come to know that?\u201d Ledbetter: \u201cGosh, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t really know. I don\u2019t really remember that.\u201d\n\nBut here, we are going to forgo a Pinocchio ruling. Obama\u2019s language was imprecise, but in general it reflects the basic outlines of the case. At this point, few would dispute that Ledbetter was a victim of sex discrimination; the issue before the Supreme Court was whether her complaint was timely. Ultimately, because the court decided that she did not file suit within the correct time frame, she never earned the back pay that she believed she was owed. Still, as the court noted, the outcome might have been different if she and her lawyers had pursued a claim under the Equal Pay Act.", "lang": "en"}
