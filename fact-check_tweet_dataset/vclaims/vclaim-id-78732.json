David Vitter entered the Louisiana governor\u2019s race this year as the clear front-runner. But a prostitution scandal from years ago has left Vitter, a veteran Republican with widespread name recognition in the deep red state, in a difficult race against a lesser-known Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards.\n\nIn Louisiana\u2019s open primary on Oct. 24, Edwards finished first among four candidates; Vitter was a distant second. Two weeks later, Edwards\u2019 campaign released an ad called \"The Choice.\" It highlights Vitter\u2019s connection to \"D.C. Madam\" Deborah Palfrey, which was revealed in 2007 when an investigator working for Hustler obtained phone records from Palfrey and .\n\nVitter\u2019s connection to Palfrey isn\u2019t new. For years he avoided the issue after obliquely addressing it in 2007. It apparently had little effect on his 2010 bid for a second term in the Senate, . But his connection to the D.C. Madam has percolated in as .\n\nEdwards\u2019 ad, released the day before early voting began for the general election, put the issue on TV screens throughout the state. After it was released, \"Meet the Press\" host it \"might be the most vicious negative ad ever.\"\n\nThe ad features a female narrator who says:\n\nThe choice for governor couldn\u2019t be more clear. John Bel Edwards, who answered our country\u2019s call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute\u2019s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom. David Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots. Now the choice is yours.\n\nThe ad makes two claims about Vitter: He skipped a vote for a resolution honoring American soldiers killed in the line of duty, and he answered a call from Palfrey\u2019s phone soon after. It then concludes that Vitter \"chose prostitutes over patriots,\" suggesting the two are related.\n\nThe basics are not hard to substantiate.\n\nThen-U.S. Rep. David Vitter did, in fact, . On Feb. 27, 2001, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution to honor 28 soldiers killed in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, with 395 votes in favor. Two congressmen answered \"present\" but did not vote. Vitter was one of 35 marked absent.\n\nWe asked Vitter\u2019s campaign where he was that day, but the campaign declined to answer.\n\nThere were no other roll-call votes that day, according to House records, nor were there any the day before, the first day after a congressional recess.\n\nThat vote was recorded at 5:27 p.m. ET. Thirty-nine minutes later, at 6:06 p.m. in Washington, a call was placed from Palfrey\u2019s cell phone to Vitter\u2019s, according to her cell phone records . It lasted about a minute.\n\nHowever, the presence of a call on a phone bill doesn\u2019t mean that Vitter picked up, rather than his voicemail. (If you find this fascinating, we recommend the podcast \"Serial,\" which .)\n\nVitter has never directly admitted or denied patronizing Palfrey\u2019s service, though he\u2019s come close. In 2007, after media outlets reported Hustler\u2019s findings, he apologized in a statement for a \" \" but didn\u2019t elaborate. He\u2019s been similarly evasive during this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race.\n\nIn an ad his campaign released after \"The Choice,\" Vitter says, \"Fifteen years ago, I failed my family,\" but it . Asked this week during a debate if he took the call, .\n\nLikewise, Vitter\u2019s campaign did not respond to our questions about the ad. Edwards\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for additional evidence beyond what\u2019s cited in the ad. (Palfrey died in 2008.)\n\nWith Vitter unwilling to talk, we wondered if he was even in Washington that day, considering that Feb. 27, 2001, was Mardi Gras.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal in Louisiana, and Vitter has for the holiday. Considering that Carnival coincided with Congress\u2019 winter break, it was possible that Vitter was back in Louisiana.\n\nBut he was in Washington that night. As Louisiana State University Professor Robert Mann , President George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. Vitter is visible in the audience about and .\n\nMoreover, a House report, detailing members\u2019 use of congressional funds for office and travel expenses, shows that Vitter . Flight records from the show five direct flights from New Orleans to Washington-area airports that day prior to Bush\u2019s speech. Arrival times ranged from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nThere, our reporting on this track reached a dead end.\n\nEdwards\u2019 ad says Vitter took a call from a prostitute minutes after skipping the vote. The only thing we don\u2019t know is if Vitter answered his phone. Even if he didn\u2019t, he has still been connected to the D.C. Madam.\n\n\"The Choice\" doesn\u2019t quite close the deal in suggesting that Vitter missed the vote because of his dealings with a prostitute, which is what it suggests when it says he \"chose prostitutes over patriots.\"\n\nBut the key parts of the statement in question \u2014 that Vitter \"answered a prostitute\u2019s call minutes after he skipped a vote\" \u2014 are accurate. We rate this statement Mostly True.\n\nThis story was published in collaboration with , a nonprofit, public-interest newsroom that covers the New Orleans area. Donate now to support The Lens.
