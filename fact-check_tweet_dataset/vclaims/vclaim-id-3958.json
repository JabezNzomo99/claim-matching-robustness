Last week\u2019s \u201c92%\u201d headline drew some criticism for this, and although the headline is now a bit more cautious in saying instead that 100,000 had voted to exit the EU, it still says the poll \u201cproves\u201d that Britain wants to leave.\n\nThe \u2018remain\u2019 side has been slightly ahead for the past four months, according to the \u201cpoll of polls\u201d published by non-partisan information site What UK Thinks: EU. This is the average level of support across the six most recently published professional polls. At the time of writing, \u2018remain\u2019 has 51% and \u2018leave\u2019 has 49%.\n\nPollsters might not have the best reputation at the moment, after they consistently underestimated the Conservative\u2019s lead over Labour in last May\u2019s general election. An inquiry into the issue found that Conservative voters were underrepresented in poll samples.\n\nDifferent methods produce different results\u2014so far in the EU referendum campaign we\u2019ve seen that telephone polls are more likely to find a lead for the \u2018remain\u2019 camp than online polls are.\n\nSo no poll, or poll of polls, should be taken as the definitive answer on this.\n\nBut professional pollsters do at least try to get a representative result, for example by choosing people at random. Online polls such as the Express\u2019s, on the other hand, are completed by whoever wants to complete them. Where they are featured and what they ask will attract specific types of people, and so represent their views rather than that of the average voter.\n\nWe are seeking a correction from the Express.", "lang": "en"}
