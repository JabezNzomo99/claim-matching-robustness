Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: In the image, Aamir Khan is standing with Junaid Samshed and Moulana Tariq, who are Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists. Fact: The persons standing beside Aamir Khan are Junaid Jamshed and Moulana Tariq but they are not terrorists. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords \u2018Aamir photo with Junaid and Tariq\u2019 on Google, it was found that the photo was taken in 2012 when Aamir went to Haj. The names of the persons standing next to Aamir Khan are Junaid Jamshed (not Junaid Samshed) and Maulana Tariq Jameel. Both of them are Pakistan nationals and Islamic preachers but they are not terrorists. In an event, Junaid Jamshed told his followers about when and where he met Aamir Khan. Also, Junaid Jamshed is not alive now, he died in a plane crash in 2016.\n\nTo sum it up, the persons standing next to Aamir Khan are not terrorists.\n\nDid you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
