The claim is false; the group was never registered to participate in the polls.\n\nAn image containing the claim was shared in this Facebook post on May 12, 2019, and also in this one published the following day.\n\nIt says that the Philippine national election authority, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), disqualified several groups days before polls opened.\n\nThe Philippines voted on May 13, 2019, to elect local and national legislators. Here is a government information page about the election.\n\nThe two false posts have been shared more than 300 times each. The caption of the May 13 Facebook post consists of three emojis \u2013 a thinking face, a flushed face, and a face with a monocle.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the false Facebook posts:\n\nThe image contained in the posts has the words \u201cLive Breaking News\u201d in the top left-hand corner and the COMELEC logo in the top right-hand corner.\n\nThere is also text in the image that has the Filipino-language headline: \u201cCOMELEC DISQUALIFIES FIVE PARTYLIST, DAYS BEFORE ELECTION.\u201d\n\nIt also says, in part: \u201cThe disqualification was rooted in the petition that was filed by Angel Aguilar at COMELEC to cancel the registration of the six partylist BAYAN MUNA, ANAK BAYAN, ANAK PAWIS, ACT-TEACHERS, GABRIELA, KABATAAN PARTYLIST.\u201d\n\n\u201cPartylist\u201d refers to a practice in the Philippines where a political party runs for the lower House of Representatives as a group, described in the country\u2019s law here.\n\nAFP has previously debunked similar claims that five of the six groups listed in the misleading posts \u2013 all of them except \u201cAnak Bayan\u201d \u2013 were disqualified from the elections, in this fact-check blog.\n\nAnak Bayan, or Anakbayan, describes itself as a \u201cnational democratic mass organization of the Filipino youth\u201d on its Facebook page.\n\nIt was not disqualified before the election; in fact it never qualified to be on the midterm ballot in the first place.\n\nHere is the official list of qualified partylists on the COMELEC website. Anakbayan is not on the list.\n\nThe group also confirmed it was not a candidate in the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running for the elections\u201d, Al Omaga, Anakbayan\u2019s media liaison officer, told AFP in a phone interview on May 14.", "lang": "en"}
