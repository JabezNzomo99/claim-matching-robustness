In the background a man can be heard saying, \"they have hurt our religious sentiments.\"\n\nThe video is viral from several Facebook pages and Twitter handles with different captions. Some captions go as far as saying 'after Kashmir, it's West Bengal's turn'.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the frames from the video and traced it back to 2015. The same video had been uploaded on YouTube on November 10, 2015 with the caption '25 idols of Maa Kali are desecrated at Hooghly, WB'.\n\nBOOM also found the same video, uploaded on a Right Wing page Welcome To Hinduism in 2015, accusing people from Muslim community of desecrating the idols.\n\nWe tried looking for news reports on the incident but could find none. BOOM also tried reaching the Hooghly police for more information and the report will updated once we hear from them.\n\nWhile BOOM could independently not establish where in West Bengal the video was from, we were able to trace it back to 2015.", "lang": "en"}
