They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s assertions, the Times\u2019 story never said that the coronavirus originated in Europe. Instead, the article details research findings that suggest a majority of the first cases of the coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, in New York City resulted from travelers from Europe.\n\n\u201cNew research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case,\u201d the story begins, \u201cand that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the virus started in Europe, only that the primary way the virus appears to have landed in the Big Apple was via Europe.\n\nThe story\u2019s author, science journalist Carl Zimmer, explained as much in an April 11 Twitter thread correcting the president. \u201cScientists wanted to know how the virus reached the city. Studying the virus\u2019s genes, they found the answer: mostly from Europe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe virus did not originate in Europe, but it got to New York through Europe.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the answer to Trump\u2019s insinuating question about whether there are any named sources \u2014 which would be apparent to anyone reading the article \u2014 is an emphatic yes. More than half a dozen scientists comment on the record, and there are no anonymous sources.\n\nOr, as Zimmer put it, \u201cUm, they\u2019re ALL named in the article. See for yourself.\u201d\n\nZimmer\u2019s article, \u201cMost New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe, Genomes Show,\u201d describes preliminary results from two hospital systems in the city that sequenced viral genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients. Because the virus is constantly mutating as it replicates, slight changes in the genomes can be used to infer where and how long those viruses were recently circulating \u2014 and help trace the spread of the virus across the globe.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System, for example, collected samples from 84 patients over the first few weeks of March, just after the first documented COVID-19 case in New York. The researchers\u2019 analysis, which has yet to be peer reviewed, concluded that while the virus entered the city on multiple occasions from different places, a large proportion of the genomes are most similar to those from Europe. The results were posted on the preprint server medRxiv on April 11.\n\nAnother research group at NYU Grossman School of Medicine came to a similar conclusion, noting in an April 9 press release that \u201cmost local viral samples indicate that they originated in Europe.\u201d\n\nAgain, this does not mean the novel coronavirus started in Europe, but that many New York cases stem from viruses that circulated in Europe, after the virus made its way out of China.\n\nZimmer interviewed two authors of the Mount Sinai report and the lead researcher of the NYU team; he also consulted four additional scientists.\n\nThe fact that the virus began infecting people in Asia is perhaps most clear from the family tree-type visualizations from Nextstrain, a project tracking the virus\u2019 evolution using sequences scientists around the world \u2014 including the two New York hospital systems \u2014 uploaded to a database.\n\nAs Zimmer pointed out in his story, \u201cThe deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the New York City results also have implications for his repeated claim that U.S. travel restrictions have been lifesaving.\n\nThe findings indicate that the virus, which goes by the name SARS-CoV-2, was being passed around for weeks prior to the first confirmed case in the city, which was announced on March 1. That suggests that the president\u2019s travel restrictions, which applied to China on Feb. 2, Iran on March 2 and the bulk of Europe on March 13, had little effect on the outbreak in New York City, which has been the largest in the country.\n\n\u201cOur data provide insight into the limited efficacy of travel restrictions for preventing spread of SARS-CoV2 infections in NYC,\u201d the Mount Sinai preprint reads, \u201cand point to the increased risk of community driven transmission within the larger metropolitan area.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Trump misunderstood the Times\u2019 story or even if he read it or read it in full; we did not hear back from the White House when asked for comment. But his remarks about the article are inaccurate.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The author was previously a student in a science writing course taught by Carl Zimmer.", "lang": "en"}
