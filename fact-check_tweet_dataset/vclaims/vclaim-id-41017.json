However, the footage has been circulating on social media since at least March 2019, months before the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe video appears in numerous social media posts, including this tweet (archive) by a Nigerian senator, Dino Melaye. It was liked nearly 4,000 times after it was published on April 16, 2020, but it has since been deleted.\n\nThe tweet was captioned: \u201cFG do something b4 something do us all. Nigerians are hungry.\u201d FG refers to the Nigerian federal government. Many comments suggested some Twitter users believed the video was shot recently at a food distribution centre during the lockdown.\n\nThe footage was widely shared on Facebook (including here), Twitter (here) and Instagram (here). It was also published on YouTube here and has been circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nThe 30-second video clip shows several men on top of a truck loaded with what appears to be bags of rice. They distribute the bags to a surrounding crowd.\n\nNigeria reported the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa on February 27, 2020. Since then, the figure in Nigeria has risen steadily to at least 442 cases including 13 deaths, as of April 16, 2020.\n\nPrecautionary measures such as regular hand washing and social distancing were recommended by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to keep inhabitants of Africa's most populous nation safe from the virus.\n\nSeveral parts of the country have been under a stay-at-home order since March 30. The lockdown affects the country\u2019s largest city Lagos, neighbouring Ogun state, and the capital Abuja.\n\nThe lockdown has seen Nigerians who depend on daily wages cut off from their only source of income, and has prompted local authorities to provide food relief packages to help citizens through the pandemic.\n\nWhat does the viral video show?\n\nWhile the AFP video above (in French) is one of several media reports showing a lack of social distancing at some food distribution centres in Lagos, the clip shared thousands of times on social media has nothing to do with the virus. It has been circulating online since at least March 2, 2019, months before the start of the pandemic.\n\nAFP ran a reverse image search using the verification tool InVID-WeVerify and found this Facebook post published on March 2, 2019, shortly before the Lagos state 2019 gubernatorial election won by Governor Sanwo-Olu of Nigeria's ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cBirds eye view of the scramble for rice at the Lagos State Secretariat (sic),\u201d the caption reads. \u201cNigeria is really at its lowest ebb. People willing to die for Rice in Lagos Secretariat.\u201d\n\nAnother reverse image search using Yandex led us to a different version of the video uploaded on YouTube by Sahara TV on March 1, 2019, captioned \u201cLagos State Civil Servants Scramble Over Sanwo-Olu's APC Campaign Rice\u201d.\n\nPolitical parties in Nigeria often give away rice and other food in a bid to woo voters ahead of elections.\n\nSahara TV reported that the distribution took place at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium in the government administrative area in Ikeja.\n\nAFP found that the physical structures and wall paintings visible in the footage indeed match those around the auditorium, as can be seen using Google Street View.\n\nMoreover, news reports about the rice distribution to Lagos state civil servants ahead of the poll were published by major Nigerian news outlets, including Vanguard Newspaper and The Punch.", "lang": "en"}
