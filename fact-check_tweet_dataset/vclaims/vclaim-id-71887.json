It is a grave sin, one for which there is no redemption.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching for the quote online we found no results. We also didn\u2019t discover any evidence that Pope Francis has condemned Americans who vote for Democrats.\n\nThere are about 51 million Catholic adults in the United States, and today they\u2019re evenly split between the Republican and Democratic parties, Pew Research Center reported in January. White Catholics are more likely to vote Republican, and Hispanic Catholics \"overwhelmingly back Democrats.\"\n\nRepublican and Democratic Catholics both used to admire Pope Francis, according to Pew, but he\u2019s become an increasingly polarizing figure in the church. Democrats and Democratic-leaning Catholics view him more favorably than Republicans and Republican-leaning Catholics. Republican Catholics are much more likely than Democratic Catholics to say he\u2019s \"too liberal\" and \"naive.\" Most Catholic Democrats say he\u2019s doing an excellent or good job of spreading the Catholic faith.", "lang": "en"}
