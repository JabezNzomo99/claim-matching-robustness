But while Usman did retire this month after 36 years in service, he made no such comments at the time and has reasserted that he did not resign for political reasons.\n\nThe post published by the Facebook page Dailymail Gist on February 19 shared a picture of Usman with the caption: \u201cBREAKING NEWS!!! Brigadier General Sani Kukasheka Usman, Director Army Public Relations, Announces His Voluntary Retirement From The Nigerian Army. Saying!! I will not be part of what The presidency planned against innocent Nigerian if Buhari didn't win 2019 Election!!!\u201d\n\nOther posts shared the same claim, including here and here. But Usman\u2019s statement at the time of his resignation on February 7, released on his official Facebook page, made no reference to Buhari, saying he was \u201cleaving highly fulfilled after contributing my best to national development\u201d.\n\nAnd on February 20 he released another statement describing the posts as \u201cmischievous fake news\u201d and saying he had never issued any such public comments against Buhari or a supposed crackdown planned by the president in the event of a defeat in the election, which has been delayed until February 23.\n\n\u201cI voluntarily retired from the Nigerian Army on 7th February 2019 having served for over three decades and commenced my terminal leave the following day,\u201d Usman said.", "lang": "en"}
