Four of the 10 most-read columns dive into the president\u2019s false statements about the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible connection to the Trump campaign. Two relate to the recent uproar over family separation. And a majority look at Trump\u2019s statements. (Although, we\u2019re always on the hunt for statements by other politicians.)\n\n1. The facts about Trump\u2019s policy of separating families at the border\n\nHe claimed the House Intelligence Committee had \u201cconcluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\u201d (The committee made no such conclusion.) He queried the motive behind a donation to former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s state senate campaign from Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton friend. (There\u2019s no evidence the donation was intended to influence McCabe.) Trump took issue with special counsel\u2019s appointment \u2014 saying it was \u201cbased on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of [his] campaign.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t.) Trump accused former FBI director James B. Comey of lying under oath. (The president is jumping to a conclusion without enough evidence.) Then he argued that Mueller\u2019s team has \u201c13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans.\u201d (Nope. Mueller is a registered Republican. 13 of the 17 investigators on Mueller\u2019s team are registered Democrats.)\n\n7. Does the GOP memo show the FBI spied on the Trump campaign?\n\n8. Did Hillary Clinton collude with the Russians to get \u2018dirt\u2019 on Trump to feed it to the FBI?\n\nThe Clinton campaign, via a law firm, did seek \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump and Russia. But it\u2019s a huge leap to say Clinton colluded with Russians to do this. Instead, you have (a) the campaign hiring (b) a research firm that hired (c) a researcher who spoke (d) to Russian sources. Steele, for his part, has suggested he tried to alert reporters and the FBI because he was appalled by what he had discovered. The closest connection to Clinton is the fact that Steele gave to the FBI material written by Clinton associates, but it\u2019s unclear what the FBI did with that memo. Several additional pieces of intelligence came to the FBI around the same time prompting the investigation.\n\n9. What you need to know about Christopher Steele, the FBI and the Trump \u2018dossier\u2019\n\nWhether Steele was \u201cshopping\u201d the material is a matter of opinion, but clearly at the direction of his then-client Fusion GPS, Steele tried to interest reporters in his findings on Russia and Trump. By his own account, Steele was sufficiently alarmed by his findings that he contacted the FBI during the summer of 2016. But he was not being paid as an informant nor is it clear that his reports led the FBI to open an investigation. The bureau received intelligence from multiple sources around the same time, which suggested contact between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n10.
