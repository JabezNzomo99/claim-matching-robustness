I met a lot of them in southern Turkey over the last few years. The problem was as assistance didn\u2019t arrive, the defectors became disheartened so not sure where they all are at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of citizen Free Syrian Army fighters that have proven their abilities to fight off both the Assad regime and the al-Qaeda offshoot ISIS,\u201d Shahbandar said. \u201cOver a thousand of these fighters have gone through U.S.-supported training programs and they\u2019ve proven their capabilities on the ground.\u201d He added that \u201cFree Syrian Army commanders like Jamal Maarouf who were not professional military officers when the revolution began were able to eject Assad regime forces and then ISIS from northwest Syria. Jamal Maarouf commands approximately 30,000 fighters in northern and southern Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that a significant portion of the Free Syrian Army is composed of local civilians who picked up arms to protect their homes and villages from the Assad regime, there are also several thousand former officers and soldiers in the Syrian Army who defected to the FSA. Several brigades are highly professional and are led by former colonels and captains in the Syrian Army, said Ken Sofer, policy analyst at the Center for American Progress who has written on the structure of the opposition. \u201cThe problem is that while some brigades in the FSA are highly professional, effective fighting forces, they are the minority.\u201d The civilians generally have no military background, he said, though he acknowledged Syria has military conscription.\n\n\u201cJust from my experience interviewing fighters on the Turkish-Syrian border, several rebel commanders complained about the difficulty of training fighters and getting them to adhere to military-style discipline,\u201d Sofer added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say they were all former farmers and teachers, but they said that in the larger rebel battalions, most of the fighters had no military experience, had never fired a gun, etc.\u201d\n\nWhile exact numbers are not clear, the Violations Documentation Center in Syria, a respected opposition source that is considered reliable, has listed the known occupations of those who have been killed while fighting on behalf of the opposition. The figures only concern 12 percent of the more than 27,000 deaths and cannot be verified; VDC is an activist organization. But with that caveat, the numbers provide additional evidence that former military personnel make up a relatively large percentage of opposition fighters\u2014in fact, more than 50 percent. Farmers and teachers, by contrast, make up less than 2 percent.\n\n\u201cThe president and his strategic communications people should drop this alibi. It is inaccurate, unworthy, and patronizing, if not insulting,\u201d Hof wrote in an article for the the Atlantic Council. \u201cPresident Obama fails to mention the tens of thousands of Syrian Army officers and soldiers who abandoned the Assad regime rather than participate in that regime\u2019s campaign of mass homicide. Why is the totality of what the president calls \u201cthe moderate opposition\u201d characterized by him as entirely civilian, and therefore inadequate, in nature? And why does he not assume that a healthy percentage of the farmers, teachers, pharmacists, dentists, and radio reporters to whom he refers have had significant prior military training as conscripts in Syria? Does he think that Syria has had an all-volunteer military force for the past fifty years?\u201d\n\nOne additional note: In the interview with NPR, the president made a reference to \u201cradio reporters\u201d being among the fighters. Perhaps that was just a nod to the fact he was being interviewed on the radio. But before the uprising, Syria had a tightly run state media with very few outlets. There are now a lot of radio reporters in the opposition because the United States has provided funds for the opposition to set up radio stations. But these people report on the radio; they don\u2019t fight.\n\n\u201cWhat President Obama was saying is at the outset of the Syrian protest against the Assad regime, many of the protesters were not trained fighters. They were ordinary citizens who were standing up and demanding their rights. So that was an assessment he was making \u2014 the comments he made the other day \u2014 that didn\u2019t apply to the opposition today. It applied to the opposition at the outset of this crisis.\u201d\n\nThe president is being misleading when he describes the Syrian opposition in purely civilian terms without acknowledging that a substantial portion of the fighters are actually ex-military personnel. Clearly there is a civilian component and training \u2013 and weapons \u2014are necessary to forge an effective force, especially one that has the capability to achieve more than just tactical victories. But the fighters are certainly much more than \u201cformer farmers or teachers or pharmacists.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
