Komen for the Cure foundation, worked to pull funding for screenings performed by Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood,\" Ossoff said in a June 6 debate with Handel, adding that she had \"imposed her own views\" while at Komen.\n\nOssoff, a former congressional aide, is running against Handel in the June 20 special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District in northern Atlanta, a historically Republican district.\n\nDuring the debate, Handel pushed back by saying she had been instructed to develop options for disengaging from Planned Parenthood. She downplayed her personal role in the controversial decision, adding that no single employee would have been authorized to unilaterally pull funding. The Komen foundation reversed the move after public criticism.\n\n\"I was directed to come up with options for how the organization could disengage,\" she said. \"It was a business decision ultimately decided by the board of Komen.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at Ossoff\u2019s claim that Handel said she had led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings.\n\nHandel did a media interview shortly after her February 2012 resignation as the Komen foundation\u2019s vice president of public policy. Her departure came after the group\u2019s decision to pull Planned Parenthood\u2019s breast cancer screening funding caused a firestorm.\n\nFirst, Handel downplayed her personal role -- similarly to the way she pushed back in her debate with Ossoff. \"I was part of (the) decision-making process,\" Handel told the reporter, \"but I was not the sole decider.\"\n\nBut then Handel pivoted to her feelings about the role she played, saying, \"I embrace the fact that I was involved in the project.\"\n\nFinally, she said: \"I embrace the fact that I led the project.\"\n\nOssoff said, \"In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nHandel did say that she led efforts, but she also said at the time that the decision wasn\u2019t entirely hers, and that Komen\u2019s board ultimately approved the move, which was later reversed.", "lang": "en"}
