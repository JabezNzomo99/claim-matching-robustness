They\u2019re exactly the same as forecasts that the Treasury published in April.\n\nBack then, the Treasury suggested that if the UK left the EU single market and relied on its membership of the World Trade Organisation, after 15 years the government would collect between \u00a338 billion and \u00a366 billion less in tax revenues each year than it would have done if it had remained in the EU. That\u2019s because the economy would have grown less in size - and if people are making less money, they pay less in taxes.\n\nSome people have called leaving the single market a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019, although there\u2019s no precise definition for what that means.\n\nThe estimated figures are big; \u00a366 billion is just over half of what we spend on the NHS. But forecasts like these are not certain and never definitive. Other independent organisations have published similar forecasts and the Treasury\u2019s analysis is one of the more severe assessments. Even though it hasn\u2019t published any new analysis since April, its view is probably still similar because it\u2019s about long term effects of leaving the EU.", "lang": "en"}
