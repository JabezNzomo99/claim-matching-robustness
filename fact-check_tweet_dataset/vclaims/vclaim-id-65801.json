Trump did not coin the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d for retired Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. The general, who reportedly hates this nickname, has been referred to as \u201cMad Dog Mattis\u201d in public reports since at least 2004. Los Angeles Times reported that the nickname originated with Mattis\u2019 troops:\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that he and former President Barack Obama both fired Mattis has a little more truth to it.\n\nMattis served as the Commander of the United States Central Command under Obama until he was removed from the position in 2013 over his \u201chawkish\u201d views on Iran. Mattis served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense under Trump, but he resigned in 2018 over Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Syria. Trump subsequently accelerated Mattis\u2019 resignation and now claims that the general was fired.\n\nAdditional context: Trump sent the above-displayed tweet the day following the publication of an op-ed by Mattis in which the general wrote: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2014 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us.\u201d\n\nSources: Politico / The New York Times / CBC / The Atlantic / Los Angles Times / Twitter", "lang": "en"}
