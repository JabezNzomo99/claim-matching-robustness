The narrator in the 2007 production said, in Russian: \u201cJust one such missile is capable of simultaneously destroying three American states, like Maryland, Vermont and Rhode Island.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Russian government-linked media have threatened the United States with \u201cnuclear apocalypse.\u201d Dmitry Kiselyov, the Kremlin\u2019s chief propagandist and the head of Rossiya Segodnya, the international information agency that includes RT and Sputnik, once threatened on his TV program to turn the U.S. into \u201cradioactive ash.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
