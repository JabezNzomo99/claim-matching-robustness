Behavior never lies.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence that Churchill penned this quote.\n\nChurchill served as Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945, during which time he led Britain through World War II, and again from 1951 to 1955.\n\nHe wrote prolifically throughout his career, including many speeches and other works, yet there is no evidence he authored this quote about body language.\n\nA search of the Churchill Archive, which contains around 800,000 original documents related to the statesman, turned up no results. The Churchill Papers, another collection of his writings, had no record of the saying either.\n\nIndeed, two experts \u2014 John Olsen, the International Churchill Society communications director, and author Gretchen Rubin \u2014 confirmed in emails to the Caller that they had not come across the quote in any of Churchill\u2019s works.\n\n\u201cI have seen the quote before, but there has never been any correct attribution,\u201d said Olsen. \u201cAs far as I know, this quote does not appear anywhere in Churchill\u2019s written or spoken works.\u201d\n\nLee Pollock, an International Churchill Society trustee, told the Caller in an email, \u201cNot by Churchill \u2026 and I would say, doesn\u2019t really even \u2018sound like\u2019 him.\u201d\n\nRubin, who wrote \u201cForty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill,\u201d agreed that the quote didn\u2019t sound like Churchill: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a Churchillian ring to it, to my ears.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 blog post, Hillsdale College senior fellow and Churchill expert Richard Langworth also identified the quote as misattributed, calling the website linked in the Facebook post a \u201ccornucopia of things Churchill never said.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
