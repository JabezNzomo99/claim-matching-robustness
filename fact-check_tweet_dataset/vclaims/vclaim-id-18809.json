The Norwegian news outlet Drammens Tidende spoke to the homeowner, Inger Gar\u00e5s, and found that she had given away more than 200 bags of apples this way:\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the Drammens Tidende report (loosely translated via Google):\n\nJust today I hung out 30 bags with about one kilo of apples in each, and it was gone in an hour or two, Inger Gar\u00e5s tells Drammens Tidende. This past week she has hung apple bags on the white fence every day, and in total she has distributed around 200 bags of apples. About 200 kilos. But Inger points out that she hasn\u2019t counted all the bags every time \u2026 \u2026 \u201cThere are so many apples this year. Nice, clean and large. I don\u2019t get to use everything, and it becomes too much to throw away. Then it is much better to give them away, says the generous mouth watering.\u201d\n\nDrammens Tidende reported that Gar\u00e5s lives on a large property with several apple trees, some of which were planted as early as the 1850s. Gar\u00e5s said that she would keep hanging her apples from the fence so that less of them go to waste.\n\nWhile this picture does document one Norwegian woman\u2019s attempt to give away apples, this photograph is often shared as if it represents a common practice in the country. As far as we can tell, that simply isn\u2019t the case. Norwegians are not expected to give away their surplus fruit, and we haven\u2019t found anything (outside of this single image) to indicate that this practice is widespread in the country.\n\nIn fact, the existence of this news report indicates that this was a rather rare occurrence. Drammens Tidende was not writing about a cultural phenomena in Norway. Rather, they were writing a story about one woman\u2019s kind act of giving away surplus apples for free.\n\nFurthermore, Norwegians frequently chime in when this image is shared online to dispute the idea that this is common practice. Some have noted that the premise of the meme was flawed because Norway doesn\u2019t have a large homeless population. Others noted that the word \u201cepleslang,\u201d which means \u201cstealing apples from a neighbor\u2019s garden,\u201d wouldn\u2019t exist if this was common practice.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly possible that other Norwegians have put out similar bags to get rid of surplus fruit, this doesn\u2019t appear to be a common, countrywide practice.", "lang": "en"}
