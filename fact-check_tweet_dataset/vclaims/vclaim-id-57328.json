Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, became the chief of all German police forces, per the Jewish Virtual Library.\n\nLaurie Woods, a lecturer at Vanderbilt University with 21 years of law enforcement experience, explained to USA Today that changes in policing in Nazi Germany bear little resemblance to current calls to defund the police, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you can even compare.\u201d\n\n\u201cHitler absorbed the police into one unit. They didn\u2019t suddenly lose their jobs as police officers so the other guys could move in,\u201d Woods told USA Today. \u201cThey had more powers to arrest without cause, take people into custody simply because they were Jewish, seize other people\u2019s property \u2013 they increased the reach of existing police powers in a way that was totally uncontrolled and unchecked.\u201d\n\nThomas K\u00fchne, director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University, said in an email to Check Your Fact that the claim is \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police apparatus in Nazi Germany, in its various branches, grew,\u201d K\u00fchne said. \u201cThere was no way and no intention to defund it.\u201d (RELATED: Did Germany Elect Hitler As Their Chancellor?)\n\n\u201cIn the police state that Nazi Germany was, the security authorities were strengthened and expanded beyond anything previously seen in Germany, with a wide variety of policing agencies at every level of society,\u201d Paul Bartrop, director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Research at Florida Gulf Coast University, said in an email to Check Your Fact. \u201cRather than defunding and eliminating police departments, the Nazi state expanded the range of policing activities enormously.\u201d\n\nThe SS, SD and police \u201cwere among the primary perpetrators of the Holocaust,\u201d where six million Jews and millions of others were murdered, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.", "lang": "en"}
