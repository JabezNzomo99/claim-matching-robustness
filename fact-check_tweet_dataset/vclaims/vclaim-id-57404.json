Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of people in New Zealand following \u2018Bharatiya\u2019 (Indian) culture of sitting on the floor and eating in banana leaves. Fact: The photo was taken in India, not New Zealand. The photo is related to \u2018Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram\u2019 in Kerala (India). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a similar photo was found on a travel website. The website mentions that the photo is related to \u2018Sivananda Ashram in Kerala\u2019. The flooring, pillars, window design and ceiling etc. look the same in both the photos. Also, similar visuals can be seen in the Google Images of \u2018Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram\u2019, which is located at Trivandrum in Kerala (India). Few more photos of the same place can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the posted photo was taken at an ashram in India. It does not show people following Indian tradition in New Zealand.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
