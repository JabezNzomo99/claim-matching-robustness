I mean, the second one hit Puerto Rico as a Category 5. I don't believe anybody's ever seen that happen before, hit, land with that kind of velocity.\"\n\nMaria did reach Category 5 status but made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane. Category 4 storms have sustained wind speeds between 130 and 156 miles per hour. Maria hit the upper limit.\n\nCategory 5 landfall wouldn\u2019t have been unprecedented, though, as three such hurricanes have made landfall in the United States, the last one being Hurricane Andrew in Florida 25 years ago.\n\nIt was indeed the second hurricane to impact the island in the last few weeks; the core of Hurricane Irma passed north of Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, 2017, creating significant damage.\n\nIn a bipartisan meeting on tax reform earlier in the day, Trump said the storm had winds of over 200 miles an hour.\n\nHurricane Maria reached maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour in Puerto Rico according to Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center. Gusts, which are occasional but not sustained winds, reached 195 miles per hour.\n\nAs a result of the hurricane, Puerto Rico faces serious food, water and power shortages. The death toll has reached 10 people so far; 80 percent of the transmission infrastructure was destroyed, and it could take four to six months before power is restored.\n\nThat didn\u2019t hold Trump back from declaring the storm response a success.\n\n\"We've had tremendous reviews from government officials. This morning the government made incredible statements about how well we're doing.\"\n\nThe White House referenced comments by Puerto Rican officials on CNN, which were more mixed than the \"generous\" praise he described.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 sung Trump\u2019s praises while pressing for further assistance.\n\n\"Well, the president has been phenomenal in this situation,\" Rossell\u00f3 said on CNN. \"He's been, both in Irma and Maria, he has offered an pre- landfall emergency declaration. He's already declared most of the island a disaster area so that we can start the rebuilding process quickly. And he just said that he loved the people of Puerto Rico, and that he would help, that he would stand by us in our rebuilding process.\"\n\nRossell\u00f3 nonetheless said that more resources would be needed to address the process on Bloomberg.\n\n\"Administration, they've been helpful up until now,\" Rossell\u00f3 said. \"But we need more help. We need more help. We need more resources. And at the same time, Congress solidarity and all of the help that they've pledged through social media and phone calls with our staff. Now is the time to materialize it.\"\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz acknowledged, \"We are getting a lot of logistics help.\" But she expressed frustration with Trump's tweets on the devastation in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.\n\n\"Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well,\" Trump tweeted.\"\n\nYou don\u2019t put debt above people. You put people above debt,\" Yulin Cruz said on CNN. \"There is a human moral imperative to deal with that situation first.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on Oct. 3.", "lang": "en"}
