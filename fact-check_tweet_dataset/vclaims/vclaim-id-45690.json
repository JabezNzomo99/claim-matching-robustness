The posts claim the additional letter represents \" pedosexual\". The claim is false; experts said \"LGBTP\" has never been used to describe the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe image was published on Facebook here on May 26, 2020.\n\nThe purported poster shows an acronym that reads \u201cLGBTP\u201d. The letters allegedly represent \"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Pedosexual\". \u201cLGBTP Equality & Acceptance,\u201d the poster adds.\n\nOther instances of the image appeared on Facebook here, here, here, here, and here. An Instagram post here has more than 11,000 likes.\n\nThe image, which has been online since at least 2016, has circulated in an anti-LGBTQ disinformation campaign; the acronym \u201cLGBTP\u201d has never been used by any legitimate LGBTQ groups, experts say.\n\n\u201cAssociating the letter \u2018P\u2019 with the LGBTQ+ community amounts to nothing more than just another slur devised by anti-LGBTQ supporters, meant to defame and dismiss LGBTQ+ people,\u201d Scott McCoy, the interim deputy legal director of Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s LGBTQ Rights & Special Litigation Practice Group, told AFP via email on May 29, 2020.\n\nHe said that linking the LGBTQ community with pedophilia has long been a \u201cfalse and dangerous practice\u201d used by anti-LGBTQ groups and that \u201cthe \u2018LGBTP\u2019 acronym has never been used by any reputable source to describe the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch images fuel the fears used to substantiate their previously debunked accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is simply the vehicle used by anti-LGBTQ enthusiasts to push their hateful narrative, allowing the lies to travel faster and farther.\u201d\n\nDr. Fred Berlin, a psychiatrist specialising in sexual disorders and the director of the Johns Hopkins Sex and Gender Clinic, also notes that there is no evidence-based justification for conflating the LGBTQ community with pedophilia.\n\n\u201cTo the contrary, there is evidence that gay men are at no greater risk of sexually abusing a boy, than are \u2018straight\u2019 men of sexually abusing a girl,\u201d he told AFP in an email on May 29, 2020.\n\nBerlin added that it is \u201cunclear why some groups have tried to link pedophilia to homosexuality\u201d and noted that \u201cas society becomes more open, and less defensive, about discussing the diversity of human sexuality, such disinformation may become less common.\u201d\n\nSnopes, a US-based fact-checking organisation, found that the misleading poster \u201cseems to be the work of a 4chan misinformation campaign\u201d that was published on the online forum in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
