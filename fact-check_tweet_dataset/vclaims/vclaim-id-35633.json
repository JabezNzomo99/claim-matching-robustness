No, that's not true: a viral YouTube video making that claim was published in October 2019 but it is just a rehash of a (real) story about Blow's heart surgery in May of 2019 from which he has already recovered. The channel on which the video was published seems to specialize in videos with \"sad\" or \"tragic\" news about various entertainers wich generally consist of a monotone voice reading old news articles over a slideshow of various photos of the performers.\n\nThe video appeared as a YouTube Video published by the channel World of Stars on October 9, 2019 titled \"Prayers Up! Rapper Kurtis Blow Is In Critical Condition After Emergency Heart Surgery.\" (archived here) which had following description:\n\nHere is the video in question:\n\nMost of the video description seems to have been copied from here:\n\nAnd the voice over in the video basically reads out this article from May 10, 2019:\n\nFans and friends of hip hop pioneer Kurtis Blow were shocked to hear that the singer has undergone heart surgery once again. Blow was still in the hospital recovering from an aortic artery repair which had taken place on May 2 when he was subjected to an emergency open heart surgery on May 7, 2019.\n\nSince then Blow has made a recovery, as he already announced on Instagram himself on May 5, 2019:\n\nDon't fall for dodgy YouTube channels plagiarizing real news, always Google before liking or sharing such videos.", "lang": "en"}
