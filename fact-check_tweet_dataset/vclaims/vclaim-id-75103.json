Wow, we haven\u2019t given up anything and they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, and no more testing!\n\nNBC Meet the Press host Todd drew Trump\u2019s ire for saying that a more positive tone for negotiations was in the air, but not more than that.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have a release of any of those Americans that they\u2019ve held captive,\" Todd said April 22. \"We don\u2019t have a pledge of denuclearization as the ultimate goal.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet insisted that North Korea indeed had agreed to denuclearization, so we looked at the record. In terms of what North Korea itself has said, Trump has gotten ahead of events.\n\nNorth Korea announced April 20 that it would shut down its northern nuclear test site. A translation of a broadcast from North Korea\u2019s state news agency said North Korean President Kim Jong Un unveiled the decision at a Workers\u2019 Party Central Committee meeting.\n\n\"The northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test,\" the newscaster said.\n\nKim also reiterated the promise to conduct no weapon or missile tests while talks were under way. He added that tests were no longer needed because the country had met its goal of developing its weapons capability.\n\nSo far, North Korea has yet to officially commit to scrapping its nuclear program. It has left it to other countries to put that possibility on the table.\n\nMost recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told dozens of South Korean media executives April 20 that North Korea was \"expressing its commitment to complete denuclearization.\"\n\nMoon said North Korea is not demanding the withdrawal of American troops from bases in South Korea. That would be a significant shift, but as the Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo reported along with Moon\u2019s comments, \"there is still a considerable gap between Washington\u2019s demand of the North\u2019s denuclearization in a minimum period of time and Pyongyang\u2019s calls for progressive and synchronous measures for denuclearization.\"\n\nDenuclearization has been in the air since Kim made a rare trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official Chinese news service Xinhua reported March 28 that Kim said, \"It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula.\"\n\nTrump also tweeted about his Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Kim.\n\n\"Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week, Trump tweeted April 18. \"Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!\"\n\nSo, no direct statements from North Korea on denuclearization, but the word has been in play and not refuted by North Korea.\n\nThe White House pointed to an opinion piece in the Washington Times as support for Trump\u2019s latest statement.\n\nThe April 19 headline said, \"North Korea agrees to \u2018complete denuclearization,\u2019 says South.\"\n\nThat op-ed cited an NBC News report that had the headline, \"North Korea willing to accept 'complete denuclearization' without conditions, Moon says.\"\n\nThe NBC News post repeated a Reuters report from April 19 that said, \"South Korea's Moon says North seeking 'complete denuclearization'.\"\n\nIn the nuances of diplomacy, the transition from \"seeking\" to \"agrees to\" is a big deal.\n\n\"North Korea has agreed to talk about it (denuclearization), not to do it,\" said Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, a group that funds work on U.S.-Asian policy.\n\nArkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sounded unimpressed with what North Korea has promised so far, even with the closure of its test site.\n\n\"I think this announcement on Friday is better than continued testing, but it's not much better than that,\" Cotton said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation April 22. \"It's an easily reversible decision, and they made no announcement about their medium- or short- range ballistic missiles that threaten hundreds of thousands of Americans in Korea and Japan just like it threatens our allies there.\"\n\nSouth Korean skeptics of the North\u2019s intentions have noted that denuclearization has been central in previous high-level negotiations without producing tangible results.\n\nJannuzi said North Korea often speaks of denuclearization as the dying wish of Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung.\n\n\"They always said he wanted that the peninsula be denuclearized,\" Jannuzi said. \"All we have from the North right now is basically what\u2019s always been there.\"\n\nTrump said that North Korea had agreed to denuclearization. While North Korea has promised to halt testing and close a weapons test site, it has not officially said that it is committed to denuclearization.\n\nOther leaders have made that statement on their behalf, and even in that case, the only promise is that they are willing to talk about reaching that point. That is not the same as agreeing to do it.", "lang": "en"}
