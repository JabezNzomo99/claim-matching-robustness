We now have 20 million more Americans who have access to health care.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Clinton, rally in Omaha, Aug. 1\n\n\u201cOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs, 20 million more Americans with health insurance, and an auto industry that just had its best year ever.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Clinton, acceptance speech at Democratic National Convention, July 29\n\nThe Clinton campaign is clearly fond of saying that 15 million jobs \u2014 or, alternatively, 15 million private-sector jobs \u2014 were created in the Obama administration. Clinton frequently indicates that she\u2019s talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such \u201cthan when they took office\u201d or \u201cin the last 7 1/2 years.\u201d\n\nRegular readers know that we tend to discount job-creation records by a president, as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a president\u2019s control. Obama took office amid a massive recession, when the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month. It seems silly to blame him for those job losses \u2014 just as he can\u2019t claim credit for all of the job gains since the recession. But if people are going to tally up job creation in a presidential term, they need to get the dates right.\n\nSo how does Clinton come up with 15 million? She\u2019s counting from the low point for jobs in Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 February 2010. When you start the clock from then, the tally is 15 million private-sector jobs and 14.7 million overall jobs.\n\nClinton spokesman Josh Schwerin responded that \u201cif you look at the context of most of these it\u2019s clear she\u2019s talking about it in the context of having pulled us out of the recession, which is what the stat describes.\u201d For instance, at the event in Scranton, Clinton said, \u201cPresident Obama and Vice President Biden pulled us back from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and put our economy back on a stronger footing.\u201d\n\nThis graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis illustrates this well. You can see that the recession (in gray) ended in the middle of 2009. The number of jobs kept falling until the beginning of 2010, at which point the job figures slowly started to improve. Not until May 2014, in Obama\u2019s second term, was there actual positive job creation.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Obama often also dated his job-creation numbers from February 2010, but generally his language was very specific, making clear he was talking about a time period that did not start with his presidency. If Obama can be so precise, we cannot imagine why Clinton cannot also adopt more careful phrasing.\n\nClinton is clearly trying to use the biggest jobs number possible. But she can\u2019t be so cute and leave listeners with the impression that all of these jobs were created since the start of Obama\u2019s term in office. All she needs to do is make it clear that she is talking about this particular streak of job creation. Until then, she earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
