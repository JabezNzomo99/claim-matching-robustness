It\u2019s false.\n\nThe rumor started as a text message and migrated to social media as a screenshot meme, claiming: \u201cwithin 48 to 72 Hours\u2026 The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.\u201d\n\nDifferent versions of the rumor attribute this misinformation to various sources, including \u201cmilitary friends,\u201d the \u201cDC mayor,\u201d and \u201ca physician at the Clev. Clinic.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s National Security Council addressed the claim in a statement on Twitter, saying: \u201cText message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump also rejected the idea that his administration is considering a \u201cnationwide lockdown.\u201d When asked about it by a reporter on March 16, Trump said: \u201cWe may look at certain areas, certain hot spots as they call them.\u201d But, he added, \u201cat this moment,\u201d they are not considering anything that would affect the whole country.\n\nThe day before, Trump had urged Americans not to panic. Following a call with the CEOs of more than a dozen major grocers and food suppliers on March 15, he said that the U.S. supply chains are \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201c[t]here\u2019s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies.\u201d\n\nThe only thing the rumor gets right is its reference to the Stafford Act, which Trump invoked when he declared a national emergency on March 13. Before making the false claim about the mandatory quarantine, it says: \u201cwithin 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke what is called the Stafford act.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s use of that federal disaster relief law actually allows for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help state and local governments dealing with the outbreak.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that organizers cancel events that host more than 50 attendees. It also has suggested strategies that communities can implement to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, but there is currently no federally mandated \u201cquarantine.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
