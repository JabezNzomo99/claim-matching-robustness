It said: \u201cASPIRIN LANG PALA KATAPAT NG COVID-19 BATAY SA LIBO-LIBONG GUMALING SA ITALY?BACTERIA ANG COVID AT HINDI VIRUS?Niloko tayo ng WHO.\u201d In the comments section, the user cited Italy\u2019s Minister of Health as the source.\n\nThe facts: There is scientific consensus that COVID-19 is caused by a virus that belongs to the coronavirus family. Both the WHO and the Ministry of Health of Italy say there is no specific treatment or registered cure for COVID-19 to date.\n\n\u201cThe novel coronavirus, which is responsible for the respiratory disease now named COVID-19, is closely related to the SARS-CoV and is genetically classified in the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus,\u201d the Ministry of Health of Italy said in its frequently asked questions page.\n\nWhile both viruses and bacteria can cause diseases, viruses are smaller and need a host to survive. They invade and multiply in the host's healthy cells. Meanwhile, bacteria are cells and can survive on their own and even outside the body.\n\nThe Italian Medicines Agency, Italy\u2019s government agency responsible for drug regulation, listed the drugs that are made available to treat the symptoms of its COVID-19 patients here and all the clinical trials in the country here. Aspirin is not on both lists.\n\nThere are clinical trials that test aspirin to treat COVID-19 patients in China and in the US, but these are still ongoing and do not provide scientific validity yet. The estimated completion date of the study in China is in June 2020, while the one in the US is expected to last until December 2020.\n\nIn April, Rappler debunked a similar claim that said COVID-19 can be cured by ingesting aspirin with lemon juice and honey, which cited Makati Medical Center (MMC) as its source. MMC denied issuing the advisory. (READ: FALSE: Aspirin with lemon juice and honey cures coronavirus) \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
