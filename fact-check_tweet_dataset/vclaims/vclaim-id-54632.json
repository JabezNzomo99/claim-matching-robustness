The claim originated on a satire website.\n\nThe website USAvotefortrump.com published the article, titled \u201cNancy Pelosi Says Trump Must Apologize To Iran \u2018Or Else,'\u201d that alleges Pelosi demanded Trump apologize to Iran for \u201ckilling one of their generals.\u201d It appears to reference Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in an airstrike ordered by Trump in early January, according to BBC News.\n\n\u201cHe had better apologize or else,\u201d Pelosi allegedly said. \u201cOr else we\u2019ll have to say what is he doing and start to see the things that he says and does as things he doesn\u2019t really know what to say. He\u2019s not very good on Iran like me I\u2019m probably the best there\u2019s ever been.\u201d (RELATED: Did Trump Fly US Soldiers Back From Operation Desert Storm On His Airline?)\n\nBut, contrary to the article\u2019s claim, Pelosi didn\u2019t make any of the comments it attributes to her. None of them appear in any of her social media posts or on her official websites. Nor did the Daily Caller find any media outlets quoting her as saying such.\n\nPelosi did issue a statement regarding Soleimani\u2019s death, but at no point in that statement did she demand Trump apologize to Iran. She called for Congress to be \u201cimmediately briefed on this serious situation and on the next steps under consideration by the Administration, including the significant escalation of the deployment of additional troops to the region.\u201d\n\nThe USAvotefortrump.com article appears to lift word-for-word from a Jan. 4 article posted on Taters Gonna Tate, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a \u201cnetwork of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d While the original article contains several disclaimers warning readers of the satirical nature of the piece, the USAvotefortrump.com version does not, leading some social media users to share it as factual.\n\nThis is not the first time a satirical article about Pelosi has been taken out of context. In late June, the Caller debunked a claim that Pelosi had been removed from the House floor after drunkenly cursing at Republicans.", "lang": "en"}
