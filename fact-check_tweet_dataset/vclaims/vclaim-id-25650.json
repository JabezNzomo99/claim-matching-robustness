These are the maximum tariffs the EU imposes on these products being imported from any country in the world.\n\nTwo other African countries (Nigeria and the Republic of Congo) benefit from a scheme designed to support developing countries, which lowers the tariff on cocoa powder to 2.8%, cocoa butter to 4.2% and cocoa paste to 6.1%. This scheme is called the standard generalised scheme of preferences.\n\nThe remaining 51 countries face no tariffs on cocoa powder, butter or paste, by virtue of either trade agreements with the EU, or EU schemes designed to support the least developed countries by removing tariffs on most goods.", "lang": "en"}
