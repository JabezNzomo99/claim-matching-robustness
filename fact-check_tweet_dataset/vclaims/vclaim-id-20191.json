{"title": "Old, Stitched Video Shared as Footage of PAF Shooting IAF Aircraft", "subtitle": "Fact Check: A video that claims to be of this aerial engagement of the Pakistan Air Force with the IAF aircraft has gone viral on Twitter, with many Pakistani users sharing it widely, hailing the pilot\u2019s actions.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2019-02-28T19:01:47+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20191", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/fake-doctored-video-footage-of-paf-shooting-down-iaf-aircraft", "vclaim": "The Quint conducted a reverse image search to get to the bottom of the video. One of the first results, from the beginning of the video, leads to a YouTube video that was published on 7 February 2019, with the headline \u2018PAF Veterans \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 Grp Capt Azman Khalil\u2019 with the hashtag #PakArmyZindabad. While the video matched the beginning of the viral clip completely, a further search with the headline directed us to a website called Pakistan Defence, a forum for discussions about the military. On the website, there is a thread which speaks about G/C Azman Khalil sharing his experience, where the same video features again. This link explains that this is a video of Wing Commander Azman Khalil performing a F-16 display on PAF's Veterans Day, taken using a GoPro. The video is dated April 2015. Further searches of the later parts of the viral clip involving the missile being shot took us to a host of multiple videos of the Pakistan Air Force. The third video that showed up, called Pakistan Air Force Live Mission showed the source of the viral clip. While the video in this link begins differently, from 1.36 till 2.10, it is exactly the same as the clip. This video too was published much earlier, on 2 October 2016. Video of Injured Pilot is From Suryakiran Crash, Not Pak \u2018Attack\u2019\n\nBut it can be seen that this video is also a stitched version of two videos, in the part where the missile is released and the screen is split into two halves. A search for the same image on Yandex threw up a result for a website called Daily News Agency, which was in a different language. On translating the page, it became clear that that the missile-releasing part of the clip came from this video. This video too was published on 1 July 2015. All of the above proves that the viral clip in question is not of the PAF shooting down an Indian aircraft on 27 February, but is actually a chunk of the much older Pakistan Air Force Live Mission video from 2016, which itself took from two videos from 2015. It is a fake, stitched together video that is being used incorrectly as actual footage from Wednesday\u2019s attack.", "lang": "en"}
