Not all of these are what it calls \"classic\" free trade agreements\u2014a customs union like the one with Turkey, for example, makes trade easier but economists might say it's different to a 'free trade agreement' as such.\n\nOther deals are part of a more wide-ranging treaty, or an agreement with poorer countries aimed at economic development as well as trade.\n\nThe list also includes the European Economic Area countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) that take part in the EU single market, as well as Switzerland, which has close ties to it. The text of individual agreements can be found here.\n\nOther agreements are in the pipeline, most notably the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the USA.\n\nThe European Commission says that if a member country like the UK were to leave the EU, it would no longer benefit from these treaties.\n\nThe question then becomes what kind of deal we could get negotiating alone.\n\nAs the last government's review of our EU membership noted, \"assessing the impact of alternatives to EU membership on the UK's trade and investment relationship with third countries is not straightforward or simple\".\n\nWe'll do our best to lay out the issues as the EU referendum campaign develops. In the meantime, beware simple answers.", "lang": "en"}
