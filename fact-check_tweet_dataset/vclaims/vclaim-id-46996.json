The words \u201cI\u2019m an unicorn\u201d have been written across the duct tape.\n\n\u201cFrom an antifa page,\u201d reads the Facebook post. \u201cTrump supporters tackled an antifa thug, duct tape him to an electrical box, placed a dildo to his head, and wrote \u2018I\u2019m an unicorn\u2019 on him.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the photo does not show an antifa, short for anti-facist, activist. The individual was voluntarily taped to the electrical box as part of a 2015/2016 live art installation project by the Berlin-based artist Rallito X. Similar photos on Rallito X\u2019s website show the \u201chuman stickers series\u201d work from different angles.\n\n\u201cThis piece was done in Berlin with volunteers and its part of my series Human stickers,\u201d the artist confirmed to the Daily Caller via email.
