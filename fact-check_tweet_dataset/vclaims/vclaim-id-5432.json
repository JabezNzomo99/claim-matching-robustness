The fake news bears the ungrammatical headline:\n\nIt carries a two-year old video that copy-pastes an ABS-CBN report about an exchange between Duterte and the Vatican.\n\nThe video refers to Duterte as \"Davao City mayor,\" having been uploaded by the Youtube channel Just Stellar TV on April 4, 2016.\n\nDuterte, then in the middle of his presidential run, drew flak for cursing the pope for supposedly causing heavy traffic during his 2015 visit to the Philippines.\n\nDuterte\u2019s executive assistant, Christopher Bong Go, subsequently uploaded on Facebook a letter sent by Italian Archbishop Angelo Becciu, saying the Vatican has received the then Davao-mayor\u2019s letter, purportedly containing an apology for his remarks.\n\nThe Balitang Pinoy fake news, which could have reached more than 748,000 people, was published the day about 800 Catholic priests concluded their prayer retreat in Baguio City, done in response to Duterte\u2019s verbal attacks against the Church.\n\nAt least three priests had been killed in the past six months, causing alarm at the worsening climate of impunity in the country.\n\nSocial media traffic to the story was largely generated by Facebook pages President Rodrigo Duterte, WBP We Blog Ph, and Unofficial: PNP Chief Ronald \"Bato\" Dela Rosa.\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
