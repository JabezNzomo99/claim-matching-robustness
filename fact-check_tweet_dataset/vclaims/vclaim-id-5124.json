{"title": "The hunt for 8.4 million Welsh-speaking telly addicts", "subtitle": "Minister says twice as many people watch Welsh language TV as live in Wales.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5124", "url": "https://fullfact.org/news/hunt-84-million-welsh-speaking-telly-addicts/", "vclaim": "This article has been updated.\n\nAs S4C is the only Welsh language TV channel in the world, and only 3.1 million people live in Wales, 8.4 million is a surprisingly large number of weekly viewers.\n\nThe claim is wrong, and it's not clear what the Minister might have meant. According to S4C's annual report \u2014\n\u2022 578,000 people watch S4C across the UK in an average week, down from 599,000 in 2012.\n\u2022 In a month it's 1.4m (up from 1.3m, most of a 10% increase).\n\u2022 In a year it's 6.5m (up from 5.3m, a 23% increase).\n\nThe report also shows that the average time spent viewing S4C each week by Welsh speaking viewers in Wales was 8 hours and 4 minutes. It is just possible that is the source of the confusion. That figure is up from 7 hours and 53 minutes, but it's not up by 10%.\n\nThese figures come from BARB, the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, a standard source for TV viewing data in the UK.\n\nTo take another view, S4C research into Welsh speakers' language use in their daily lives, which surveyed 483 Welsh speakers, found that 70% had watched Welsh language TV in the past week.\n\nOn either basis, the number of weekly Welsh-language viewers is around half a million and certainly not close to 8.4 million.\n\nThe new 2014/15 S4C annual report is due to be published next week.\n\nThis article has now been published in Welsh.
