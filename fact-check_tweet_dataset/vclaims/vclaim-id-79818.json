We agreed with the author on two points: One quote needed more context, and one of our assumptions needed to be stated. We made these changes on \u200eSeptember 28.\n\nThe NDP created a petition calling for the protection of Canadian lakes and rivers, which the party claimed dropped from 2.5 million to 159 during the Conservative government\u2019s time in office. These numbers have also spread through social media.\n\nThe petition reads: \u201cCanada has one of the world\u2019s largest supplies of fresh water. But instead of preserving this resource for future generations, Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives have stripped protection from most of Canada\u2019s waterways. From 2.5 million protected rivers and lakes, down to just 159 now.\u201d\n\nThe claim refers to the new federal Navigation Protection Act, which lists 159 protected lakes and rivers, plus three oceans. The number of waterways in this act (159) and in the claim (2.5 million down to 159) make it clear this act is the unstated focus of the petition.\n\nIt turns out this claim is only partly about the numbers. More important is the definition of \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nThe NDP petition does not describe the type of protection it refers to, but the party asks people to act if they want to \u201ckeep our waters safe and clean,\u201d and accuses the Conservatives of not \u201cpreserving this resource for future generations.\u201d The reference is clearly to environmental protection.\n\nThe law in question, however, is not about protecting the environment, said Michael Van Den Heuvel, director of the Canadian Rivers Institute. He called it \u201ca very old piece of legislation that pre-dates even the concept of ecological harm due to human development activities.\u201d\n\nThe Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA), created in 1985, centered around the protection of lakes and rivers for their use as commercial or travel routes. Its purpose was to maintain the accessibility of lakes and rivers. Any \u201cwork\u201d or projects that occurred on navigable waters had to go through a federal approval process to ensure the lake or river was not obstructed. The law defined navigable water as any body of water through which a vessel could pass \u2013 even a vessel as narrow as a canoe.\n\nIn 2012, the Conservatives replaced the NWPA with the Navigation Protection Act (NPA). This act lists 159 lakes, rivers and riverines, as well as 3 oceans that are protected by the federal government. Here, protection still means that the waterway is left unobstructed.\n\nIn an article on their paper comparing environmental protection before and after the NPA, researchers Adrienne Davidson, Emma Hodgson and Amanda Winegardner concluded, \u201cthis change did not confer any real reduction in environmental protection. That change had happened earlier.\u201d\n\nVan Den Heuvel agreed the NPA is not the relevant law. \u201cThe [NDP] statement implies through the blanket application of the term \u2018protected\u2019 that this act was somehow critical in the environmental management of waterways. That is simply untrue,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, many laws are interrelated. Although the old NWPA and the new NPA are about navigation rights, there is a relationship with another law covering environmental oversight.\n\nAn environmental protection piece entered the NWPA in 1992 with the creation of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), a law that would trigger an environmental assessment as part of the approval process for \u201cwork\u201d or projects on navigable waters.\n\nThe same year the NPA arrived, the CEAA also got replaced with the CEAA 2012. This resulted in a decoupling of the environmental assessment trigger from the NPA review process, and a new designated projects list that outlines when a federal environmental assessment is required. Changes to the CEAA in part intended to reduce environmental assessment duplication between the federal and provincial or territorial levels of government.\n\nSo we\u2019ve gone from a system in which work on any body of water wide enough for a canoe to travel triggered a federal environmental assessment, to one in which federal assessments are only required under certain conditions.\n\nThis raises two questions: Does the new CEAA mean less environmental oversight? And if so, is it because of the NPA?\n\nOn the first question of less oversight due to CEAA changes, according to Amanda Winegarder, a PhD candidate in biology at McGill University, the answer is maybe. \u201cIt might be reasonable to assume that [the CEAA changes] will result in a decrease in the total number of required federal environmental assessments,\u201d Winegardner said. \u201cHowever, it is still too early to actually begin to parse out these numbers.\u201d She also cautioned that reducing the number of federal assessments may not affect the degree of environmental protection.\n\nCanada has other laws for that. Van Den Heuvel called the Fisheries Act \u201cthe major instrument of environmental management\u201d and said other water bodies not covered by that law \u201care typically protected under provincial legislation.\u201d For example, environmental assessment rules in Ontario and British Columbia.\n\nBut even assuming a loss of federal environmental oversight, the NPA has little to do with it, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to talk about 159 lakes and rivers when discussing the new number of environmental assessments.\n\nAccording to Winegarder, if the CEAA did not get updated along with the NPA, \u201cthis would have meant a reduction in federal oversight, as it would mean fewer triggers for an [environmental assessment].\u201d But now there\u2019s a separate designated project list doing the triggering, so \u201cit is not this straightforward.\u201d\n\nThe NDP claim that Canada\u2019s 2.5 milion protected rivers and lakes fell to just 159 is true only where navigation rights are concerned. However, an average reader would likely assume that the petition referred to environmental protection, and on this interpretation, the numbers don\u2019t makes sense.\n\nWhile part of the petition is true, it omits important context on the nature of the axed protection. It\u2019s a misleading claim because an average reader would take it to mean that 2,499,841 million lakes and rivers are no longer covered by environmental protection. And that is not accurate.\n\nHow many navigable waterways does Canada have? Good question. Marie-Christine Fiset, an NDP press secretary, said 2.5 million is an estimate from the Library of Parliament. When we asked, a library researcher said, \u201cthe total number of lakes and rivers in Canada is not known for certain,\u201d but directed us to an old Natural Resources Canada estimate of at least 2 million lakes.\n\nLakes and rivers are tricky to count, and the attempt can turn esoteric. \u201cWhat are \u2018lakes\u2019 and \u2018rivers,\u2019\u201d asked John Clague, an earth sciences professor at Simon Fraser University. Does a tiny pond count? Streams that flow for only parts of the year? John Smol, from Queen\u2019s University and the Canada Research Chair in environmental change, uses the 2 to 3 million ballpark for lakes. The University of Alberta\u2019s David Schindler said he\u2019s seen counts of 2 to 4 million. All agreed it\u2019s likely the number is unknown. So 2.5 million appears a reasonable estimate.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
