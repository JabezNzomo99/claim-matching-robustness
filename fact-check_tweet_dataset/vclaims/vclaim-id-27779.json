The answer depends largely on the age groups included in the calculation.\n\n, the ANC claims school attendance has increased from 51% to 99% since 1994. The party told Africa Check/City Press the information was sourced from Statistics South Africa\u2019s (Stats SA) General Household Survey and the basic education department.\n\nWhile children as young as five years can be admitted to Grade 1, school attendance is compulsory from age seven to 15,\n\n. Our fact-check, therefore, focuses on this age range.\n\nThe latest available data on school attendance is from\n\n. In that year, 98.4% of children aged seven to 15 attended school. A breakdown shows an increase in attendance as children approach compulsory school-going age and a decrease as attendance is no longer compulsory.\n\ncontains calculations of school attendance as far back as 1994. The committee was appointed by the then minister of education, Naledi Pandor, \u201cto conduct an investigation on the extent of retention and dropout in the schooling system\u201d.\n\nThe enrolment rates for children aged seven to 15 in 1994 vary between 89.7% and 97.7%. This data was calculated using the 1994 October Household Survey. But Stats SA previously\n\nbecause there were sampling and fieldwork issues. The agency pointed to the 1996 census as the earliest reliable data. In that year 89.3% of children aged seven to 15 were in school.\n\nSources: Ministerial committee on learner retention in the South African schooling system (2008) and Stats SA\n\nWhat the numbers don\u2019t tell us\n\nBut school attendance rates \u201calone do not capture the regularity of children\u2019s school attendance or their progress through school\u201d, according to last year\u2019s SA Child Gauge\n\nat the University of Cape Town. \u201cSimilarly, school attendance rates tell us nothing about the quality of teaching and learning.\u201d\n\nWe sent questions to basic education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga regarding the department\u2019s data on school attendance and the reason some children did not attend school.\n\nThe government often refers to \u201chousing opportunities\u201d when reporting on delivery.\n\nHousing opportunities and houses built are not the same because housing opportunities include serviced sites \u2013 plots of land \u2013 without houses.\n\nof housing opportunities delivered from 1994 to last year. (The figures for April to December 2018 are preliminary.)\n\nHouses built include subsidised houses, rental accommodation, hostel upgrades and council houses where ownership was granted. If both a serviced stand and a house are provided, these count as one housing opportunity.\n\ncheme \u201cprovides state subsidies to repair and/or rehabilitate, and even demolish and rebuild where necessary, government [rental] houses built before 1994 and then transfer houses into the ownership of legitimate occupants\u201d.\n\nAsked about the source of the number in the claim, the ANC said the \u201cmore than 4.7 million\u201d in fact referred to housing opportunities and not houses built. It said it would make this \u201cclearer\u201d in the online version of the manifesto.\n\nthat \u201cover\u201d 14 million people benefited from the delivery of free houses.\n\nIf the number of housing opportunities provided (4.8 million) is multiplied by the average household size (3.3 according to the\n\n), it comes to 15.8 million. However, it would not be correct to say that this number of people benefited from \u201cfree houses\u201d because housing opportunities include serviced stands without houses.\n\nMarie Huchzermeyer, a professor at Wits University\u2019s School of Architecture and Planning, previously told Africa Check that an uncritical celebration of numbers should be avoided.\n\non the national minimum wage considered the appropriate level for such a wage, it found that\n\nIt based its calculation on data from the\n\nand noted that this figure was an \u201coverestimate\u201d of workers earning less than R3,500 because it included workers who earned part-time salaries.\n\nThe LMDS report, which tracks labour market trends, is based on Stats SA\u2019s\n\nwas released in 2017. According to Stats SA, there were\n\nearning less than R3,500 a month in that year. This number includes part-time workers.\n\nat Wits University found that a national minimum wage \u2013 if set at an \u201cappropriate and meaningful level\u201d \u2013 could reduce poverty and inequality, while having a \u201cminimal effect\u201d on employment.\n\nThis conclusion was based, in part, on statistical modelling. Project coordinator and author of\n\nDr Gilad Isaacs said while the research was done in 2016 and the economy had since deteriorated, he would not expect dramatically different results if the exercise were to be repeated today.\n\nAsked whether the current level of the national minimum wage was considered to be \u201cappropriate and meaningful\u201d, Isaacs said while it did not adequately \u201csupport bringing people out of poverty\u201d because it had been set below the working poor line, it would have a large impact in terms of the number of workers affected.\n\nare workers who earn less than R4,125 a month (at 2015 prices) and are unable to meet their and their dependants\u2019 basic needs.\n\nThe ANC made two claims in its\n\nThe first stated that more than R2 trillion was spent in a decade. The second, which was contained in a graphic, claimed that R1.2 trillion was \u201cinvested in national infrastructure projects\u201d in 10 years.\n\nAsked about the discrepancy, the party\u2019s national elections communications manager, Lerato Monethi, said the figure contained in the graphic was incorrect and would be corrected online. \u201cThe R1.2 trillion is for five years.\u201d\n\nAccording to annual amounts provided by National Treasury, infrastructure spending in the past 10 complete financial years, came to R2.3 trillion.\n\nare infrastructure spending at all levels of government, by state-owned enterprises and other public entities (for example, the Property Management Trading Entity in the national department of public works), as well as public funds spent as part of public-private partnerships.\n\nNational Treasury says capital items such as equipment, machinery and vehicles are excluded, while public housing, maintenance and repairs form part of the definition of infrastructure spend applied in this case.\n\nIn the 2017/18 financial year, most of the money was spent on transport and logistics, followed by energy, water and sanitation, and education.\n\nThe National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) did not exist in 1994.\n\nIn that year the Tertiary Education Fund of SA \u2013 its predecessor \u2013 funded 25,568 students to the tune of\n\nAsked to provide the source of the \u201cnearly R15 billion\u201d in the ANC\u2019s claim, national elections communications manager Lerato Monethi referred Africa Check/City Press to Nsfas.\n\nwas disbursed in student financial aid, benefiting 460,341 students in the financial year 2017/18.\n\nWe asked Mamabolo to provide a more recent figure for spend on student financial aid \u2013 for January to December last year. However, the number he provided (R22 billion) was a budgeted amount for disbursement and administration and not confirmed spend.\n\nTherefore, the latest available number for support to students is the R14.1 billion in the annual report.\n\nMamabolo said the Nsfas funding had increased since 1994 because of an \u201cincrease in available academic spaces, in the funding budget and in matriculant candidates\u201d.\n\nProfessor Pierre de Villiers of the economics department at the University of Stellenbosch and his colleagues did a study of Nsfas-funded students who entered the higher education system from 2000 to 2004. \u201cThe most interesting finding was that the Nsfas students are, on average, more successful than the non-Nsfas students,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study, which tracked the performance of individual students as they progressed through the system, found that a greater proportion of Nsfas-funded students obtained qualifications compared with their non-funded peers.\n\n. For non-Nsfas students, 48% had qualifications and 46% dropped out,\u201d said De Villiers.\n\n\u201cOne can add here that more than 71% of the funds spent on the 2000 group was spent on students who obtained a qualification.\u201d\n\nOne of the contributing factors to the better performance of Nsfas students was that they were less likely to drop out because they had \u201ca financial back-up\u201d, he said.\n\nAn incentive that might have played a role was the fact that Nsfas students were able to convert portions of their loans into bursaries based on their academic performance, he said.\n\nDe Villiers said the researchers found students in the system who were still funded despite failing to obtain a qualification within nine years, which raised questions about the administration of Nsfas. \u201cNsfas helps but it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said.\n\nMamabolo said \u201cvalid and justifiable reasons\u201d might exist for finding \u201ca small minority of students in the system who had received funding for this period, however we cannot comment on this without exploring the relevant data\u201d.\n\nTaglined \u201ca people\u2019s plan for a better life for all\u201d, the manifesto contains a number of claims about progress in the country.", "lang": "en"}
