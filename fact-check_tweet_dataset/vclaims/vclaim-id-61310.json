As for her request for us not to PolitiFact her, well, we couldn\u2019t help but take that as a friendly challenge.\n\nRich told PolitiFact Florida in an interview, \"don\u2019t hold me to \u2018third regressive.\u2019 .... I did not say \u2018third\u2019 definitively. ... We are one of the most regressive.\"\n\nRich cited a 2013 report by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, a group that advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families.\n\nThe report concluded that all states have regressive tax systems. It means that state taxes come more from the poor and middle class than from the rich.\n\n\"Virtually every state\u2019s tax system is fundamentally unfair, taking a much greater share of income from middle- and low-income families than from wealthy families,\" the report says. \"The absence of a graduated personal income tax and the over reliance on consumption taxes exacerbate this problem in many states.\"\n\nThe report measures property, sales and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013 and concludes Florida is \"No. 2 of the terrible 10\" -- the second most-regressive tax system in the country. (No. 1 was Washington state.)\n\n\"The No. 1 and No. 2 predictor of a very unfair tax system is not having a personal income tax of any kind and an above-average sales tax, and Florida has both of those things,\" said Matt Gardner, the institute\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe report found that for non-elderly taxpayers, the bottom 20 percent pay 13.2 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of earners only pay about 2.3 percent of their income toward state and local taxes.\n\nThe report gives a nod to one progressive feature of Florida\u2019s taxes: We don\u2019t have sales taxes on groceries.\n\nWe were unable to find any other entity that included Florida in a state-by-state comparison of regressivity and taxes.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that analyzes tax policy, wrote a report criticizing the institute\u2019s study, but their points were not specifically about the states\u2019 rankings. Instead, they criticized the report for promoting income taxes.\n\nThe foundation does its own ranking of states in terms of business climate -- Florida placed fifth.\n\nWe interviewed a few experts on taxes, and they were not surprised by Florida\u2019s ranking when it comes to regressive taxes.\n\n\"Not that many states don\u2019t have an income tax, so that puts us in a small group that looks more regressive,\" said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. However, he said, \" \u2018regressive\u2019 and \u2018burdensome\u2019 are separate issues. The tax burden in Florida is still very low, despite being regressive.\"\n\nAaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, said there are only two taxes that are progressive: the income tax and the estate tax.\n\n\"States that don\u2019t have the income tax -- they just don\u2019t have that lever to pull,\" he said. \"Sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes run from moderately regressive to really regressive.\"\n\nRich said that there is evidence that Florida has \"the third most-regressive tax base,\" though she acknowledged when she spoke she wasn\u2019t certain if she had the number right.\n\nShe was close: A study placed Florida No. 2 in terms of its regressive tax base.\n\nFlorida has a regressive tax base because we lack a state income tax. Though the Tax Foundation criticized the report, it didn\u2019t dispute the states\u2019 rankings, and other experts we interviewed also had no qualms about Florida\u2019s placement.\n\nRich\u2019s number of third place was just a smidgen low, so we rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
