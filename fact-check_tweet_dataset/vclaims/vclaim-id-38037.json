This is false; Dion\u2019s talent agency told AFP the singer is alive, and the website used an altered video from CNN\u2019s New Day program, although the US news channel never reported Dion\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cSuperstar and singing legend Celine Dion dead at 51,\u201d is the headline shared hundreds of times on Facebook. Those who click on the link in their social media newsfeed are directed to a webpage where a single video seems to confirm the news.\n\nHowever, the video is a cut and altered news segment from CNN\u2019s New Day news show, which lasts just long enough for co-host John Bergman to say the words, \u201cWe have some terribly sad news to report this morning, heartbreaking, and devastating.\u201d On the bottom of the screen, a fake news banner again proclaims Dion\u2019s death.\n\nThe video then stops, and in order to play more online users are forced to share the link on Facebook.\n\nA search for the words \u201cCeline Dion dead\u201d yields no results on CNN\u2019s website. The original video used in the hoax was a news segment announcing the death of US chef and TV star Anthony Bourdain on June 8, 2018.\n\nThe identical clip can be seen in this CNN special report:\n\nAlthough the false report began to be shared on November 4, Dion, who is on a world tour until September 2020, sang in Detroit, at Michigan\u2019s Little Ceasars Arena on the evening of November 5.\n\n\u201cC\u00e9line\u201d tweeted a photo of herself at the concert, and fans shared moments from the concert on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe webpage that features the news of Dion\u2019s death was created on November 2, 2019, according to domain identification tool Whois. This is often a good indication of a news website\u2019s lack of credibility.\n\nThe 51-year-old singer announced she would leave her residency of 16 years in Las Vegas in June 2019, and began a world tour to showcase her new album \u201cCourage\u201d in her native Canadian province of Quebec in September.", "lang": "en"}
