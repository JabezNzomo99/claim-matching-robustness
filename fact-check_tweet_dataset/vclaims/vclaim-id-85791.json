But the data shows there is nothing unusual about that number.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T21:19:03Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85791", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/11/07/are-300-house-bills-really-bottled-up-in-the-senate/", "vclaim": "We did not have to look far, as it turns out another colleague, Philip Bump of The Fix blog, already examined this question in August. (The Fact Checker was on vacation then, and missed his report.) Bump is a master chart maker, so we are going to borrow from his good work.\n\nBump used data from GovTrack to assess this claim, going back for the past 20 Congresses to count up how bills had passed the House but were still waiting for Senate consideration when Congress adjourned.\n\nVoila! It turned out that in 11 of the past 19 Congresses \u2014 more than half \u2014 more than 300 bills were waiting for Senate action by the time the Congress completed its work. In fact, there were nearly 200 or more House bills pending in every single Congress of the past 40 years. (For this Congress, the number currently is just shy of 350.)\n\nIn the chart below, Bump color-coded the bars with the color of the party that controlled the House during that Congress \u2014 red for Republicans and blue for Democrats.\n\nYou can see that the worst jam-up \u2014 when more than 700 bills passed in the House were ignored by the Senate \u2014 came in the 110th Congress, when Democrats controlled the House and Senate. So if anyone should have been upset at the Senate, it should have been Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), then the house speaker. She had more than twice as many bills \u201cstuck in the Senate\u201d than Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), the current speaker.\n\nBump also examined how many bills passed by the Senate were ignored by the House. (Remember that big immigration bill that passed with bipartisan support in 2013?) The numbers are not as large\u2014 about 70 \u2014 but it is still substantial.\n\nYou can see that the Senate used to have more bills that languished but it is not because the House has acted on more bills. The Senate has passed fewer bills since Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) became majority leader and McConnell became minority leader in 2007, though the reasons for the slowdown remain the subject of debate. McConnell has pledged to reintroduce what he calls \u201cregular order\u201d to the Senate, so it will be interesting to see if the number of bills passed by the Senate increases. But the evidence suggests that even so, that only means more Senate bills will languish in the House.\n\nThis is one of these \u201cfacts\u201d that is sorely lacking context. While some 300 bills have passed the House and failed to pass the Senate, there is nothing unusual or unique about this. As Bump put it, \u201cwhen it comes to House legislation that the Senate is ignoring, it\u2019s the same as it ever was.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
