Now share as much as you can\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is at least eight months old and of a training session of Bangladeshi soldiers.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video was viewed almost 80,000 times and shared over 5,000 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nTwitter user \u201cImran Khan\u201d also shared the video with the caption, \u201cIndian Army defeated in Ladakh Fash video after being beaten by the Chinese army.\u201d\n\nCertain clues in the video itself gave rise to suspicions over the claim that it is a torture video the superimposed background score and the fact that there was no resistance from the soldiers who were tied and gagged. Also, the whole activity was being carried out in a synchronised manner.\n\nSearching further, we found that a TikTok user had shared the video on April 21. Recent border tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control erupted only last month.\n\nA keyword search led us to a longer version of the video, which was uploaded in October last year on a YouTube page with the caption, \u201cBangladesh Army hard training.\u201d\n\nWhile the viral video has the score of Turkish song \u201cDerdim\u201d by Xeyale Tovuzlu in the background, one can hear the soldiers conversing in Bengali in the original video. An even longer version of the video shows some soldiers grinning even as they\u2019re lying on the ground.\n\nIt is true that some Indian soldiers were captured by Chinese forces during the bloody Galwan Valley clashes of June 15, but they were released later. There is no report of Indian soldiers being tortured by Chinese troops. The viral video is of a training session of Bangladeshi soldiers and has no link to the border stand-off between India and China.", "lang": "en"}
