He\u2019s a killer. He\u2019s a guy who ran over eight \u2014 many people \u2014 eight died; 10 to 12 are really badly injured. So I really think that a lot of people are going to agree with us now on that subject.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, remarks at a bipartisan meeting on immigration, Jan. 9\n\nIn November, after Uzbekistan-born Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov allegedly killed eight people and injured a dozen others by driving a pickup truck down a bicycle path near the World Trade Center in New York, President Trump attacked the diversity visa program that gave Saipov legal permanent residency in the United States. He also made a startling claim: Saipov was the \u201cpoint of contact\u201d for \u201c23 people that came in or potentially came in with him.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments caused a brief flurry of attention and then were quickly forgotten. But twice since the start of the year, the president has resurrected the claim, without any caveat about \u201cpreliminarily\u201d or \u201cpotentially.\u201d Now Trump flatly says that 22 (or 24) of Saipov\u2019s relatives are in the country, in what the president labeled as \u201cchain migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cChain migration\u201d refers to the practice of immigrants bringing other members of their families to the United States. Under U.S. law, there is a preference for relatives already living in the United States, so a U.S. citizen can petition for a green card for spouses, children, parents or siblings. So, for example, a sibling of U.S. citizen could come to the United States, bringing along spouses and minor children.\n\nThat\u2019s how Akayed Ullah, accused of setting off a pipe bomb in Manhattan in December, came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, according to the Department of Homeland Security. He obtained a green card as the child of a sibling of the U.S. citizen.\n\nSaipov arrived in the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery. But Saipov is not a U.S. citizen yet; he just has a green card. The rules are stricter for green-card holders: they can only petition for a spouse or unmarried children.\n\nSaipov is married, but his wife (also Uzbek) was already in the United States when they met and then married in Ohio. (Her parents live in Brooklyn.) Saipov and his wife have three young children, all of whom are already U.S. citizens because they were born in the United States.\n\nIf Saipov had eventually become a citizen, he could have petitioned for his parents and his three sisters, who now live in Uzbekistan, to come to the United States. That would be five people, though if the sisters were married (one is 17 and the two others are older), they could eventually bring in spouses and children. But there\u2019s often a lengthy wait list. As of November, according to the State Department, nearly 4 million people are waiting to get off the list, including 2.3 million\u201cfamily fourth\u201d preferences \u2013 children of siblings of citizens.\n\nThat\u2019s another problem with Trump\u2019s claim: Not only is Saipov not a U.S. citizen, but even if he was, it\u2019s \u201cprobably close to impossible\u201d that he could bring in two dozen people in seven years, according to Mark Krikorian, executive director of Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration limits and a merit-based immigration system.\n\nRegular readers know the burden of proof rests with the speaker. But the White House and DHS declined to offer any explanation or documentation for the president\u2019s statements. If Trump is hanging this statistic on \u201cpotentially,\u201d that\u2019s a real whopper, especially the way he framed it in recent comments.\n\nThis reminds us of when Trump three times falsely claimed that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte refused to let President Barack Obama land his plane in Manila. Obama\u2019s visits to the Philippines were uneventful, and we wondered at the time why no one on the White House would point out the mistake to the president.\n\nHere, the president three times has made a claim that again appears based on a misunderstanding. The first time, he included a mysterious caveat \u2013 \u201cpotentially\u201d \u2013 but all caveats have been dropped now. Yet under no scenario is his claim feasible. As far as we can tell, Saipov has not brought a single relative into the country.\n\nGiven that this claim of \u201cchain migration\u201d is central to the president\u2019s push to overhaul immigration laws, we are surprised the White House would not try to correct the record. If the president is giving out fake news awards, he should reserve a plaque for himself. His statement resulted in headlines that now appear to be wrong.", "lang": "en"}
