We recorded 492 claims \u2014 an average of just under five a day \u2014 and readers demanded that we keep it going for the rest of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn other words, in a single year, the president said more than the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years. Put another way: He averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019.\n\nThe president added to his total on Sunday evening with more than 20 Trumpian claims \u2014 many old favorites \u2014 during a triumphant speech at the annual conference of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He incorrectly described trade agreements \u2014 suggesting Canadian dairy tariffs were eliminated and an agreement with Japan to reduce tariffs on $7 billion of farm products was \u201ca $40 billion deal\u201d \u2014 and also falsely asserted that \u201ctough\u201d farmers and ranchers were crying as he signed a repeal of Obama-era regulations. A video of the event shows no one crying.\n\nThe key reasons for last year\u2019s surge in October and November was the uproar over a phone call on July 25 in which Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s president to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival \u2014 and the ensuing House impeachment inquiry. Almost 1,000 of the false and misleading claims made by the president deal with the Ukraine investigation, even though it only became a category four months ago.\n\nFor instance, nearly 70 times he has claimed that a whistleblower complaint about the call was inaccurate. The report accurately captured the content of Trump\u2019s call and many other details have been confirmed. Nearly 100 times, Trump has claimed his phone call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect,\u201d even though it so alarmed other White House officials that several immediately raised private objections.\n\nAs Trump approaches a tough reelection campaign, his most repeated claim \u2014 257 times \u2014 is that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \u2014 or Ulysses S. Grant. Moreover, the economy is beginning to hit the head winds caused by Trump\u2019s trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in an apparent recession.\n\nAbout one in six of Trump\u2019s claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that increased in early 2019 when the government was partly shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his second-most-repeated claim \u2014 242 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and mostly repairs of existing barriers as \u201ca wall.\u201d (Almost all of the 100 miles that have been completed replaced previous barriers.) The Washington Post has reported that the bollard fencing is easily breached, with smugglers sawing through it, despite Trump\u2019s claims that it is impossible to get past.\n\nTrump has falsely said 184 times that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised that it would be the biggest in U.S. history \u2014 bigger than Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1981. Reagan\u2019s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9 percent of gross domestic product, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. This continues to be an all-purpose applause line at the president\u2019s rallies.\n\nOn 176 occasions, Trump has claimed the United States has \u201clost\u201d money on trade deficits. This reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.", "lang": "en"}
