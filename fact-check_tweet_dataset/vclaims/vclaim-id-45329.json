The post was then captioned with \u201cSa mga gustong ibasura ang Anti-Terrorism Bill, salamat raw sa suporta (To those who want to junk the Anti-Terrorism Bill, (IS) says thank you for the support).\u201d\n\nThe earliest traceable copy of its original image is found on Twitter.

The message read, \u201cMujahideen in the state of East Asia.\u201d\n\nMujahideen is an Arabic word which refers to \u201cthose who proclaim themselves warriors for the faith.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State, known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has links to the Maute armed group, which was responsible for the terror attacks in Marawi City that began on May 23, 2017, and which prompted the imposition of Martial Law over the whole region of Mindanao. The Marawi siege lasted for five months but military rule continued till the end of 2019.\n\nThe doctored photo was uploaded two days after police detained seven students from the University of the Philippines Cebu on June 5 for violating general community quarantine guidelines by holding a protest. A bystander recording the incident on video was also detained. They were released on bail on June 8.\n\nThe controversial Anti-Terrorism Bill was transmitted to the Office of the President on June 9 amid mounting opposition from different sectors. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Malaca\u00f1ang will review the bill to make sure its provisions are constitutional.\n\nBigboss Duterte\u2019s post could\u2019ve reached almost 300,000 followers.
