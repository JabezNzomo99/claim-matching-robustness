Now ask Congress sycophants what led to the Yes Bank fiasco.'\n\nBOOM found out these claims to be false.\n\nArchived version of the viral post can be viewed here.\n\nBOOM also came across a photo of Kapoor and family posing with P Chidambaram at, what seems to look like, a wedding reception.\n\nIn a shock move on March 5, 2020 the Reserve Bank of India put the cash-starved Yes Bank under a moratorium fixing a Rs 50,000 withdrawal limit for the bank's customers.\n\nTop 5 Things To Know If You Are A YES Bank Customer\n\nBOOM went through several news articles to find out the truth behind the viral claim. While looking for the history of Yes Bank, we also found out about Rana Kapoor's personal life. Here's a brief history.\n\nYes Bank was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur in 2004. While Ashok Kapur was the chairman, Rana was the managing director and CEO of the bank.\n\nThe business partnership between Ashok Kapur and Rana Kapoor turned into a familial bond with Ashok's wife's sister marrying Rana Kapoor. As Bindu Kapur, sister of Ashok's wife Madhu Kapur, married Rana Kapoor, the business partners became co-brothers. Click here for more details on the Kapoors and Kapurs.\n\nAnother article published in Business Standard dated June 14, 2013, BOOM found it mentioned Kapur's and Rana's wives were sisters. The BS article has, however, wrongly named Ashok Kapur as Ajay Kapur.\n\nAshok Kapur meanwhile lost his life during the terrorist attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008. A Times of India article dated November 28, 2008 had reported that Kapur's body was found in Mumbai's Oberoi Hotel which was under terrorists' siege. The article mentions Ashok Kapur as brother-in-law of Rana Kapoor.\n\nBOOM also read more on P Chidambaram's family tree and found out that Chidambaram has one son: Karti P Chidambaram. We also contacted Karti Chidambaram about the viral message. Karti rubbished the viral claim.\n\n\"We can't be reacting to all silly gossip which are circulated in SM,\" Karti Chidambaram told BOOM.\n\n\n\nA reverse image search on the photograph showing P Chidambaram along with the Kapoor family led us to a 2012 picture on the official website of GettyImages. The picture is from the marriage reception party of Rana Kapoor's eldest daughter.\n\n\n\nThe caption with the photograph read: 'NEW DELHI, INDIA - NOVEMBER 30: Rana Kapoor and his family pose with the Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram during the marriage reception of Kapoors's elder daughter at Taj Palace on November 30, 2012 in New Delhi, India. Kapoor is the MD & CEO of YES Bank, which is the 4th largest private sector bank in the country. (Photo by Rajesh Kashyap/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)'", "lang": "en"}
