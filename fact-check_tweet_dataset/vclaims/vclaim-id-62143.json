Also, in the image, we can see a laptop and a couple of books lying beside Modi. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo-op of PM Modi reading books, a newspaper in these times of COVID-19 pandemic. Fact: The same image is featured in a listicle dated 14 September 2013 and the image is available on the internet at least since 2011. The description of this image reads \u2018Gujarat Chief Minister on the lawns of his palatial home in Gandhinagar\u2019. Thus the image is many years old. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nA reverse image search of this photo led us to a listicle dated 14 September 2013. The title of the listicle reads \u201c30 things you should know about Narendra Modi\u201d.\n\nDescription of this particular image in the listicle reads \u2018Gujarat Chief Minister on the lawns of his palatial home in Gandhinagar\u2019. The same picture is also available on blogs and other sources since 2011.\n\nTo sum it up, an old image is being shared as photo-op of Prime Minister Modi with books, a newspaper in these times of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
