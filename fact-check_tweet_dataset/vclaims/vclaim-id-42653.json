The claim is false; health experts warn that water alone cannot kill the virus and recommend that people wash their hands with soap and water for effective protection.\n\nThis report by Gosulsel.com published on January 27, 2020 cites a doctor who claims Islamic ablution water can destroy coronavirus.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading report:\n\nThe report\u2019s Indonesian language headline translates to English as: \u201cDr Luthfi Parewangi Says Wudhu Can Destroy Coronavirus\u201d.\n\nWudhu, or wudu, is an Islamic ablution ritual required before performing certain acts particularly worship. The practice is performed using plain water; the steps on how to perform it can be read here.\n\nPart of the report translates to English as: \u201cIn response to that matter, an internist in Makassar, Dr. dr Luthfi Parewangi, SpPD, said that Indonesian people do not have to worry about the virus.\n\n\u201cIn his opinion, Indonesia is a country with abundance of water. He explained that coronavirus will be destroyed with water. One thing that can be done, particularly by Muslims, is to maintain ablution.\u201d\n\nSimilar claims citing the same doctor were also published in other reports, including by Koran Seruya and Asianmuslim.com, and in Facebook posts here, here and here. Posts on Twitter here, here and here also shared a link to a report that contained a similar claim.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\n\u201cThere has not been any scientific evidence to suggest that coronavirus can be killed with plain water,\u201d Dr Dirga Sakti Rambe, an internist and vaccinologist with OMNI Pulomas Hospital in Jakarta, told AFP via WhatsApp on March 11, 2020.\n\nSimilarly, the World Health Organization's (WHO) representative in Indonesia told AFP by email on March 12, 2020, that \u201cin order to kill the virus, WHO recommends that you wash your hands with soap and water or clean them regularly with an alcohol-based hand rub.\u201d\n\nThe agency also recommends that people \u201cclean surfaces regularly with disinfectant -- for example kitchen benches and work desks.\u201d\n\nThe same hand washing recommendation is also published on the WHO's official prevention guidelines here.\n\nMoreover, the Indonesian Health Ministry also tweeted a video about how to prevent the coronavirus infection, which includes \u201cwashing hands with soap and flowing water\u201d.\n\nThe ministry also advises mosques to \u201cmaintain hygiene at ablution areas and toilets with disinfectant\u201d.\n\nThe coronavirus has infected more than 191,000 people and killed more than 7,800 worldwide since it was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, according to this WHO report on March 18, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
