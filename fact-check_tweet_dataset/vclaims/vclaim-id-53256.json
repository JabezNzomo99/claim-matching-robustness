The move left the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies open to attack by Turkey and was criticized by several Republican and Democrat politicians, as well as numerous current and former military officials:\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was controversial, but the above-displayed photograph does not depict U.S. soldiers in Syria in 2019 criticizing their commander-in-chief.\n\nThe picture was taken in December 2011 and shows three soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team at Camp Virginia in Kuwait.

Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear which parts of this Twitter thread are anecdotal and which can be directly attributed to the news segment it links.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible that a U.S. soldier said something similar to the quote posted above, the accompanying photograph is unrelated because it was taken in Kuwait in 2011 and not Syria in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
