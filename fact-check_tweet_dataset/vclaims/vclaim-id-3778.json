On March 21, Rajapaksa himself tweeted from Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo International Airport, claiming that officials with Emirates Airlines would not allow him to board his flight to Houston, Texas.\n\nRajapaksa implies three possible reasons for being prevented from flying to the U.S., one being his \u201ctravel to Russia.\u201d A reader of RIA Novosti\u2019s headline could not be faulted for jumping to a similar conclusion:\u201cSon of the ex-president of Sri Lanka not allowed into the U.S. after a trip to Russia.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the reason he could not travel to the U.S. is more straightforward. According the U.S. government he lacked \u201ca valid visa.\u201d\n\nOn his personal website, Namal Rajapaksa, 31, describes himself as follows: \u201cA Proud Citizen of Sri Lanka. A Member of Parliament. A Lawyer. A Philanthropist. A Rugby Player. A Yoga Enthusiast.\u201d One thing he does not mention is any history of being an election observer. Rajapaksa also claimed he received no explanation from U.S. authorities as to why he was barred entry.\n\nIf one were to read further down in the RIA Novosti article, however, there is a sentence which suggests a more likely reason why airline officials didn\u2019t allow Rajapaksa to board his flight to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAccording to The Daily Mail, the ban on entry to the U.S. may be connected with the fact that in his homeland he has been accused of money laundering,\u201d the text reads.\n\nA cursory search reveals a number of news reports about the incident in Moscow and Rajapaksa\u2019s legal case. The New Indian Express, for example, reported that:\n\n\u201cU.S. authorities do not comment on individual cases, but official sources said his name was likely on a travel watch list as a result of money laundering charges he faces at home.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail, the source cited in RIA Novosti\u2019s story, notes that Rajapaksa\u2019s passport had been \u201cimpounded\u201d by Sri Lankan authorities, but that he was granted a two-month exception by a judge to travel to Russia and Nepal.\n\nPolygraph contacted U.S. Border Patrol, which provided the following statement:\n\n\u201cAll travelers arriving to the United States must possess valid travel documents. For foreign nationals, this includes a current passport and a valid visa or visa waiver issued by the U.S. Government. In this instance, Mr. Namal Rajapaksa, 31, did not have a valid visa to travel to the U.S. and without valid travel documents, airline carriers do not normally allow international passengers to board flights destined to the U.S.\u201d\n\nBased on this statement and the details of his pending criminal case at home, the explanation for Rajapaksa\u2019s ban is not based on Russian-U.S. politics.", "lang": "en"}
