The page has over 480,000 followers. The same image with the identical message has been posted on some other pages as well. The image has been shared widely on WhatsApp. Several followers reached out to Alt News seeking confirmation about the veracity of the picture.\n\nThe picture of the Bombay Stock Exchange which has been circulating on social media is photoshopped. It was tweeted by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on April 14.\n\nKamra had tweeted several photographs which were photoshopped with the words \u2018Dont Vote for Modi\u2019, in a dig at the Prime Minister and the ruling party. The photos were in the nature of sarcasm, as Kamra had tweeted them with the words \u201cThese photos are as real as Modiji\u2019s promises\u2026\u201d. Some of the other motifs that Kamra had used included the recent image of the black hole, and a photograph of protests against the Simon Commission, of 1927 (posted below).\n\nKamra\u2019s humour however has not gone down too well with the BSE, which has tweeted that it \u201creserves the right to take appropriate legal action\u201d.\n\nIn response, Kamra has clarified that the photograph was meant to be a joke.\n\nThe comparison of the original image vs the photoshopped one can be seen below.", "lang": "en"}
