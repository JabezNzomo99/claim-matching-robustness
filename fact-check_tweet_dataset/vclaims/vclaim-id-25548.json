While on the Indian side there has been an attempt to portray normalcy in the Valley, misinformation streaming from Pakistan attempts to show the Indian government\u2019s brutality on Kashmiris. In the latest such case, a video where female protestors are being dragged by the police and pushed inside a bus is floating on Pakistani social media ecosystem with the claim that the scenes were recently shot in Kashmir.\n\nThe above video was shared by a Facebook page \u2018MaaZoo\u2019 and has attracted over 3 million views and nearly one lakh shares since August 23. The page claims that the video depicts the oppression of Kashmiris after the dilution of Article 370 \u2013 \u201c\u0648\u06cc\u0688\u06cc\u0648 \u067e\u0631 \u06a9\u0644\u06a9 \u06a9\u0631 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0634\u06cc\u0626\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0632\u06c1 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0648\u06cc\u0688\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0634\u06cc\u0626\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u06c1 \u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0648\u062a\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u0648 \u0634\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u062c\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0646\u06d2.\u201d\n\nThe same video has also been circulated by multiple Twitter users.\n\nOld video of teachers\u2019 protest in Haryana\n\nThere are several hints which debunk the falseness of the claim that the video was shot in Kashmir. A person on the other side of the camera, possibly the individual shooting the video, says, \u201cThis is a protest by JBT teachers outside the CM\u2019s office. These are live scenes of the protest from Karnal.\n\nKarnal is a city in Haryana and JBT stands for Junior Basic Training which is a diploma level Educational course.\n\nFurthermore, there is \u2018Karnal Haryana\u2019 imprinted on the side of a bus visible in the video.\n\nAlt News searched for the video on Facebook using keywords \u2013 \u201cJBT teachers protest Haryana\u201d \u2013 and we were directed to the same clip which is currently viral with a false narrative. The video was a Facebook Live posted by the page \u2018Karnal Breaking News\u2019 on June 11, 2017. According to the page, women JBT teachers were protesting outside the Chief Minister\u2019s Camp Office when women police personnel dragged and shoved them into buses. The protest was organised in CM City Karnal by JBT teachers to save their jobs.\n\nAccording to a June 2, 2017 report by The Tribune, \u201cThe Haryana Government has issued a revised combined merit list of JBT and primary teachers following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. With the revised list, nearly 1,225 Junior Basic Training (JBT) teachers and Primary teachers (PRTs), who were issued appointment letters, are set to lose their jobs.\u201d\n\nA video of a two-year-old protest in Haryana has been picked up by Pakistani social media users and floated as protests in Kashmir where the police are manhandling the people. Similar misinformation has been peddled in the past \u2013 a protest in Mizoram was shared as that in Kashmir, video of Burhan Wani\u2019s funeral procession was floated as Kashmiris protesting and another clip of a funeral procession in Kashmir was shared as citizens protesting against Article 370\u2019s dilution.", "lang": "en"}
