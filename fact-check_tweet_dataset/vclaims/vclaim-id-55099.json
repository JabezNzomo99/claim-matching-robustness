This photograph was taken by Alex Brandon and is available via The Associated Press with the following caption:\n\nThe above-displayed image was widely circulated on social media along with comments about how Fauci was setting a bad example or acting hypocritical by wearing a mask below his mouth and not social distancing, but the above-displayed picture may not be as \u201cdamning\u201d as some are presenting it.\n\nThe woman on Fauci\u2019s left is his wife, Christine Grady, and the man on Fauci\u2019s right is a \u201cclose friend\u201d of the NIAID director. This man was also described in a photograph from USA Today as one of Fauci\u2019s \u201cguests\u201d at the event. In other words, the two other people in this photograph appear to be part of Fauci\u2019s inner circle, which may reduce the need for social distancing in this instance.\n\nIt should also be noted that a water bottle can be seen directly in front of Fauci, and that the NIAID director and his guests are sitting outside. In many cities where restaurants and other businesses have reopened, people are allowed to remove their masks when they are eating or drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also notes that outdoor activities, such as attending a baseball game in an open-air stadium, is safer than indoor activities.\n\nThe above-displayed photograph shows Fauci outdoors with his wife and a close friend while he was presumably drinking a bottle of water. Although wearing a mask at all times is certainly the safest option, it doesn\u2019t appear that Fauci was acting contradictory to the recommendations offered by himself, the NIAID, or the CDC.\n\nOn July 24, Fauci was asked about this photograph during an interview on Fox News. Fauci said:\n\nThe other person is a very close friend of mine. John, I think this is sort of mischievous with this thing going around. I had my mask around my chin, I had taken it down. I was totally dehydrated and I was drinking water trying to rehydrate myself. And by the way, I was negative Covid literally the day before. So I guess if people want to make a thing of that, I wear a mask all the time when I\u2019m outside. To pull it down, to take some sips of water, and put it back up again, I guess if people want to make something about that, they can. But to me, I think that\u2019s just mischievous.", "lang": "en"}
