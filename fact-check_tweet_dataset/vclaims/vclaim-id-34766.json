The image is of a German-English dictionary which was used in an experiment where it was artificially crystallised.\n\nThe message with the post reads, An ancient Bible has been found at the bottom of the ocean and is still readable! The user also urges netizens to share the photo and spread the message.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThere are other users on social media who claimed it to be the Quran, arguing that it was discovered undersea.\n\nAFWA has found that it is an old photo which has been resurfacing on various social media platforms for the last few years. Through reverse search, AFWA found out that a blog named Stuff You Can\u2019t Have\u2019 had uploaded the photo on May 18, 2014. Check out the photos below.\n\nThe owner of the blog, Catherine McEver, titled the set of photos as Crystallization Experiments 1: Books and Paper Ephemera\u2019.\n\nWhen contacted by India Today, Catherine said, \"The entire Facebook story is fake. I am the artist who made the book as a work of art. Someone stole the photo of the book from my blog and used it to create fake news. This book is not a Bible, it is a German-English dictionary. I bought the book from a thrift store.\"\n\nAFP had debunked the claim in the past.\n\nCatherine has also mentioned about her work, My artwork includes assemblage, textile art, installation/interactive pieces and fashioning things out of unlikely materials, she wrote.\u2019 It is clear from the blog that the artist was conducting an experiment with the book by artificially crystallising it.", "lang": "en"}
