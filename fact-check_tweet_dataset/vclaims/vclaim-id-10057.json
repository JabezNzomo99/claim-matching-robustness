Bought and paid for by Crooked H\u2026.\" he tweeted on Nov. 2, 2017.\n\nTrump was referring to Brazile\u2019s forthcoming book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nBrazile, however, tweeted several responses to Trump a few times to say he had mischaracterized what she had written. Among them:\n\nWe wanted to crack open the book\u2019s available portion and determine whether Trump misrepresented Brazile\u2019s point. We found her words could be interpreted in different ways, so we decided to let readers review her words and decide for themselves.\n\nBrazile criticized the relationship between the DNC and the Clinton campaign without using the word \"rigged.\" But it\u2019s clear Brazile thought Clinton\u2019s campaign held plenty of sway they probably shouldn\u2019t have had.\n\nSo what did she really write?\n\nThe excerpt said that the DNC\u2019s finances were in disarray when she took over as interim chairwoman in July 2016, after leaked emails showed members of the party favored Clinton.\n\nBrazile said that she had promised Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders she \"would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton\u2019s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested.\"\n\nShe wrote that the party was broke and millions of dollars in debt and that former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"was not a good manager.\"\n\n\"She hadn\u2019t been very interested in controlling the party \u2014 she let Clinton\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn\u2019t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was,\" Brazile\u2019s excerpt said.\n\nShe added that she had tried to determine the extent of Clinton\u2019s control, and learned that the DNC, Hillary for America and the Hillary Victory Fund had reached a deal, called a joint fundraising agreement, for Clinton\u2019s campaign to help the party with its debt in August 2015.\n\n\"The agreement \u2014 signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias \u2014 specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party\u2019s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.\"\n\nPolitico reported Clinton reaching a fundraising agreement that month. They noted that all 50 state parties were invited to participate and that \"the Clinton campaign, wary of management and structural problems at the DNC, insisted on a tight rein on spending.\"\n\nSanders signed his own joint fundraising agreement in November 2015.\n\nBrazile wrote that it was normal for a nominee to start exerting control over the party, but the Clinton campaign\u2019s agreement seemed to come exceptionally early.\n\n\"I had tried to search out any other evidence of internal corruption that would show that the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary, but I could not find any in party affairs or among the staff. I had gone department by department, investigating individual conduct for evidence of skewed decisions, and I was happy to see that I had found none. Then I found this agreement.\n\n\"The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party\u2019s integrity.\"", "lang": "en"}
