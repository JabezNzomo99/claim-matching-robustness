But the infographics have been shared in a misleading context; Singapore does not have a minimum wage law; the country\u2019s prime minister is one of the highest paid leaders in the world but the infographic uses out of date salary figures.\n\nThe two infographics were shared in this Facebook post by a page with more than 57,000 followers on May 1.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe first infographic shows a graph comparing the monthly minimum wage in selected countries.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the infographic:\n\nThe infographic is misleading; Singapore does not have a minimum wage law.\n\nThis page on an official website for Ministry of Manpower within the Singapore government website states: \u201cSingapore does not have a minimum wage. Your salary is subject to negotiation and agreement between your employer and you or your trade union.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the infographic in the misleading Facebook post was captured from this Singaporean blog published on September 22, 2014.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the infographic on the blog:\n\nThe title above the blog\u2019s infographic states the monthly minimum wages were calculated for 2013. The date was not included in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nThe text above the blog\u2019s infographic states: \u201cThe PAP government has refused to set a minimum wage to protect Singaporeans but the $1,000 they are finally willing to give to cleaners can be seen as a de facto minimum wage. But even then, this is only $1,000.\u201d\n\nThis text refers to Singapore\u2019s Progressive Wage Model, which applies to workers in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors. This page on the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s website gives details of the model.\n\nAccording to this page on the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s website, minimum wage rates have been enforced for those working in the aforementioned sectors.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the minimum wages of outsourced resident cleaners as of July 2018:\n\nThe government web page states \u201cGeneral/indoor cleaners\u201d in an office or commercial environment must be paid at least SGD$1,120 per month.\n\nThe second infographic in the misleading Facebook post appears to show Singapore\u2019s prime minister receives the highest salary of any world leader, but the figure cited in the misleading post is not up-to-date.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the infographic:\n\nThe infographic states Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s salary was USD$1,700,000 in 2015.\n\n\u201cLee Hsien Loong\u201d refers to the prime minister of Singapore. This is his official Twitter page.\n\nA Google keyword search found the second infographic in the misleading post was taken from this report by Statista, a German online statistics portal.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe Statista infographic states Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s salary was USD$1,700,000 in 2015, which is equal to SGD$2.3 million according to this conversion rate.\n\nIn May 2019, Singapore\u2019s Public Service Division stated here that Lee\u2019s salary was SGD$2.2million.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the statement:\n\nThis AFP report published on March 1, 2018, also stated Lee\u2019s salary was SGD$2.2million.\n\nIn this report published by US-based financial news site Wall Street 24/7 on April 16, 2019, Lee was listed as the highest paid world leader.\n\nThe report states here that the list excluded \u201cleaders of absolute monarchies such as Qatar, Brunei Darussalam, and Saudi Arabia\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
