Not really, the headline is entirely made up, there is no truth to it at all. It was used by a scammy website being run from Eastern Europe that hopes to profit from gullible Trump supporters by feeding them fake headlines via dozens of pro-Trump Facebook groups and hoping they will click through to the website operated by the scammers so they can earn some money through advertising.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by ViralityThings on July 4, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: $1.8 BIL Of Soros' Money Just Intercepted - He Could Officially Go To Prison For Years\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nGeorge Soros is at it again throwing his money around and trying to manipulate political races. This time he's trying to reshape the nation's criminal justice system. Soros thinks he can do this by dumping $1.8 billion into four of the 56 district attorney positions in California up for grabs June 5th. This is the same kind of tactic he used to grab control of attorney generals in varying states. Soros isn't the only one either. Wealthy progressive liberal donors are also pouring millions of dollars into these races. Liberal groups are offering their support to would-be prosecutors who favor lower incarceration rates, crackdowns on police misconduct and changes in a bail system that they argue discriminates against the poor, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe rest of the article doesn't mention the sum of $1.8 billion dollars at all and also fails to explain how, why and where it was supposedly \"intercepted\" or why that would land George Soros in prison.\n\nIn fact, most of the rest of the article is blatantly copy-pasted from this L.A. Times article (archived here in case you live in Europe) which doesn't mention $1.8 billion or Soros going to prison either:\n\nThe website viralitythings.us was only registered in April by someone from Albania or Kosovo:\n\nNot exactly your most reliable source of news when it comes to Hollywood or politics...\n\nThe Soros article was posted in at least 13 pro-Trump Facebook groups on July 4, 2018 by sockpuppet accounts according to Facebook's CrowdTangle tool.\n\nWe wrote about viralitythings.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Uma Thurman Did NOT Say Trump Is The Best President in U.S. history And We Must Respect Him", "lang": "en"}
