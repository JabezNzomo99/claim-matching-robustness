The Minister was right with his comment that Nigeria is the largest producer of rice in Africa. Data sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and United States Department of Agriculture confirm the minister\u2019s claim.\n\nOn Monday 17th August, 2020, in a report in one of Vision FM\u2019s Flagship Programme in Hausa, Taskar Vision, the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, said Nigeria is ranked 13th in the production of rice in the World, and the 1st in Africa.\n\nIn the Current Affairs programme aired in all Vision FM Stations in seven (7) Northern states (Abuja, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Kano, Kaduna and Gombe), the minister said in Hausa, \u201cWe are currently the 13th position in Rice production in the World. In Africa we are the 1st.\u201d\n\nThe Minister was answering questions as to whether or not there will be a food crisis in Nigeria due to COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nNanono continued \u201cWith what we are seeing, God willing, we won\u2019t experience food shortage like people are expecting.\u201d\n\n\u201cRainy season is here and people are farming more than they used to. I\u2019m not ruling out that there is no insecurity. But that won\u2019t stop people from farming\u201d he said.\n\nIn July this year, the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Gutteres, said the world stands at the brink of suffering a food crisis the globe has not experienced in the past 50 years.\n\n\u201cUnless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending global food emergency that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,\u201d Angonio Gutteres said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the UN, about 820million people are already going hungry, saying the number will definitely rise.\n\n\u201cOur food systems are failing, and the COVID-19 pandemic is making things worse,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria is estimated to produce 8 million tonnes of rice in 2020, according to an estimate by the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nNigeria\u2019s rice produce has continued to rise since 2014 at 6million tonnes and 2015 6.2million tonnes. It peaked in 2016 at 7.5million tonnes but dropped to 6.6million tonnes in 2017, before rising again to 6.8million tonnes in 2018, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) revealed.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) source data largely from member countries and based on imputation methodology.\n\nIn 2014, Nigeria overtook Egypt to become Africa\u2019s Largest Producer of rice when production reached 6million tonnes from 4.8million tonnes in 2013, according to Index Mundi which sourced it information from the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nNot all Rosy \u2014 Nigeria still import rice\n\nNigeria only produces 55% of its rice consumption, according to the Rice Industry Review.\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria produced 8 million metric tonnes of rice, puting the country among the top 20 producers of rice in the world, according to Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nAlthough Nigeria has been the largest producer of rice in Africa since it overtook Egypt in 2014, Nigeria is still the 4th Largest Importer of Rice, estimated to import 1.4 million tonnes in 2020, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nNigeria still maintains the first place in Africa with Egypt and Madagascar following closely in the second and third place respectively.\n\nHowever, despite Nigeria being one of the largest producers of rice in the world, it is still among the largest importers, like China which is the largest producer in the world and one of the largest importers of rice.\n\nThe Minister was right with his comment that Nigeria is the largest producer of rice in Africa. Data sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and United States Department of Agriculture confirm the minister\u2019s claim.\n\nThe researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Vision FM to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
