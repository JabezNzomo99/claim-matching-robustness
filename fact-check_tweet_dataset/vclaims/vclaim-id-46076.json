It commissioned research agency Opinium to survey a representative group of UK adults between 20-24 March who were working prior to the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOf those who said that their work was impacted by the new coronavirus, 11% said they had been evicted. This accounts for 4% of everyone who was in employment before the outbreak.\n\nWith 33 million people employed in the UK in January this year, this would equate to around 1.3 million workers being evicted (to say nothing of their families).\n\nThis number far exceeds the housing charity Shelter\u2019s figure of 20,000 formal evictions (though this doesn\u2019t include informal evictions which don\u2019t involve any court proceedings), which is based on ongoing eviction cases in the courts which began before the government\u2019s recent ban on evictions. Those are taking place due to all reasons, and not just coronavirus-related ones.\n\nGrantley White Senior Research Executive at Opinium told us: \u201cWhen it comes to the exact number of evictions taking place, this is a number that will be hard to understand for a number of methodological reasons. Nonetheless, we would expect that Shelter\u2019s figures are very close to being an accurate representation because they will be using a methodology specifically designed to establish such detailed figures - our survey was aimed at capturing broader trends.\u201d\n\nWe asked Shelter about the number of recent evictions and a spokesperson told us: \u201cAnecdotal evidence plus our experience researching housing and homelessness, and the private rented sector particularly, tell us that there almost certainly has been a spike in formal and informal evictions in the period just before the Government\u2019s protections come into force.\n\n\u201cHowever the level reported in this story and by the Opinium poll does not intuitively feel right.\u201d\n\nShelter added: \u201cIt seems clear to us that there has been some misunderstanding of this question by respondents and that perhaps fears of not being able to afford to pay for their housing, have in some cases got mixed up with actual eviction.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that we are not extremely concerned about a probable rise in evictions as the implications of the virus on the UK have been becoming clear.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
