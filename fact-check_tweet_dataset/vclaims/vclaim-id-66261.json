The story appears to be copied from The Daily World Update, a website that purports to be satire.\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

First off, the queen is 92 years old, not 94. But more importantly, the queen is not dead.\n\nIf the queen had died, it would be reported by legitimate news outlets, like the BBC or the Guardian. And there would likely be a post about it in press releases of the official website of the British Royal family (which is teeming with news about the birth of Prince Louis and the impending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry).\n\nIn reality, on the same day this hoax published, the queen was actually at the Royal Windsor Horse Show where she was pictured smiling.\n\nWhen the queen does pass away, it will be the \"most disruptive event in Britain in the last 70 years,\" according to Business Insider.\n\n\"For at least 12 days \u2014 between her passing, the funeral and beyond \u2014 Britain will grind to a halt,\" the article said. \"It'll cost the British economy billions in lost earnings.\"\n\nThere was one recent death in the royal family: the queen\u2019s dog, Willow. Willow, the 14-year old corgi was put down in April following a battle with cancer. Willow\u2019s death was particularly significant, as it was the last in a long line of royal corgis.\n\nWe rate the story about the queen being dead Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
