A google search with the name of the youtube account led to Unite the Union's website.\n\nReportedly, BA had planned to cut 12,000 staff, or more than a quarter of its workforce, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and has also angered unions by proposing new contracts for the workers it keeps. The trade union had responded by lobbying for the law to be changed to allow BA to be stripped of some valuable take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport if it proceeds with its plans. Below is a screenshot of the original 'Unite the Union' youtube account which has 2.6k subscribers:\n\nThus, we can conclude that the airline is still operating.
