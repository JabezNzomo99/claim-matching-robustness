No, that's not true: The claim was made in a YouTube post that carried a false headline but no details to support it in the video. Grier's representative has confirmed the claim is bogus. The channel that published the video was also recently busted for falsely claiming that TV host Robin Roberts was dying of cancer.\n\nThe claim originated from a video (archived here) posted on the World of Stars YouTube channel on January 2, 2020, under the title \"Prayers Up, Pam Grier Have Only Few Days To Live After Her Battle With Stage 4 Cancer\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThis is an example of the false video being shared as true on Facebook:\n\nTMZ shot down the healh rumor on Friday, January 3, 2019, in a report titled Pam Grier No Stage-4 Cancer Here!!! Despite Social Media Rumor:\n\nA rep for Pam tells us the rumors are bogus ... she's as healthy as ever. Pam's rep says Grier will be headed to work tomorrow on season 3 of her ABC show, \"Bless This Mess.\" Pam puts in 8-10 hour days when she's working. Grier was diagnosed with stage-4 cervical cancer in 1988 and given just 18 months to live. Through tough treatment, she made a recovery and has been in remission ever since.\n\nWhile the video headline makes the claim that Grier has \"ony few days to live,\" the actual video is simply a female narrator reading an old profile story about Grier's earlier successful battle with cancer. We found that story from May of 2019, titled 'They Gave Me Only 16-18 Months to Live,' Pam Grier on Hardships She Faced Fighting Cervical Cancer.\n\nThis was the second false celebrity health video by this channel that Lead Stories has debunked.
