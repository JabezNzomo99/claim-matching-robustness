This is false; the central bank did change its policy on textiles in March 2019 but this does not amount to an import ban.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: CBN bans importation of textile materials,\u201d reads the March 5 Facebook post by the Nigerian Tribune newspaper, which has nearly a million followers on Facebook.\n\nThe link in the Facebook post leads to an article (here's an archived version) on the Nigerian Tribune's website with the same headline. But the article itself -- which is only four lines long -- contains nothing which actually backs up the claim that Nigeria has banned textile imports.\n\nInstead, the article states -- correctly -- that the CBN has added textiles to a list of items that are not eligible for foreign exchange.\n\nThis means that Nigerians or Nigerian businesses planning to import any of these items from another country cannot buy dollars, euros or any other foreign currencies from authorised forex dealers in Nigeria -- predominantly the banks -- with which to pay their suppliers.\n\nTherefore, anyone seeking to import textiles, or any other items on the list, would have to buy their dollars or other foreign currencies from the black market, where the prices are slightly higher. The CBN trades $1 for N305 officially, but also has an importer/exporter window which authorises currency exchanges between people that want to buy naira in order to invest in Nigeria, and people that want dollars or another currency in order to buy imports. The same $1 sells at this window for about N360. On the black market, $1 sells for even more than N360.\n\nThe CBN has rationed the sale of foreign currency to businesses and individuals since 2015, when the price of crude oil -- the mainstay of the Nigerian economy -- suffered a drastic fall on global markets. Oil was, and remains, Nigeria\u2019s biggest source of foreign exchange earnings, so the fall in prices left the government scrambling to ensure it wasn\u2019t going to run out of foreign currency reserves.\n\nThe bank at the time released a list of 41 items not eligible for foreign exchange, including toothpicks, rice, cement and even Indian incense sticks. The bank said the policy was designed to conserve foreign exchange and boost local production of the 41 items.\n\nIt stated categorically that \u201cfor the avoidance of doubt, please note that the importation of these items are not banned, thus importers desirous of importing these items shall do so using their funds without any recourse to the Nigerian foreign exchange markets\u201d.\n\nFertiliser was added to the list in December 2018.\n\nHow has the CBN\u2019s policy on textiles actually changed?\n\nOn March 5, CBN governor Godwin Emefiele told a meeting with Nigerian cotton producers that the bank was adding textiles to the items not eligible for foreign exchange, as seen in the video below.\n\nJust like the items that were already on the list, the restrictions do not mean that Nigerians are banned from importing textiles -- just that anyone wanting to do so will not be able to buy the foreign currency needed for the purchase through an authorised forex trader. They\u2019d have to get their currency on Nigeria\u2019s well-established informal or \u201cblack\u201d market for forex, which can in some cases be done legally.\n\nThe policy makes imports of textiles more expensive for the importer, and more difficult. But it does not make them impossible.\n\nCBN spokesman Isaac Okorafor confirmed to AFP that Emefiele\u2019s announcement was \u201cnot a ban on the importation of textiles\u201d.\n\nInstead it is \u201ca restriction of access to forex from the Nigerian forex market to importers of textile, meaning that importers can source their own forex autonomously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo authorized forex dealer is allowed to sell forex from the Nigerian forex market to anyone importing textile into Nigeria,\u201d he added.", "lang": "en"}
