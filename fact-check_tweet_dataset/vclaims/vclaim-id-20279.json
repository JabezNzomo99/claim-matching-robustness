This article is a fact check of these claims.\n\nWhat is the Jan Dhan Yojana?\n\n According to the official website, \u2018the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a National Mission on Financial Inclusion encompassing an integrated approach to bring about comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country. The plan envisages universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension facility. In addition, the beneficiaries would get RuPay Debit card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh. The plan also envisages channelling all Government benefits to the beneficiaries\u2019 accounts and pushing the Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme of the Union Government\u2019.\n\nA response in Lok Sabha in November 2014 stated that \u2018PMJDY was formally launched in August, 2014. The Yojana envisages universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension. The beneficiaries would get a RuPay Debit Card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs.1.00 Iakh. In addition, there is a life insurance cover of Rs. 30000 to those people who open their bank accounts for the first time between August 2014 & January 2015 and meet other eligibility conditions of the Yojana\u2019.\n\n \n\n Further, the government stated in the Lok Sabha that, \u2018PMJDY is different from the earlier financial inclusion programme (Swabhimaan) as it seeks to provide universal access to banking services across the country and focuses on coverage of all households (both rural and urban) while the earlier Financial Inclusion programme was limited to providing access point to villages with population greater than 2000. Further, PMJDY focuses on interoperability of accounts which was not there earlier; has simplified KYC guidelines and involves the Districts and States for monitoring and follow-up\u2019.\n\nTo add to this, \u2018there is no requirement of maintaining any minimum balance in case of accounts opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)\u2019. However, it has to be noted that the concept of zero balance accounts (or no minimum balance account) is not new. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had directed all banks in the year 2005 to make available a basic banking \u2018no-frills\u2019 account either with \u2018nil\u2019 or very low minimum balances. Such an account was called \u2018Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA)\u2019. In fact, the RBI has now issued notifications with instructions that a BSBD account-holder of a particular Bank cannot open any other savings bank deposit account in the same bank, including the PMJDY account. In other words, a BSBD account is treated on par with a PMJDY account.\n\nHow many accounts have been opened under the scheme?\n\n The first claim is that \u201831.52 crore Jan Dhan accounts opened\u2019.\n\nResponses in the Lok Sabha show that, \u2018as of December 2017, a total of 30.71 crore accounts have been opened under PMJDY and more recently, \u2018as per the data sourced from banks, as of January 2019, out of the total 34.03 crore PMJDY accounts, 5.06 crore accounts were having zero balance\u2019.\n\nDoes India account for more than half of the new bank accounts in the world between 2014-17?\n\n The second claim is that \u2018according to the World Bank Findex Report, India accounts for 55% of new bank accounts opened globally between 2014-17\u2019.\n\nThe first Global Findex survey was completed in 2011, followed by a second round in 2014 and the latest one in 2017. Globally over those intervals, the share of adults with an account rose from 51% to 62% and then to 69%.\n\nThe report notes, \u2018in India the share of adults with an account has more than doubled since 2011, to 80 percent. An important factor driving this increase was a government policy launched in 2014 to boost account ownership among unbanked adults through biometric identification cards. This policy benefited traditionally excluded groups and helped ensure inclusive growth in account ownership. Between 2014 and 2017 account ownership in India rose by more than 30 percentage points among women as well as among adults in the poorest 40% of households. Among men and among adults in the wealthiest 60% of households it increased by about 20 percentage points\u2019.\n\nThe same report also states that \u2018the share of account owners with an inactive account varies across economies, but it is especially high in many South Asian economies. In India, the share is 48%, the highest in the world and about twice the average of 25% for developing economies. Part of the explanation might be India\u2019s Jan Dhan Yojana scheme, developed by the government to increase account ownership. Launched in August 2014, the program had brought an additional 310 million Indians into the formal banking system by March 2018, many of whom might not yet have had an opportunity to use their new account\u2019.\n\nThough it is mentioned that 310 million Indians were brought into the banking system because of PMJDY, that is about a different time period. However, the report notes that, \u2018515 million adults worldwide opened an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money provider between 2014 and 2017\u2019. The 55% claim of the government seems to have been calculated based on the number of PMJDY accounts opened (310 million). However, the number of savings bank deposit accounts including new accounts in scheduled commercial banks increased from 97.77 crore as of 31st March 2014 to 150.2 crore as of 31st March 2017.\n\nWhat is the Indian postal payment bank? \n\n The last claim is that \u2018India Post Payment Bank to take the banking system to the doorstep of the poor and the unbanked\u2019.\n\nThe Cabinet in June 2016 had approved the proposal of Department of Posts for setting up of India Post Payments Bank with a direction to roll out 650 India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) branches co-located in district headquarter Post Offices and their linkage with all (approximately 1.55 lakh) Post offices across the country by September, 2017.\n\nAccording to the official information, \u2018IPPB aims to drive financial inclusion at the last mile, by bringing customers under formal banking channels and providing access to banking services at affordable rates. There are multiple socio-economic benefits that would be realized by the economy at large, and are mentioned below:\n\u2022 Migration from cash based transaction to digital economy, thus removing intermediaries leading to a more economical and efficient settlement of transactions.\n\u2022 Reduction in opportunity costs in availing banking and financial services leading to higher economic outputs.\n\u2022 Access to formal credit channels (through 3rd party tie ups) leading to increase in business capacity (at better rates) and productivity compared to the higher costs incurred otherwise, leading to higher income and lower costs\n\nAccording to another response in Lok Sabha, \u2018IPPB would be offering the payment bank services to the rural population using Door Step (Assisted) Banking along with the regular counter services through the Postmen/Gramin Dak Sewaks (GDS) and Postal Assistants\u2019.\n\nThe latest response about the IPPB in Lok Sabha in January 2019 states that \u2018India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) has rolled out 650 branches co-located in the District Headquarter Post Offices on 01st September, 2018 using its own IT platform. All the Post Offices in the District will be linked to the respective branches which will function also as Access Points of IPPB to offer IPPB services to customers. The IPPB branches will function as Controlling Office for managing the operations of Access Point of IPPB\u2019.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
