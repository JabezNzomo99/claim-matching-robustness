The level of casualisation hasn\u2019t changed for about 20 years.\u201d\n\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says trade unions have an important role but has taken issue with what she calls \u201coverstatements\u201d of trends in Australia\u2019s workforce composition.\n\nIn a speech at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University on October 31, Ms Westacott targeted the focus of unions on levels of casual work in Australia, saying: \u201cThe claim that the workforce is now excessively casualised is simply not true\u201d. \u201cThe level of casualisation hasn\u2019t changed for about 20 years,\u201d she said. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claim that there has been no change in the level of casual work in Australia for approximately two decades.\n\nMs Westacott made the claim as part of a speech titled, \u201cDo trade unions help or harm Australia\u2019s economy\u201d. The speech outlined the BCA\u2019s vision for the roles unions and business must play to improve Australia\u2019s economy and strengthen support for the most vulnerable in society. [2]\n\nMs Westacott described herself as a supporter of unions and the role unions have in ensuring the wellbeing of society. While she took issue with what she described as \u201ca short term campaigning focus\u201d by unions and \u201cthe risk of overstatements of important trends\u201d, Ms Westacott said there were important issues concerning underemployment, the so-called gig economy, and the rise of part-time work. [2]\n\nCasualisation and \u201cinsecure work\u201d are contested issues in Australia, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) claiming in 2018 that insecure work is rising and is \u201cthe biggest issue facing Australian workers\u201d. [3]\n\nAt the time of publication the ACTU were unable to provide AAP FactCheck with a definition of \u201cinsecure work.\u201d However in 2012 the ACTU commissioned an independent inquiry into insecure work, which was defined as \u201cthat which provides workers with little social and economic security, and little control over their working lives.\u201d Indicators of this included unpredictable, fluctuating pay; irregular and unpredictable working hours and inferior rights and entitlements. [4]\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says \u201cone of the main indicators for casual employment is whether an employee is entitled to paid leave, such as paid sick leave or paid annual leave\u201d. [5]\n\nMs Westacott\u2019s statement is supported by a January 2018 Parliamentary Library report, which states that from 1996 to 2016, the casual employee share of total employees increased \u201cmarginally\u201d from 24 per cent to 25 per cent. The same report notes that \u201cuse of casual employees in Australia grew most strongly from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s\u201d, increasing from around 13 per cent to 24 per cent. [6]\n\nA December 2018 Parliamentary Library report, by the same author, states that casual employees comprised 25.1 per cent of total employees in August 2017 and 24.6 per cent in August 2018. [7]\n\nThe report states: \u201cClaims have been made by some economic commentators and unions about the growing casualisation of the workforce and disproportionate growth in non-traditional or non-standard forms of employment. These claims are not supported by the latest data. While there have been periods where growth in casual employment has been stronger or weaker than permanent employment over the past 14 years, the casual share of employees and employment has not changed substantially in this time. In fact, over the whole period analysed, growth in the number of permanent employees has been stronger than growth in casual employees.\u201d [7]\n\nIn July 2018 the ABC examined a similar statement by the then workplace minister Craig Laundy. Mr Laundy said casuals had remained at a steady 25 per cent over the last 20 years and the ABC found the claim checked out, but noted it \u201crelied on a narrow definition of insecure work\u201d. [8]\n\nIn 2016 The Conversation probed the Australian Industry Group who said the percentage of casuals employed in Australia had not changed since 1998 and found ABS data to confirm Ai Group\u2019s statement. [9]\n\nACTU secretary Sally McManus said in a statement to AAP FactCheck that casualisation was only one of many non-standard forms of work \u201cwhich by some estimates accounts for half of the total workforce in Australia\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the percentage of employees who are engaged as casuals is similar today to what it was 20 years ago (20.6 per cent now compared to 20.1 per cent in 1998, that percentage has risen significantly in the past 10 years when it jumped from 19 per cent to today\u2019s levels). The real story here is the growth in numbers where casual employees have jumped from 2.2 million in 2008 to 2.6 million in 2018,\u201d she said.\n\nMs McManus referenced ABS figures in the December 2018 parliamentary report on trends in non-standard forms of employment and cited the change in casual share of employment. [7]\n\n\u201cAdded to the number of workers on casual employment contracts are the number of workers on fixed-term contracts or forced into independent contractor status. These workers are not counted in the BCA\u2019s number but they include most \u2018gig\u2019 economy workers.\u201d\n\nSenior Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne Dr Josh Healy told AAP FactCheck that, in official statistical terms, the proportion of casual employment in Australia sits at about a quarter of the workforce and has done so for many years.\n\nDr Healy said when viewing the situation through a wider lens, the bigger issue was about the idea of insecure employment, and the fact that casual employment figures remained about 25 per cent was still problematic. \u201cThe fact that proportion is stable is nothing to boast about, it represents a very large chunk of the workforce,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Healy pointed to the fact the ABS classifies a casual worker as an employee while a gig economy worker is considered a contractor, putting them in a separate data set to casual workers.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found Ms Westacott\u2019s statement that the level of casualisation in the workforce has not changed for about 20 years is true - a parliamentary library report using ABS data supports her statement. However the ACTU claims the definition of casual work is too narrow and excludes fixed-term workers and independent contractors. Ms Westacott also acknowledged there are \u201cimportant issues concerning underemployment, the so-called gig economy, and the rise of part time work\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
