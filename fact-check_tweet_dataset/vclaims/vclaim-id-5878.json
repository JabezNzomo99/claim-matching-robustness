She is the daughter of the late Shyamala Gopalan, who was Indian-American (here) and Donald Harris, a Black Jamaican man who emigrated to the United States in 1964 (here).\n\nKamala was never a police officer but served as \u201cTop Cop\u201d (slang for head of the police) indirectly through her positions as District Attorney of San Francisco from 2003 and subsequently as Attorney General of California from 2011 ( www.harris.senate.gov/about , oag.ca.gov/history/32harris ). Since 2017, she has been serving on the U.S. senate.\n\n\u201cTop Cop\u201d has been used to describe Harris\u2019 past record on crime by various publications, see here , here , here and here .\n\nThe New York Times wrote about the shift in her stance from her career in California to the summer of 2020, when Black Lives Matter protests spread across the United States and outlined her position on various high profile cases and her criminal justice work in California during career (here).\n\nThe Atlantic argued in an op-ed that she doesn\u2019t say enough when pressed about criticisms about her track record, \u201clike that she fought hard to keep innocents in prison and failed to fight hard against corrupt cops.\u201d (here)\n\nWhile it is true that Kamala Harris\u2019 father claimed to be a descendant of a slave owner, Harris and her family\u2019s relationship to Hamilton Brown remains unclear.\n\nIn an article published by the Jamaica Globe (here), professor Donald Harris wrote: \u201cMy roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy (n\u00e9e Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown\u2019s Town),\u201d a town in Jamaica.\n\nAccording to the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership, Hamilton Brown was an Irish resident slave-owner in Jamaica, and founder of Brown\u2019s Town (here). Snopes, which investigated this claim (here) in 2019, reported that Brown owned at least 121 and 124 slaves in 1826 and 1817, respectively.\n\nThese in-depth Fact Checks by Snopes and Politifact (here) have determined that while there is no clear evidence to prove Kamala Harris is a descendant of slave owners, it is likely that she is a descendant of both slaves and slave owners.\n\nAs explained by the Atlantic (here), \u201cthe overwhelming majority of African Americans have white male ancestors, largely because of white male slave owners who raped Black female slaves.\u201d\n\nThis dark historical fact undermines the point this claim tries to make - that having a white slave-owner in her ancestry makes Harris or any African American less Black.\n\nMissing context. The claims that Kamala Harris is a \u201ccop\u201d and that her \u201cfamily owned slaves in Jamaica\u201d are both missing essential context.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
