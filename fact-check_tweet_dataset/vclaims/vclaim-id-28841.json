All of them are boys!\"\n\nThe facts: The world record for most children delivered at a single birth to survive is held by Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to 8 babies on January 26, 2009.\n\nBefore Suleman, the record-holder for the category was Nkem Chukwu, who gave birth to octuplets in 1998. The Suleman octuplets surpassed the survival rate of the Chukwu octuplets, which is why they broke the previous record.\n\nThe image of the woman used in Moalboal Cebu Philippines' post was altered to look like she was more pregnant than she was. A reverse image search using TinEye showed that the photo was first uploaded to the website DeviantArt in August 2016.\n\nA Google reverse image search of the man with many babies leads to a HuffPost article that uses the photo. The author of the article identifies the man as Robert Biter, an obstetrician and gynecologist. He uses the photo on his website.\n\nThis claim has been making the rounds on the internet as far back as 2014. The website worldnewsdailyreport.com published a \"news report\" on the claim, but it only had a photo of many babies in a living room.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
