It appears the address was added as a practical joke.\n\nEpstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 from what officials deemed a suicide while awaiting trial for federal sex-trafficking charges, according to The New York Times. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested earlier this month on charges of allegedly helping recruit minors for Epstein to sexually abuse, sparking a number of dubious claims to circulate on social media.\n\nThis particular post attempts to link Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island, Little St. James, to the home address of the titular character from the popular Nickelodeon cartoon \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants.\u201d It juxtaposes two images \u2013 one of the character\u2019s driver\u2019s license and one of Google search results for \u201clittle st james island theme park address \u2013 to claim SpongeBob\u2019s address corresponds to a supposed \u201cLedges of Little St. James\u201d theme park on Epstein\u2019s island, where some of his accusers have said they were sexually abused.\n\n\u201cWhy is Jeffrey Epstein sex traffic island address doing on SPONGEBOB\u2026\u201d reads the caption. \u201cDO your research This is crazy.\u201d (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Visit Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Private Island At Least 17 Times?)\n\nWhile a Google search for \u201clittle st james island theme park address\u201d did at one point display the address for SpongeBob\u2019s \u201cpineapple under the sea\u201d on the northern tip of Little St. James, there is no actual connection between the fictional \u201c124 Conch St., Bikini Bottom\u201d address and Epstein\u2019s island. The address no longer appears at that location when you Google it. Satellite imagery of Little St. James from Google Earth and 360-degree drone footage from the Miami Herald also show no outdoor theme park on the island.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that, according to advertisers, search experts and current and former Google employees, Google Maps is \u201coverrun with millions of false business addresses and fake names.\u201d Anyone can \u201cpublicly add places, like a business or landmark, to the map,\u201d according to the help page for Google Maps.\n\nIn 2015, someone jokingly claimed the White House as the location of a fake snowboarding shop called \u201cEdwards Snow Den,\u201d seemingly referencing NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, per the Washington Post. The address for SpongeBob\u2019s \u201cpineapple under the sea\u201d also appears to have been added to Google Maps as a practical joke, as the phone number previously listed for the location on Little St. James was the same one for the \u201cSpongeBob and the Find Gary hotline,\u201d which was part of a promotion for a \u201cSpongeBob\u201d movie, per The Dispatch Fact Check.", "lang": "en"}
