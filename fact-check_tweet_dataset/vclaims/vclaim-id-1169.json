The image is a screenshot of a post made in a group where Colleyville residents discuss the community\u2019s issues. The post\u2019s story, however, is a hoax.\n\nIn the original post, a user named Sherry Michaels recounts how her daughter Natylee became sick from COVID-19 after the family went on outings to parks and local restaurants and hung out with friends, which \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been possible if Texas hadn\u2019t opened up\u201d - presumably a reference to Texas businesses reopening in May after lockdown ( open.texas.gov/ ).\n\nThe post concludes with the mother expressing pride in her local government in this time of \u201cliberal media indoctrination\u201d and includes the hashtag #MasksAreUnconstitutional. Examples of the post are visible here and here .\n\nThe claim comes amid orders by Texas Governor Greg Abbott to temporarily halt the state\u2019s reopening as COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations surged and the country set a new record for a one-day increase in cases, ( here ).\n\nOn June 28, a follow-up post from the Sherry Michaels account on Facebook said Sherry Michaels and her daughter Natylee Michaels were not real people. The fictitious story, according to the post, \u201cwas an attempt to test the beliefs of this community and bring light to the toxicity that exists on \u2018Colleyville Citizens Opposed to High Density\u2019 that is perpetuated by not only citizens of the Colleyville community, but also members of the city council.\u201d ( here ).\n\n\u201cWhile this may seem extreme,\u201d the post continued, \u201cthese are the very attitudes shared by many members of this community that we, as citizens, must sacrifice our lives and the lives of those we love to to (sic) uphold this idea that wearing masks is somehow a partisan issue.\u201d It ends by urging people to \u201cstop promoting hate and wear a damn mask\u201d.\n\nThe original post about the death of Natylee Michaels has been removed from the Colleyville Citizens Opposed to High Density group page. One user posted in the group:\u201cTo play a political game with what could be a fake profile scaring people about a recent death is despicable. I\u2019m sorry it has come down to this type of nastiness from folks to slant a point of view.\u201d ( here )\n\nAs of July 2, Colleyville had 76 COVID-19 and no deaths, according to numbers from Tarrant County. ( here ).\n\nLast week, the city hosted a large annual gathering called Stars and Guitars, where the use of face masks was not enforced, despite an order by the county, according to the Dallas Morning News ( here ).\n\nFalse. A social media post about the death of an 8-year old child from COVID-19 in Colleyville, Texas was a hoax.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
