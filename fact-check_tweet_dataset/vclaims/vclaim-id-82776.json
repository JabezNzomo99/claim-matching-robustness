Let\u2019s take a look, going through each of the key statements. This analysis expands on the Truth Teller treatment that the ad gets above, so be sure to watch the video as well.\n\nAs evidence, Ty Matsdorf of Senate Majority PAC pointed to a Facebook biography of Cotton. Most of the bio focuses on Cotton\u2019s military service, but it notes that he worked as a management consultant for McKinsey and Company. \u201cAs a businessman, Tom has advised some of America\u2019s most respected companies on business strategy, operations, finance, and marketing,\u201d the bio says. \u201cHis industry experience includes agribusiness, health care, oil and gas, food processing, insurance, and aerospace.\u201d\n\nBut there is even less to the story. David Ray, a Cotton spokesman, says that Cotton never actually worked for an insurance company as even a consultant. Instead, Ray says the \u201cinsurance\u201d in the bio refers to an assignment working for the Federal Housing Authority, in the office of multifamily housing programs, to improve its service in providing insurance to lenders who finance apartment buildings. In other words, he worked on an assignment to make the government more efficient. (The successful effort is described on page 10 of this McKinsey report.)\n\n\u201cNow Cotton wants to end Medicare\u2019s guarantee, giving billions in profits to insurance companies\u2026\u201d\n\nAs we have noted before, Senate Majority PAC seems stuck in a time warp on this talking point, referring back to an older version of the House Republican plan to transform the health-care system for the elderly by offering beneficiaries help in buying private insurance, known as \u201cpremium support.\u201d\n\nThe plan, authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), was substantially changed in 2012 to include an option for seniors to keep the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan if they preferred. So the \u201cguarantee\u201d is now there. (Claiming a federal program has a \u201cguarantee\u201d is a bit odd because a future Congress can change the terms of any government program.)\n\nWould the GOP plan give \u201cbillions in profits\u201d to insurance companies? The ad cites as its source a 2012 article in The New Republic, which in turn was based on an analysis by an Obama campaign adviser. We won\u2019t get into the weeds of this debate, except to note that the author states \u201cfor the record\u201d that it would be an \u201cover-simplification\u201d to claim that the GOP Medicare plan \u201cwould take your money and give to the insurance companies for their profits.\u201d\n\nThis is another talking point long past its due date. The $6,000 claim is based on a 2011 analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, using data from the Congressional Budget Office, regarding Ryan\u2019s original plan. The report said that in 2022, when the premium support system was expected to go into effect, a beneficiary\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses would double, from $6,000 to $12,000.\n\nThe premium support payment would be based on the cost of the second least-expensive private plan or traditional Medicare, whichever is lower. Any difference in costs would need to be made up by the beneficiary. But Medicare benefits of at least one plan supposedly would be covered by the premium-support payment.\n\nThe CBO did not do the same sort of extensive analysis of the revised Ryan plan, so there are no numbers as definitive as the original estimate of a $6,000 gap. CBO did say \u201cbeneficiaries might face higher costs,\u201d and other analyses have suggested any increase would be much lower than the earlier $6,000 estimate.\n\nSuch estimates are highly speculative. Even if enacted\u2014unlikely as long as Democrats control the presidency or at least one house of Congress\u2014the Republican plan would not go into effect for at least 10 years. So readers should simply ignore such hard-and-fast claims of specific cost increases.\n\nNone of the allegations made about Cotton or his policies are factually correct. In straining to somehow tie Cotton to insurance companies, Senate Majority PAC has managed to turn a job that Democrats might celebrate (developing a better functioning government program!) into a negative. The Medicare claims are so stale\u2014and so repeatedly discredited\u2014we can assume that polling indicates that the language is effective in moving voters, despite its falsity.", "lang": "en"}
