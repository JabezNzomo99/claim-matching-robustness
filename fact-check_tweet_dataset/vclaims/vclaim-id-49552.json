The 31-second clip shows police gathered outside Delhi\u2019s Dilshad garden metro station. The person shooting the video gives audio commentary that cops found a bomb at the station and people are advised to not touch anything. \u201cInform the police if you find something lying around,\u201d he furthers.\n\nThe video is widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, suggesting its possible circulation on WhatsApp as well.\n\nThe 31-second clip has been posted with a false narrative. There are no media reports which substantiate the claim that a bomb was discovered at Dilshad garden metro station. It is unlikely that a piece of news this serious goes unreported in the media.\n\nThere are other hints which suggest that the viral claims are untrue. If one carefully watches the video, the police are not evacuating citizens from the station. Commuters and passers-by are freely walking to and from the station.\n\nSeveral individual users have commented that it represents a mock drill. Alt News also found YouTube videos of the incident shot from a different angle that describe the incident as, \u201cDilshad Garden metro station McDonald\u2019s bomb mock drill.\u201d\n\nWe contacted Dilshad Garden police station for confirmation and this article will be updated if and when the police respond.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated case of a police mock drill video shared on social media as \u201cbomb found\u201d or \u201cterror attack\u201d. Earlier this month, a counterterrorism mock drill conducted in Mumbai\u2019s DMart hypermarket was shared as \u201cterrorists caught by police.\u201d Last month, a Telangana police mock drill video was viral as a terror attack in Tirupathi Tirumala bypass road. At a time when citizens are at unease in the aftermath of Pulwama terror attack, posting a mock drill video with the false narrative of a bomb found by the police might cause unnecessary panic.", "lang": "en"}
