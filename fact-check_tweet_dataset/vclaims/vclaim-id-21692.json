When it left government in 2010, it was 7.9%.\n\nThe number of people who were unemployed rose from 2 million to 2.5 million.\n\nUnemployment rates generally fell from the time of Labour taking power in 1997, rising after 2005. During the Labour government unemployment remained at around 5% for most of the 13-year period\u2014in the ballpark of full employment, in practice.\n\nThe total number of people unemployed followed roughly the same pattern.\n\nAnd Labour's time in government ended in a recession, which led to increased unemployment from 2008 onwards.\n\nThe main measure of unemployment in the UK is provided by the Labour Force Survey. This looks at \u201cpeople without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.\u201d It then shows this number as a share of the economically active population.", "lang": "en"}
