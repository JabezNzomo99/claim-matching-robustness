A spokesperson for the NFL confirmed the claim is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\nMultiple Facebook users shared the claim after the NFL pledged in a June 11 statement that it would donate $250 million over 10 years to \u201ccombat systemic racism and support the battle against the ongoing and historic injustices faced by African-Americans.\u201d\n\nThis particular post reads, \u201cThe NFL has agreed to give BLM 250M. I will never watch an NFL game again. I\u2019m OUT!\u201d It has been shared over 41,000 times. (RELATED: Are NFL Ratings Down 20 Percent?)\n\nBut nowhere in the NFL\u2019s statement did it say the funds would be solely given to Black Lives Matter. The league plans to work with players to \u201cidentify and work with programs that address criminal justice reform, police reform and economic and educational advancement for African Americans,\u201d according to an article on the NFL website.\n\nThe programs the NFL plans to distribute the funds to have not yet been announced, so it is possible some may go to Black Lives Matter. However, Brian McCarthy, vice president of communications for the NFL, told The Dispatch Fact Check the claim that all $250 million will go to Black Lives Matter is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\nOrganizations the NFL has previously given social justice grants include the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, the National Urban League, the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and the United Negro College Fund, according an article on the NFL website.", "lang": "en"}
