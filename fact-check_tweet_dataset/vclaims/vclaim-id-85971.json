Rep. Huelskamp, for instance, might be surprised to learn that any tax increase can be passed with just a bare majority in the Senate. That\u2019s because a tax increase would not raise the deficit, and thus no senator can protest (\u201craise a point of order\u201d) that the proposal violates budget rules.\n\nThe statement from Huelskamp, an opponent of the bipartisan budget agreement that cleared the House on Thursday, was puzzling until his spokesman referred The Fact Checker to the statement by Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. Sessions, hoping to piggyback on GOP objections to Democrats limiting the use of the filibuster on administration nominees, is referring to highly technical provisions in the bill that he claims would allow a tax increase if it was used as an offset for increased mandatory spending.\n\nEssentially, they reinforce pay-as-you-go rules, requiring that any increased spending must be \u201cdeficit-neutral,\u201d meaning the spending hike would be matched by tax increases or spending cuts, or both. As long as that requirement is met, lawmakers cannot claim it violated agreed ceilings on spending and thus raise a \u201cpoint of order\u201d (requiring 60 votes) against it. The specific point of order in question is 302 (f), and wonks can refer to a report by the Congressional Research Service, for a list of all points of order.\n\nSo what\u2019s the beef? Part of the issue is that the Bipartisan Budget Act is an actual law, as opposed to a budget resolution, which simply guides Senate procedure during the period the resolution is in force. So there\u2019s a concern that the Senate would be entering uncharted territory, though a number of budget experts suggest it\u2019s a tempest in a teapot. In any case, for the moment, the situation would be no different than if the two bodies had agreed on a budget resolution for the coming year.\n\nMoreover, discretionary bills, if they contained spending covered by a reserve fund, would be subject to other points of order. (We won\u2019t bore you with the details, except to note that the law actually appears to strengthen one, increasing the requirement to 60 votes.) There is more of question concerning mandatory spending, but again, there are probably other options, especially regarding Social Security \u2014 and not all such spending is affected by these reserve funds in the first place. The reserve funds generally are quite targeted because, as we noted, they are more about generating press releases than actually making policy.\n\nTwo experienced and respected GOP budget analysts, G. William Hoagland and Steve Bell, issued a statement through the Bipartisan Policy Center saying that \u201csuch reserve funds are common in budget legislation\u201d and \u201cthis subsection does not deny any rights to the Senate minority that they have had under reserve funds in the past.\u201d Their statement said that \u201cthis section maintains all of the historical prerogatives of the Senate minority when considering legislation resulting from the use of a reserve fund mechanism.\u201d\n\nA statement by the GOP-led House Budget Committee also dismissed the concern. \u201cSenate Republicans retain the right to unlimited debate, meaning Democrats would still need 60 votes to pass a tax increase,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnd of course, any revenue bill must originate in the House, and House Republicans have been unquestionably clear, that we would not under any circumstance pass a tax hike regardless of what the Senate does.\u201d The statement listed three other possible points of order that could be raised, though for highly technical reasons, the efficacy of some options are in dispute.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 16: We do not want to suggest that the Republican side is acting in bad faith when they assert the the budget agreement amounts to an abuse of the reserve fund mechanism. The issue is highly technical and obscure to all but a handful of Capitol Hill denizens, and people can reasonably disagree about the impact of rule changes.\n\n\u201cThe statement from the Bipartisan Policy Center is a non-sequitur. It\u2019s like being asked if the soil is red and replying that the ocean is blue. The only question at issue is whether a specific budgetary point of order that is used to block spending hikes offset by tax hikes can no longer be raised in certain crucial circumstances. The answer to this question is an unambiguous, unequivocal and undeniable yes. No one who has examined this issue has disputed this discovery \u2013 they\u2019ve only attempted to obfuscate it. \n\n So what is really going on? In the Senate, members can enforce budgetary rules by raising a point of order. This, in turn, triggers a vote on whether to sustain or waive the rule. One such point of order\u2014used on multiple occasions to block bills that busted spending limits since 2011\u2014is the 302(f) point of order. See here Under this legislation, Senator Murray would be able to prevent Senators from exercising their right to raise this 302(f) point of order if a bill offsets a spending increase called for in a reserve fund with a tax increase. Senators are therefore on the precipice of losing a core procedural tool to enforce spending limits\u2014as well as a tool to prevent tax increases with bare majority votes in a post-cloture environment.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
