This led us to an Aster Clinic in Dubai. When we searched for Dr. Usman Riyaz Aster Clinic in Dubai, we found a Dr. Riyaz Usman as the first link. It led to the photo of the same doctor that is being falsely shared.\n\nHence, this news is fake and no Delhi doctor named Usman Riyaz has died from COVID-19.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
