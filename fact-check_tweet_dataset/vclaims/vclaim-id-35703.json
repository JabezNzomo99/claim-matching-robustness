Instead of medical care, they have been locked inside their homes. These screams will echo for centuries in the global community. Coronavirus is spreading fast. India will have to prepare immediately.\n\nSeveral social media users on Twitter and Facebook also shared the clip.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search on Twitter and found that @Madhusu21543161 had tweeted the same text along with a longer version of the same video. Alt News recognised the South China Morning Post logo in the video.\n\n\n\nUsing this as a clue, we did a keyword search on the YouTube channel of South China Morning Post and found the original video. It was uploaded on January 28, 2020. According to the video description, \u201cWuhan has been in lockdown since January 23 to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. But residents have found their own way to boost morale. Videos show people in their apartments shouting out of their windows and singing patriotic songs to cheer each other up. The videos have also gone viral on Chinese social media.\u201c\n\nTherefore, the claims made by Brajesh Misra, editor-in-chief of Bharat Samachar are false. The people in the building were chanting slogans and patriotic songs to boost morale. They haven\u2019t been locked inside their apartments.", "lang": "en"}
