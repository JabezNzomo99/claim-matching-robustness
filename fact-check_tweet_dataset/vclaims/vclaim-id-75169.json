(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe could find no instance of Michelle Obama saying those words, or any variation of that quote.\n\nThe rumor can be traced back to a 2015 commencement speech Obama gave at Tuskegee University, a private, historically black university in Alabama.\n\nFollowing the speech, JewsNews.com, a right-wing website that often pushes conspiracy theories, published an article with the headline: \"White Folks And America Are The Problem \u2013 Michelle Obama Addresses All Black University With Divisive Message.\" A few months later the site repurposed the same story, but this time with the headline: \"Michelle Obama says \u2018White Folks\u2019 are what\u2019s Wrong with America\"\n\nThe articles contain misleading content, and the headline of the second is a distorted take on Obama\u2019s speech and not drawn from any statement she made. (She never said \"white folks\" at all.)\n\nMichelle Obama told graduates the road ahead wouldn\u2019t be easy \"especially for folks like you and me.\"\n\n\"The world won\u2019t always see you in those caps and gowns. They won\u2019t know how hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day \u2026 Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world. And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We\u2019ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives \u2014 the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the \u2018help\u2019 \u2014 and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country.\"\n\nA full transcript of the speech is available in the White House archives, and a video of the speech is available on YouTube.\n\nA refurbished meme claims Michelle Obama said, \"White folks are what\u2019s wrong with America.\"\n\nThe false rumor stems from a commencement speech Obama made at a historically black university in 2015. While her message was candid about race relations in the United States, at no point does she say those words.\n\nThe meme (and the stories that helped spur it) spreads misinformation and presents a twisted interpretation of her words.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
