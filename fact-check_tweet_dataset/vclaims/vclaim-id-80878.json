The first phase, which proposes to reopen malls, restaurants, hotels and religious places, has given rise to fears of catching the coronavirus from contaminated surfaces or objects.\n\nFor long, it has been argued that surface transmission is a potential risk and that the virus can stay on certain surfaces for as long as 3-7 days. Various studies have shown that the life of the virus is as much as three days on plastic and steel. On the other hand, on surfaces like cardboard and copper, it can survive for a good 24 hours and four hours respectively.\n\nResearch has also shown that the virus can remain suspended in air for nearly 30 minutes.", "lang": "en"}
