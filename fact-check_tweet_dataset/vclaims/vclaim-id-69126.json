Trump Approves Scholarship for 50,000 African Student (sic) to Study in USA 2018,\" reads the headline of one such post on the website studentapply.info.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article is rife with grammatical errors that almost bring it to the point of incomprehensibility. To start with, the headline references \"50,000 African Student,\" singular, not 50,000 African students, plural.\n\nAt one point, it declares, \"The US Embassy will work emphatically through their specialists with understudies occasionally masterminded social events and courses to help them all through the application strategy to hook declaration and honors to go to schools and colleges in the United States.\"\n\nWe searched on Nexis to see if any major news outlets reported on the news of Trump approving scholarships for African students, and could not find any evidence to support the headline\u2019s claim.\n\nA Google search revealed that this hoax has appeared before in a similar form. Another website previously touted that Trump had approved \"fully government sponsored scholarships for international students \u2026 in USA universities.\"\n\nStudentapply.info did not respond to a request for comment sent through its contact form.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
