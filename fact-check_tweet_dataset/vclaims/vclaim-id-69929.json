She earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National.\n\nWest, who\u2019s from Chicago, has spoken out before about politics, including going on a rant during one of his concerts in 2016. But as one of the highest-profile celebrity supporters of President Donald Trump, West drew more attention on Oct. 11, 2018, four days after Swift\u2019s post.\n\nWest pontificated during what USA Today called a \"meandering 10-minute monologue while making remarks with Trump and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner. He made his claim about Wisconsin during this exchange, according to the White House transcript:\n\nWest: And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That\u2019s one thing \u2014 I\u2019ve never stepped into a situation where I didn\u2019t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring \u2014 Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota.\n\n \n\n Kushner: Wisconsin.\n\n \n\n West: Fifty-three thousand \u2014\n\n \n\n Trump: Wisconsin. Yeah.Wisconsin.\n\n \n\n West: Yeah. Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs. People making $53,000 a year.\n\nSo, does Foxconn have 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin with people making $53,000 a year?\n\nWest\u2019s reference is to a massive deal that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, forged with GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker has praised the deal as a mega-job creator. Critics, including Democrat Tony Evers, who faces Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, say Wisconsin is spending too much on the deal.\n\nFoxconn plans to invest as much as $10 billion on a high-tech electronics factory in Racine County, in southeast Wisconsin, and to employ up to 13,000 people. In exchange, Wisconsin has agreed to give the company up to $2.85 billion in cash payments and $150 million in tax breaks.\n\nThe full $2.85 billion would be paid only if the company invests at least $9 billion in its plant and, in rough numbers, employs at least 13,000 people earning at least $30,000 per year.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from a spokesman for West about the claim. But here\u2019s what we know about what West said:\n\nNo jobs yet: Foxconn has broken ground on the factory. But no one is producing ultra-high-definition flat screens yet.\n\nThousands expected: Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people \u2014 and eventually 13,000 \u2014 at the plant. So, West\u2019s figure of 4,000 jobs is in that range.\n\nWages: Foxconn\u2019s contract with the state says the average annual salary will be $53,875, plus benefits. So, West\u2019s claim of $53,000 is on target.\n\nCritics of the Foxconn deal have questioned whether the average would reach that level only by Foxconn paying huge salaries to executives, and then paying wages well below the $53,875 to a large portion of employees. Under the state\u2019s contract with Foxconn, wages paid up to $400,000 annually will be counted as part of the average.\n\nWest says in Wisconsin, Foxconn has \"4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year.\"\n\nThe Taiwanese company has broken ground on a massive electronics factory that it says will initially employ 3,000 people, and eventually 13,000, at an average wage of nearly $54,000 per year.\n\nBut both figures are plans, albeit connected to a contract Foxconn has signed with the State of Wisconsin. There aren\u2019t any jobs, and therefore no average wages in that range, yet.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\n\n\n\nJoin us for PolitiFact chat\n\n Interested in the U.S. Senate race?
