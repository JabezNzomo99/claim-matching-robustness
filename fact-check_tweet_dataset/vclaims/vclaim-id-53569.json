Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cJesus was a lot like Trump, both con artists.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever made this remark. The claim stems from a satirical article.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman to be elected to Congress, is a popular target for online misinformation. In this case, the Facebook post credits her with a comparison between President Donald Trump and Jesus, quoting her as saying, \u201cJesus was a lot like Trump, both con artists.\u201d (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Say, \u2018There Are Homeless People Out There Who Can\u2019t Pay Their Mortgage\u2019?)\n\nThere is, however, no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever making the remark. Searching her social media posts and press releases yielded no results, and resources like the congressional record didn\u2019t have any matches either. Had the congresswoman made such a comment, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk the attribution.\n\nThe quote appears to come from the headline of an article published on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d But the Facebook post fails to disclaim that the quote is fictitious.\n\nCheck Your Fact has previously debunked quotes attributed to Ocasio-Cortez. In late March, a viral Facebook post falsely credited the congresswoman with saying, \u201cThere are homeless people out there who can\u2019t pay their mortgage,\u201d for instance.", "lang": "en"}
