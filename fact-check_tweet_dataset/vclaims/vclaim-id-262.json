Hannelore Smitz, the journalist who wrote the article, told Reuters that he obtained the photograph from a resident who was worried about why the trees had been felled.\n\nThe article explains that trees along the Baron Descampslaan road in the Belgium city of Leuven were cut down so they could be replaced. According to the report, Belgian politician Carl Devlies said the trees were being replaced because \u201csome were sick, others were crooked, and some were showing signs of aging.\u201d\n\nGoogle street view confirms the photograph was indeed taken along the Baron Descampslaan. The distinctive white house and tree lined pavement in the photo can be traced to a specific part of the road.\n\nSmitz said that the local government had now replaced the trees with healthy ones.\n\nFalse. The trees were cut down because they were old, not because of 5G technology.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
