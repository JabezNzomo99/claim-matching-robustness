While many appreciate the PM for the hands-on job, others call it a staged PR exercise executed with the help of a planned photoshoot.\n\nCongress MP from Tamil Nadu\u2019s Shivaganga constituency Karti Chidambaram tweeted three images on Saturday night. Two of them show PM Modi cleaning the beach and the third image is of an equipped camera crew in action. He wrote Jai Shree Ram as the caption of the tweet.\n\nKarti is the son of former finance minister P Chidambaram who is lodged in Tihar jail in connection with the INX Media case lodged by CBI.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post was liked by more than 2,300 users and retweeted almost 800 times. The archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found Karti\u2019s post to be misleading. The viral image showing the camera crew is not related to PM Modi\u2019s Mamallapuram beach cleaning event. This image is around 14 years old and was taken at West Sands beach, beside St. Andrews Cathedral in Fife, Scotland, by a TV production crew.\n\nThe initial reason for suspicion was that the crew comprised mostly of what looked like foreigners.\n\nA few users, including Twitter handle @pillai_007, pointed out on Karti\u2019s post that the same viral picture was taken from the webpage of Tayscreen.\n\nTayscreen is an organisation based in Dundee City, Scotland, UK, which works with various government councils of Scotland in media production-related activities.\n\nA much bigger picture of the viral image with a wider horizon and background can be found on the Tayscreen website. In this image, we can see old European structures with two spires and a tower in the background.\n\nA combination of reverse image and keyword search indicates that the location of the viral image is West Sands beach, Fife, Scotland.\n\nWith the help of satellite images and Google street view, we could locate and identify the two monumental spires and towers in the background as ruins of St. Andrews Cathedral and St. Rules Tower in Fife, Scotland.\n\nThese historic structures can be seen from the West Sands beach, where the camera crew can be seen shooting with equipment.\n\nWe found a similar image used in another website for research activities called Institute for Capitalising on Creativity\u2019 They had given credit to Julie Craik, Tayscreen Scotland, for the photo.\n\nAFWA contacted Julie Craik for more details on the viral image. Craik confirmed that this photograph was taken by her around 2005. She wrote back through Linkedin, this image was a TV production crew in St Andrews Scotland UK taken by me for TayScreen which I run. It was around 2005.\n\nTherefore, we can say that one of the viral images which Karti Chidambaram posted on Twitter along with PM Narendra Modi\u2019s pictures from Mamallapuram was unrelated, and hence the post is misleading.\n\nHowever, we could not verify whether any crew was present at the spot while PM Modi was cleaning the beach. But the viral image used by Karti to show the camera crew was taken around 2005 in Scotland.\n\nEven Karti later clarified in a separate tweet that he was wrong in his choice of one photo.", "lang": "en"}
