Rick Scott, who can veto the entire education bill or sign it in the coming weeks.\n\nIn March, both chambers produced bills -- HB 7069 in the House and SB 1552 in the Senate -- to expand eligibility criteria for bonuses to top public school teachers under the Florida Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship Program.\n\nLawmakers wanted to add in bonuses for principals, and the House budget proposal called for $214 million to the expanded program in the 2017-18 budget, up from the $49 million this year.\n\nTwo House committees voted in favor of the bill at public meetings on March 10 and March 29.\n\nAlthough senators also expressed interest in expanding the program, the Senate\u2019s initial budget proposal included no such funding. The decision was part of a strategic move in hopes that the Senate would get some of its priorities in later negotiations with the House.\n\nOn April 13, the House version passed the House (79-38). The Senate voted unanimously -- but not to pass the bill, rather to send it to budget conference. HB 7069 was among four K-12 policy bills sent into conference negotiations.\n\nConference negotiations between members of both the House and Senate are common to work out differences in spending allocations, but it is unusual to resolve policy disagreements. Watchdogs raised concerns that policy and funding decisions would be hashed out in secret. Legislative leaders repeatedly vowed a transparent process.\n\nBut by Saturday, April 29 -- three days before lawmakers needed to agree on a final total state budget in order to end session on time -- House and Senate leaders still hadn\u2019t released proposed language to be discussed, including about the teacher bonuses.\n\nHouse and Senate negotiators -- Hialeah Republican Rep. Manny Diaz Jr. and Altamonte Springs Republican Sen. David Simmons -- told the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald that they would not release draft language until the House and Senate were ready to exchange formal offers.\n\nWhile Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law bans city or county commissioners from meeting in secret to hash out legislation, two legislators are allowed to meet in private under limited circumstances before voting in public on legislation.\n\nWhile a budget conference subcommittee held a brief public meeting that Saturday morning to trade spending offers, they revealed little about what their intentions were for the policy bills.\n\nUltimately, legislators couldn\u2019t agree on the overall state budget on time, which led to an extension of the session from Friday, May 5 to Monday, May 8.\n\nDuring the final week of the regularly scheduled session, Corcoran and Negron -- with help from other key lawmakers, such as Simmons, Diaz and House Education chairman Michael Bileca, R-Miami -- negotiated in private a catch-all education bill that included a final version of the teacher bonuses language, the policies of the other K-12 budget bills and myriad other proposals unrelated to spending.\n\nThat final version of HB 7069 was made public for the first time on Friday evening May 5.\n\nSeveral newspapers -- including the Herald and Times, the Tallahassee Democrat, the Gainesville Sun, the Orlando Sentinel -- wrote that final legislation was hammered out behind closed doors.\n\n\"State lawmakers flushed promises of transparency down the toilet,\" wrote the Gainesville Sun editorial board.\n\nThere were a few differences in the teacher bonus program as outlined in the final version in May, compared to the original House version in March. The most significant change -- and one not previously contemplated or discussed in public -- was that the final version added the ability for teachers to get bonuses over the next three years of $1,200 if they were \"highly effective\" or up to $800 if rated \"effective.\"\n\nCorcoran and Negron publicly discussed HB 7069 for 10 minutes May 5 without any substantive debate of the contents before formally accepting it.\n\nThe Times/Herald submitted several questions to Corcoran\u2019s office May 6 after the final language of HB 7069 was made public. An explanation provided in the speaker\u2019s response:\n\n\"Negotiating solutions when there are significant differences between the two chambers on an issue in conference sometimes requires adding new language and bringing in issues that were not part of the budget conference. That is often what it takes to reach agreement and is inherent to the conference process.\"\n\nOn May 8, both chambers met for the final day of the session.\n\nSen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, the Senate\u2019s appropriations chairman, took responsibility for allowing HB 7069 to balloon so much. But he urged passage anyway.\n\nThe House (73-36) and Senate (20-18) both voted in favor of the final compromise version of HB 7069 that was decided in budget conference.\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo defended the process that led to the final version. He said that Corcoran\u2019s tweet didn\u2019t mention anything about discussions during conference.\n\n\"I get folks don\u2019t like it, but because it wasn\u2019t talked about during a public budget conference debate doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t publicly discussed for months beforehand,\" he said.\n\nThe same argument could be made about any other type of legislation -- from the environment to health care -- if it was discussed during a conference, he said.\n\nCorcoran tweeted that it is a myth that education legislation was \"negotiated in secret.\"\n\nCorcoran pointed to the filing of HB 7069 in the House on March 10 and its passage in two committees and then the House on April 13.\n\nWhile part of the legislative process was done in public, Corcoran omits that the final dealmaking between the House and Senate was largely done behind closed doors.", "lang": "en"}
