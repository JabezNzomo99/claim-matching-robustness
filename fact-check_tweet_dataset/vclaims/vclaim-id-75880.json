Recently, he\u2019s begun targeting Tom Wolf, the Democrat who has become the frontrunner in a four-way Democratic primary. Since March, in general-election polls by between seven and 19 percentage points.\n\nIn a released April 30, 2014, Corbett\u2019s campaign took aim at Wolf\u2019s record when he was serving as Pennsylvania\u2019s revenue secretary, an appointed position that handles tax collection.\n\nWolf was appointed to the position by then-Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, and confirmed by the state Senate, which was in Republican hands. He served as revenue secretary from April 2007 until November 2008.\n\nWolf \"conveniently left out of his ads that he was the state\u2019s revenue secretary in Harrisburg. You know, the top tax collector. And Wolf was a job-killing bureaucrat. On Wolf\u2019s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs, and our unemployment went up almost 50 percent. But the real insult? Wolf is a millionaire, but he fought to increase taxes on average Pennsylvanians, including higher taxes on home heating and the sales tax. Tom Wolf: high taxes, fewer jobs.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of claims for a brief ad, but for this fact-check we\u2019re going to focus on the claim that \"on Wolf\u2019s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs.\" For claims like this one, we take into account two factors -- whether the statistics cited are accurate, and whether it\u2019s reasonable to assign credit or blame to the target of the ad. So we\u2019ll take this claim point by point. With this ad, the statistics quoted are reasonable, but the blame is off-base -- especially the cause of Pennsylvania's job loss.\n\nTo the extent that taxes were high, was Wolf responsible?\n\nWe won\u2019t address whether taxes were too high in Pennsylvania, since that\u2019s an opinion on which reasonable people can disagree. But we can judge whether Wolf bears responsibility for the state of Pennsylvania\u2019s taxes while he was serving as revenue secretary.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s Corbett\u2019s argument. A Corbett spokesman, Billy Pitman, noted that the Tax Foundation found Pennsylvania to have the 10th highest tax burden among states in 2007 and 2008. (The Tax Foundation is a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.)\n\nPitman said the ad was referring to some specific taxes Wolf advocated for.\n\n\"In his position as the commonwealth\u2019s top tax collector, Secretary Wolf lobbied the legislature on behalf of the Rendell administration he served,\" Pitman said. Among the proposals Pitman specifically cited were an increase to the sales tax, an oil-company tax and hikes to electricity and garbage-collection taxes.\n\nThe Corbett campaign has a point that Wolf, as a member of Rendell\u2019s cabinet, advocated for some tax hikes (though also for some reductions); we found news reports to back that up.\n\nHowever, the ad exaggerates Wolf\u2019s influence on the shape of tax policy in the state.\n\nFirst, Pennsylvania\u2019s tax landscape was set well before Wolf got on the job. In , corporate taxes accounted for about one-fifth of tax revenues, sales taxes accounted for about one-quarter, and personal income taxes accounted for about 55 percent.\n\nThis means that adding a percentage point to the state sales tax, as Wolf advocated, would have represented a modest increase to a levy that represented just one-quarter of the state\u2019s overall tax revenue. The other taxes he advocated for would have had an even more modest impact on the state\u2019s overall tax architecture.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because the ad said that \"on Wolf\u2019s watch, taxes were high.\" This suggests that Wolf is to blame for the state\u2019s overall tax structure, rather than just for proposing marginal expansions. In reality, most of the state\u2019s tax structure was already well-established before Wolf was even sworn in, so it\u2019s a stretch to lay the blame for \"high taxes\" at his feet.\n\nSecond, the ad overhypes how much impact Wolf had on tax policy as revenue secretary. While Wolf certainly engaged in at least some advocacy, as the newspaper articles noted, his job duties were exclusively administrative, not policy-setting.\n\nThe , according to the department\u2019s website, is to \"administer the tax laws of the commonwealth in a fair and equitable manner.\" Raising taxes or creating new ones is up to the governor and the Legislature (which during his tenure had one chamber controlled by the Republicans).\n\n\"The revenue secretary collects the taxes and issues reports on the state's financial health, and the subjects and rates of taxation are set by state law,\" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. \"Policies dealing with economic and community development, jobs programs, taxes and other recession-fighting measures are handled by the governor and the Legislature.\"\n\nChristopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., agreed that the ad assigned too much responsibility for setting tax policy to Wolf.\n\n\"The claims in this ad are really loose, and as is the case in almost all negative ads, very lacking in context,\" he said.\n\nWe did find a basis for the ad\u2019s claim that 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs were lost during Wolf\u2019s tenure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Pennsylvanians rose by 150,000 between April 2007 and November 2008.\n\nHowever, the problem with this part of the claim is that it\u2019s a stretch to blame taxes in general -- much less Wolf specifically -- for the loss of these jobs (especially their \"killing,\" in the ad\u2019s overheated rhetoric).\n\nWe asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, how much straight-line causation we can draw between tax policy and those job losses.\n\n\"Basically none,\" Sinclair said, saying the much bigger factor during that period was the national economic downturn, which officially became a recession almost halfway through Wolf\u2019s tenure.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that tax policy can affect job growth, Sinclair added that \"economists disagree wildly on the \u2018job-killing\u2019 effects of taxes. So, confidently drawing any line of causation is impossible. And throw in that the entire country lost about 2.3 million jobs over that period. I don't think it was the high taxes of Pennsylvania that caused the job losses.\"\n\nCorbett\u2019s ad claimed that \"on Wolf\u2019s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs.\"\n\nThe ad has a point that Wolf, as a Rendell appointee, did at times give rhetorical support to some of the governor\u2019s proposed tax hikes (as well as some proposed tax reductions). But the ad exaggerates the influence that Wolf, as the operational head of the state\u2019s tax-collection department, had on crafting tax policy. Most of the state\u2019s tax structure was set long before he took office, and most of his job was to carry out tax laws, not craft them.\n\nMeanwhile, the ad suggests that taxes are to blame for the job losses on his watch, when in fact Wolf\u2019s time in office coincided with the start of the national economic downturn -- a much more plausible reason for rising unemployment. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
