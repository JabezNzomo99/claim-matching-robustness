Shortly after the announcement, the president held a press conference, calling it a \u201cvery big day for our country\u201d as it seeks to recover from the novel coronavirus that shut down large segments of the U.S. economy.\n\nBelow we briefly recount some of his misstatements about the economy and other topics in his remarks.\n\nNot the \u201cgreatest economy\u201d: The president said that prior to the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cWe were very strong.\u201d And it\u2019s true that stocks were high (the Dow Jones Industrial Average had a record close at 29,551.42 on Feb. 12), and unemployment was at a 50-year low of 3.5%, as we have written.\n\nBut then the president exaggerated the strength of the U.S. economy by falsely claiming, \u201cWe had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nAs we also have reported, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. The real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product, or GDP, grew 2.3% last year \u2014 down from 2.9% in 2018, according to data released on Feb. 27. Over the last 39 years \u2014 dating to Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency \u2014 the nation\u2019s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump\u2019s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, including under then-President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nManufacturing jobs: Trump also slightly exaggerated the number of manufacturing jobs when he said that \u201cwe had up to 600,000 jobs prior to the plague.\u201d At the peak under Trump, the economy added 499,000 manufacturing jobs, as of November 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the number of jobs had plateaued and began to slip even prior to the pandemic.\n\nAs of February, a month before the stay-at-home orders, the U.S. economy had added 483,000 manufacturing jobs \u2014 not 600,000 \u2014 under Trump.\n\n\u201cMost people working\u201d: Trump also repeated a meaningless boast that prior to the pandemic, \u201c[w]e had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million. We were never even close to that.\u201d But, as we\u2019ve written, that\u2019s to be expected as the population rises.\n\nThere are notable exceptions, such as recessions and now a pandemic, but the number of employed Americans steadily rises with the population. (See the chart below from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\nA month after the Great Recession started in December 2007, the number of Americans working peaked at 138.4 million in January 2008, before rapidly declining. It took until May 2014 to recover those lost jobs, but then the U.S. again started setting employment records through Obama\u2019s second term and into Trump\u2019s first \u2014 until the pandemic.\n\nAlso, Trump exaggerated when he said the U.S. prior to the pandemic had \u201calmost 160 million\u201d jobs. The peak occurred in February at 152.5 million jobs, according to BLS. It is currently at 132.9 million.\n\nEmployment \u201cequality\u201d: Trump falsely claimed that the May jobs report showed strength across the board. \u201cWhat we\u2019re announcing today is a tremendous tribute to equality,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the unemployment rates declined from April to May for whites (14.2% to 12.4%) and Hispanics (18.9% to 17.6%), the jobless rates ticked up slightly for blacks (16.7% to 16.8%) and Asians (14.5% to 15%).\n\nCoronavirus testing: Trump said the U.S. had conducted \u201cover 20 million or very close\u201d tests for coronavirus infections, adding the misleading boast: \u201cmore than anybody in the world.\u201d The U.S. has conducted more tests overall \u2014 just under 20 million \u2014 but the U.S. also is one of the largest countries in the world. It hasn\u2019t conducted more tests on a per-capita basis.\n\nThe president has made this claim numerous times. As of June 4, the U.S. had conducted 19.81 million tests, more than any other country, according to a chart from Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford. But on a per-capita basis \u2014 per 1,000 population \u2014 several countries still have conducted more testing, including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Australia and New Zealand. Another source, Worldometer, a data aggregation website, had the U.S. at number 33 on June 5 in terms of tests per 1 million people among other countries and territories.\n\nExperts also have recommended looking at the number of tests per confirmed case of COVID-19. By that measure, the U.S. also lags behind several other countries.\n\nStockpile had ventilators: Trump again falsely claimed that his administration inherited a Strategic National Stockpile without ventilators.\n\n\u201cWe did not have ventilators when we started,\u201d Trump said about the breathing machines that several states requested from the federal stash in order to treat some patients with COVID-19. \u201cThe previous administration left us empty cupboards.\u201d\n\nIn a 2017 article, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were about 9,000 ventilators in the stockpile as of at least 2010. And earlier this year, Richard Branson, a respiratory care specialist and professor emertius at the University of Cincinnati, said that, in the 20 years prior to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the government had never distributed ventilators from the U.S. stockpile. Not even during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were ventilators deployed from the stockpile, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPlus, in 2016, the year before Trump was inaugurated, reporters said they saw ventilators during a tour of at least one of the U.S. facilities where the machines and the rest of the stockpile\u2019s massive inventory are stored in the event of a health crisis.\n\nTrump made a number of familiar misstatements about his administration\u2019s travel restrictions on China.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. Under the restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.\n\nImpact of the restrictions: There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. saved \u201ctens of thousands of lives with that decision.\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently asserted without evidence that the travel restrictions saved lives, with the total escalating over time from \u201ca lot\u201d to \u201chundreds of thousands.\u201d But as we have reported, we have found no support for such claims, and the White House hasn\u2019t provided any.\n\nThe few studies that have been carried out estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of disease but do little to contain them.\n\nSaad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn\u2019t seen any evidence to support the president\u2019s claims. Travel restrictions \u201ccan have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,\u201d Omer said. But \u201ceven then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions weren\u2019t \u201cearly\u201d: Trump has often said that he acted \u201cearly\u201d in imposing the restrictions, saying in his June 5 remarks that he acted swiftly to \u201cstop people very early on from China.\u201d But, as we have written, 36 countries, including the U.S., had imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2.\n\n\u201cWhat this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,\u201d Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t act on his own: Trump also repeated the claim that \u201cnobody\u201d else wanted him to issue the restrictions. But according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, that isn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cThe travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,\u201d Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. \u201cThese were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d\n\nBorder wall: Trump touted the progress on construction of southern border fencing, which he said is now \u201cup to 210 miles long.\u201d But as he often does, Trump misleadingly failed to note that the vast majority of that is either secondary fencing or replacement for existing dilapidated fencing. To date, just three miles of fencing has been built where no barriers previously existed.\n\n\u201cThe wall, which you never hear about, is up to 210 miles long,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd we\u2019ll have it up to almost 500 miles very early next year. By the end of this year, we\u2019ll be over 400 miles.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data, as of May 22, there has been about \u201c194 miles of new primary and secondary border wall system\u201d constructed since Trump took office. It is plausible that between May 22 and June 5, that number has risen to 210 miles, as the president said. But the vast majority of that new construction has been to replace existing fencing.\n\nAccording to CBP, 167 of the 194 miles of \u201cnew border wall\u201d built as of May 22 was \u201cin place of dilapidated and/or outdated designs.\u201d Another 24 miles was secondary wall, some of it replacing dilapidated designs and some of it where there had not previously been secondary barrier.\n\nThe 194 miles of new fencing built under Trump includes only about \u201c3 miles of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,\u201d CBP notes.\n\nBut more is coming. According to CBP, funding is in place from fiscal year 2019 and 2020 budgets for construction of hundreds of miles of fencing.\n\nFalse Veterans Choice boast: The president repeated a favorite, and wrong, talking point about the Veterans Choice Program, which was created by bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama on Aug. 7, 2014. In Trump\u2019s telling, the program was created under his administration \u2014 \u201cwe got choice approved for the vets,\u201d he claimed \u2014 and it\u2019s something people had been \u201ctrying to get\u201d for \u201calmost 50 years.\u201d\n\nAgain, the legislation was passed in 2014. It allowed veterans to receive care from non-VA health care providers if they were unable to get a timely appointment or faced long travel distances to VA medical facilities. Trump has continued the program. And he has been spreading falsehoods about its origin since 2018, when he wove a tale about how the program was \u201cthe greatest idea I think I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nMisleading VA accountability claim: In Trump\u2019s speeches, he often pairs the falsehood about \u201cchoice\u201d with a misleading description of the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, legislation that was indeed enacted during his time in office, in June 2017. The law made it easier for the VA secretary to remove VA staffers; it shortened the firing process and the appeals process. But Trump misleadingly suggested the VA couldn\u2019t fire \u201cbad people\u201d before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called VA Accountability, where we can now fire people that don\u2019t treat our vets good. We have sadists, we have thieves, we have a lot of bad people,\u201d he said. As we found when Trump was more explicitly claiming \u201cyou couldn\u2019t fire anybody in the VA\u201d before the accountability law, the VA could and did fire people prior to this law. Before Trump took office, the VA had fired more than 2,000 employees each year dating back to 2006, according to data the agency reported to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nChina trade: The president continues to exaggerate the trade deficit with China. In discussing trade, Trump said, \u201cWe helped rebuild China. We gave them $500 billion a year \u2014 how stupid.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U.S. imported a record $559 billion in Chinese goods and services in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But the U.S. also exported $178 billion in goods and services to China \u2014 for a net trade deficit of about $381 billion, which again is a record but not close to a trade deficit of $500 billion.\n\nPrior to Trump, the highest trade deficit with China in goods and services was nearly $334 billion in 2015, and the 10-year average, from 2007 through 2016, was close to $283 billion, according to the BEA.", "lang": "en"}
