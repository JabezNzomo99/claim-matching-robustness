Rubio made this comment while defending a proposal to \u201cstreamline most of our existing federal anti-poverty funding into one single agency,\u201d which would distribute funds as cash grants to states for their own \u201ccreative initiatives that address the factors behind inequality of opportunity.\u201d\n\nRubio was asked what would happen if states simply opted out of providing programs for the poor, as nearly half the states have done with the Medicaid expansion envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Rubio countered that his plan would be funded. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be something where states are told you get the money for a few years, then we\u2019ll back away,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid is a health-care program for low-income people. When the Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the overall constitutionality of the ACA, it also dealt a blow to one key part \u2014 a planned expansion of the Medicaid program to individuals with incomes of up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $15,850). The Court, in a 7-2 ruling, said the government could not force states to accept the expansion and instead each state would have a choice.\n\nSo far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while four more are considering it. (That list does not include Virginia, where the new governor, Terry McAuliffe, has said he wants to push for it.)\n\nCurrently, the cost of Medicaid is split at least 50-50 between the states and the federal government. There is a complicated formula that can alter the so-called federal matching percentage, but every state essentially gets back at least $1 for every $2 it spends on the program.\n\nUnder the health-care law, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of expansion in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Then the federal match is pared back to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019 and then 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. It would stay at the 90 percent level unless the lawmakers change or repeal the legislation.\n\nSo, rather than getting $1 back for every $2 spent, states would get $9 back for every $10 spent. (This is a simplified version of a complex formula. The Kaiser Family Foundation in 2013 issued a report with all of the details.)\n\nSo, only in a very narrow sense does the money \u201cgo away.\u201d The match declines a bit, and certainly Congress could change its mind, but at the moment this looks like a better deal than the current system.\n\nHere\u2019s how one Republican governor, John Kasich of Ohio, described in an interview why he decided to accept the expansion: \u201c13 billion of our own dollars back here to treat and solve Ohio\u2019s problem. It\u2019s our money, let\u2019s bring it home.\u201d\n\nFormer Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, who opposes the expansion, acknowledged in an opinion article on Jan. 8: \u201cUnder the current cost-sharing arrangement for Medicaid, the federal government pays approximately 50 percent of Virginia\u2019s Medicaid costs, and the state pays the other 50 percent\u2026. Under the expansion, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost of the expansion through 2016, with its share reducing to 90 percent thereafter.\u201d (Cuccinelli opposes expansion in part because he believes it will increase fraud, but that\u2019s a separate issue.)\n\nSo what is Rubio talking about? Did he misspeak and mean to focus on just on the short-term reduction from a rather high federal match? That\u2019s unclear. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything to add to what the senator said,\u201d said spokesman Alex Conant.\n\nMichael Tanner of the Cato Institute, an Obamacare critic, has argued that the federal match is \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d He believes that publicity about the law will bring people out of the \u201cwoodwork\u201d who had been previously eligible but had never signed up for the law. Those people would not be covered under the 90-10 match but the older 50-50 formula, thus increasing costs for states.\n\nRubio has little basis to make such a sweeping statement. Some money does \u201cgo away\u201d under the law, but at least 90 percent of the cost of the expansion will be covered by the federal government. That ratio is still better than the current formula, which is why some of Rubio\u2019s fellow Republicans describe it as found money.", "lang": "en"}
