One such video shows passengers onboard panicking in fear.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u2018#WATCH | Just before PIA Plane crash in #Karachi #Pakistan. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\u2018\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to it is FAKE.\n\nWhen we extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found the video in question on CNN\u2019s YouTube dated May 4, 2016. The title of the video read, \u2018Heavy turbulence scares passengers on Ethiad flight\u2019.
