But it\u2019s not true. Trump didn\u2019t even call Mattarella by his last name during the 46-minute Oval Office visit, referring to him mostly as \u201cthe president of Italy.\u201d\n\nOne Facebook post on the account of \u201cDonald Trump Is Not My President\u201d shows two photos of a wide-eyed Italian translator listening intently during the Oval Office meeting. \u201cThe look of the White House Italian translator as Trump says President Mozzarella for the Italian President and says U.S. and Italy have been allies since Ancient Rome,\u201d reads the post, which has received 3,700 likes and 2,500 shares.\n\nThis false account of Trump\u2019s fumbling of the Italian president\u2019s name has gone viral across multiple social media platforms. We\u2019ve seen the claim on Twitter, Instagram and elsewhere on Facebook.\n\nThe picture of the translator is from a joint appearance of the two presidents in the Oval Office prior to a bilateral meeting between the two countries. A White House transcript of the meeting shows that Trump did not refer to the Italian president by his last name. Instead, Trump refers to Mattarella four times as \u201cthe president of Italy\u201d and once as \u201cMr. President\u201d during his remarks.\n\nA video of the Oval Office event can also be seen on C-SPAN.\n\nTrump and Mattarella made multiple public appearances throughout the day, all of which were videotaped. Trump did refer to the Italian president by his last name twice during a joint press conference that was held after the Oval Office meeting. Neither time did Trump pronounce Mattarella\u2019s name as \u201cMozzarella.\u201d\n\nTrump also referred to the Italian president by his full name twice in an evening reception in honor of the Italian Republic and Italian-American Heritage and Culture Month. But Trump properly pronounced the Italian president\u2019s last name both times.\n\nSome posts also distort Trump\u2019s statements regarding ancient Rome and the alliance between the U.S. and Italy.\n\nIn his opening remarks during the joint press conference, Trump said: \u201cThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years, to ancient Rome.\u201d Trump said that Italy and the U.S. share a cultural and political heritage \u2014 not a formal alliance \u2014 that dates to ancient Rome.\n\nTrump noted the long-standing alliance between the two countries in his statements throughout the day. For example, Trump said in the Oval Office meeting that the U.S. has \u201chad a great relationship with Italy for a long time.\u201d Trump does not mention ancient Rome in that meeting at all.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
