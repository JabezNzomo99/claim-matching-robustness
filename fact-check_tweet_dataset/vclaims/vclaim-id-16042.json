No, that's not true: a liberal satire website that loves to troll conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing their made up stories as real news made up a tale about a pig named Dorothy being involved in the sketch and a huge fine resulting from that but none of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on September 30, 2018 by America's Last Line of Defense titled \"BREAKING: Saturday Night Live Fined $16.2 Million For 'Vulgar' Kavanaugh Sketch\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nYou've probably heard about Saturday Night Live's disastrous sketch involving Brett Kavanaugh. But just case you haven't, here what you need to know. The sketch featured Matt Damon as Kavanaugh openly weeping in a courtroom. Eventually one of his accusers, a pig named Dorothy, took the stand. This may sound ridiculous, but it's what passes for humor in the liberal world. At the end of the sketch, Damon as Kavanaugh leaps on top of the pig and fondles its genitals in full view of the camera. This violates FCC rule 36.9 B in the \"Animal Sexuality\" guidelines.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so people who hadn't actually seen the sketch might have thought it was real:\n\nAs it happens there is no FCC rule 36.9 B about animal sexuality, and the actual cold open sketch with Matt Damon did not involve a pig named Dorothy as you can see for yourself here:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about worstpot.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Michelle Obama Did NOT Say Abortion Is Ok Because You Can Just Make Another Baby\n\u2022 Fake News: Kaepernick NOT Arrested for Publicity Stunt During Anthem in San Fran\n\u2022 Fake News: Nike Did NOT Cancel Kaepernick Contract After Backlash\n\u2022 Fake News: Colin Kaepernick Did NOT Immediately Lose Nike Endorsement After Anti-White Rant\n\u2022 Fake News: Henry Winkler Did NOT Die, Did NOT Donate Half Of His Estate To MAGA 2020", "lang": "en"}
