And one of the most tragic is the history of the Gulag on the territory of our country. We need to remember this, to know, to prevent the repetition of something similar,\u201d Nosov explained.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the \u201ctragic\u201d history, particularly in the governor\u2019s own region:\n\nMagadan contained some of the Soviet labor camps of the Kolyma region, which held around 740,000 prisoners between 1932 and 1953, the year that Stalin died. Of those, at least 120,000 prisoners died due to the harsh conditions of the camps. The Moscow Times article also points out that around 700,000 Soviet citizens were executed during the Great Terror of 1937-38.\n\nInterestingly, Meduza linked to an official site of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia that details the history of the labor camps in Nosov\u2019s region, Magadan. The site includes not only data on the number of prisoners, but also information on the arrival in the late 1930\u2019s of more political prisoners, \u201ccounter-revolutionary elements,\u201d along with accounts of beatings, torture and extrajudicial killings.The site indicates it was last updated in 2016.\n\n\u201cOne of the most notorious features of the Soviet regime was its attempt to curtail political opposition by creating a new species of crime: \u2018anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,\u2019\u201d wrote Professor Sarah Davies of Durham University in 1997, the pre-Putin period when Russians were coming to terms with the bloody Soviet era. The anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda statute, Davies wrote, \u201cwas an important weapon\u2026particularly at the height of the Great Terror\u201d in 1937 and 1938.\n\nMany of those killed by the Soviet regime had not engaged in any kind of dissent. Many victims of the Holodomor, the Great Famine in Ukraine in 1932-33, died for allegedly deliberately failing to fulfill state quotas for grain production. In other cases, entire ethnic groups were deported to Siberia or Central Asia en masse, often dying in transit due to harsh conditions, as collective punishment for the alleged actions of a few. One famous example is the Crimean Tatars, who like Chechens and some other ethnic groups, were deported from their homelands to Central Asia, where they would remain for decades.\n\nDuring the Tsarist era, according to the BBC, \u201cthe army\u2026was used to crush opposition in the cities.\u201dImperial Russia\u2019s third prime minister, Pyotr Stolypin, became associated with \u201cStolypin cars\u201d -- special railroad carriages designed to deport peasants, along with their livestock and property, to Siberia. Stolypin is also associated with \u201cStolypin Neckties,\u201d slang for the hangman\u2019s noose. The term was coined during the period of repression that followed Russia\u2019s failed 1905 Revolution.\n\nThe record of the post-Soviet era is less clear.Russia no longer has capital punishment, so while dissent is still punished, no one is officially executed. However, a number of dissidents have been murdered, and those cases have never been fully solved. Perhaps the most famous is the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was gunned down within sight of the Kremlin\u2019s walls in February 2015. Two years later, five Chechen men were convicted for the assassination, but Nemtsov\u2019s family and their lawyer said they did not believe that \u201cthose who ordered or arranged for the murder\u201d had been found.They stopped short of accusing the Kremlin.\n\nIn addition to Nemtsov, a number of Russian journalists who investigated sensitive topics have died under mysterious circumstances, some of them falling out of windows.", "lang": "en"}
