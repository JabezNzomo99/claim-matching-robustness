The video was pitched in response to a claim from Jeremy Corbyn that \u201cfor decades, we\u2019ve been told that inequality doesn\u2019t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background\u201d.\n\nThe thrust of the video is to counter the implication that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour governments did nothing to combat inequality during their time in office. Mr Blair goes on to list statistics about a range of topics from tax and spending, to education, NHS staffing and poverty.\n\nThe figures listed are pretty much all broadly correct, and we\u2019ll look at each of them in turn below.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth pointing out first that the video doesn\u2019t actually provide any facts directly relating to overall income inequality under Labour. And this is one area where the available figures don\u2019t quite compliment that government as much.\n\nIt might sound unlikely, but a government can increase the incomes of the poorest, reduce the number of people living in poverty, and still oversee rising income inequality\u2014if the incomes of high earners rise faster than those of low earners.\n\n\u201cIncome inequality changed little\u201d, is the verdict of researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in 2013 (the IFS is also quoted elsewhere in the video). They go on:\n\n\u201cinequality did fall across much of the distribution. Those on relatively low incomes did a little better than those with incomes just above the average. However, those right at the top saw their incomes increase very substantially with the result that, on most measures, overall inequality nudged up slightly.\u201d\n\nThat said, the IFS does suggest that Labour\u2019s increased spending on tax credits and benefits\u2014which benefited poorer households, as we\u2019ll cover in more detail later\u2014might have prevented larger rises in income inequality than actually took place.\n\nThere are too many specific figures on income inequality to go into all of them here, but several key measures reflect the IFS\u2019s conclusions. Inequality rose slightly under Labour according to the \u201cGini Coefficient\u201d, which measures the overall distribution of incomes across the country. Other figures which compare the incomes of various groups at the poorer and richer end of the income scale tend to show broadly flat trends between 1997 and 2010 (usually following rises in inequality during the 1980s).\n\nThe full assessment from the IFS is available here.\n\nWe asked the Tony Blair Institute what it meant exactly by this claim and it explained that it was actually referring to record increases in health and education spending\u2014not that this was at all clear in the video.\n\nHowever, whether you\u2019re talking about education, health or total spending, the claim is correct.\n\nIn this section we\u2019re using figures provided to us by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nFrom 1996/97 (the year just before Labour were elected) to 2009/10 the amount spent on education increased in real terms by 83% from \u00a356 billion to \u00a3103 billion while spending on health more than doubled in real terms from \u00a364 billion to \u00a3136 billion.\n\nTotal spending increased by \u00a3326 billion in real terms over this period.\n\nNo other 13 year period since the Second World War saw such large increases in spending in any of these areas.\n\nA more useful measure for public spending is to look at what percentage of the overall economy is spent in different areas, rather than the absolute amount of money spent.\n\nIn 13 years of Labour government, education spending as a share of GDP increased by 1.6 percentage points from 4.1% to 5.7%. This is an equal record increase along with the 13 year period to 1965/66 where education spending as a share of GDP also rose by 1.6 percentage points.\n\nHealth spending as a share of GDP increased by 2.9 percentage points from 4.7% to 7.6%. This was a record increase since the Second World War.\n\nFinally, total spending as a share of the economy increased by 9.6 percentage points, also a peacetime record compared to any other 13 year period.\n\nData on \u201cpeacetime\u201d spending doesn\u2019t quite go back to the end of the Second World War. The figures from the IFS we\u2019ve used are available from 1955/56.\n\nMr Blair is correct about the reduction in patient waiting times in England under Labour.\n\nIn March 1997, just before Labour took office, the average waiting time for an inpatient in England was 13.2 weeks. By March 2009 this had fallen to four weeks. In March 2010, just before Labour left office, the median wait was 4.3 weeks.\n\nThis refers to the average time between the decision to treat a patient to the date of the treatment.\n\nThe total number of qualified nursing staff working in NHS hospitals and general practice in England increased by just over 79,000 between 1997 and 2010. The total number of doctors at any level (including GPs) increased by around 48,000. Looking just at those in hospitals the number increased by around 41,000.\n\nThese figures are looking at the full-time equivalent\u2014or the number of doctors and nurses there would be if you added up all their hours into only full-time roles.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute pointed us toward a Labour party press release as the source of its figures. We\u2019ve asked Labour for more information on how they were calculated.\n\nThis is correct for England. Between 1997 and 2010 the number of full-time equivalent teachers in state schools rose by 48,000 and support staff (including teaching assistants) rose by 230,000.\n\nThis is correct. In 1996/97, 45% of students in England achieved at least five GCSEs graded A*-C. By 2009/10 this had increased to 76%.\n\nThe London Challenge was an investment programme, largely for London secondary schools which ran from 2003 to 2011, and at its peak it had a budget of \u00a340 million a year. At the time the project began, London was identified as having a large number of underperforming secondary schools.\n\nThe Institute for Government found that: \u201cThe performance of London schools over the decade after London Challenge began improved dramatically, with Key Stage 4 results moving from among the worst in the country to the best during the period.\n\n\u201cBy 2010, Ofsted rated 30% of London schools as \u2018outstanding\u2019 compared to 17.5% nationally, and very few London secondaries fell into the bottom Ofsted categories.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve not seen a way to benchmark this performance against every other \u201cmajor capital city\u201d and have asked the Tony Blair Institute for more information about the claim.\n\nBritish Coal was twice taken to the High Court over damage caused to miners through excessive use of vibrating tools and exposure to coal dust. British Coal was found negligent by the court in 1997 and 1998 and as a result the government, which had assumed British Coal\u2019s liabilities in 1994, was instructed by the courts to work with the miners\u2019 lawyers to agree compensation measures.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the Labour government agreed a \u00a32 billion compensation deal with coal miners who contracted lung diseases as a result of their work for British Coal, as well as another compensation pot worth around \u00a3500 million for those left injured after using vibrating tools.\n\nFor miners suffering from lung diseases, the process involved them submitting a claim of ill health, followed by an assessment of the severity of their case, after which a financial offer may have been made.\n\nA 2005 House of Commons report stated that, as of 9 January 2005, 172,000 claims had been settled in full for miners suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and final offers had been made in another 180,000\u2014a total of around 350,000 cases. Around \u00a31.3 billion had been paid in compensation at that time. In total the government expected payouts to miners for industrial injuries (not only from COPD) to total around \u00a37.5 billion.\n\nThe number of pensioners and children living in poverty fell during Labour\u2019s time in office. But the exact level it fell by depends on which measure of poverty you use. We\u2019ve written more about the various ways poverty can be measured here.\n\nThe number of pensioners living in relative poverty fell by over a million from 1997/98 to 2009/10, after housing costs have been factored in. If you don\u2019t factor in housing costs, the drop is around 500,000.\n\nBut in looking at that same measure\u2014relative poverty\u2014the number of children in poverty did not fall by over a million. The number fell by around 800,000 from 1997/98 to 2009/10, before housing costs are factored in, or by around 300,000 after accounting for housing costs.\n\nIf you look at absolute poverty, then the number of children in poverty fell by well over a million (in fact, over two million), regardless of whether you factor in housing costs or not. The same goes for pensioners (almost three million).\n\nIt should be noted that the figures do not include Northern Ireland before 2002/03 (after which they are UK-wide), meaning that the level of child and pensioner poverty prior to 2002/03 will be slightly understated.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies describes the fall in pensioner and child poverty during Labour\u2019s time in office as significant, but points out there were other groups did not see the same level of change. For example, relative poverty actually rose among working-age people with no dependent children (from 12% to 14% over the same period). That said, the level of poverty among the UK population as a whole fell under Labour, regardless of which measure you use.\n\nMr Blair is correct. As a result of tax and benefit changes under Labour, the poorest 10% of households gained, on average, an amount equal to 12.8% of their income while the richest 10% of households lost an amount equal to about 8.7% of their net incomes.\n\nThe chart in the video doesn\u2019t quite match up with what Mr Blair is saying. People with incomes over \u00a3100,000 a year are shown separately, and they\u2019re excluded from the \u201crichest\u201d category. If you combine them together to make up the richest 10% of households, it would show a decrease of 8.7%.\n\nThere are various measures of social mobility. Mr Blair is correct in describing what\u2019s happened in the UK when you look at one of those measures.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute told us that Mr Blair was referring to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published last year titled \u2018A Broken Social Elevator? How to Promote Social Mobility\u2019.\n\nThe report talks about \u201cincome persistence\u201d\u2014the likelihood of individuals to move between income groups\u2014and how, compared to the 1990s, the 2010s has seen higher income persistence in numerous Western countries.\n\nIn the report, the OECD looked at how likely those working-age people in various income brackets were to still be in those same brackets four years later. Between the late 1990s and early 2010s this likelihood of someone staying in the lowest income quintile decreased from 56% to 45%, the biggest fall among the 16 OECD countries measured.\n\nSimilarly, the percentage of people who remained in the poorest quintile after four years fell from 60% in the late 1990s to 40% in the early 2010s.\n\nThe OECD says the sharp decline in income persistence in the UK during this time \u201cmay partly be explained by the lower unemployment rate and policy reforms introduced in the system of cash-benefits and tax credits during the 1990s and early 2000 (such as the Working Families Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit), and the introduction of a national minimum wage, in line with a \u201cmaking work pay\u201d strategy\u2026 However, the reduction in low-income persistence has also been accompanied by an increased recurrence of poverty spells in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the amount of money that the UK spent on development aid roughly tripled in real terms under the last Labour government (that\u2019s accounting for inflation). This followed two decades of it staying relatively flat.\n\nThe UN has had a long-standing target that the Official Development Assistance (ODA)\u2014often referred to as foreign aid\u2014provided by a country should total 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI). GNI is a country\u2019s annual output of goods and services, plus any income from abroad.\n\nThere\u2019s no fixed definition of \u201cmajor developed nation\u201d, but a number of European countries reached the target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid before the U.K. did. They were: Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. No G7 or G20 country reached the 0.7% target before the UK.\n\nBut that 0.7% target wasn\u2019t met by the UK until 2013, three years after Labour left office. While Mr Blair\u2019s government in particular accelerated the growth of foreign aid spending, it was the Coalition government that both enshrined a commitment to 0.7% of foreign aid spending into law, and was the first to reach that target.", "lang": "en"}
