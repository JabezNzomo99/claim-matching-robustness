It announces to Muslims in the area surrounding a mosque that the time for prayer has come.\n\nIn May 2019 the city government of\n\n, South Africa, received a noise complaint about the athaan from the\n\nin District Six, an inner-city residential area.\n\nNews of the complaint has\n\n, the party that runs Cape Town\u2019s government, wants to \u201cshut down\u201d the mosque altogether.\n\nA screenshot of the tweet made its way onto\n\n, where it\u2019s been shared over 1,300 times.\n\n, mayoral committee member for community services and health, said the city government is \u201cengaging\u201d with the Zeenatul Islam Masjid, commonly known as the Muir Street mosque.\n\nHe told Africa Check a resident had filed an affidavit in terms of Western Cape province noise regulations and that the affidavit also represented six other people. \u201cPrior to this, we have received three other complaints from persons who chose not to submit affidavits.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit means the city is legally required to address the complaint. But it had no intention to \u201cshut down\u201d the mosque, Badroodien said.\n\nThe city\u2019s environmental health service had respected the Muir Street mosque\u2019s request that further engagement take place after Ramadan, he added. And it has not requested that the athaan be turned off or its volume lowered.\n\n\u201cDistrict Six is a diverse community and the city respects the right to practice any religion,\u201d Badroodien said.\n\n\u201cThe matter had blown out of proportion on social media with incorrect information being shared and retweeted exponentially.\u201d\n\nAnd we couldn\u2019t find any evidence or reports to suggest that the DA wants to shut down the mosque. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. - Cayley Clifford", "lang": "en"}
