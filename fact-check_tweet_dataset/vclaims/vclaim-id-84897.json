What's their score?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-07-15T07:00:17Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84897", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/15/trump-versus-clinton-the-pinocchio-count-so-far/", "vclaim": "Why were so many more of Trump\u2019s claims rated? In large part, it is because he made so many public appearances, sometimes several times a day on television or radio programs. The Fact Checker responds to reader requests, and many of Trump\u2019s statements were provocative and controversial.\n\nBy contrast, Clinton tended to give few relatively few interviews. Many of her remarks were confined to prepared speeches, not off-the-cuff remarks. About one-third of Clinton\u2019s claims that my colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee and I checked concerned the revelation that she had a private email server when she was secretary of state \u2014 remarks that certainly prompted reader inquiries and concerns.\n\nClinton is a professional politician, with a large staff that will readily respond to fact-checking questions. Often, Clinton\u2019s staff can quickly provide documentation that backs up, or at least explains, the facts and figures that she cites. By contrast, Trump\u2019s small staff rarely responds to fact-checking inquiries and never provides an explanation for his statements.\n\nTrump is also the rare politician who will repeat false claims, over and over, even after they have been debunked by fact-checking organizations. Most politicians will simply stop repeating a claim after receiving Four Pinocchios, our worst rating.\n\nWe obviously cannot vet every claim made by a candidate, so it is admittedly a self-selected list. But we focus on statements about newsworthy topics or that shed light on important policy issues. We do not play gotcha, and so avoid scrutiny of obvious misstatements (especially if a candidate admits error). We also do not assess obviously true statements, but prefer to focus on claims that are surprisingly true. Moreover, we have now vetted so many claims that the Pinocchio tally is a useful basis for comparison.\n\nAs you see, the ratio of Trump\u2019s Four-Pinocchios ratings is sky-high. In fact, nearly 85 percent of Trump\u2019s claims that we vetted were false or mostly false. A line graph of Trump\u2019s numbers would show a very steep sky jump. By contrast, Clinton has a bell curve of a typical politician. The number of false claims equals the number of true claims, while her other claims fall mostly somewhere in the middle.\n\nClinton earned Four Pinocchios for a fanciful and tendentious claim that illegal immigrants, as a group, pay more in taxes than some corporations. She also falsely stated that the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to thwart an anti-gay-marriage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But both of these were close calls, as we nearly made them Three Pinocchios.\n\nMore problematic was Clinton\u2019s claim that U.S. prisons are overflowing with inmates mainly because of marijuana convictions. (In fiscal year 2014, in the federal system, 187 inmates (0.9 percent) were sentenced for simple drug possession \u2014 of whom 75 were jailed for marijuana possession.) Clinton also made the absurd claim that she was the only candidate in either party who had a plan to both raise incomes and not raise middle-class taxes.\n\nClinton earned a bushel of Pinocchios for her claims about her email arrangement. After the conclusion of the FBI investigation, we elevated the Pinocchio count on her statements that she did not send or receive classified material, which she sometimes specified as \u201cmarked or designated classified.\u201d While the markings found on her emails are now being disputed, the FBI has confirmed there were 110 emails that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received.\n\nTrump\u2019s Four-Pinocchios claims are too numerous to tally; we even have created a Web page that contains a complete list. The volume of his false claims is extraordinary, especially because he so often repeats them. He continued to say that he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrate the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when that never happened. He repeatedly says he opposed the Iraq war from the start, when that\u2019s false. He constantly says the Islamic State terrorist group controls the oil in Libya, when that\u2019s wrong. He routinely inflates the unemployment rate from 4.9 percent to as high as 42 percent.", "lang": "en"}
