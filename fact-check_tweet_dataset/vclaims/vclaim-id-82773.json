The Crimea referendum, set up by local authorities, met none of those conditions.\n\nPutin, in a long section of the speech, refers to Russia\u2019s \u201cshared history and pride\u201d with Crimea. He is correct on that score. Crimea has been an important part of Russia since Catherine the Great seized it from the Ottoman Empire in 1783. Putin is also correct that the reasons for the 1954 transfer remain a bit of mystery, though historian William Taubman, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Khrushchev, said that the one-time party boss of Ukraine had long tried to expand Ukraine\u2019s territory and even tried to take Crimea for Ukraine 10 years earlier, in 1944.\n\nBut Putin is relying on sophism to assert that the transfer violated the \u201cconstitutional norms\u201d at the time. Behind the scenes, Khrushchev, who did not yet have full power, had to get approval from key party officials. On Feb. 5, 1954, the Presidium of the Russian Supreme Soviet launched an initiative to transfer Crimea. That resulted in a decree on Feb. 19, 1954, by what was then called the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Then the transfer was formally adopted by the Supreme Soviet on April 26, 1954.\n\nThere is some question as to whether the Soviet constitution also would have required referendums in the respective Soviet republics, but the Soviet Union was a one-party state, and the outcome would not have been in question. Ultimately the Supreme Soviet itself had the formal authority to ratify the transfer \u2013 -and that\u2019s what happened.\n\n\u201cIn general, constitutional norms were not followed in Soviet times even when they were followed \u2014 because Supreme Soviets didn\u2019t really decide, but rather, did what they were told to do by party leaders, and elections (and referendums, if they were ever held) were pre-determined,\u201d Taubman said in an e-mail.\n\nMoreover, Russia did have extremely crucial interests at stake \u2014 a cache of more than 1,000 strategic nuclear weapons that were on Ukraine\u2019s soil when the Soviet Union dissolved. In fact, Ukraine was instantly the world\u2019s third biggest nuclear power, with more weapons than Britain, France and China combined. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, Russia, along with the United States and Britain, agreed to \u201crefrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine\u201d in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s joining the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nPutin also exaggerates the role of right-wing, nationalistic factions, though it is true that a party with a neofascist past and other ultra-nationalistic elements are now part of the government. (The party claims it has mellowed, but the World Jewish Congress has warned about it.) The Guardian newspaper, in a long report on this issue, notes that one revolutionary killed by a government sniper \u201cwas an unlikely fascist,\u201d adding that \u201che was Jewish.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Putin described the new Ukrainian leaders as \u201cthese ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitler\u2019s accomplice during World War II.\u201d He is referring to Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist who sought to create an independent Ukraine after the German invasion of the Soviet Union \u2014 only to be thrown into a German concentration camp. He was murdered in Munich by the KGB in 1959. Bandera remains a controversial figure in Ukraine.\n\nIn a long section of his speech, Putin lashed out at the West for what he views as a double standard, defending Crimea\u2019s action as the equivalent of Kosovo\u2019s declaring independence from Serbia. In citing what he calls the \u201cwell-known Kosovo precedent,\u201d Putin even accurately quotes from the U.S. submission to the International Court of Justice, which later concluded that Kosovo\u2019s action did not violate international law. (Russia at the time denounced that ruling.)\n\nBut the analogy is woefully misplaced. The United States was not seeking to annex Kosovo, as Russia is doing with Crimea. Moreover, the Kosovars had spent years seeking greater autonomy, only to face such Serbian backlash that even Russia voted for a U.N. Security Council Resolution that said it was \u201cgravely concerned at the recent intense fighting in Kosovo and in particular the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army which have resulted in numerous civilian casualties and, according to the estimate of the Secretary-General, the displacement of over 230,000 persons from their homes.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker is obviously not rating the entire speech, which reflects Putin\u2019s worldview. But certainly this selection of statements is highly deficient or based on slim facts. He ignores Russia\u2019s real interest in removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine\u2019s soil, which led to a pledge by Moscow to respect Kiev\u2019s sovereignty. He hypes the involvement of nationalist and right-wing groups in the uprising. The Kosovo analogy is a real stretch. One could quibble on whether some of these statements are worth Three Pinocchios, but the statement on the Crimean referendum by itself is worth Four Pinocchios. So that\u2019s what the Russian president earns.", "lang": "en"}
