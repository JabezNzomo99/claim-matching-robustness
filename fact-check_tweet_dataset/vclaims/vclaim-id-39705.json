However, a reverse image search shows that the man was in fact arrested during looting and clashes that broke out during an anti-foreigner protest in South Africa in 2017.\n\nOne Facebook post carrying the image has been shared more than 800 times since it was shared on September 23. We\u2019ve archived it here.\n\nThe image has an embedded caption which reads: \u201cThis Soweto father tracked down the man who raped his 3-year-old daughter, tied him to tree, cut off the rapist\u2019s penis, cooked it and forced him to eat it.\u201d Soweto is a township just outside South Africa\u2019s largest city, Johannesburg.\n\nIn the comments, some online users expressed approval at the man\u2019s supposed actions, endorsing such punishments against child rapists.\n\nThe same image was shared on Group Kenya, a Facebook group with more than two million members, alongside the caption: \u201cI want to marry this Soweto man and give him 10 kids???. Won't mind been a fourth wife either.\u201d\n\nSimilar posts were shared here, here and here.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search for the picture using the search engine TinEye, which traced the picture to an article published on the website of Britain\u2019s Daily Mail newspaper in 2017.\n\nAccording to the caption, the photo shows a South African resident being arrested \u201cafter allegedly looting and clashing with foreign residents during a xenophobic march by the Mamelodi Concerned Residents through the streets of Pretoria\u201d.\n\nThe article itself details violent clashes between South Africans and immigrants from other African countries in Pretoria, the country\u2019s administrative capital, which is around an hour\u2019s drive north of Soweto.\n\nNumerous waves of anti-foreigner unrest have broken out in South Africa in recent years, with immigrants becoming a target due to accusations that they are taking up scarce jobs. Most recently, 12 people were killed and hundreds forced to flee their homes during a wave of xenophobic unrest in September -- see this report by AFP.\n\nThe Daily Mail attributes the image to the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA), an international news photo agency. To confirm its origin, we ran a search on the EPA website -- it can indeed be found here. According to the metadata, the image was captured on February 24, 2017.\n\nA reverse image search on Google led us to a BBC news report from India which bears a resemblance to the story of the \u201cSoweto father\u201d. It details the case of a father in Delhi who tortured and killed his tenant in 2014 after suspecting him of raping his daughter. He turned himself into police voluntarily.", "lang": "en"}
