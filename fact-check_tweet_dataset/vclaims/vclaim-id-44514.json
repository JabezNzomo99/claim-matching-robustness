The cover features US President Donald Trump, exiting through a door with the text, \u2018TIME\u2026to go\u2019, written on it.\n\nThe caption of the post reads, \u2018Congratulations, Donald J Trump. You made the cover of Time Magazine Again\u2019.\n\nThe post has been shared by novelist, Shobhaa De as well.\n\nNewsMobile did a fact check on the picture and found that the claim is fake.\n\nWe started our investigation by carefully examining the cover in the viral post. We found that unlike all TIME magazine covers, the cover in the post does not have the date of the issue mentioned on the top right corner.\n\nWe further checked the TIME vault, a segment where the magazine keeps the archives of all its covers. We could not find the cover in the archive.\n\nMoreover, the magazine tweeted their latest issue which looks nothing like the cover in the viral picture.\n\nHence, our investigation proves that the cover in the viral post is fake and not issued by TIME magazine.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
