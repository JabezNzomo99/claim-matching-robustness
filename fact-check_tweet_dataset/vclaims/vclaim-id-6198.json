Well, that\u2019s what some websites are saying.\n\n\"Report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens,\" reads a headline on InfoWars, a conspiracy website ran by Alex Jones. The article has been shared via Facebook more than 48,000 times when we last looked.\n\nOther websites also have touted this report, including Milo, TheNewAmerican and FreedomDaily.\n\nSo is there any truth to it?\n\nWell, we don\u2019t know for absolute certain. But the report is actually a tweet, and the person who authored the tweet won\u2019t explain how he arrived at his figure. If that isn\u2019t reason enough to be skeptical, independent experts and historical analyses suggest it\u2019s highly suspect.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t buy it.\n\nAs evidence of its claim, InfoWars\u2019 headline refers to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he\u2019s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app.\n\nThere is no report from VoteFraud.org, however, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. The information comes from tweets made by from Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13.\n\nHere they are:\n\nPhillips would not provide any additional information when asked by PolitiFact. He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used.\n\nPhillips said he would release the information publicly once he is finally finished.\n\nAccording to his page on LinkedIn, Phillips is a former finance director of the Alabama Republican Party. He also served as executive director of the Mississippi Republican Party and was managing director of a super PAC that supported Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 campaign for president.\n\nPlenty of reason to be skeptical\n\nWhile we have no idea how Phillips arrived at his claim that 3-million noncitizens voted, people who have made similar claims in the past have cited a 2014 report that claims 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010 midterm congressional elections.\n\nThat report was based on data from a Harvard survey of people. But the data was flawed, which created flaws in the subsequent report.\n\nThe authors of the survey say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentified themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn\u2019t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question.\n\nHow do researchers know this? One of the authors of the survey, Brian Schaffner, said people changed their answers later when they were asked about their citizenship.\n\n\"When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted,\" Schaffner told PolitiFact.\n\nNews 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.\n\nA report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. \"Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,\" reads the 2007 report.\n\nStates that have tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls, meanwhile, have found even government data lacking.\n\nIn 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott\u2019s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls.\n\nThrough this process the Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives \u2014 including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet.\n\nUltimately, only 85 people were removed from the voting rolls. State officials began to pursue a second attempt at a purge in advance of the 2014 election but then abandoned that effort, too.\n\nRichard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called Phillips\u2019 claim \"fake news.\"\n\n\"There is no credible evidence I have seen to show large numbers of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections anywhere,\" Hasen said. \"The idea that 3 million noncitizens could have illegally voted in our elections without being detected is obscenely ludicrous.\"\n\nThe articles point back to tweets from Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. But Phillips will not provide any evidence to support his claim, which happens to be undermined by publicly available information.\n\nIf Phillips does release a more detailed report, we will consider that information. But for now, this claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
