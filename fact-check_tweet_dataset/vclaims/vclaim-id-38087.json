It is being claimed that the son of Israel\u2019s prime minister serves in the army unlike the children of Indian politicians who enjoy luxurious life and later join politics.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. The man seen in the photo is definitely an Israeli soldier but not the son of any prime minister of Israel.\n\nThe post was shared by Facebook page Tellgu\u2019 on Wednesday. Besides this, similar posts are also circulating on social media.\n\nUpon reverse-searching the image, we found some news reports related to the photo. As per a report in The Jerusalem Post, the man in the picture is Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was returned to Israel on October 18, 2011, after being held captive by militant organisation Hamas since June 25, 2006.\n\nIn exchange for Gilad release, Israel freed 1,027 Palestinian prisoners of Hamas and other terror organisations, the report said.\n\nThe viral photo was taken at Tel Nof Airbase of central Israel when Gilad was returning to his home. The man to whom Gilad is saluting in the photo is Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWe also found some other pictures of this event on Getty Images.\n\nGilad Shalit was born on August 28, 1986, in Israel to Noam and Aviva Shalit.\n\nHowever, it is correct that the youngest son of the Israeli Prime Minister, Avner Netanyahu, joined the Israel Defense Forces in 2014.\n\nA report in The Jerusalem Post says according to the 1949 Israeli Security Service Law, conscription to military service is compulsory for all Israelis who turn 18. Only two groups are exempt from mandatory military service: the ultra-Orthodox and Arab Israelis\".\n\nHence, it is true that the son of Israeli PM served in the defence, but the soldier seen in the viral photo is not the son of any prime minister of Israel.", "lang": "en"}
