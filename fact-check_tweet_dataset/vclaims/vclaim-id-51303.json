And you know what that meant? It was the lowest GDP growth for the whole of the fourth republic.\u201d\n\nGhana\u2019s Fourth Republic was birthed on January 7, 1993, when the country\u2019s 1992 Constitution came into effect after a chequered history of military interventions.\n\nSo, to be able to assess the comment, one must look out for the GDP growth rate between 1993 and 2019 but bear in mind that the Ghana Statistical Service has rebased Ghana\u2019s economic calculations in 2010 and 2018.\n\n\u201cThe figures will naturally have to be rebased if you want to compare\u2026[But] whether you rebase or not the relative change is going to be the same.\u201d A Senior Lecturer at the University of Ghana Economics Department Dr Ebo Turkson said in an interview with GhanaFact.\n\nThat notwithstanding our checks from World Bank computation [using constant 2010 U.S. dollars] found that Ghana\u2019s 2015 growth rate of 2.17% is the lowest in the fourth republic.\n\n\u201c2015 was the year we did worse and not 2016. That was the year we went to the IMF.\u201d Dr Ebo Turkson reiterated.\n\nAttempts to reach Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko for a reaction following our findings proved futile. But GhanaFact will update this fact-check report if we duly get a response.\n\nSo, the claim that Ghana\u2019s growth rate in 2016 was the lowest in the fourth republic is false.", "lang": "en"}
