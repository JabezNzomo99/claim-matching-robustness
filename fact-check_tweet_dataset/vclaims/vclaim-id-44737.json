He is now on trial in the Senate, where members of his Republican party hold enough seats that he is all but certain to be acquitted.\n\nOther posts -- such as this one -- link to an article that makes the same claim about Pelosi\u2019s possible resignation.\n\nThe article cites an interview Pelosi allegedly gave to a Belgian magazine called \u201cL\u0435 Mensonge,\u201d and quotes her as saying: \u201cIf this impeachment fails, my time is probably up. I won't wait around. If it doesn't go through, I'll resign.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d is a fictitious publication with a name that means \u201cThe Lie\u201d in French.\n\nAnd the text of the article appears to have been copied from one that appeared on bustatroll.org with the label \"Impeachment Satire.\"\n\nBustatroll.org is part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d network of websites, which was founded by Christopher Blair, a resident of the US state of Maine.\n\nArticles on Blair\u2019s sites make outrageous claims written as fact, albeit with clear indications they are not real.\n\nThe articles are nonetheless shared in droves by people who apparently believe they are true amid a hyper-partisan American political environment.\n\nThe resignation claim is also repeated in a YouTube video that has been viewed more than 200,000 times, and which has been shared here on Facebook.\n\nThe video cites a different article -- apparently this one, which also seems to have been taken from bustatroll.org -- that quotes the same alleged \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d interview as the source of its information.", "lang": "en"}
