For example, we rated False a statement from Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz that said the deal \"trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.\"\n\nThis time, a reader from Westmoreland\u2019s congressional district asked Politifact Georgia to truth-test the statement that Obama and Kerry had agreed \"to lift Iran\u2019s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct.\"\n\n\"My understanding is that Iran must meet certain requirements through verification before these sanctions are lifted,\" the reader wrote. \"Can you please investigate this claim?\"\n\nThe historic agreement was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States and was backed by 41 Senate Democrats. It calls for Iran to significantly limit its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for being relieved of economically crippling international sanctions.\n\nOpponents say the deal lacks long-term assurances that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. and one of three countries still identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism -- won\u2019t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions and any involvement in terrorism in exchange for having the sanctions lifted.\n\nSupporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the short term. They say the U.S. had to make concessions because many of its allies had grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against oil-rich Iran.\n\nInitially, we weren\u2019t entirely certain what Westmoreland meant by \"conduct.\" Was it the country\u2019s nuclear policy? Foreign policies? Human rights record?\n\nWe zeroed in on the nuclear threat after Leigh Claffey, the communications director for Westmoreland, responded when we told her a reader had asked us to fact-check the accuracy of the statement.\n\nClaffey said Westmoreland\u2019s statement was based, in part, on the fact that the U.S. does not have any inspectors on the ground to receive firsthand knowledge or confirmation that the Iranians have changed their ways.\n\nThe U.S. also is not part of the inspection process, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear nonproliferation commitments, is not permitted access to all Iranian sites, she said.\n\nClaffey also forwarded us links to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s \"21 reasons the Iran deal is a bad deal\" and to an opinion piece in The New York Times calling it \"the worst agreement in U.S. Diplomatic history.\" Additionally, she cited a statement from the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracy that read, in part, that \"the fatal flaw\" of the pact is its sunset clauses, which permit \"critical nuclear, arms, and ballistic missile restrictions to disappear over a five- to 15-year period.\"\n\nGreg Terryn, a research and policy associate with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, said Westmoreland \"is mistaken.\"\n\n\"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the pact) specifically delays the lifting of any sanctions until the IAEA has verified that Iran is living up to its commitments under the agreement,\" Terryn said.\n\nIn the language of the deal, this is described as Adoption Day -- the day Iran must begin working toward its commitments under the agreement, Terryn said. Implementation Day is the day the U.S., United Nations and European Union must waive the implementation of certain sanctions, he said.\n\n\"Implementation Day only comes about when the IAEA verifies that Iran has fulfilled its initial obligations under the agreement,\" Terryn said.\n\nThe agreement lists 82 specific items about its nuclear program that Iran has to change to satisfy the international community. These include reducing the country\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium down to 300 kg and removing the core of the reactor at Arak and filling it with concrete.\n\nUltimately, the deal rolls back Iran\u2019s nuclear program for more than a decade, pushing back the time it would take Iran to enrich enough nuclear material for one nuclear weapon from a few months to at least one year, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n\nWe contacted several other nuclear-policy experts, only one of whom thought Westmoreland\u2019s statement had merit.\n\n\"The problem is there are tiers of sanctions -- the United Nations sanctions, the United States sanctions -- and the sanctions are being lifted upfront without Iran having to change its conduct, without Iran having to abide by the agreement itself,\" said Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"Technically, the way the agreement is written, they do not have to change their conduct.\"\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the nonprofit Arms Control Association in Washington D.C., said the pact \"definitely requires Iran to effect radical changes in the conduct and capacity of Iran\u2019s nuclear program before there is any sanctions relief.\"\n\n\"There will be no sanctions relief \u2014 whatsoever \u2014 before \u2018Implementation Day,\u2019 and to get to that point Iran must take very substantial steps and put in place tough restrictions that will block its ability to produce nuclear bomb material, allow much more intrusive inspections, and answer questions from the IAEA about past experiments with \u2018possible military dimensions,\u2019 \" Kimball said.\n\nShawn l. Ramirez, an assistant professor of political science at Emory University, said \"numerous \u2018proofs\u2019 of compliance with the terms of the agreement are required of Iran over time to actually lift the sanctions.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" Ramirez said, \"restoring the sanctions cannot be undone unless all five members of the UN Security Council agree to continue to suspend sanctions \u2014 the U.S. has locked in its veto power to punish Iran if Iran doesn\u2019t comply.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said that President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry agreed to lift Iran\u2019s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct.\n\nThe Iran deal may be less than perfect. And there\u2019s certainly reason to be dubious of Iran, one of only three nations that remain on the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nBut most experts say the agreement does require Iran to make significant changes before some, if not all, sanctions are removed and pushes back the timeframe on Iran\u2019s ability to make a bomb.", "lang": "en"}
