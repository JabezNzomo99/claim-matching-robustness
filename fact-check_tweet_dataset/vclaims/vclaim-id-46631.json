Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross \u2014 who oversees the Census Bureau and approved the citizenship question \u2014 violated a federal law that required him to disclose the real reason for the change. (For more on that, read our previous fact checks here and here.)\n\nObama was in office when the next decennial census rolled around, in 2010. But the Census Bureau had switched over to the ACS in 2005 \u2014 before Obama took office. Furthermore, the 2010 ACS included a citizenship question. So there was no yanking on Obama\u2019s part. (The Census Bureau began to design the ACS in 1994.)\n\nConway mentioned the way the citizenship question \u201cwas asked for 50 years.\u201d Perhaps she meant the long form used from 1960 to 2000, though that was 40 years. Otherwise, the math makes no sense. The census citizenship question, as we\u2019ve noted, first appeared in some form in 1820. It appeared continually from 1890 to 1950 on the census form. And it has appeared in the ACS since 2005, which covers all of Obama\u2019s time in office.\n\nAccording to Conway, the ACS asks about citizenship \u201cevery fifth year.\u201d The questionnaires are all archived online, and the citizenship question appears in every one. As the Justice Department wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court, citizenship questions \u201chave been part of the ACS every year since its inception in 2005.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of all the questions that nobody complains are included in our U.S. Census every 10 years that include a far, far, far smaller number of Americans or, I would argue, are much more intrusive, invasive and expansive. We\u2019re asking people how many toilets in your house, and you don\u2019t want to know who\u2019s using them?\u201d\n\nFrom 1960 to 2000, the long-form census supplement asked a version of this question: \u201cDo you have COMPLETE plumbing facilities in this house, apartment, or mobile home; that is, 1) hot and cold piped water, 2) a flush toilet, and 3) a bathtub or shower?\u201d In 2000, respondents were asked to check one of two boxes: \u201cyes, have all three facilities\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d (In 1970, the flush toilet question appeared by itself.)\n\nThe Census Bureau in 2014 said it was weighing whether to cut some questions on commuting habits, income, mental disability and household plumbing from the ACS, partly in response to criticism that they were too nosy. Since 2016, the ACS survey has not included a toilet question, though it still asks about other forms of plumbing.\n\n\u201cPlumbing data are used by federal agencies to allocate federal housing subsidies, identify poor-quality housing and identify candidates for home repair or other assistance,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center. \u201cThe data also help public health officials identify areas with potential ground water contamination or waterborne diseases. The plumbing questions were first asked on the 1940 Census. [Census Bureau official Gary] Chappell acknowledged that the plumbing questions may have been more useful in earlier eras, when more homes lacked basic sanitation facilities. However, these estimates may still be important in some rural areas and on American Indian lands.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s recap: The Obama administration did not yank the citizenship question from the 2010 Census. Conway\u2019s 50-year timeline doesn\u2019t add up. The ACS asks about citizenship every year, not every five years. The supplemental surveys that asked about toilets also asked about citizenship. The ACS no longer asks about toilets, but still asks about citizenship.", "lang": "en"}
