No, that's not true: There's zero evidence to support the claim, a variation on the oft-debunked myth that Trump is fighting a deep state. A \"whistleblower\" exaggerated his role in developing a program that he falsely claimed was then used to do everything from spur protests to frame Trump. His claims are \"wildly fictitious and irresponsible,\" according a spokesman for Dynology, the company where he worked.\n\nThe claim was made in a video that appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) on August 15, 2020. The video, titled \"ShadowGate,\" was made by Millicent \"Millie\" Weaver, who goes by the name \"Millennial Millie.\" It appeared alongside text that read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like at the time of writing:\n\nThe 82-minute video begins with a short narration by Weaver. She asks:\n\nWhat if I were to tell you that a small group of government contractors were hired by government officials to frame the Trump campaign, set him up for the Russia collusion investigation, provided witnesses for the impeachment hearings and provided administrative support services to the Department of Justice during the Mueller investigation? And what if it just so happened that this same group of contractors are behind the fake news in mainstream media, influence operations on social media and the civil unrest nationwide, pushing the Defund the Police movement?\n\nDespite the bombshell nature of its claims, the video does not successfully support them.\n\nAs evidence, the video includes interviews with just two people, \"Tore\" and Patrick Bergy, both of whom are identified as people who worked as contractors \"within the shadow government.\"\n\nTore is described as an intelligence contractor and linguist with the U.S. Navy. Bergy allegedly worked in cybersecurity for the U.S. Army and as a contractor for a company called Dynology. Lead Stories confirmed from a source who worked with Bergy that his job at Dynology did not involve developing software. A spokesman for the company said:\n\nIn the video, Bergy said that he worked on contracts for the Department of Defense, \"for the development of the capabilities for interactive internet activities.\" Here's Bergy:\n\nVarious images scrolled as he spoke. One looked like an official flyer or website explaining ShadowNet. Another showed the 2007 Department of Defense (DoD) policy.\n\n\n\nThe montage is typical of the video, which uses a combination of stock footage and official-looking documents to make its points. Often, though, the images are irrelevant to the arguments and don't match the sinister-sounding music that's played beneath them.\n\nFor example, there's nothing secret about the DoD policy on IIA. It says nothing about \"psychological warfare.\" (You can read the full guidance here.) Also, ShadowNet, as its described in the image, is hardly a \"weapon.\" It creates a \"sandbox\" for secure, anonymous access to the internet. (You can read more about the platform here.)\n\nThe video, via Bergy, attributes IIA as being behind recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations and describes certain news personalities, such as Gillian Turner and Mika Brzezinski, as \"IIA assets.\" When asked whether he thought IIA had been used against Trump, Bergy said:\n\nAgain, he offers no proof for his sweeping claims beyond speculation.\n\nAnd speaking of speculation, Bergy recently suggested that authorities arrested Weaver because of her work exposing the deep state. They did not. According to The Plain Dealer, Weaver was arrested August 14 on charges of robbery and domestic violence in Portage County, Ohio. At the time of writing, a GoFundMe page had raised close to $170,000 for Weaver, who is a contributor to InfoWars.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes Infowars.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
