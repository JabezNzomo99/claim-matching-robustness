This is\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the rural electrification corporation to electrify schools, that is to wire schools and anything that goes with it. Kenya Power comes in with the meter, connects, and then bills,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\nThis was the approach \u201canywhere\u201d in the country, including urban areas such as the capital city Nairobi, Nyandika said.\n\nsecondary schools, according to its 2016-2021 strategic plan. Some 6,530 of these had been electrified by June 2013, when Kenyatta\u2019s administration started its first full financial year.\n\nto primary schools to support the new government\u2019s\n\n. By June 2016 it had connected 8,259 secondary schools, and 22,648 of 23,401\n\ntargeted, according to the strategic plan.\n\nA spokesperson for the agency told Africa Check it has connected 22,927 public primary schools. This was 98.4% of the\n\nof public primary schools as of 2019.\n\nThe agency also told Africa Check some 8,755 public secondary schools, polytechnics and institutions of higher learning were connected as of 2020. But it did not break down this data further to allow us to calculate what percentage of secondary schools have been electrified.\n\nFor early childhood development and education centres, some 204 have been provided with electricity, the agency said. This is less than 1%, or 0.7% specifically, of the 28,383 early childhood centres\n\nThe president\u2019s figure would therefore have been accurate if he were referring only to public primary schools. Before his administration, some 6,530 secondary schools had already been connected, so he cannot take credit for them.\n\nAvailable data also shows at least 99% of early childhood centres are not yet connected to electricity.\n\nKenya attained self-rule in June 1963. Fifty years after this was June 2013, two months after Kenyatta started his first term. The president was thus alluding to the electricity access achieved by previous administrations.\n\nThe number of households in 2013 was between\n\n, according to the 2009 and 2019 censuses respectively. Using the president\u2019s households figure, this suggests that in 2013, the national grid electricity access was somewhere between 37%and 51%.\n\nBut an access rate of 50.4% was only achieved in 2019,\n\nCase closed? Not exactly. There is considerable confusion in the energy sector over what qualifies as a household.\n\nsupplies power to \u201cindividual households, private industries, companies and government institutions\u201d. In its\n\non the electrification of households the utility has\n\nan average of four people in a household.\n\nthe entire Kenya Power customer base as though it is the same as the number of households. Using this approach,\n\nthe country had 2.33 million connections in total, 2.1 million of which were domestic.\n\nThat is still 2.2 million domestic connections fewer than the president\u2019s 4.5 million figure.\n\nAfrica Check reached out to Kenya Power spokesperson Kevin Sang for clarification on how it defines a household. We will update this report with the utility\u2019s response. We thus at present can only rate this claim as unproven.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 census found there were\n\nhouseholds in Kenya. Kenyatta\u2019s figure of \u201cclose to 8 million\u201d suggests about two-thirds of Kenyan households have electricity provided by the state.\n\nBut the census showed access to grid electricity was\n\nin 2019. Another 19.3% had access through solar. This is more than two-thirds, but it is not clear how much off-grid access was by the state.\n\nWhat of connections? Kenyatta took office in April 2013. As of June that year, when his first full financial year began, total connections were about 2.8 million, of which 2.5 million were domestic.\n\nTreasury data shows there were 7.2 million connections as of June 2019, but does not give a figure for domestic connections.\n\nhad risen to 7.5 million customers as of January 2020, but also does not say how many were domestic connections.\n\nThe last publicly available figure for domestic connections was\n\nWe are yet to find data that supports the president\u2019s estimate of \u201cclose to 8 million\u201d.\n\nthat 4.5 million title deeds \u2013 the same number quoted by the president \u2013 have been issued since 2013. Is this number verifiable?\n\nin Nairobi, told Africa Check that since the\n\nof 2012, title deeds are now referred to as \u201ccertificates of title\u201d. \u201cTitle deed was the name under the Government Lands Act and all other regimes before the\n\nAccording to the registration law,\n\nprove that the person named in the certificate owns the land.\n\nwere issued in six financial years from 2013/14 to 2018/19. If we factor in the ministry\u2019s number of 388,000 deeds for the first 10 months of the 2019/20 financial year, the total is 4.42 million, or about 60,000 short.\n\nWe thus reached out to the ministry to clarify how many title deeds have been issued.\n\nwith us which showed that from 2013 to 2017, some 3,218,170 title deeds were issued.\n\nThe minister\u2019s data was broken down as follows:\n\nThat means about 4.49 million title deeds have been issued since 2013, when the current administration started in office, which is similar to the figure cited by the president.", "lang": "en"}
