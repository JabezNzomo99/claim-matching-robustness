The article (Archived) given in the post mentions that Narsinghanand Saraswati has made the claim. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Narsinghanand Saraswati: \u2018All the accused in the Hyderabad Rape are Muslims. The Police admit changing their names because three of them were minors.\u2019 Fact: None of the accused is a minor. The police did not admit that they changed the names of the accused. Also, the names of the three accused Hindus were not made up. Their names can be found in their family\u2019s ration cards. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nNarsinghanand Saraswati has uploaded a couple of videos (video 1 and video 2) on his YouTube channel regarding the Hyderabad Veterinary Rape-Murder case. In both the videos, he claims that all the accused are Muslims. In the recent video, he also claims that the police made up the names of the three accused and showed them as Hindus to defame the religion. He claims that the names were made up because they were minors. \n\n\n\nIn the press conference held by the Cyberabad Police on the issue, the Commissioner of Police Mr Sajjanar gave the details of the accused. The same can be seen at 4 min: 10 seconds in the video. The details of the accused are:\n\n\n\nAll the accused members are adults. So, the question of changing their names does not arise. But, as the post claims that the Police has misled the people, FACTLY tried to find the official proof to establish that the names of the Hindu men were not made up. We looked at the names of their parents and the address to find official evidence for these men. FACTLY could find the ration cards of families of the three accused Hindu men on the Telangana Government website which can be seen below. The ration cards confirm that the names were not made up.\n\nTo sum it up, all the accused men in the Hyderabad Veterinary Rape-Murder case are not Muslims.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
