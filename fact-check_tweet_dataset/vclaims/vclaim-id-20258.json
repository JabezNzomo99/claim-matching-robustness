It should be noted that Varthaman is a pilot with the Indian Air Force and not the Indian Army.\n\nBOOM further analysed the video and using advanced searches was able to determine that the woman speaking in the video is Sirisha Rao, a resident of Gurgaon. Rao had tweeted the video of her speaking from her personal handle with the caption, \"Humble request .@BJP4India dont count your seats at the cost of soldiers sacrifice\"\n\nBOOM contacted Rao who confirmed she had recorded and posted the video. \"Yes, I uploaded the video on my Twitter handle. It was an appeal to political leaders to not politicise the issue of our soldiers at the border,\" she said. Rao who is a volunter with Aam Aadmi Party said her husband was a Colonel in the Army but did not wish to divulge further details.\n\nShe further said, \"In the video I clearly say I am the wife of an army officer and as we all know Varthaman is a pilot with the air force so why is it that people are sharing the video claiming I am his wife?\"", "lang": "en"}
