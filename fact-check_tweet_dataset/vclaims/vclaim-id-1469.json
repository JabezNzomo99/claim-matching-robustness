She said she wasn\u2019t. Donald J. Trump appears to be referring to the \u201cred line\u201d (not \u201cline in the sand\u201d) episode in Syria. At a news conference in August 2012, President Obama said if President Bashar al-Assad of Syria moved or used \u201ca whole bunch of chemical weapons,\u201d it would be \u201ca red line\u201d that would change his calculations about not intervening in Syria with armed force. A year later \u2014 after Hillary Clinton was no longer in government \u2014 there was a chemical weapons attack in a rebel-contested suburb of Damascus, killing as many as 1,500 people. The United States government issued a report saying \u201cstreams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence\u201d as proving that Syrian government forces were behind the attack, meaning Mr. Obama\u2019s red line had been crossed. Mr. Obama weighed a punitive strike against the Syrian government, although there was no precedent that would have made that legal under international law. Then, Mr. Obama said he would seek congressional authorization (for domestic legal authority) first. As public opinion shifted against any direct Western intervention, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed that his country would remove Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical weapons. That solution resolved the crisis and the United States never attacked. Mr. Obama\u2019s decision not to attack Mr. Assad was criticized by some observers as showing that a president could say something was a \u201cred line\u201d and not follow through. Others praised him for holding back. Whatever the policy merits, it is false that Mrs. Clinton was part of the administration when this happened. Close", "lang": "en"}
