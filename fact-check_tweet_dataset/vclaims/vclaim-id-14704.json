Ms Hanson\u2019s office said the source was the 2018 Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land report.\n\nThe Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land was established in 2015 by the Foreign Investment Review Board to provide greater transparency about the level of foreign ownership of Australia\u2019s agricultural land. [2]\n\nAs of June 2018, foreign ownership of Tasmanian farmland was 24.5 per cent, according to the report. Ms Hanson quoted a figure of 25 per cent. The level of foreign ownership in NT was 26.8 per cent according to the report. Ms Hanson said 30 per cent. [3]\n\nMs Hanson also did not refer to agricultural land. She said \u201cour land\u201d.\n\nBack in September 2016 Katter's Australian Party leader Bob Katter made a similar statement using similar figures but correctly quoted the percentage of foreign-owned farmland in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.\n\n\u201cThirty per cent of the Northern Territory\u2019s farmland is now foreign-owned, 22 per cent of Tassie; that\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Mr Katter told The Australian in 2016. [4]\n\nBased on the 2016 Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land, Mr Katter\u2019s claim was found to be true. [5]\n\nHe correctly referred to farmland or agricultural land and his figures for foreign ownership tallied with the 2016 report which stated 21.8 per cent for Tasmania and 30.1 for NT. [6]\n\nMs Hanson\u2019s did not make this distinction. Her figure for NT\u2019s foreign-owned agriculture land was incorrect and dated back to 2016. Her claim that the government has not put the brakes on foreign ownership of land was also incorrect. The source her office said she used to make her claim shows the level of total investment in agricultural lands has dropped slightly from 13.6 per cent in 2016 to 13.4 per cent in 2018. [3] [5]\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics told AAP FactCheck there was no data for all foreign-owned land - residential and agricultural - in each state.", "lang": "en"}
