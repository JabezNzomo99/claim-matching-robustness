{"title": "Lavrov Alleges Ties Between Bellingcat and Intelligence Services", "subtitle": "Russian sources are promoting a narrative that the open source investigative reporting organization is connected to Western intelligence. Russia has not produced any evidence to connect Bellingcat to British or other intelligence agencies.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "October 19, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39335", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/lavrov-alleges-ties-between-bellingcat-and-intelligence-services-fact-check/29551448.html", "vclaim": "On October 16, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Euronews, a European paid television network headquartered in Lyon, France, that the open-source intelligence (OSINT) organization Bellingcat is connected with Western intelligence agencies, who supposedly leak information to the outfit in order to influence public opinion.\n\nLavrov\u2019s comments came in response to Bellingcat\u2019s recent investigation which, with the help of the privately-owned Russian Website The Insider, uncovered the identities of the two main suspects in the Salisbury poisoning case.\n\nTo date, neither the Russian government nor their media outlets have come up with an explanation to counter the Bellingcat and Insider claims, and instead have been touting the narrative of Bellingcat\u2019s alleged ties to Western intelligence agencies. For example, on October 12, Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the United Kingdom Alexander Yakovenko, told reporters at a press conference the same line about Bellingcat and Western intelligence agencies. When asked by a reporter if he could provide any evidence to support this claim, the ambassador replied in a London news conference.\n\n\u201cI cannot present you the evidence,\u201d Yakovenko said in front of the cameras.\n\nDespite Lavrov\u2019s claim that Western intelligence agencies \u201cleak information\u201d to Bellingcat, the Salisbury story cites a series open source information, passport records, Russian residency documents and even school yearbooks.\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, the reaction to Bellingcat from Russian state media in the past has sometimes run counter to the notion that the media organization has deep connections. For example, state media typically dismissed Bellingcat\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins, as an \u201camateur\u201d and \u201cfull-time blogger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHiggins\u2019 own work involves \u2018investigating\u2019 war and conflict from the comfort of his home in England,\u201d one RT article in the news section, not the op-ed section, reads. It goes on to mention that Higgins allegedly worked for \u201can underwear company in a previous life.\u201d\n\nIn the same piece RT states, that Eliot Higgins refused a debate with Professor Theodore Postol. However Higgins confirmed to Polygraph.info that the debate that is the subject of this RT article is set to take place on October 20.\n\nAn article by the Russian state-owned news agency TASS cited the press secretary of the Russian embassy in Britain, who referred to Eliot Higgins as an individual who \"turned from a video gamer into an 'icon of independent journalism' practically overnight.\" The press secretary also claimed that Bellingcat\u2019s funding was not transparent, a claim which Polygraph.info has addressed in a past fact check.\n\nHiggins, responding to the TASS article, answered some questions about his background and how he got into journalism in a thread on Twitter, where he explains he started blogging six years ago, focusing on the Britain phone hacking scandal and not on Russia.\n\nWe gave the \u201cmisleading\u201d verdict based on three main findings of this fact check:\n\u2022 The Russian statements regarding Bellingcat and its founder are contradictory \u2013 ranging from denying credibility to accusing the organization of ties with intelligence;\n\u2022 The Russian accusations against Bellingcat have never been supported by evidence;\n\u2022 The character and the pattern of these repeated and synchronized messages fit in a recognizable disinformation strategy Russia employs when dealing with international actors Moscow perceives as adversaries.", "lang": "en"}
