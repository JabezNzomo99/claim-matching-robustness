The area has become a communal flashpoint after a fake news fuelled a brawl over parking between a Muslim and Hindu resident of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: How Fake News Turned A Parking Brawl At Delhi\u2019s Hauz Qazi Into A Communal Flashpoint\n\n\n\nThe fake quote was shared on the page 'WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI' and had close to 260 shares at the time of publishing.\n\nIt translates to, \"why is there such a hue and cry? Lifeless idols have been destroyed. Neither has anyone been killed nor has anyone been lynched.\"\n\nAn archived version of the post can be viewed here.\n\nBOOM spoke to Akhtar, who denied having made any such statement and was rather amused at how a line of acclaimed poet Allahabadi was twisted and falsely attributed to him.\n\n\u201cIt is quite obvious that I have not made any such statement,\" Akhtar, who has been at the centre of fake quotes multiple times, along with his wife Shabana Azmi, told BOOM.\n\n\"Neutrality, fairness and objectivity make people uncomfortable often times,\" he added.\n\nFurthermore, an annoyed Akhtar said he was irritated and at times amused by the disinformation spread in his name.\n\n\u201cAt times I am irritated and at times I am just amused. They hate me so much but they cannot find anything true about me to demean me. They have to lie about me all the time.\u201d\n\nAkhtar took to Twitter to post the same after BOOM contacted him.\n\nThe popular ghazal Hungama Hai Kyon Barpa was written by poet Akbar Allahabadi. It was used in the Pakistani film Aap Ka Khadim, and sung by Mehdi Hassan.", "lang": "en"}
