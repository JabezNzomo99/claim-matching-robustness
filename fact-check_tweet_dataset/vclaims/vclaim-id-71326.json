It was tagged as Duterte's \"point of view,\" or preceded by the note \"Hindi na nakapigil si Mayor Inday Sara sa mga bumabatikos as kanyang ama na si Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte (Mayor Inday Sara was not able to resist responding to those who criticize her father, President Rodrigo Duterte).\"\n\n\"Why are you blaming Duterte for the slowness of the 200 billion fund? He released that! Blame your LGUs! This is what you get for having a centralized government. This is why Duterte wanted Federalism but you dumbasses think it's some sort of Martial Law,\" the text read.\n\nAnother segment of the text read, \"You blame the President yet all he knows is that he released it. Imagine how many official heads that the money has to go through before it reaches your hand. A lot!\"\n\n\"You ask why I blame the LGUs? Because look at other cities. When the head official does his job properly his people can feel that 200 billion,\" the text added.\n\n\"This is to inform the public that the article \u201cMayor Inday Sarah Duterte\u2019s point of view\u201d is not mine nor does it reflect my actual views about federalism and how the national government is responding to the COVID-19 health crisis,\" the statement read.\n\nDuterte said the article was shared and reposted by supporters of her father, and was \"particularly popular\" among those who are pushing for federalism. \"How the article was presented as my commentary on federalism vis-a-vis the fight against COVID-19 was insulting,\" she said.\n\nShe also cited variations of the post and pointed out their errors, saying, \"Everything about the said article was never mine \u2013 from the misspelled \u201cSarah\u201d to the glaring grammatical errors to the ridiculous syntax or to the whole idea of federalism.\"\n\nThe Davao City mayor slammed those who authored the article as well as those who shared it on their social media accounts, saying misinformation is counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
