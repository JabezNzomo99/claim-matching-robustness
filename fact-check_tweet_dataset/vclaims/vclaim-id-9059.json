While this was before before the increase in tuition fees, new data suggests white students' attendance has only fallen further behind since then.\n\n\n\nThe lowest of any ethnic group\n\nAbout 33% of white British school students enrolled in university in the academic years 2010/11 and 2011/12. That is the lowest enrolment rate of any ethnic group\u2014next lowest is Black Caribbean students at 37%. By comparison the highest performing groups were Chinese students (76%), Indian students (67%) and Black African students (57%).\n\nThe IFS research is based on university enrollment prior to the 2012 tuition fees increase in England, so we don\u2019t entirely know how different the picture looks now.\n\nRecent research suggests white British attendance has fallen since then. According to King's College London research, the total number of white first-year undergraduates fell by almost a third in 2012/13, the academic year following the rise. And the same paper concludes the effect of the tuition fees rise was smaller for minority ethnic groups.\n\nThere\u2019s no agreed definition of what \u2018working class\u2019 means in this context. The IFS provides a useful breakdown of attendance by \u2018socio-economic level\u2019: a combination of student\u2019s eligibility for free school meals and the average multiple deprivation figures for their local area.\n\nWhat this shows is that of the least well-off fifth of white Britons, only 12 in 100 attended university. Of the next least well-off fifth, the number was 20 in 100. Both figures are lower than the equivalent band for any other ethnic minority.\n\nThe IFS report says that girls are on average 8% more likely than boys to attend university. This gender applies to white British students too: in 2010/11, 159,665 white girls enrolled in university, compared to 129,495 boys; the following year, the figures were 170,210 girls to 136,425 boys. This suggests white British boys from less well-off backgrounds are less likely to attend university than other groups.\n\nThere are some important caveats to the IFS research. Firstly, it excludes the six per cent of English students who, according to the Independent Schools Council, attended fee-paying schools in 2011. (The current figure is seven per cent.)\n\nSecondly, it's based on English state-educated students who took their GCSEs in 2008 and enrolled at university either as 18 year olds in 2010 or 19 year olds the following academic year. In other words, it excludes those who started later or are yet to start.", "lang": "en"}
