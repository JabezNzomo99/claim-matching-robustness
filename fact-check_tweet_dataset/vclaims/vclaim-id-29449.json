The photos are being used in a misleading context; one image is of an unrelated protest and the other shows students making a dance video. Both images were produced before the lawmaker was elected in 2016.\n\nThe article, published here on a site called \u201cNews Break Updates\u201d, states students walked out on Senator Risa Hontiveros after she promoted a book criticising the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nHontiveros is an opposition politician in the Philippines.\n\nMarcos ruled the country for 20 years before he was ousted in a 1986 \u201cPeople Power\u201d revolt; here is an encyclopedia entry about him.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the online report:\n\nThe article contains three images: a photo of young people in black-and-yellow T-shirts walking along a street, one holding a megaphone; a photo of Hontiveros; and a photo of students dancing overlaid with yellow text that says: \u201cBYE BYE RISA!\u201d\n\nIt has been shared in multiple Facebook posts that repeat the claims in the article, for example this one published June 25, 2019, which has been shared more than 600 times.\n\nThis Facebook post, dated April 27, 2018, contains the same three photos and text as in the article, but does not contain a link to the web page.\n\nThe photos are being used in a misleading context.\n\nHontiveros was elected to the Senate in 2016; here is a report about her victory published at the time by Philippine news organisation ABS-CBN.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the first image in the misleading article, which shows young men dressed in black, has been circulating online since 2013 \u2013 three years before Hontiveros became a senator.\n\nIt appears in this gallery of photos from a rally against corruption, published on September 12, 2013, on the official website of the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nThe web page does not mention Hontiveros or Marcos. Below is a screenshot of the photo, which is the sixth image in the gallery:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading article (L) with the Ateneo website image (R):\n\nThe other image in the misleading article appears to show a group of students dancing.\n\nAnother reverse search on Google found the image in this September 2012 video of students from National University in Manila taking part in a dance competition.\n\nThe YouTube video is embedded below; the same scene of students dancing appears at around the 1:26 mark:\n\nA keyword search on Facebook found the YouTube video relates to a dance competition in 2012 called Magnitude 14.0, which was organized by backpack company Jansport and the Philippine Institute for Civil Engineers.\n\nHere is the competition\u2019s Facebook page. This post, dated September 23, 2012, and this post published two days earlier, refer to the National University and contain similar photos of students in blue shirts dancing.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the image in the misleading report (L) and a the screengrab from the 2012 YouTube video (R):\n\nNational University also wrote in this Facebook post dated March 16, 2018 that the claim in the report was misleading.\n\nThe post, embedded below, says in part: \u201cIn reference to the article that came out on social media, where National University students allegedly walked out in the middle of Sen. Risa Hontiveros\u2019 speech, allow us to set the record straight: Sen. Hontiveros was not present and did not deliver any speech in National University last Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, pictures that were posted related to this article were taken more than 4 years ago and were not in any way connected to any protest on any issue.\u201d\n\n\"That's a recycled claim. NU also already came out with a statement about that. She has not given a speech at NU in June, not even 2019.\" NU refers to National University.\n\nA third reverse image search on Google traced the photo of Hontiveros in the misleading article to this report by local news site Politiko dated June 8, 2017.\n\nIts caption states the image was taken from Hontiveros\u2019s Facebook account. AFP found the same photo in this post published to Facebook by Hontiveros, also on June 8, 2017.\n\nThat post refutes a separate piece of misinformation. It is embedded below:", "lang": "en"}
