This is well over the combined borrowing of Labour governments since 1945, around \u00a3490 billion.\n\nRecent government borrowing is also higher if you take price inflation into account, though the difference is smaller.\n\nThis isn\u2019t actually very surprising, for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that borrowing has been historically high in recent years following the financial crisis in the late noughties, when Labour was still in office. Borrowing rose from \u00a340 billion in 2007/08 to a peak of \u00a3155 billion in 2009/10.\n\nA new government can\u2019t wipe out that level of borrowing overnight, nor would it necessarily want to. You can argue the deficit should or could have come down quicker anyway, but simple arithmetic like this clearly doesn\u2019t give you the whole story.\n\nSecondly, the economy is much bigger now than it used to be. Once you look at all these figures compared to the size of the UK economy, the picture is different.\n\nBorrowing peaked at about 10% of the size of the economy (GDP) in 2009/10, and it\u2019s now down to about 3.5%. That\u2019s a relatively large deficit, but not off the scale historically.\n\nThe Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan ran deficits of around 5% of GDP back in the 1970s, for example. The post-war Labour government in 1945 borrowed 15% of GDP in its first year.", "lang": "en"}
