BOOM found that the woman in the photo is IAF pilot Avani Chaturvedi. In 2016, Chaturvedi became one of the first female fighter pilots to be inducted into the IAF . BOOM had previously debunked the same claim in February 2019, when it was viral after Balakot strikes. Five IAF pilots - Wing Commander Amit Ranjan, Squadron Leaders Rahul Basoya, Pankaj Bhujade, BKN Reddy and Shashank Singh were awarded the Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry) for bombing Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Pakistan\u2019s Balakot.
