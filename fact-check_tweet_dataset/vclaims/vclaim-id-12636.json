He rhetorically asked what might have happened had the missile landed in Russian territory, stating that it was \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s quotes were picked up and repeated in a headline on November 6 by New Eastern Europe magazine, which is an independent non-profit publication based in Krakow, Poland. It quoted an unnamed European defense official as saying that the missile\u2019s tracking radar was not activated, meaning the pilot supposedly could not engage its self-destruct mechanism (a feature of the AMRAAM). Apart from this anonymous source, the magazine provided no other information to back this assertion. Some reports have indicated that the missile may have in fact self-destructed.\n\nRadio Free Europe quoted Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas as saying on Facebook \"thank God\" there were \"no human casualties\" due to this \"startling incident,\" which he called \"extremely regrettable.\"\n\nThe New Eastern Europe article did note that the missile was thought to have landed north of the Estonian city of Tartu, meaning that even if the self-destruct system was not engaged, it\u2019s very unlikely that the missile would have reached Russian territory. The Russian side of the border in the area within the missile\u2019s max range is sparsely populated, and the large Lake Peipus takes up much of that area.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Air Force's specifications for the missile indicate it has a range of 20 miles.The Spanish jet was approximately more than 30 miles from Russian territory at the time, further evidence that the accidental firing of the missile posed no threat to Russians or Russian territory.\n\nAs such, it would seem Lavrov has very little to worry about, though his concern about the need for Russia-NATO communication to avoid misunderstandings, if it is lacking, would certainly be reasonable.", "lang": "en"}
