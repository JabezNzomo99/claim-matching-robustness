Responding to the reporter\u2019s assertion that many Russians believe Moscow\u2019s foreign policy situation is \u201chopeless,\u201d particularly regarding the U.S. and Ukraine, Lavrov claimed the U.S. is trying to \u201cpunish\u201d Russia not for its aggression in Ukraine, as the U.S. and other Western governments say, but for taking in Edward Snowden, the fugitive former Central Intelligence Agency employee and U.S. government contractor who leaked highly classified information from the U.S. National Security Agency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve repeatedly said that as soon as Edward Snowden chose freedom \u2013 refused to fly to where he was threatened with the electric chair \u2013 the Americans immediately began trying to punish us,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cThen there was the Magnitsky Act. This was all before Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTwo of Lavrov\u2019s points are problematic. First, the Magnitsky Act was approved in December 2012, whereas Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow on June 23, 2013. Secondly, the Magnitsky Act was lobbied by Bill Browder, at the time a British subject (Browder renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1998), and the Obama administration was reluctant to back it. Thus, the Magnitsky Act was the project of a non-U.S. citizen and approved months before the world knew the name Edward Snowden. Indeed, the two cases have nothing to do with each other.\n\nLavrov\u2019s claim that Snowden chose \u201cfreedom\u201d is also spurious. Snowden ended up at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport while allegedly in transit to Cuba from Hong Kong. According to both Snowden and the journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the people to whom Snowden leaked NSA documents, Snowden could not continue his journey because U.S. authorities had cancelled his passport while he was in transit between Hong Kong and Russia. If true, it cannot be said that Snowden \u201cchose\u201d freedom in Russia.\n\nAs to Lavrov\u2019s claim that Snowden was threatened with the \u201celectric chair,\u201d i.e. capital punishment, former CIA Director James Woolsey said in December 2013 that Snowden should be tried for treason and \u201changed\u201d if convicted. However, not all U.S. officials shared that view. Then, U.S Attorney General Eric Holder said that while Snowden should face penalties for the illegality of his actions, he did America a \u201cpublic service\u201d by raising a debate about domestic surveillance and privacy.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Holder issued an official letter to Alexander Konovolov, Russia\u2019s Minister of Justice, explaining the charges that had been filed against Snowden and the penalties they carry.\n\n\u201cAs you know, Mr. Snowden has been charged with theft of government property (in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 641), unauthorized communication of national defense information (in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 793(d)), and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person (in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 798(a)(3)),\u201d the letter stated.\n\nEach of the charges carried a maximum sentence of ten years.\n\n\u201cFirst, the United States would not seek the death penalty for Mr. Snowden should he return to the United States,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cThe charges he faces do not carry that possibility, and the United States would not seek the death penalty even if Mr. Snowden were charged with additional, death penalty-eligible crimes.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info talked to Snowden\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union, Ben Wizner, about the potential charges against Snowden. Wizner confirmed that these were the original charges, but said that even now it is not known whether there is an indictment, given that such an indictment could be sealed. He confirmed that Snowden never faced the death penalty, although he would face severe sentencing were he to return to the U.S. to face trial.\n\nWizner also said he was certain Snowden would face \u201clife imprisonment\u201d if he returned to the U.S. The maximum sentences on just the three known charges against him would add up to 30 years. According to Wizner, there is no precedent for the Snowden case, but the closest analog is that of Chelsea Manning, who was initially sentenced by a military court to 35 years in prison for a similar offense before her sentence was commuted. Snowden would also be unable to mount much of a defense, since he has essentially confessed to the existing charges. Wizner explained that the courts do not consider public interest in a case like Snowden\u2019s.\n\n\u200bThe facts show that Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is completely off-base when it comes to the reason for his country\u2019s rapidly deteriorating relations with the U.S. and West in recent years. He not only mixed up the order of the Snowden affair and the passage of the Magnitsky Act, but did not show familiarity with the details of both circumstances. The worsening of relations and the increasingly tough measures taken by the U.S. and its allies against Russia, mostly in the form of sanctions, are due to Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion, annexation and continued occupation of Crimea, Ukrainian territory, and what the U.S. calls \u201cRussian-controlled\u201d eastern Ukraine. The U.S. also imposed sanctions following Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as additional sanctions following the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia last year.", "lang": "en"}
