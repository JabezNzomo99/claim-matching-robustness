By the time of filing the story the post was shared by more than 450 times and more than 500 people had expressed their views in the comment box. The majority of them are criticizing Sibal.\n\nAmong others, a Facebook user \u201cSaurabh Chaudhary\u201d posted a random image of Kapil Sibal with the claim in Hindi that roughly translates to: \u201cBig Breaking: Congress\u2019 faithful slave Kapil Sibal will fight a case against TikTok ban in the Supreme Court\u201d. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nKapil Sibal is also a lawyer, so if he would have decided to challenge the government\u2019s decision in court then this would be the headlines, but we didn\u2019t found any media report supporting the claim.\n\nFurther, to get the confirmation we reached out to Kapil Sibal who told us that the claim in the viral post is false. Neither he has been approached for any such case, nor he is fighting this case.\n\nRecently, Sibal had tweeted a poetic message for the government asking them to reclaim India\u2019s territory.\n\nThe post is shared on the Facebook page \u201cI M WITH SUDHIR CHAUDHARY\u201d by a user named Saurabh Chaudhary. As per his Facebook profile, he lives in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. His timeline is full of anti-Congress posts. This Facebook page has around 37000 members.\n\nKapil Sibal is anyway not fighting any case against government decisions related to TikTok in the Supreme Court. The viral post claiming so is false.\n\nDisclaimer: One paragraph has been removed from this article as it was unnecessary to the information already provided.", "lang": "en"}
