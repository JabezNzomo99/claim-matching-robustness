The claim is false; the claim originated from a satirical website; as of April 28, 2020, there were no credible reports that the story was based on a genuine incident; the photo used in some of the misleading social media and blog posts was taken from an unrelated media report.\n\nThe claim was published here on a Malay-language blog site.\n\nThe April 14, 2020 report\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cCovid-19: Mortuary worker accidentally burned by colleague.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading report:\n\nThe first three paragraphs of the article translate to English as: \u201cA service worker at New York, Funeral & Cremation died yesterday, accidentally burned by one of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cAccording to police officials, Michael Jones, 48, decided to sleep after being exhausted working for sixteen hours straight because of too many dead bodies to handle.\n\n\u201cWhen he was asleep, another worker thought he was a body of a 52-year-old who died due to respiratory issues and moved him to the crematory.\u201d\n\nThe claim was also made on Facebook here and on Twitter here. The claim was also shared in Tamil and English here.\n\nThe claim is false; the story originated on a satirical website.\n\nThe same story was published in this April 11, 2020, article on the US-based satire website the Weekly Inquirer. The report is headlined: \u201cNEW YORK, NY: EXHAUSTED FUNERAL HOME EMPLOYEE CREMATED BY MISTAKE WHILE TAKING A NAP.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom of the webpage, a notice reads: \u201cDisclaimer: This is satire.\u201d\n\nAs of April 28, 2020, there have been no credible media or police reports detailing any accidental cremations in New York City during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe same story has also been published elsewhere in articles that claim the same incident occurred in different US states.\n\nThe Weekly Inquirer published a similar satirical article here claiming an accidental cremation occured in Louisiana. In February 2020, the claim was published in the same format under different URLs in articles that purported to report the same incident in Texas and Missouri. The story was even published in March 2017 here on a different satirical website.\n\nThe photo at the top of the satirical report, which shows people in hazmat suits removing a body, was taken from this Bloomberg article published on April 10, 2020. The image is credited to Bloomberg and Angus Mordant, a New York-based photographer.\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption in the Bloomberg report reads: \u201cMedical workers move the body of a deceased patient to a refrigerated overflow morgue outside a medical center in Brooklyn, New York on April 3.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Weekly Inquirer article (L) and the Bloomberg article (R):\n\nSnopes, a US-based fact-checking organization, also debunked the claims in 2017 here and in 2020 here.", "lang": "en"}
