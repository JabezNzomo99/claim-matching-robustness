Bush, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had warned people against voting for Donald Trump. This is partly false. George W. Bush and the now late George H.W. Bush did not endorse Donald Trump but they did not openly warn people not to vote for him.\n\nThe image has regained attention in the run-up to this year\u2019s presidential election. The post has been shared over 57,600 times since 2016 ( here ).\n\nIt reads: \u201cThink about this for a minute, for the first time in the history of the United States, all living ex-presidents have united to warn Americans: no matter what, do not vote for Trump.\u201d\n\n(George H.W. Bush, the 41st U.S. president, died in 2018, here ).\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were among the prominent Republicans that did not endorse Donald Trump ( here ).\n\nTheir non-endorsement followed the unsuccessful candidacy for the Republican nomination by Jeb Bush, son of George H.W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush ( here ).\n\nAt the time, a spokesman for H.W Bush told the Guardian that at the age of 91 he was \u201cretired from politics\u201d. A spokesman for George W. Bush also said that he did not \u201cplan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign.\u201d ( here )\n\nAs for the 2020 election, a spokesman for George W. Bush recently told The Hill here that Bush \u201cis retired from presidential politics and will not be weighing in.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama, the 44th president of the United States, has spoken out against Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential race and urged voters to choose the Democratic candidates ( here , here , here ).\n\nIn 2016, the 39th president of the United States Jimmy Carter criticized Trump for violating \u201csome of the most important moral and ethical principles on which our nation was founded\u201d and expressed his support for Hillary Clinton ( bit.ly/3gK002r ). During the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Carter also endorsed presidential candidate Joe Biden ( here ).\n\nIn 2016, 42nd president of the United States Bill Clinton urged voters to vote for his wife, Hillary Clinton ( here ). During this August\u2019s Democratic National Convention, he warned that Trump\u2019s re-election would bring \u201cblame, bully, and belittle\u201d and endorsed Joe Biden ( here ).\n\nPartly False. George W. Bush and now late George H.W. did not endorse Donald Trump but they also did not warn people not to vote for him.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
