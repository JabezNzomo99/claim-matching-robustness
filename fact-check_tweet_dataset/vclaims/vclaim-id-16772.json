(That makes up about 18% of the passenger cars it exports, a little under one in five).\n\nBut it is true that the rest of the EU sells more to us than we sell to them overall.\n\nLast year, the Office for National Statistics says that we bought about \u00a390 billion more in goods than we sold to other EU countries. At the same time, we ran a \u00a320 billion trade surplus in services, selling more than we bought. So our overall trade deficit in good and services was about \u00a370 billion overall.\n\nOn its own, the overall balance of trade doesn\u2019t tell us very much about the balance of power in Brexit negotiations. For example, it doesn\u2019t tell us about which industries our negotiators think are strategically important, or domestic priorities, or why.\n\nThere are lots of different ways to look at how much UK-EU trade is worth to each party, and what that means for who is most keen to agree on a trade deal. We\u2019ve written about this in detail here.\n\nThe European Commission gives different figures for the UK\u2019s trade with the EU, because it collects the data in a different way. It still says that the UK has a trade deficit in goods, a trade surplus in services and a trade deficit overall.", "lang": "en"}
