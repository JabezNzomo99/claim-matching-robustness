The report used net-worth calculations from Forbes magazine, which tracks the net worth of billionaires.\n\nBut selecting March 18 was a bit of cherry-picking. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had reached its peak on Feb. 19, and the market had fallen quite a bit by March 18. So, many of these billionaires were underwater on May 19. MarketWatch recalculated the numbers from Feb. 19 and came up with a much different picture.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, the top 50 billionaires lost $232 billion between the market\u2019s peak and [May 19],\u201d MarketWatch reported. \u201cIf the remaining billionaires on the Forbes list lost wealth at the same roughly 12.5% rate that the top 50 experienced, that\u2019s another $200 billion-plus wiped out.\u201d\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 index recovered all of its losses this week, so it\u2019s safe to say many billionaires have probably regained their earlier losses. Some, such as Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, have done extremely well. Forbes says Bezos\u2019s net worth as of Aug. 19 was $195 billion, as Amazon\u2019s stock gained more than 50 percent in six months. (Our colleague David Lynch notes that without six stocks \u2014 all tech giants like Amazon \u2014 the S&P 500 would still be negative for the year.)\n\n\u201cAmerican workers need a fighter more than ever and Joe Biden is that person because he has done it before and I\u2019ve seen it firsthand. He and President Obama made it easier for home-care workers to organize. They extended overtime pay to more than 4 million workers.\u201d\n\nOvertime regulations written by the Labor Department during the Obama administration would have extended overtime pay to an estimated 4 million workers in 2016. The overtime rule would have required employers to pay time-and-a-half to employees who clocked more than 40 hours a week and earned less than $47,476 a year.\n\nBut the new regulations never kicked in, so the 4 million figure only ever existed on paper. A federal judge in Texas who was nominated by Obama ruled in late 2016 to block the overtime rule, days before it was set to take effect. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision by the court,\u201d the Labor Department said at the time.", "lang": "en"}
