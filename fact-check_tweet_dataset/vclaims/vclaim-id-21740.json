Republicans were in control of the House from 1995 to 2007 and of the Senate from 2015 to present.\n\nIn 2005, Rolling Stone named Sanders the \"amendment king\" of the House. At the time, the title held true with a specific qualification: amendments agreed to by record votes. (Amendments can also be passed with voice votes, in which the volume of yeas and nays dictates passage, or by unanimous consent, in which no one raises an objection.)\n\nOut of 419 amendments Sanders sponsored over his 25 years in Congress, 90 passed, 21 of them by roll call votes. Here\u2019s a breakdown (bold indicates Republican Congresses):\n\nFrom 1995 to 2007, Sanders passed 17 amendments by a recorded roll call vote \u2014 more than any other member in the House.\n\nOhio Democrat James Traficant came in second with 16 roll call amendments, but he served five less years than Sanders after being indicted on several corruption charges in 2002 and then expelled from Congress. If we look at all amendments, not just those passed by roll call votes, Traficant passed 72 more than Sanders.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Chris Smith, who served in the same time period as Sanders, finished third with 14 roll call amendments (and 32 overall amendments).\n\nCraig Volden, an expert on the legislative process at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that records like these are rather unusual in the House.\n\n\"There are so few members with large numbers of substantive and successful amendments,\" he said. \"Sanders and Traficant were exceptions to that rule.\"\n\nIn comparison, Hillary Clinton passed zero roll call amendments during her tenure as a senator from New York from 2001-09.\n\nIn the current Congress, Sanders ranks fourth when it comes to the number of career roll call amendments passed, according GovTrack founder, Josh Tauberer. The three lawmakers who top him are Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., with 27 in 15 years in Congress; Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., with 24 in 33 years; and Rep Steve King, R-Iowa, with 22 in 13 years.\n\nRoll call amendments aside, Sanders isn\u2019t shattering any legislative records, though he\u2019s not doing poorly either. Tauberer\u2019s research places Sanders at No. 14 in Congress with 90 amendments. The other senator from Vermont, Democrat Patrick Leahy, on the other hand, has passed 226.\n\nOf course, amendments are just one of the ways lawmakers press their agendas. Sanders has had much less luck with passing bills.\n\nDuring his 25 years in Congress, Sanders introduced 324 bills, three of which became law. This includes a bill in a Republican Congress naming a post office in Vermont and two more while Democrats had control (one naming another Vermont post office and another increasing veterans\u2019 disability compensation). Clinton, for the record, also passed three bills in eight years.\n\nBut the sparse number of bills isn\u2019t surprising. Volden and Vanderbilt University\u2019s Alan Wiseman assess the legislative effectiveness of House members by comparing their records to a benchmark. According to this analysis, Sanders has either met or exceeded expectations during his tenure in the House (bold indicates Republican Congresses):\n\nLawmakers who belong to the party in control are five times more likely to have their bills go anywhere than minority party members, according to Volden. So Sanders\u2019 legislative approach may seem like fixating on small potatoes, but for an independent who caucuses with the minority party, it\u2019s a smart strategy.\n\n\"He could have either resigned himself to that fate, changed the nature of his legislation and coalition-building strategy, or offered amendments on the floor,\" Volden said. \"He chose the third of these paths, making him more influential in shaping policy than if he had taken the first path. Why he did not take the second path is an open question \u2014 likely linked to his ideological views.\"\n\nA campaign ad for Sander said, \"Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a very specific way of slicing and dicing Sanders\u2019 effectiveness as a lawmaker, but it\u2019s accurate. From 1995 to 2007, when Republicans controlled Congress, Sanders passed the most roll call amendments (17) out of anyone in the House of Representatives.", "lang": "en"}
