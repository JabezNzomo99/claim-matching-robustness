Then, on Sept. 19, CNN reported that the U.S. government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump\u2019s supporters claimed he was vindicated (#TrumpVindicated trended on Twitter), and several readers asked us to revisit our Four Pinocchio rating.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s briefly revisit the White House\u2019s explanations for Trump\u2019s March 2017 tweets. (Read our full fact check for more.) Officials provided five articles, and only one reported that a foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court order was granted in October to examine possible activity between two Russian banks and a computer server in the Trump Tower.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election,\u201d Spicer said in March 2017. \u201cThe president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\u201d\n\nJames Clapper, the director of national intelligence under Obama, said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d following Trump\u2019s tweets that he would have known about a \u201cFISA court order on something like this. Absolutely, I can deny it.\u201d\n\nThen-FBI Director James Comey said in a congressional testimony after Trump\u2019s tweets that neither his agency nor the Justice Department had evidence to support the president\u2019s allegations. In a court filing in early September 2017, Trump\u2019s own Justice Department and the FBI again said they did not have evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims.\n\nCNN reported that there was a FISA court order for surveillance of Manafort, relating to the FBI\u2019s investigation of him over potential ties to Ukrainian politics. The FBI investigation began in 2014, sources told CNN. This surveillance was extended at least into early 2017, possibly to include an investigation into Manafort\u2019s role in the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cSome of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nAn important note: In order to obtain FISA authority to conduct surveillance inside the United States, an FBI agent would need to prove the case to a federal judge. It requires the approval and review of the courts \u2014 not the president or the White House. (Our colleague Ellen Nakashima explained this here.)\n\nHowever, the Wall Street Journal reported that Manafort was placed under surveillance after he left the Trump campaign in the summer 2016, and that the surveillance did not involve listening to Manafort\u2019s phone conversations in real-time. So that means Trump\u2019s conversation would not have gotten picked up by any investigator real-time.\n\nPerhaps it was a Trumpian, inarticulate way of claiming that he learned in March 2017 that the U.S. government had wiretapped his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and that it may have been in Manafort\u2019s residence in Trump Tower. But that\u2019s questionable, since the White House so thoroughly failed at providing any proof to back up Trump\u2019s claim at the time.", "lang": "en"}
