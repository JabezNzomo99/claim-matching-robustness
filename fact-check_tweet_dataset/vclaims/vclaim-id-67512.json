Leah Vukmir vs. Democratic incumbent Jim Sullivan.\n\n \n\n Going door to door, Vukmir distributes a flier that says she will work to improve the economy, attract more jobs and cut taxes. In it, she also laments the current tax burden in the state, saying that in 2009, the Legislature \"passed more than $5 billion in tax increases.\"\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve been here before.\n\n \n\n And though the Legislature did raise taxes -- and fees -- quite a bit in 2009, the total wasn\u2019t anywhere near $5 billion.\n\n \n\n Our research was done after Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, made almost the identical claim. We found that taxes and fees were upped by $3.14 billion in 2009. Consequently, we gave Kleefisch\u2019s statement a False rating.\n\n \n\n To try to get closer to $5 billion, Vukmir\u2019s campaign includes -- as Kleefisch did -- a$1.5 billion boost in net property taxes. But we\u2019ll repeat what we said in the Kleefisch claim: Property tax levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not by the Legislature.\n\n \n\n And we\u2019ll give Vukmir\u2019s claim the same rating: False.", "lang": "en"}
