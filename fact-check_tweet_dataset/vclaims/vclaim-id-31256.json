Netizens claim that the woman got agitated after the priest said fat women won\u2019t go to heaven.\n\nSeveral Facebook pages such as \"Is it funny or offensive\" and \"Fobs be like\" have posted an article by Indiatimes.com with the headline \"Priest Says Fat Women Won\u2019t Go To Heaven, Woman Knocks Him Off The Stage\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading claim. The woman did push the priest off the stage in July this year in Brazil\u2019s Cachoeira Paulista in front of approximately 50,000 people. But the priest never said that fat women won\u2019t go to heaven.\n\nThe viral post has been shared by many on Facebook.\n\nSeveral Twitter users have also shared this post. In fact, this video is viral on social media since July 2019.\n\nIn the seven-second video clip, a woman suddenly appears and pushes off the priest from the stage. It is, however, not clear what the priest says just before the incident.\n\nThis incident was widely reported in international media as well.\n\nAccording to these reports, the incident took place during a Sunday Mass in Cachoeira Paulista, a city in southeast Brazil. Padre Marcelo Rossi, a widely popular preacher in the country, was addressing a crowd of around 50,000 people, when a woman suddenly ran on stage and shoved him down.\n\nThe entire incident with the priest\u2019s sermon can be seen in the longer video uploaded by Portal UAI on July 14, 2019.\n\nInternational Fact Check website \"Snopes\" had spoken to a local journalist and got a translation of Rossi\u2019s speech just before he was being pushed off from the stage.\n\nThe translation goes, These hands no longer belong to me. Sinners, weak, but these hands belong to Jesus, so much that the priest already acts in the person of Christ. To serve, to bless\n\nIt is, however, not clear why the woman knocked Rossi off the stage. As per several media outlets such as the Portugese website \"O Dia\", the 32-year-old woman was initially detained by police, but later released as Rossi did not press any charges against her.\n\nAs per these news reports, the lady was undergoing psychiatric treatment. It was also reported that the woman said the incident was between him and me when asked by police why she pushed the priest.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the woman did push the priest off the stage, the claim that he said fat women won\u2019t go to heaven is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
