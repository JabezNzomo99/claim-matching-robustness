The claim is false; the WHO confirmed COVID-19 is an abbreviation of \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d and said that geographical locations are not included when naming diseases to avoid stigmatisation.\n\nThe claim was made on Twitter here on February 12, 2020. \"#COVID19 stands for China Outbreak Virus in December 19,\" the tweet reads.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nSimilar claims were also shared on Twitter here, here and here; on Instagram here, here and here; on Reddit here; on Facebook here; and on Weibo here.\n\nThe claim is false; the WHO announced that COVID-19, which has now killed at least 1,300 and infected nearly 60,000 in China, stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019.\u201d\n\n\"We now have a name for the disease and it is COVID-19. And I will spell it, C-O-V-I-D-hyphen-one-nine,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on February 12, 2020. \u201c\u2018CO\u2019, C-O, stands for corona, \u2018VI\u2019 stands for virus, \u2018D\u2019 for disease, so \u2018COVID\u2019.\u201d\n\nTedros added that the WHO chose a name \"that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or a group of people, and which is also pronunciable and related to the disease.\"\n\n\u201cHaving a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreak,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO also tweeted the new name for the disease in this February 12 post: \u201cWe now have a name for the #2019nCoV disease: COVID-19. I\u2019ll spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine \u2013 COVID-19\" - @DrTedros #COVID19\u201d.\n\nAccording to WHO guidelines on \u201cBest Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Disease,\u201d geographical locations, people's names, species/class of animal or food, cultural, population, industry or occupational references and terms that incite fear should be avoided.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the guidelines:", "lang": "en"}
