The message claims that the women can repay the loan over 30 years with 0% interest.\n\nThe post also contains a link that redirects people to a website to avail the scheme.\n\nWe fact-checked this claim and found it to be fake.\n\nIn our investigation, we discovered the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the post is false and untrue. The government has not declared any such offer under the Pradhan Mantri Dhan Lakshmi Yojana yet.\n\n\n\n We checked the link and found that the website holds on authentic government essentials. It should also be noted that the URL does not have a gov.in or nic.in domain, which all government-run websites have.\n\nThe website also asks people to share discrete information of their Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and Bank account passbook to register for being a beneficiary of the claimed offer. We would request our users to be cautious with such fake websites.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
