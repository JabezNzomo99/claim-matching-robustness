Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, could open the door to private business owners declining on religious grounds to serve people they believe are gay, bisexual or transgender.\n\nMcKoon and Teasley have said they did not intend to target the gay community, but their bills were pulled into the political firestorm over a religious freedom bill passed in Arizona and vetoed Wednesday by that state\u2019s governor, Jan Brewer. Major corporations that lined up against the Arizona measure voiced similar concerns about the bills by McKoon and Teasley, both of which have been given slim chances of passage heading into the final days of the General Assembly session.\n\nMcKoon was selling his bill, in part, by capitalizing on the backlash against the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nHe told reporters Monday that SB 377 would be \"another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing.\"\n\nOthers dispute McKoon\u2019s assessment. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look.\n\nMcKoon said one of his intentions was to help Catholic institutions that, under the ACA, could be expected to provide services they normally find objectionable, such as making available abortion-inducing medications.\n\n\"At minimum, I would like for those institutions to have the potential to have the religious-liberty test that this law would give them,\" said McKoon, an attorney who has served in the General Assembly since 2011.\n\nSeveral experts we checked with said they can\u2019t see McKoon\u2019s bill having the stated effect.\n\n\"What I am given to understand is that state law that tries to alter federal law, such as the Affordable Care Act, is superseded by that federal law and ignored,\" said William S. Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University.\n\nChad Brock, a staff attorney at ACLU Georgia, and Robert A. Schapiro, the dean of Emory University\u2019s School of Law, generally agreed.\n\n\"How can an organization use state law to exempt itself from a federal mandate?\" Brock said.\n\nCuster said \"the ACA specifically states that federal subsidies do not pay for abortion services, so that\u2019s a moot point.\"\n\nOn March 24, 2010, President Barack Obama signed an executive order declaring that federal funds would not be used for abortion services, except in the case of rape, incest or a woman\u2019s life safety, in accordance with long-standing restrictions commonly known as the Hyde Amendment.\n\nThat\u2019s not slowed the rumors or their spins through the Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Some individuals may have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges, but they won\u2019t be forced to buy it.\n\nSome states have passed laws banning abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on their state exchanges. Georgia has not.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday, McKoon acknowledged that his religious freedoms bill, if challenged legally, might not be able to stave off ACA requirements. But he said the bill would address what he perceives is a bigger issue -- an attack on religious freedom.\n\nMcKoon pointed out that the state Senate recently passed legislation to safeguard Christmas trees and holiday greetings such as \"Merry Christmas\" and \"Happy Hanukkah.\"\n\n\"That speaks to the level of fear people have to speaking their faith,\" he said.\n\nPeople of faith currently carry the burden of having to justify their practices, McKoon said.\n\nHe said he hopes his legislation would turn that on its head and require the government to show why a certain rule, regulation or policy is so important that it needs to supersede a person\u2019s religious liberty.\n\nThirty-one states have similar religious freedom laws on the books -- 18 passed by their legislatures, McKoon said.\n\nHis bill did not make the Senate calendar for Monday, the last day for most bills to clear at least one chamber with a serious chance of passing this session.\n\nMcKoon said he wants Georgia to become the latest state to have a religious freedom law on the books. But our fact check looked specifically at his comment that his bill would create a law that would serve as \"another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t see that he has made that case.", "lang": "en"}
