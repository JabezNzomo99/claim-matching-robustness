Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel said it will remain in effect until at least late September .\n\nWhen NAACP Interim President and CEO Derrick Johnson announced the organization\u2019s travel advisory, he cited statistics that depict racial disparities in Missouri.\n\n\"The numerous racist incidents, and the statistics cited by the Missouri Attorney General in the advisory, namely the fact that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than Caucasians, are unconscionable, and are simply unacceptable in a progressive society,\" Johnson said in the statement .\n\nThe advisory was issued largely in response to SB 43 , which requires employees who claim workplace discrimination prove bias is an explicit reason for being fired, rather than just a contributing factor. It was also in response to a \"series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently.\"\n\nWe wanted to look into Johnson\u2019s statement about racial disparities in Missouri. Are law enforcement officers a full 75 percent more likely to pull over and search an African American?\n\nWhen we reached out to the NAACP, communications director Malik Russell said Johnson may have gotten some of his numbers mixed up, since he didn\u2019t have the data in front of him. But he emphasized the larger point, saying the difference between the numbers that he might have mixed up is small.\n\nRussell didn\u2019t give any additional evidence, but the statement announcing the advisory cited data from the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nIn 2000, concerns from both Missouri residents and the legislature prompted the passage of a law that requires law enforcement officers collect specific information, including race, for every traffic stop. Each agency must provide this data to the attorney general, who in turn sends it to the governor.\n\nA team of researchers has been compiling this information for the attorney general since 2001.\n\nThe 2016 Vehicle Stops Report Executive Summary from the attorney general\u2019s office breaks down the data related to vehicle stops last year. There were 21 agencies that did not submit the data by the required date and 58 agencies that reported no stops out of 682 law enforcement agencies in the state.\n\nBlacks represent 10.9 percent of the driving population and 18 percent of all traffic stops, while whites represent 82.8 percent of the population and 78 percent of stops.\n\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has been on the research team since 2001.\n\nRosenfeld said the researchers divided stops made by the number of people 16 years and older in the state to come up with a \"stop rate.\" A value of one means there is no disparity, values greater than one mean there is overrepresentation, and values below one mean there is underrepresentation.\n\nThe disparity index, which is the proportion of stops divided by the proportion of the population, was 1.65 for blacks last year, overrepresenting the black population by 65 percent. Whites, on the other hand, were stopped at a .94 rate, underrepresenting the white population by 6 percent.\n\nResearchers divided 1.65 by .94 to get 1.75, or a 75 percent higher stop rate for blacks than whites. This is the number Johnson used in his statement.\n\nBut stops and searches are different things.\n\nBlacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. (Formula: 8.77 percent search rate for blacks divided by 5.57 search rate for whites = 1.57.)\n\nJohnson stated that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians.\n\nBlacks in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officers than whites, which is reflected in the attorney general data.\n\nThat\u2019s not true about searches. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. The discrepancy in searches is huge, but it\u2019s not 75 percent.", "lang": "en"}
