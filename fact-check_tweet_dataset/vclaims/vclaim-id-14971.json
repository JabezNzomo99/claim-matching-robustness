According to the FSB, the men were suspected of being members of \u201cthe terror group Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami,\u201d which is banned as an extremist group in Russia and other countries, including Turkey, Egypt and Germany, but not in Ukraine.\n\nIn reality, the article and the FSB\u2019s statements cited within contain distortions and serious omissions. First, while it is not clear if any of the men arrested were affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir, they are in fact openly activists of the Crimean Solidarity initiative, a group that helps political prisoners and documents human rights abuses committed in Crimea since Russia annexed it in 2014. The TASS article does not mention this organization and, according to Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, some of the suspects had been scrutinized and harassed by Russian law enforcement organs for public activities with this group.\n\nAccording to some of the suspects\u2019 lawyers, FSB personnel began searching homes during the raids without an official court order. They alleged the FSB appeared to plant extremist literature, possibly to be used as evidence the suspects were tied to Hizb ut-Tahrir.\n\nThe TASS article does not specify what evidence the FSB produced to support its claim that the men were affiliated with that group.\n\n\u200bLabeling Hizb ut-Tahrir a \u201cterror group\u201d is also misleading. While Russia designated the political party (whose Arabic name is translated as \u201cParty of Liberation\u201d) a terrorist organization in 2003, it has not been accused of terrorist activity in the country.\n\nThe Chatham House research paper, Transational Islam in Russia and Crimea, listed Hizb ut-Tahrir as one of those considered to be \u201cgradualist,\u201d along with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Fethullah G\u00fclen movement.\n\n\u201cThey tend to avoid violent means and instead may focus on social work, education and dialogue initiatives,\u201d wrote Anna M\u00fcnster,a fellow at the Chatham House Russia and Eurasia Programme.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not designate the group among \u201cForeign Terrorist Organizations\u201d in the latest listing on the agency\u2019s web site.\n\nNevertheless, the organization remains controversial due to the fact that its ideology is similar to that of groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State. While Hizb ut-Tahrir rejects violence, its stated goal is, like the above-mentioned groups, is to unite Muslims under a global Caliphate. This has led some law enforcement agencies to call Hizb ut-Tahrir a \u201cconveyer belt\u201d to terror groups.", "lang": "en"}
