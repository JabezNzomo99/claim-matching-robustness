Schumer (D-N.Y.), remarks on the Senate floor, Feb. 1\n\n\u201cI am coming back to the floor to correct the record about my earlier comments, when I said that Republicans \u2018insisted\u2019 on 60 votes for each of President Obama\u2019s nominees. Sixty votes is a bar that was met by each of President Obama\u2019s nominees. At the time, there was no need for a cloture vote, because we knew that each of them would garner over 60 votes.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Schumer, minutes later on the Senate floor.\n\nBut you can see, in Durbin\u2019s remarks, the slippery language that Democrats use to give the impression that achieving 60 votes is some sort of Senate \u201cstandard.\u201d Even in his amended remarks, Schumer went on to say \u201c60 votes is the right standard for this nominee.\u201d\n\nFirst, some definitions, as people often get these terms confused: A filibuster generally refers to extended debate that delays a vote on a pending matter, while cloture is a device to end debate. Filibusters are used by opponents of a nominee or legislation, while cloture is filed by supporters. Under current Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to end debate.\n\nThe last Supreme Court nominee who faced a cloture vote was Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006. He won it handily, 72-25, though the members who voted against ending debate included Schumer, Durbin, Hillary Clinton and Obama. Later, as president, Obama said he regretted his vote. (He apparently had been persuaded by aides that he would not be viable candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination if he did not vote against ending debate.)\n\nAnother key cloture vote in modern times concerned Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas, at the time an associate justice, to be chief justice. Johnson was a lame duck, having decided not to seek reelection. Although Democrats controlled the Senate, Southern Democrats were angry at the Warren court\u2019s record on jurisprudence \u2014 and the Republican presidential nominee, Richard Nixon, had pledged to nominate a Southerner as his first Supreme Court pick.\n\nNineteen senators, in fact, declared that they would refuse to accept any nomination by Johnson because he was a lame duck. The Fortas nomination eventually ran aground over ethics issues and his close relationship with Johnson, and he eventually withdrew after his nomination failed a cloture vote. At the time, Senate rules required approval of two-thirds of the Senate to end debate \u2013 and Fortas could only achieve a vote of 45 to 43.\n\nFinally, there were two cloture votes involving the late Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist. In 1971, a motion to invoke cloture failed by a vote of 52-42, but nevertheless he was confirmed later that day 68-26. When he was nominated to become chief justice in 1986, he was confirmed 65-33 after cloture was also invoked by a vote of 68-31.\n\nMatt House, Schumer\u2019s spokesman, said that \u201cwe do not maintain that it was a standard Republicans required, only that it was one that has been met by the last six justices, appointed by presidents from both parties.\u201d Although Alito failed to get 60 votes, House pointed to the cloture vote as evidence that Alito met the necessary standard.\n\nThere is a separate issue of whether Republicans will have to invoke cloture to end a filibuster \u2014 and whether Gorsuch could meet the necessary 60 votes to proceed to a confirmation vote. In Supreme Court nominations, that\u2019s a rarely used parliamentary tactic that is certainly available to Democrats to establish a threshold for confirmation. But it\u2019s not \u201ca standard.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
