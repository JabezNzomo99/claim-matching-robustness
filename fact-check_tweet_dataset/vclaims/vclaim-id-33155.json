One clip shows the president\u2019s Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C.\n\n\"Coronavirus \u2014 this is their new hoax,\" Trump is pictured saying.\n\nThe video makes it seem like Trump is calling the disease itself a hoax, which he hasn\u2019t done. The words are Trump\u2019s, but the editing is Biden\u2019s.\n\nDuring the North Charleston rally, there was nearly a minute between when Trump said \"coronavirus\" and \"hoax.\" Here is the full context of his remarks:\n\n\"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, \u2018How\u2019s President Trump doing?\u2019 They go, \u2018Oh, not good, not good.\u2019 They have no clue. They don\u2019t have any clue. They can\u2019t even count their votes in Iowa. They can\u2019t even count. No, they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t count their votes. \"One of my people came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.\u2019 That didn\u2019t work out too well. They couldn\u2019t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was not a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\"\n\nDuring a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks.\n\n\"I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,\" he said, referring to Democrats. \"That's the hoax.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and, by extension, the president\u2019s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks.\n\nBut the Biden campaign\u2019s ad is misleading. It\u2019s an example of what the Washington Post calls \"splicing,\" or \"editing together disparate videos\" that \"fundamentally alters the story that is being told.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s ad is the latest example of a deceptively edited ad on the campaign trail.\n\nOn March 7, Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, tweeted a video that appears to show Biden saying \"we can only re-elect Donald Trump.\" But the video only showed a snippet of Biden\u2019s larger speech, in which he called for Democratic unity. A similar video tweeted by Michael Bloomberg on Feb. 20 made it look like he left other Democratic presidential candidates speechless during a debate when he didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen we reached out to the Biden campaign for comment, it told us that Trump is \"the most dishonest president in American history.\"\n\n\"We don't trust his next-day clean-up attempt, and he has made many comments in that same vein,\" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, in an email.\n\nBiden\u2019s video is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
