In two other Truth-O-Meter rulings, we examined Obama's claims about his plans for small businesses and the middle class. Here, we'll address his plan for senior citizens.\n\nHe says in the ad that \"seniors making less than $50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won\u2019t pay income taxes at all.\"\n\nThat is correct.
