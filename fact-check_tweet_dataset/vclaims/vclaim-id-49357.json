It is being claimed that the video is from PM Modi\u2019s recent Ladakh visit.\n\nThe video is being shared in reference to PM Modi\u2019s surprise visit to Ladakh on July 3, 2020, in the backdrop of growing tensions between India and China following a clash between the armies of the two nations on June 15-16 at Galwan valley in Ladakh.\n\nThe caption read: \u201cPM Modi\u2019s gesture to motivate soldier\u2019s by person is practically half the battle won. He simply did what we received via legacy of our culture. Whether we go for examination, interviews or achieve anything important we are felicitated by parents, guardians the same way. See the body language of army personnels! They are surprised as well as quite excited to receive the sweet and similar guardianship by PM Modi directly. Don\u2019t you find the similarity?\n\nOn the other hand, Xi Jinping can never take or thought of such steps, that\u2019s maoists ideology. They use soldiers as robots upon instructions not Human beings. Most of the soldiers are bound to party Constitution and policy than any human bonding. Example? You must have experienced their counterpart Communists here do always claim, \u201cSoldier\u2019s join Army for Salary and Living\u201d. It\u2019s not just their political view, it\u2019s practically even a strategy to demoralize and demotivate the protective nature of defense, destroy the mental strength of our Army against their counterpart Chinese PLA. They have been doing this for so many decades so openly, the deep rooted conspiracy to support Chinese aggression at LAC and keep the Bharatiya Soldiers moral down by calling them paid employees repeatedly, kill the zeal of Supreme sacrifices with utmost humiliation. They would call you BJP IT Cell in same manner to suppress your views and humiliate you. Every identity is a political identity for them, since they would carry one party membership no. like PLA does.\n\nNow, supporting Chinese policies are in the same line. Economy to Defense to Manufacturing to Import, everything falls on the negative comparison. China always dominated UN, so instructions to CPM is loud and clear, everytime PLA would capture LAC, these Communists will come up with suggestion like Bharat to seek International court of Justice for the same. Remember, recently post #GalwanClash, CPM Politburo Secretary Suryakant Mishra had issued the same Statement.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Japan does not spray blue dye on looters and rioters; here\u2019s\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video is false as the video in question is old.\n\nWe extracted keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search along with keywords such as \u2018PM Modi\u2019, \u2018Sweets\u2019, \u2018Soldiers\u2019. The search led us to an article dated November 07, 2018 by Outlook which had featured the same picture of PM Modi offering sweets to soldiers, seemingly from the same location.\n\nThe report suggested that the picture was taken in November 2018 when PM Modi celebrated Diwali in Uttarakhand with ITBP and Army soldiers.\n\nTaking a cue from the above discovery, on digging further, we found the shorter version of the same video in a report by newswire ANI posted on their official YouTube channel on November 7, 2018.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information establishes that the video in question is old and is from Uttarakhand. It is nowhere connected to PM Modi\u2019s recent visit to Ladakh where he interacted with soldiers.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
