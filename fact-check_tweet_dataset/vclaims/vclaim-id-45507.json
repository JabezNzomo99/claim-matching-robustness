The video shows former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee planted on Floyd\u2019s neck until Floyd lost consciousness.\n\n \n\n \n\n The Twitter account that posted the above message was removed by Twitter, but not before the tweet went viral, even getting picked up by the right-leaning RedState blog and causing panic. A Twitter spokesperson told NBC News that the tweet was a hoax perpetrated by Identity Evropa, a white supremacist organization (hence the \u201cIE\u201d in the account\u2019s logo.)\n\nThe Twitter account was created in May 2020, and an archived version of the account indicates the only tweets posted to it were on or around May 31, 2020, and seemed geared toward inflaming as much as possible. \u201cUnfollow if you\u2019re not in the streets destroying the system,\u201d one tweet read. Another stated, \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you, Fascists, America is ours.\u201d\n\nAlthough the hoax perpetrators portrayed the account as belonging to a national-level, antifa group, anti-fascist activists don\u2019t have any such overarching umbrella organization. As The New York Times reported:\n\nIt is impossible to know how many people count themselves as members. Its followers acknowledge that the movement is secretive, has no official leaders and is organized into autonomous local cells. It is also only one in a constellation of activist movements that have come together in the past few years to oppose the far right.\n\nBecause the account that tweeted the message was a hoax and was created by white supremacists to incite chaos and potentially violence amid an ongoing civil rights issue, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
