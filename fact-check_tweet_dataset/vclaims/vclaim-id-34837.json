The UK Statistics Authority also wrote to the Department for Education last year saying that use of these figures \u201cdoes not give the full picture\u201d. And recent evidence from Ofsted gives us even more reason to be sceptical of it.\n\nThe figure doesn\u2019t account for rising pupil numbers\u2014there were 630,000 more pupils in state-funded schools in England in 2018 compared to 2010\u2014or changes to inspection practices in that time.\n\nA key issue is that schools rated by Ofsted as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d are less likely to be re-inspected; schools rated outstanding are also usually exempt from routine inspections.\n\nWhen this claim was made in 2018, analysis by the Education Policy Institute found that, for this reason, 580,000 pupils were in schools that hadn\u2019t even been inspected since 2010. We had no way of knowing whether their rating would have stayed the same if they were re-inspected.\n\nBut in recent months, Ofsted has \u201csubstantially increased\u201d the number of exempt outstanding schools it inspects. It announced last week (shortly after our last article about the 1.9 million claim) that it had inspected 305 \u201coutstanding\u201d schools between September 2018 and March 2019.\n\nThey found only 16% (49) kept their outstanding rating, much lower than the proportion the previous year. 30% dropped in their rating by more than one level, to either \u201crequire improvement\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean only 16% of all outstanding schools would still have that rating today if more were re-inspected. Ofsted makes clear that \u201cmost of these inspections are carried out because the school\u2019s performance appears to be declining\u201d so \u201cit is not surprising for a large proportion to lose the top grading. The schools inspected are not typical of all outstanding schools.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in response to these findings Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said that it should \u201cset alarm bells ringing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that outstanding schools are largely exempt from inspection leaves us with real gaps in our knowledge about the quality of education and safeguarding in these schools. Some of them have not been inspected for over a decade, and when our inspectors go back in, they sometimes find standards have significantly declined.\u201d\n\nPreviously, before this evidence was published, we\u2019ve warned that the 1.9 million claim is misleading. In light of Ofsted\u2019s findings, we\u2019d go further: it\u2019s simply unjustifiable for politicians to still be using this figure as evidence of improved standards.", "lang": "en"}
