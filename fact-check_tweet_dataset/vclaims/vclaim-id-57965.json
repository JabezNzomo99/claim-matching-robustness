However, some of the other accompanying details in this meme are not quite accurate.\n\nFulgencio Batista was the military dictator of Cuba from 1952 until the end of 1958, when he was overthrown by forces led by Castro and his allies during the Cuban Revolution. This photograph does not depict a \u201cfarmer [who] refused to work for the Castro regime,\u201d but rather a member of Batista\u2019s army who had been charged as a war criminal by the victorious revolutionaries a few weeks after they finally ousted Batista.\n\nThe UPI caption for this picture read as follows: \u201cFather Domingo Lorenzo performs last rites for Cuban Army Cpl. Jose Cipriano Rodriguez on Jan. 17, 1959. Rodriguez, who had served in Fulgencio Batista\u2019s army, was executed by firing squad after being found guilty for the deaths of two brothers. His tribunal lasted just one minute.\u201d\n\nA UPI account of the circumstances behind the photograph, which was published in May 1960 when Lopez was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stated that Rodriguez\u2019s trial lasted two hours rather than four minutes (although deliberations afterwards lasted only a minute), and it made no mention of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, a Castro lieutenant, being personally involved in the case (although Guevara reviewed the appeals and firing squad sentences of those convicted as war criminals in post-revolutionary Cuba):\n\nAndrew Lopez, veteran United Press International photographer, felt like crying when he took his Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs of a Cuban war criminal kneeling before a priest, with an impatient firing squad watching. Lopez was awarded the prize for a series of four photographs of Cpl. Jose (Pepe Caliente) Rodriguez preparing to die. \u201cWhen you have a man kneeling, being given spiritual consolation by a priest who is holding a cross in his hand as the victim presses forward to kiss it, there\u2019s no question,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt was packed with emotion. I felt like crying myself,\u201d he said. Rodriguez was sentenced Jan. 17, 1959, after a two-hour trial in San Severino fortress near Matanzas, Cuba. The tribunal conferred for one minute before finding him guilty, Lopez said. Rodriguez was marched from the trial room and taken down a flight of stairs to the courtyard. \u201cWhen I saw him marching down the stairs I went in front of him and into this huge, open air, dungeon-like area,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI started to make pictures. \u201cWhen Pepe Caliente fell to his knees as a priest held up a cross for him to kiss, the scene was one that will be hard to forget. I honestly felt like crying \u2026 \u201cWhile all this was going on, the firing squad in the background impatiently was waiting for this scene to end so they could perform their duty.\u201d The condemned man received a 24-hour stay just before sentence was to be carried out, but he was shot the next day.", "lang": "en"}
