Local news outlet Florida Today reported that officers found a duffel bag containing 15 kilos of cocaine worth about $300,000:\n\nCocoa Beach police are asking beachcombers in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian to be cautious about suspicious packages after a duffel bag stuffed with 15 kilos of cocaine washed ashore over. The find \u2014 worth at least $300,000 \u2014 came before Dorian\u2019s violent stirrings in the Atlantic led to a single brick of cocaine being found along a beach in Melbourne. \u201cThere is a possibility that more will come onshore. Especially now with these conditions. It could be coming from anywhere,\u201d said Manny Hernandez, spokesman for the Cocoa Beach Police Department. \u201cWe\u2019re telling people to be cautious and not to grab or handle it because if there is an opening, it can go into your pores and you can overdose,\u201d he said.\n\nCocoa Beach Police Sgt. Manny Hernandez told us that this duffel bag of cocaine was found \u201cpre-Hurricane Dorian\u201d on Aug. 30, 2019. It\u2019s unclear if these two packages were connected. However, as some of the cocaine washed ashore prior to the hurricane, we\u2019ve marked this article as \u201cMostly True.\u201d\n\nHere are the facts regarding the cocaine that washed up in Cocoa Beach (Pre-hurricane Dorian): On Friday, August 30, 2019 (pre-hurricane Dorian) at approximately 17:16 (5:16pm), Cocoa Beach Police responded to the Beach End of S. 6th St, Cocoa Beach, FL., in reference to a suspicious package that washed up on shore. The red, travel style duffle bag, was noticed by a beach goer who immediately contacted the police department as the bag appeared suspicious. Responding officers believed the duffle bag contained illegal substance and properly removed it from the beach and transported the bag to the Cocoa Beach Police Department. Upon further inspection, the bag contained 15 small \u201cbricks\u201d that were tightly packaged. However, it was believed the packages may contain an unknown narcotic, possibly cocaine. Cocoa Beach Police contacted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and notified them of the suspicious bag and contents. A representative/Agent with the agency responded to the Cocoa Beach Police Department the same evening. U.S. Custom and Border Protection Agent inspected the packages and after removing several layers off one of the \u201cBricks\u201d, the Agent informed the substance to be cocaine. It is unknown who the duffle bags belongs to and unknown where the cocaine is from. There were no further incidents involving the duffle bag. The bag and the 15 \u201cBricks\u201d (1 Kilo per brick) was turned over to U.S Custom & Border Protection Agent. The street value in the central Florida area is approximately $20K \u2013 $30K per \u201cBrick\u201d (Kilo).\n\nWhile these news reports may seem unusual, these incidents were not the first time drugs had washed ashore in Florida. In 2016, law enforcement recovered 20 kilos of cocaine worth about $600,000 near Jupiter Island in Martin County. A similar discovery was made the following year near Melbourne Beach.", "lang": "en"}
