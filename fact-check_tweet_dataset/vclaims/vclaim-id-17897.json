This is part of politicking in our country,\u201d adding: \u201cWe do not outsource this job.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s claim is likely false. A newly-established firm owned by a 22-year-old university undergraduate with no apparent previous business experience won three contracts worth 36 million rubles (nearly $520,000) with the Kremlin since October without competition and is reportedly linked to Prigozhin.\n\nPrigozhin himself, as well as 13 of his employees and five firms, including the Internet Research Agency (aka the \u201ctroll factory\u201d), Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering, are facing criminal prosecution in the United States on charges of \u201cconspiring to defraud the U.S. by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral process.\u201d\n\nPutin brushed off the charges against Prigozhin during a press conference in Helsinki this past July following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, a Polygraph.info fact check found Putin\u2019s claims to be false.\n\nPrigozhin is also reportedly linked to the Russian private military company \"Wagner,\" whose activities Putin falsely claimed were legal under Russian law.\n\nRegarding the claim that the Kremlin does not \u201coutsource\u201d the job of providing catering services and grocery supplies, Putin did not provide details, but this claim appears to be inaccurate.\n\nIn the four years between 2013 and 2017, Prigozhin\u2019s firms under the \u201cConcord\u201d trademark, which have no apparent official ties with the Federal Guard Service, received 176 contracts for catering services and grocery supplies worth 359 million of rubles (more than $5 million) with the Russian presidential administration and \u201cKombinat Pitaniya Kremlyovsky\u201d \u2013 the Kremlin\u2019s kitchen.\n\nOn December 27, the Russian independent news agency RBC reported that for the first time in many years Prigozhin\u2019s company Concord will not be catering the presidential New Year's party, and that the contract instead went to the newly-created firm MSK Ltd.\n\nAccording to Russian tax authorities\u2019 data, MSK Ltd is registered in Moscow at 4/1 Teterinsky pereulok, office 2/214. Another 50 companies are registered at the same address, 38 of them active, 12 inactive.\n\nMSK Ltd, which was created on May 3, 2018 with 30K rubles (around $433) of declared capital to conduct \u201cceremonial events catering services,\" lists as its CEO and sole owner Danil Vitalyevich Aksutin \u2013 a name linked to no previous business activities.\n\nYet, this new company run by a business neophyte won, without competition, three direct contracts with the Kremlin during the first seven months of its existence: 20 million rubles (around $288,000) on October 16, 2.6 million rubles (around $37,490) on December 17 and 13.1 million rubles (around $188,870) on December 19. All the contracts were for catering services for presidential parties and supplying the Kremlin\u2019s kitchen.\n\nAs for MSK Ltd ties with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the BBC\u2019s Russian service reported that Danil Aksutin, listed as the sole owner and CEO of the company, is a 22-year-old undergraduate at the Moscow Technology University, who, before becoming a Kremlin contractor, sold fake designer handbags on the internet. BBC reporters also established that MSK Ltd\u2019s backup email address was connected to the Concord-moscow.ru server, and that the two companies had the same phone number in their contact information.", "lang": "en"}
