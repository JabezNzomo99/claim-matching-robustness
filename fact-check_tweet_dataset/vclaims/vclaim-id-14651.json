No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on December 5, 2018 titled \"Boston man sues Dyson for $2.3 million after being partially emasculated by vacuum cleaner\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA Boston man is suing Dyson for $2.3 million after he was left partially emasculated from inserting his penis into a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Matthew Blair, 47, was transported to the Boston Medical Center last month where he necessitated a 96-hour-long surgical procedure costing him $1,260,000 in medical fees with no insurance. Surgeons were forced to remove one of Blair's testicles as well as the top section of his penis, requiring 37 stitches and leaving him practically impotent because of his inability to maintain an erection more than several seconds.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and if they didn't click through and scroll all the way down to the disclaimer they would not have known it was not real news:\n\nThe man in the picture illustrating the story did not sue a vacuum cleaner company, he was actually found guilty of a murder in 2014:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nThe Dyson story echoes an earlier hoax from the site that went viral which involved another big name brand, a big-dollar lawsuit and the use of an everyday object for sexual gratification:\n\nThe site is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
