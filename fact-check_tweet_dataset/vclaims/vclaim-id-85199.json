He subsequently clarified the statement to say that he misspoke, and that his comments were limited to the \u201chard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThe constituent question that prompted his Aug. 25 statement related to his earlier comments and went, in part: \u201cMy question for you today is in light of a recent quote with regard to funding levels for women in health care. I\u2019m wondering about your position on increased funding for the women\u2019s programs within the Department of Veteran Affairs.\u201d\n\nBush answered that funding should be given to expand women\u2019s health services through community-based organizations. He then said that Planned Parenthood should not be given any federal funding because the organization is not \u201cactually doing women\u2019s health issues.\u201d\n\nAs we recently wrote, it is difficult to accurately discern how much of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services comprise abortions. (The organization earned Three Pinocchios for its claim that abortions are just 3 percent of its services.) Planned Parenthood has a broad definition for \u201cservices\u201d (\u201cdiscrete clinical interaction\u201d). Regardless, Planned Parenthood clearly provides an array of women\u2019s health services, including Pap tests, female sterilization, contraception and urinary tract infection treatments.\n\nA long-standing legal restriction bans federal funds from paying for any elective abortions, which are for pregnancies that are not caused by rape, incest or that threaten the mother\u2019s health. So even if Bush opposes Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion practices, pulling federal money would not necessarily affect how Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortions are funded.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign criticized his statement via Twitter after the town hall, citing statistics from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report. The Bush campaign\u2019s response linked to an article from a right-leaning Web site showing a map of health clinics that could absorb Planned Parenthood\u2019s services if the organization no longer receives federal funding. He also called Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201ctreatment of unborn\u201d as \u201chorrifying,\u201d referring to abortions and the recent controversy over the fetal tissue donations, exposed in a series of covert videos filmed by an anti-abortion group.\n\nA March 2013 George Washington University study found that virtually all community health centers provide family planning services, at least at the most basic level. Researchers also found that centers varied widely on the scope of care and approach to how family planning and women\u2019s health services were provided. Most health centers have referral arrangements with other hospitals and organizations, including Planned Parenthood, for women\u2019s health and family planning services.\n\nWhether all of Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients can be absorbed by alternative care providers and community health centers remains in question. Those pushing for stopping federal funds for the organization say there are plenty of community health centers that can fill the gap, with increased funding set to be made available by 2019 through the Affordable Care Act. But others \u2014 including some Republicans in Congress \u2014 have questioned whether that truly is the case, especially for women in remote areas and considering the shortage of providers.\n\nA 2012 case study by GWU researchers found that after Texas stopped funding abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, the average women\u2019s health service caseload for community clinics increased by 81 percent. The study had found that some clinics would have to double to quintuple their caseloads to fully absorb patients that were served by Planned Parenthood in their areas in 2011. Proponents of Planned Parenthood point to this study to show that Planned Parenthood is a dominant source of women\u2019s health service in some areas. Opponents point to it to show the number of abortions and unplanned births dropped as a result.\n\n\u201cGov. Bush is a strong advocate for women\u2019s health care, many of the basics of women\u2019s health care are not provided by Planned Parenthood,\u201d a campaign spokeswoman said, declining to be identified. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is, however, the largest abortion provider in the country and their disturbing practices that have been publicized recently have nothing to do with women\u2019s health. As those videos show, Planned Parenthood needs to be investigated, not subsidized. Gov. Bush believes federal money should go to the many organizations that are promoting women\u2019s health care first, not promoting abortion.\u201d\n\nWe recognize that Bush spoke off-the-cuff during the town hall event. But his statement, that Planned Parenthood is \u201cnot actually doing women\u2019s health issues,\u201d is patently incorrect. (It would have made a difference if he had said Planned Parenthood \u201cwas not only doing women\u2019s health issues,\u201d in an effort to focus on the organization\u2019s abortion services.)\n\nIf he is making a point that abortions (and related, fetal tissue donation) are the majority of services Planned Parenthood provides, that is a problematic and unsupported claim. The Twitter response by Bush\u2019s campaign appeared to make a point that federal funding from Planned Parenthood should be pulled because community organizations can absorb Planned Parenthood\u2019s services. That is one of the main arguments that are made for defunding Planned Parenthood, but there are data that both support and refute that point.", "lang": "en"}
