Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a Hindu boy stabbed and killed by Muslims in Andhra Pradesh. Fact: The incident in the video took place in Hyderabad (Telangana), not in Andhra Pradesh. The boy in the video is Mohammed Imran Khan. The Police suspect that he was killed over a family dispute. The accused in the case are Imran\u2019s half-brothers and their associates. There is no communal angle to the incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a similar video was found in the search results. In the description of the video, it was written that the incident happened in Hyderabad (Telangana) and the name of the boy is Imran Khan. So, when searched with the keywords, many videos related to the incident were found. Talking to media, Imran\u2019s brother accused the stepbrother (son of their father\u2019s other wife) Mehtab and his associates behind the murder. The videos can be watched here and here.\n\nThe news articles regarding the incident can be read here and here. In the \u2018Telangana Today\u2019 article, it can be read that the accused in the case are Mehtab Taleb, Arbaz, Amir and Ghouse. Talking to media, Chakravarthy Gummi (Additional DCP (Task Force)) said, \u2018After the death of Ghalib Khan (father), the elder son of Habeebunnisa got a government job on compassionate grounds and she had reportedly retained the property also. Ruksana, the second wife, developed a grudge as she felt that she did not get an equal share in the property of her husband or other benefits. Therefore, Ruksana\u2019s sons, Taleb, Ghouse and Mehtab, planned to kill Imran, Habeebunnisa\u2019s son\u2019. Talking to FACTLY, the Rein Bazar SHO has also clarified that the claim made in the post is not true and that the victim & accused both are Muslims. He also mentioned that family disputes could be the reason for the crime. The FIR filed in this case by the Rein Bazar police can be seen here.\n\nTo sum it up, the boy in this video is not a Hindu and the incident happened in Hyderabad.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
