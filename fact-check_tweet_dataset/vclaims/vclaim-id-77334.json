Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea\u2019s latest actions were \"something to really be concerned about.\"\n\nBurr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il.\n\n\"When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he\u2019s crazy,\" Burr said of Kim Jong Un. \"The pace of missile development between his father\u2019s term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold.\"\n\nThere has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country\u2019s missile launch lately \u2013 including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction.\n\nSo in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right.\n\nSpecifically, we looked into his claim that \"the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold.\"\n\nIn terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world\u2019s largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India.\n\nKim Jong Il wasn\u2019t hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim.\n\nBurr\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don\u2019t have at our own disposal. He\u2019s the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies.\n\nBut we don\u2019t think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct.\n\nWe interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr\u2019s claim \u2013 especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it\u2019s harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected.\n\n\"Perhaps saying the \u2018pace of missile development\u2019 is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un,\" said Jean H. Lee.\n\nLee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States.\n\n\"With every test, they get closer to mastering that technology,\" she said.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any report from the Department of Defense that might vouch for Burr\u2019s numbers. But we did find a February speech by Admiral Harry Harris, the head of the DoD\u2019s Pacific Command. He spoke about North Korea\u2019s \"aggressive weapons test schedule\" and a growing missile threat in the Pacific, which is in keeping with the general theme of Burr\u2019s claim.\n\nThe North Korea experts we interviewed all said something like Lee\u2019s assessment: That Burr is correct to say Kim Jong Un put a greater focus on missiles, even if it\u2019s hard to define how much.\n\n\"The range of their missiles is being extended,\" said T.J. Pempel, a University of California, Berkeley, political science professor who specializes in northeast Asia. \"They have substantial submarine launched missiles; they have ICBMs. The frequency and number of their tests is also going up.\"\n\nJoseph Bermudez, an expert with the North Korea analysis group 38 North who has testified before Congress and the United Nations on the country\u2019s missiles, said Burr is right about the increased pace of testing.\n\nOne of Bermudez\u2019s colleagues at 38 North put together a timeline of missile tests by North Korea, along with an assessment that nearly backs up Burr\u2019s point \u2013 at least about testing, if not about development. It said North Korea tested only one missile in 2006 (under Kim Jong Il) but tested 15 in 2014 (under Kim Jong Un).\n\nIn 2016, the DoD\u2019s annual report to Congress made a similar point.\n\n\"Kim Jong Un seems to prioritize the development of new weapons systems, as demonstrated by his numerous appearances with military units and research and development organizations,\" the report read.\n\nBut Bermudez said Burr\u2019s not necessarily right to say an increase in testing equates to breakthroughs in development.\n\nEvery missile program requires research and development, testing, training, tweaking and more testing. It\u2019s not a fluid timeline, Bermudez said. There are spikes in activity surrounded by relatively dormant periods.\n\n\"Now if you have multiple missile programs going on, these cycles overlap,\" he said. \"... It might give the false impression that something is happening that isn't happening.\"\n\nFurthermore, he said, many North Korean missile tests are conducted for political reasons, intended to send a message instead of to further research and development.\n\nThat\u2019s another factor making it difficult to tell if the pace of development has driven the increase in the pace of testing, as Burr had claimed.\n\nSen. Richard Burr said that in North Korea, \"the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold.\"\n\nExperts say missile testing has certainly increased, and at least one analysis shows that increase was close to what Burr said.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is if the increased testing has gone hand-in-hand with increased development, or if the tests aren\u2019t moving the country\u2019s missile program forward as much as they might seem.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
