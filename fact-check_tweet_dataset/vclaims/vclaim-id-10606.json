{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did a Retired Postman Father Over 1,300 Illegitimate Children?", "subtitle": "Reports that an 87-year-old man had fathered hundreds of children originated from a well-known fake news site.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10606", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/postman-fathered-1300-children/", "vclaim": "On 27 February 2016, the World News Daily Report web site published an article positing that a retired postman had fathered more than 1,300 illegitimate children:\n\nAn 87-year-old former postman has been proven to have fathered over 1,300 illegitimate children after a private investigator hired by a Tennessee family discovered the shocking truth. \u201cContraception wasn\u2019t very popular in those days,\u201d he told local reporters in his defense. \u201cI have nothing to be ashamed of. The 60s were the good old days and I did a great Johnny Cash impression which played out real good with the ladies,\u201d he explained. \u201cSome even thought I was Johnny Cash for real,\u201d he recalls laughingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they really believed it or if they were trying to convince themselves, but who was I to say no to a quickie?\u201d he acknowledged.\n\nThere was no truth to this story, which originated with World News Daily Report (WNDR), a fake news site that does not publish factual stories (as noted in their disclaimer):\n\nWNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\n\nIn addition to the disclaimer, the fake news story about a postman\u2019s fathering 1,300 illegitimate children was given away as fiction because it featured two unrelated images that were lifted (like all of WNDR\u2019s photographs) from other sites:\n\nThe first image, which purportedly depicts the prolific postman, actually shows a 97-year-old World War II veteran. The second image, which supposedly captures the reported who uncovered the story, is actually picture of David Stockman, the budget director during the Reagan administration.", "lang": "en"}
