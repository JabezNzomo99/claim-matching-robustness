The posts were shared as people around the world took steps to minimise the spread of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19. The claim in the posts is misleading; experts told AFP that hand sanitiser is safe to use around pets and only large amounts of it could be potentially toxic to animals.\n\nThe misleading claim was published on Facebook here on April 1, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s text image reads: \u201cPlease DO NOT pet your dog or any pet after using hand sanitiser. It contains ethanol glycol that's also found in anti-freeze that's toxic to them!! They might lick the area you've touched them. Please share to make others aware.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nOther instances of the same post appeared on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nAnne Peaston, an associate professor from the University of Adelaide\u2019s School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, told AFP that hand sanitiser is generally safe to use around animals.\n\n\u201cHand sanitisers contain various chemicals such as glycerine (glycerol) and propylene glycol,\u201d she explained in an email on April 17. \u201cGlycerine is sweet and is commonly used in cooking e.g. fruitcakes. It is non-toxic.\u201d\n\nPeaston added that propylene glycol is a less toxic chemical substitute for ethylene glycol -- the key chemical in antifreeze -- and is only potentially harmful if ingested in large amounts.\n\nPropylene glycol is \u201cgenerally recognised as safe for consumption by humans, dogs, and other animals\u201d, however, it can be toxic to cats if ingested in large amounts, Peaston said.\n\n\u201cIf the hands are wet with sanitiser, it is possible that a tiny amount could be left on the cat fur, and the cat will clean it off by licking. Even so, this tiny amount is highly unlikely to be sufficient to be toxic to kitty unless the particular cat is remarkably sensitive to the chemical,\u201d she said.\n\nPeaston said that depending on the brand of hand sanitiser, quantities of propylene glycol can vary from small to none.\n\nAlcohol, however, can be a dangerous toxin in hand sanitisers for animals and humans.\n\n\u201cDogs and cats are usually repelled by high alcohol liquids rather than attracted to them. However, it is prudent to store sanitisers out of reach of pets and small children, avoiding the possibility of accidental ingestion,\u201d Peaston said.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control service in North America, also noted here that hand sanitiser is \u201ctypically unpalatable to pets\u201d. The service added here that alcohol in hand sanitisers can have the same dangerous effects on animals as hard liquor.", "lang": "en"}
