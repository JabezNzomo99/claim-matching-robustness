No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents and sometimes political topics. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on January 10, 2019 titled \"Coast guard employee told cops she was forced into prostitution to cope with government shutdown\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA Maine Coast Guard employee arrested during a prostitution sting operation last night claims she was forced into prostitution to pay her bills and feed her family because of the government shutdown. Marleen Freeman, 38, a Coast Guard employee for the past 12 years, told South Portland police officers that the government shutdown left her with no other choice but to prostitute herself to put food on the table.
