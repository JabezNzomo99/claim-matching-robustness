Lewis, the British author known for The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nThe various posts on social media show a quote first from \u2018Satan\u2019, who describes the fear and anxiety that he will provoke, then from \u2018Jesus\u2019, who says he will bring together people and families. The full text is transcribed below:\n\n\u201cSatan: I will cause anxiety, fear and panic. I will shut down business, schools, places of worship, and sports events. I will cause economic turmoil.\n\nJesus: I will bring together neighbors, restore the family unit, I will bring dinner back to the kitchen table. I will help people slow down their lives and appreciate what really matters. I will teach my children to rely on me and not the world. I will teach my children to trust me and not their money and material resources.\u201d\n\nOne image makes the further claim that the quote was written by Lewis in 1942 in response to World War II ( here ).\n\nThe quote, however, is misattributed to C.S. Lewis and was in fact written by a social media user this year.\n\nIn 1942, Lewis published three non-fiction books: The Case for Christianity ( here ) , A Preface to Paradise Lost ( here ), and Broadcast Talks ( here ). In none of these three books does this quote appear.\n\nThe same year, Lewis also published a work of fiction, The Screwtape Letters. This epistolary novel was a satirical account of an exchange between two demons, used to examine theological discussions related to temptation, ( here ). Nowhere in this book does a quote similar to the one attributed to Lewis on social media appear.\n\nIn the book Mere Christianity, published in 1952, but adapted from a series of talks Lewis gave during World War II, Lewis discussed the influences \u201cSatan\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d have had on humankind:\n\n\u201cWhat Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could \"be like gods [\u2026] And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human history\u2014money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery\u2014the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy. The reason why it can never succeed is this. God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine.\u201d ( here ) This exchange is evidently distinct to the quote examined in this check.\n\nThe viral quote on social media can instead be traced back to a Facebook post made on March 12, 2020 by a US woman named Heidi May ( archive.vn/lwdmA ), as first reported by Snopes on March 30, 2020 ( here ).\n\nMay told Reuters she wrote the exchange on a day she was \u201cfeeling overwhelmed\u201d, adding, \u201cJesus spoke these words to my heart.\u201d\n\nFalse claim. There is no evidence that the author C.S. Lewis wrote the quote attributed to him on social media. The quote comes from a March 2020 post by a Facebook user.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
