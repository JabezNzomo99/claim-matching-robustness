All the indicators are that we have gone from being one of the top [economic] performers in the G7, one of the top performers in the world, one of the top performers in Europe in terms of growth, and we are now nearly at the bottom of the league. And that's happened in the last six or 12 months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that if you look at the UK\u2019s GDP growth for the last few quarters it\u2019s among the lowest in the G7 and lower than the EU average. It\u2019s also much lower than other countries like China and India, but the comparison isn\u2019t very helpful.\n\nBefore then, the UK was one of the top growing economies in the G7 and was above the average for the EU.\n\nGDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country.\n\nThere are other ways of comparing countries\u2019 economic performance, but we\u2019re focusing here on growth as Lord Rose referred to.\n\nGDP growth: where are we now?\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week that once you compare various forecasts for GDP growth between 2016 and 2022 \u201cthe UK comes out well behind all of them [other G7 countries] with only Canada even within touching distance. And we don\u2019t have to rely just on forecasts. The UK is currently growing more slowly than other advanced economies.\u201d\n\nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics put the UK at the lower end of the G7 countries so far in 2017 in terms of GDP growth. It was at the bottom of the table in the first half of the year The Bank of England have also said the UK\u2019s GDP growth in 2017 so far was lower than the average of the rest of the G7 countries.\n\nThe UK\u2019s GDP growth was also below the average for the EU and the Eurozone from January to September 2017, according to the ONS. Looking at the individual countries in the EU, the UK also found itself near the bottom in terms of growth in each of the three quarters in 2017 so far and in the lower half of the league table in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s also well behind that of countries like China and India. Their growth consistently outstrips those of 'advanced' economies, but it's not always as helpful to compare these countries to the UK. As countries that have had less developed economies in the recent past they are now growing a lot faster than countries like the UK and Germany.\n\nThe UK had the fastest growing economy in the G7 in 2014\n\nThe UK had the fastest growing GDP in the G7 in 2014, and was joint first in 2016. The UK\u2019s GDP growth hasn\u2019t been above the average for the EU since early 2016 if you compare GDP growth from one quarter to the next.", "lang": "en"}
