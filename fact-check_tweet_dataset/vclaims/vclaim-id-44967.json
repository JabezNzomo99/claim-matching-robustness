A reverse image search of a frame of the video led to a few news reports. An article from One India dated May 27, 2020, said, \u201cThis case of a minor girl beaten is from tribal areas where punishments are brutal. She was brutally beaten for being in an illicit relationship.\u201d A Punjab Kesari report from May 28 says, \u201cA 16-year-old tribal girl was brutally beaten up by three men in front of her father and villagers when she went with a boy to a village in Chhota Udaipur in Gujarat.\u201d The Daily Mail also reported the incident on May 28.\n\nAccording to Dainik Jagran\u2019s May 27 report, \u201cPI Vasava of Rangpur police station reported that 17-year-old teenager, living with her aunt in Kolbokadia village, was in love with a young man from the village. Both of them used to meet in secret. A few days ago, they ran away from home. When the girl\u2019s uncle and other family members living in Bhilwant village found out, they began searching for her. On Thursday, the teenager was discovered in a village in Madhya Pradesh and was brought to Bhilwant village where was tied with a rope. After this, the villagers took the teenager outside the village and beat her brutally with sticks. The accused also pulled the teenager\u2019s hair and clothes. When the victim\u2019s father came to the rescue, he was also brutally beaten. Following a complaint, the police arrested around 15 people from Bhilwand village.\u201d\n\nUP Superintendent of Police (SP) Sonbhadra issued a statement and said that the video has no relation with UP.\n\nTherefore, a video of a girl beaten in a village in Gujarat for eloping with a boy was shared with the false claim that a Dalit woman was beaten in Uttar Pradesh for drawing water from a well used by upper-caste villagers.\n\n[Update: This video was revived in October 2020 against the backdrop of the alleged rape of a Dalit woman in UP\u2019s Hathras by four upper-caste men.]", "lang": "en"}
