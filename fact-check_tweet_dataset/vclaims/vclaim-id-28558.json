Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of people excluded from the Assam NRC list being forcefully evicted out of their houses Fact: In 2017, as per a Guwahati High Court order, the Assam government has carried out an eviction drive in the area around Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary (Guwahati) as it was declared as an eco-sensitive zone (ECZ) by the Environment Ministry. The video in the post corresponds to an incident during that eviction drive. So, claim is FALSE.\n\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC) is the list of Indian citizens in Assam. From the \u2018DD News\u2019 article, it was found that the final NRC list of Assam was published on 31 August 2019, and it had excluded 19 lakh people.\n\n\n\nThe video in the post had a watermark \u2018DY365 Exclusive\u2019. So, when searched on Facebook with that text, the official page of an Assamese News Channel \u2018DY365\u2019 was found. In the \u2018videos\u2019 section of that page, a longer version of this video was found. The video is posted in November 2017 and had the following description- \u2018As the second day of eviction drive continues at Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary, an appalling incident took place at Kangkan Nagar. An angry protestor identified as Ismail Haque attacked a forest official with a sharp weapon amid the eviction. Security personnel jumped at him immediately and what followed next is\u2026\u2019. \n\n\n\nFrom an article of \u2018Wire\u2019, it was found that, as per a Guwahati High Court order, the Assam government has carried out an eviction drive in the area around Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary as it was declared as an eco-sensitive zone (ECZ) by the Environment Ministry. So, the video in the post is related to an incident in 2017 and has nothing to do with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) Assam. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being shared with a false narrative \u2013 \u2018people excluded from Assam NRC list are forcefully being evicted\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
