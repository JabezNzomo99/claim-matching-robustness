No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on February 10, 2019 titled \"UPDATE: Body In Ohio River Confirmed As Major Clinton Aide\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOn Tuesday, police in Saint Clairsville, Ohio announced some troubling news to the small town: a dead body had washed ashore on the Ohio River. Authorities told residents not to worry, that the body had probably drifted there from somewhere hundreds of miles away based on the amount of damage -- and they were right. An investigation concluded on Saturday that the corpse was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the inhumed remains of Jaeger Holpern, aide to Hillary Clinton for more than a decade -- including in the 2012 and 2016 elections. He also worked as a bodyguard for Chelsea Clinton from 2017-November 2018. Holpern recently provided evidence to Judicial Watch regarding the Clinton email scandal, according to a press release from the transparency organization.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nEagle-eyed readers probably noticed that the television screenshot illustrating the article was actually from Pittsburgh:\n\nBut there are several other hints the story is false. First of all, the Ohio river does not flow through Saint Clairsville. The nearest place where it passes by would seem to be Wheeling:\n\nA second hint is hidden in the URL of the story: https://wearethellod.com/jaeger-holpern-is-also-an-anagram/\n\nJaeger Holpern is indeed an anagram for John Lee Prager, one of the writers behind the site:\n\nPrager happens to live in Wheeling, West Virginia.\n\nThe term \"inhumed remains\" is also a dead giveaway: it means burried remains, something typically not true of a corpse floating in a river.\n\nIf those aren't enough hints, the story was published under the category \"Clinton Satire For Chelsea to Tweet About\" and the header of the site has the warning \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\".\n\nThe site also comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
