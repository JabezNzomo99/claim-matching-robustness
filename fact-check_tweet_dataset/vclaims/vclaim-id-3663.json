We are finally going to lead again. You see what\u2019s happening? You see the rockets going up left and right? You haven\u2019t seen that for a long time. Very soon we are going to Mars. You wouldn\u2019t have been going to Mars if my opponent won, that I can tell you. You wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about it. Wouldn\u2019t be thinking about it.\n\nTrump is simply ignoring Clinton\u2019s words during the presidential campaign.\n\nPart of her written response to a question posed by ScienceDebate.org about space exploration was: \u201cToday, thanks to a series of successful American robotic explorers, we know more about the Red Planet than ever before. A goal of my administration will be to expand this knowledge even further and advance our ability to make human exploration of Mars a reality.\u201d\n\nAnd when Space News magazine asked if she supported NASA\u2019s plans to send astronauts to Mars, Clinton wrote: \u201cI have always been an enthusiastic supporter of human space flight. My administration will continue to invest in this worthwhile endeavor. Mars is a consensus horizon goal, though to send humans safely, we still need to advance the technologies required to mitigate the effects of long-duration, deep-space flight.\u201d\n\nThose responses suggest that she supported sending astronauts to Mars or was at least open to the idea.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t clear what Trump meant when he said, \u201cVery soon we are going to Mars.\u201d\n\nA year ago, the president signed legislation that mentioned traveling to Mars, but not until more than a decade from now.\n\nThe NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 \u2014 which passed unanimously in the House and Senate \u2014 says that the agency\u2019s administrator \u201cshall contract with an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space flight mission to be launched in 2033.\u201d\n\nThen, in December, Trump issued a policy directive for NASA to plan for another mission to the Moon and beyond.\n\nIn a press release about it, NASA said: \u201cThe effort will more effectively organize government, private industry, and international efforts toward returning humans on the Moon, and will lay the foundation that will eventually enable human exploration of Mars.\u201d\n\nBut the release didn\u2019t say that a trip to Mars would happen \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s own \u201cJourney to Mars Overview\u201d webpage says the agency \u201cis on a journey to Mars, with a goal of sending humans to the Red Planet in the 2030s.\u201d\n\nTrump even joked last April that he would like NASA to move up its schedule to make a mission happen during his presidency.\n\nIn a video conference call with astronauts aboard the International Space Station, Trump asked NASA\u2019s Peggy Whitson about the timing of sending a human to Mars. \u201cIs there a schedule?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhitson told the president that, \u201cas your bill directed, it will be approximately in the 2030s.\u201d She added, \u201cUnfortunately, spaceflight takes a lot of time and money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we want to try and do it during my first term or, at worst, during my second term,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have to speed that up a little bit, okay?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
