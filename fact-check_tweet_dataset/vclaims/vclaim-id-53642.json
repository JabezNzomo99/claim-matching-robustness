A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd among those fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects,\u201d the alleged quote continues.\n\nThere is no evidence that Melville ever said or wrote this quote. It actually comes from Anglican preacher Henry Melvill.\n\nA 19th-century American author, Melville wrote, along with numerous other stories and poems, the sea adventure novel \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d (RELATED: Did Lewis Carroll Say, \u2018Everyone Wants A Magical Solution To Their Problems, And Everyone Refuses To Believe In Magic\u2019?)\n\nHowever, nowhere in that book, or in any of his other works, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his complete works turned up no matching or similar expressions.\n\nScott Norsworthy, the bibliographical associate on \u201cThe Writings Of Herman Melville,\u201d debunked the saying in a 2011 blog post titled, \u201cthe finest thing Herman Melville never said.\u201d\n\nThe expression actually originates with Melvill, an Anglican preacher of no relation to Melville, according to Norsworthy. In an 1855 sermon, Melvill said, \u201cYe live not for yourselves; ye cannot live for yourselves; a thousand fibres connect you with your fellow-men, and along those fibres, as along sympathetic threads, run your actions as causes, and return to you as effects.\u201d\n\nSeveral Melville experts, including Columbia University professor Andrew Delbanco and Hofstra University professor John Bryant, directed the DCNF to Norsworthy\u2019s blog when asked about the erroneously attributed quote.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
