No, that's not true, that \"news\" came from a site specializing in fake satire (\"fauxtire\") with a long history of publishing made up stories. The news is not real.\n\nIt first appeared in an article published on April 25, 2018 on Huzlers titled \"Cardi B Says Bruno Mars Might Be The Baby Daddy\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFans of the singer might have mistaken the summary on social media for real news:\n\nCardi B (stage name of Belcalis Almanzar) is actually engaged to rapper Offset (real name Kiari Kendrell Cephus) of rap trio Migos and is expecting his child. The quote attributed to her on Huzlers is made up:\n\n\"Yeah I f*cked Bruno and he might be the baby daddy i don't know\" said Cardi B, \"Kiari[Offset] cheated on me anyways so i don't care\". Surprisingly nobody was really surprised by Cardi's confession, considering the stereotype of \"Thots\" being the majority of Cardi B fans.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Lil Tay NOT Rushed to Hospital, NOT Beat By Group of Children At Playground\n\u2022 Fake News: 28 Year-Old Man Did NOT Overdose From Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Fortnite Creator Did NOT Admit Game's Purpose Is To Prepare Young Men For War\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Leave Store After Announcing He Will Pay For Every Customers' Cart\n\u2022 Fake News: Mexican Boy NOT Arrested & Deported For Singing Rancheras At A Local Walmart Store", "lang": "en"}
