The report looked at various charities' spending on charitable activities as a proportion of their total income, averaged over a three year period.\n\nLooking at the ratio of charitable spending to total income doesn't tell you much about how well-run charities are, or how effective they are at achieving their charitable goals.\n\nThat's because charities sometimes have to spend money to make money\u2014for example, paying rent for a charity shop.\n\nLooking at total income, as the report did, doesn't account for charities spending money to raise more money, or for situations when they don't spend all of their income at once.\n\nSometimes you have to spend money to make money\n\nCharity accounts show all the resources that flow to a charity in a year, whether through donations, investments, or other sources.\n\nThis doesn't account for the cost of generating that income. For instance, a charity might pay a fundraising team to help raise donations. This can lower the ratio of 'charitable activity' spending to total income.\n\nFor example, a charity might get \u00a350 in donations, and another \u00a350 from its charity shop, which costs \u00a330 to run. Its total income is \u00a3100.\n\nThe charity spends \u00a370 on charitable works, and \u00a330 on running its shop. Criticising it for only spending 70% of its income on 'good works' wouldn't show the whole picture. If it hadn't spent \u00a330 on the shop, it would only have \u00a350 to spend on charitable activities.\n\nIn this case, it would be more helpful to look at the amount of income leftover after the cost of generating it.\n\nDifferent organisations can have very different ratios purely as a result of how they raise their funding. It's also worth noting that some charities don't receive any funding from the general public.\n\nThe report's methodology counts money that should probably be left out\n\nThe ratio used in the report includes items of income that cannot always legally be spent, like permanent endowments. This is money or land that is given to a charity with the intention that it will be held forever.\n\nThe ratio also includes income that isn't actually received in that year; legacies are recorded when a charity is notified that they've been left a sum in a will, but they aren't received until a person dies.\n\nLooking at short periods can be misleading\n\nLooking at the proportion over short periods raises another problem. If a charity receives an unusually large amount of money in one year, should it spend it over the three year period to meet a spending target, or should it invest it and spread spending over a longer period?\n\nBy this particular ratio a charity would look better doing the first rather than the second.\n\nThis is precisely what happened to one of the charities highlighted in the report. The Racing Foundation received a payment of almost \u00a350 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport last year. Instead of spending the sum in one year, the charity placed the funds in investments, \"with the aim of preserving the capital over the long term and generating investment income to fund grant-making activities\".\n\nThe comparable figure for Full Fact was about 92% in 2014. Our total income was \u00a3336,000 and we spent \u00a3309,000 on charitable activities.", "lang": "en"}
