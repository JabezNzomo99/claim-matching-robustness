He repeated the claim during a debate in Dearborn, Mich., on Oct. 9, 2007.\n\nThe problem is, he was opposed to one of the tax cuts he lists, and several other cuts were championed by others or involved state funds \u2014 not city funds.\n\nThe most glaring example is the expiration of the 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge on New York City residents. Peter Vallone, then the city council speaker and a candidate for governor, championed letting the tax expire, while Giuliani opposed him. After about five months, the mayor and the city council came to a budget agreement, and Giuliani changed his mind and let the tax expire.\n\nSome New Yorkers have disputed whether the mayor may appropriately take credit for the STAR program, a property tax rebate that Gov. George Pataki initiated and paid for with state funds, according to an analysis of the cuts by the New York Daily News.\n\nThe Annenberg Political FactCheck, a fact-checking Web site, looked at the \"23 tax cuts\" line when the campaign used the figure in a Giuliani radio ad. FactCheck concluded, based on information from New York City's Independent Budget Office, that eight of the tax cuts Giuliani boasts about actually should be credited to state government initiatives. In addition, FactCheck said he did not deserve credit for the personal income tax surcharge and that overall, he could rightly claim only 14 of the 23 tax cuts.\n\nThe Giuliani campaign has argued that Giuliani deserves credit for any tax cuts under his watch. Giuliani made the case himself to a reporter in an exchange that was captured on video.\n\nIn the video, Giuliani said he deserves credit for the tax cuts because he publicly argued for them and lobbied for them, and that he was the chief executive of the tax base that was affected.\n\nStill, we find it's a stretch for Giuliani to personally take credit for 23 when many of them were primarily pushed by others. So we find his claim to be Half True.", "lang": "en"}
