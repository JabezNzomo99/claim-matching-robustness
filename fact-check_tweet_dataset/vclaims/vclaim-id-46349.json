The video is from 2017, from the sitting US President Donald Trump's inauguration, and it falsely shows the then US President Barack Obama throw away a gift presented to the Obama family by Melania.\n\nBOOM found that the viral video is doctored and Obama had in fact, given the gift to his staff in the White House before posing for a picture with the Trumps.\n\n\n\nThe viral video shows Obama taking a gift from then First Lady Michelle Obama's hand and when he is entering the White House and is not fully visible in the frame, the blue box - reported to be a Tiffany's box - is artificially shown to tossed by him towards the end of the video to give the impression that Obama deliberately threw the gift away. \n\n\n\nThe video can be seen below.\n\nBOOM this request on its helpline (7700906111), asking if it was fake.\n\nUsing the relevant keywords, BOOM also found this video to be viral on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n\n\nThese posts have various captions like, \"Obama rejected a gift from Trump and throws it away without inviting them in\"\n\nSome of the claims are in Hindi. These captions state that Trump's visit to Obama was recent, and linked it to the ongoing racial unrest in the United States. \n\n\n\nSome of these posts are as old as January 2017 carrying much slightly longer versions of the video; the month in which Trump was inaugurated as president.\n\nOn examining the video closely, a CNN watermark can be seen in the bottom right corner of the viral videos.\n\nBOOM examined CNN's coverage of Trump's inauguration as the 45th US president on January 20, 2017, and found that contrary to claims, Obama does not throw the gift once offered by Melania. Rather, he briefly goes into the White House after taking the gift from his wife, hands the gifts over through the door, and rejoins the Trumps and Michelle to pose for pictures. Later, they all go into the White House together.\n\nThe blue object being tossed, thus, has been inserted into the video artificially.\n\nNot only CNN, but Obama can be seen going in to keep the gift through multiple reporting houses.", "lang": "en"}
