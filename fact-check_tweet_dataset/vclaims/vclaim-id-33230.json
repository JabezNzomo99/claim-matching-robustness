The \"negative tint of propaganda\" directed at Ukraine, they say.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "October 11, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33230", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-russia-ukraine-propaganda-poll-fact-check/29538187.html", "vclaim": "The top polling agencies inside Russia and Ukraine got together to look at how people in each country regard their neighbor. Ukrainian attitudes towards Russians have improved since last year even as a Moscow-backed separatist conflict rages in the country\u2019s east, a survey conducted jointly by Russia\u2019s independent Levada Center and the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) reveals.\n\nThe poll found that 48% of Ukrainians now view Russia in a positive light, up from 37% last year. By contrast, 32% of Ukrainians view Russians negatively, down from 46% in 2017. And there has been no such uptick in Russia.\n\nUkrainian opinions, unsurprisingly, break down according to region, with 31% holding positive attitudes in the west, 44% in the center, 62% in the south and 70% in the east, where more ethnic Russians reside.\n\nRussians\u2019 positive attitudes towards Ukrainians, by contrast, remain unchanged year-on-year at 33%, while 55% now view Ukrainians negatively.\n\nMoreover, when asked about the most defining characteristics of their neighbors, the most popular reply from Ukrainians regarding Russians was being \u201copen\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d (\u201cnormal\u201d) -- at 22%. Another 21% said hospitality was the dominant trait. By contrast, a plurality of Russians (30%) said the primary trait of Ukrainians was that they were\u201d hypocritical\u201d and \u201ccunning,\u201d although 26% called them \u201chospitable.\u201d\n\nAll in all, Russians named five positive and five negative traits about Ukrainians, while Ukrainians found six positive traits and four negative ones about Russians.\n\nKIIS conducted the Ukrainian portion of the poll from September 8th to the 23rd among 2,206 respondents in 109 settlements in every oblast nationwide, excluding the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.\n\nThe Levada Center conducted its survey among 1,600 Russians during the period of September 20th to 26th.\n\nRegarding the surveys, RT reported on Wednesday, October 10, that \u201cthe proportion of people who want friendship between Russia and Ukraine [had] remained the same over the past 10 years,\u201d adding that this sentiment persisted despite \u201ca campaign of anti-Russian propaganda in Ukraine and numerous infringements of Russian speakers\u2019 rights which have been taking place since the 2014 replacement of the lawfully-elected Ukrainian government with a pro-Western regime in the course of violent protests known as \u2018Maidan\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile many reports on infringements of Russian speakers\u2019 rights have been misleading and allegations of a Western-backed coup debunked, RT\u2019s claim of an \u201canti-Russian propaganda campaign\u201d in Ukraine is an interesting one.\n\nAnd so that leads to the question: If Ukraine is running a domestic anti-Russian propaganda campaign, why do Russians generally have more negative attitudes towards Ukrainians than vice-versa?\n\nDespite worsening relations which culminated in Kyiv terminating the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership with Russia last month, Alexei Levinson, the head of socio-cultural research department at the Levada Center, told Polygraph.info that \u201casymmetry in attitudes\u201d between Russians and Ukrainians is nothing new.\n\n\u201cWe traced it even more than 10 years ago and I can guess that it is a part of, let\u2019s say, a post-imperial syndrome, where Russians as a nation feel that they are kind of betrayed by all the nations that used to belong to the Soviet Union but then left after [its] collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cSo [Russians] are rather negative about almost all the former Soviet republics, except for Kazakhstan and Belarus.\u201d\n\nAnd despite RT\u2019s reports of an anti-Russian propaganda campaign in Ukraine, Levinson said it was, in fact, \u201cthe conflict with Ukraine\u201d and \u201cthe massive anti-Ukraine propaganda in recent times\u201d that has \u201caffected the mass consciousness in Russia\u201d.\n\nRegarding why Russian propaganda that centered on Ukrainian government policy would spoil attitudes towards the Ukrainian people themselves, Levinson attributed this to a \u201cshadow effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything related to Ukraine was, I would say, spoiled or colored with some negative tint by this propaganda, not differentiating the people from the country and the country from the state and the politics from humans and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the general rule is that Russians usually have much better attitudes towards the people than the country or the state.\u201d\n\nAs to why Ukrainians\u2019 would hold relatively warmer views toward Russia, despite a simmering Russian-instigated war and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Ukrainian pollster has been tracking that.\n\nVladimir Paniotto, director general of KIIS, said the influence of Russian media in terms of negative information about Ukraine had been provided \u201cconsistently\u201d and \u201cpurposefully,\u201d making public opinion in Russia \u201cmore manageable.\u201d\n\nAs for RT\u2019s claim that the proportion of people wanting friendship has remained the same over the past decade, Paniotto, described RT\u2019s analysis as a \u201cstrange mixture of real data with some fantasy,\u201d adding he \u201ccouldn\u2019t understood\u201d where they had taken their figures from.\n\n\u201cAfter [Russia\u2019s annexation of] Crimea we had a dramatic drop of positive attitudes to Russia, from 85% in 2013 to 30% (in May 2015). In 2008, only 10% of Ukrainians wanted closed borders with Russia. In December 2014 [that figure was] 50% and now [it\u2019s] about 40% (38%),\u201d Paniotto said in a written comment to Polygraph.info.\n\nBut he said \u201cthe end of active hostilities\u201d between Ukraine and Russia had brought about a gradual improvement in Ukrainian opinion towards Russians.\n\n\u201cThis is also influenced by some pro-Russian Ukrainian channels and deputies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attitude of Russians is stable, as Russia is making extraordinary efforts in anti-Ukrainian propaganda during many years and continue to do it. There are no opposition TV channels in Russia, all information is controlled by a single center, therefore it is effective. And even with this, a third of the population treats Ukraine well.\u201d\n\nSo while RT reports the desire for friendship has remained steady despite Ukrainian propaganda, the numbers clearly show that is the Russian side that has taken the biggest hit in the disinformation war.", "lang": "en"}
