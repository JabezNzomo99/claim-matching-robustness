No one really likes to claim parentage, least of all the Obama administration. So there was Defense Secretary Hagel, defending the 2015 military budget while blaming Congress for the sequester.\n\nIn 2011, Democrats and Republicans had a bitter showdown on whether to raise the ceiling on the national debt. The impasse ended with bipartisan passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which cut spending by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years by setting new budget caps for \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cnonsecurity\u201d discretionary spending.\n\n\u201cSecurity\u201d spending included not just the Defense Department but also the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs, foreign aid spending, intelligence and other areas. The goal was to allow some flexibility to avoid being locked into a specific number for defense spending.\n\nThe law also tasked a \u201csupercommittee\u201d with finding ways to reduce the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If the committee failed \u2014 which it did \u2014 then automatic cuts totaling $1.2 trillion also would be ordered in \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cnonsecurity\u201d spending. This process is known as \u201csequestration.\u201d\n\nOne aide, Gene Sperling, described it as a \u201ctrigger\u201d to lock in spending cuts. Then White House chief of staff (and now Treasury secretary) Jack Lew pitched the idea to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), arguing that \u201cthe beauty of a sequester [is] it\u2019s so ridiculous that no one ever wants it to happen.\u201d Lew then used language from 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law \u2014 which he knew well from his days as an aide to then-House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill from 1979 to 1987 \u2014 as the model for the trigger.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, Obama signed the Budget Control Act into law in 2011. He then in 2013 signed a bill, achieved after a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), that removed some of the sting of the sequester by identifying specific reductions in spending, giving a bit of a boost to the Defense Department. The proposed 2015 budget aims to exceed the sequester caps a bit more.\n\nFirst, Pentagon leadership has consistently been against sequestration, even before Secretary Hagel\u2019s tenure. There is a long public record of statements to that effect. Second, our budget submission for FY-15 and the out years is above sequestration level, so we clearly aren\u2019t accepting it now, either. Third, the Bipartisan Budget Act set defense spending at $496 billion, much less than we proposed last year. This was the Murray-Ryan plan, not a number that Secretary Hagel or the White House devised.\n\nWe had earlier given President Obama Four Pinocchios for flatly stating that the sequester stemmed from a congressional proposal, but that was in part because he was intimately involved in the negotiations and should have known better. Hagel was not in Congress during this period, but he goes too far when tries to absolve Obama of any blame for the sequester. It takes both the executive branch and the legislative branch to create a law.", "lang": "en"}
