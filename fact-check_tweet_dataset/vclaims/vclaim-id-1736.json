The best information we have seems to come from surveys.\n\nThe estimate Mr Norcott quoted matches a survey of 500 GPs in 2015, taken by GP Online. We\u2019ve asked the magazine for some more detail on how that survey was carried out.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen similar figures quoted elsewhere. About three years ago, NHS England said that more than 12 million GP appointments are missed each year in the UK. We\u2019ve asked NHS England where these figures came from and whether they\u2019ve published more up-to-date estimates since then.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know exactly what this represents as a proportion of GP attendances either.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, no-one routinely collects figures about what goes on in GP surgeries across England.\n\nThe last recorded data on the number of appointments at GP surgeries found an estimated 300 million GP consultations a year took place in 2008, but no figures are available since then.\n\nSome reports have used trends in earlier data to estimate how many GP appointments there are now. In 2014, one report estimated that there would be around 380 million consultations in GP surgeries in 2015/16.\n\nEstimates like this come with some serious health warnings, but if that were roughly correct then 14 million missed appointments, as a ballpark figure, would represent something like 3-4% of all GP appointments in the year that GP Online carried out their survey.", "lang": "en"}
