Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Swachh Survekshan ranks of Vijayawada, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam dropped from 5, 6 and 7 ranks in 2018 (under the TDP government) to 6, 12, and 17 ranks in 2020 (under the YSRCP government) respectively. Fact: While it is true that the Swachh Survekshan ranks of Vijayawada, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam were 5, 6, and 7 ranks respectively in 2018 under the TDP government, the rankings of those cities also dropped to 12, 8, and 23 ranks respectively in 2019 under the TDP government. The 2019 rankings were not mentioned in the post to mislead people that the drop in rankings occurred under the YSRCP government. Actually, the rankings of Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada improved under the YSRCP government i.e. in 2020 when compared to 2019 rankings. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nIn the post, it can be observed that the \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2019\u2019 rankings of the mentioned cities were missing. On looking at the \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2018\u2019 and \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2019\u2019 rankings, it was found that the Swachh Survekshan ranks of Vijayawada, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam were 5, 6, and 7 ranks respectively in 2018 under the TDP government, but the rankings of those cities also dropped to 12, 8, and 23 ranks respectively in 2019 under the TDP government. Actually, the rankings of Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada improved under the YSRCP government i.e. in \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2020\u2019 when compared to 2019 rankings. The 2019 rankings were not mentioned in the post to mislead people that the drop in rankings occurred under the YSRCP government.\n\nWhen a similar tweet was made by TDP leader Nara Lokesh attributing the 2019 ranks to YSRCP government, FACTLY has then written a fact-check article saying that \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2019\u2019 rankings were published during the TDP government itself.\n\nOn 20 August 2020, YSRCP MP Vijayasai Reddy has tweeted (archived) that the rank of Visakhapatnam improved to 9 as against the 23rd rank in the previous rankings.\n\nBut Visakhapatnam was ranked 23rd in the \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2019\u2019 in the category of \u2018More than 1 lakh population\u2019. In that category, Visakhapatnam was ranked 17th in the \u2018Swachh Survekshan 2020\u2019. Visakhapatnam is ranked 9th in the category of \u2018More than 10 lakh population\u2019. So, the rank of Visakhapatnam in two different categories is being compared to mislead people.\n\nTo sum it up, the rankings are being selectively picked to mislead people.", "lang": "en"}
