[1]\n\nNational Party deputy leader Bridget McKenzie defended the government\u2019s refusal to increase Newstart stating it wasn\u2019t \u201ca lifestyle choice\u201d and not \u201csomething you're on for the long term\". [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Senator McKenzie\u2019s claim that two thirds of people on Newstart end that payment within 12 months and found the exact same claim had been repeated by four other government ministers, two Senators and a backbencher dating back to April 2019.\n\nOn July 26, 2019 Finance Minister Mathias Cormann was quoted as saying: \"Two thirds of people on Newstart allowance are on it for less than a year, it is not designed to be an ongoing payment,\" he said. [3]\n\nThe federal member for Wentworth Dave Sharma made the same claim on Sky TV on July 24, 2019 stating: \u201cTwo thirds of people who are on Newstart have often found employment within 12 months\u201d. [4]\n\nDuring a Senate debate on July 22, 2019, Tasmanian Senator Wendy Askew said: \u201caround two-thirds of jobseekers who are granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [5] Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton made the same claim on July 19, 2019, stating \u201ctwo-thirds of people come off Newstart within 12 months\u201d. [6]\n\nIn a Facebook post on May 11, 2019 addressing criticism the Newstart Allowance wasn\u2019t increased in the Budget, Senator Amanda Stoker stated \u201cAround two thirds of those granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [7]\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg repeated the same line on May 6, 2019, stating \u201cthe other thing about Newstart is two-thirds of the people come off within 12 months and go into a job\u201d. [8]\n\nFormer Social Services Minister, now Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, was quoted as saying \u201caround two-thirds of those on Newstart exited income support within 12 months\u201d on April 30, 2019. [9]\n\nThe Newstart Allowance is an income support payment for people aged from 22 but under Age Pension who are actively looking for work. [10]\n\nSingles with no children get a maximum of $278 per week/$555.70 per fortnight - or about $40 a day while couples receive a maximum $251 each per week/$501.1 per fortnight. [11]\n\nThe payment has not increased in real terms for 25 years. [12]\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Howard, former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan, Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos and a number of coalition backbenchers have joined Labor and the Greens in calling for the government to raise the benefit. [13] [14]\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has stated he\u2019d rather give a welfare boost to pensioners than the unemployed. [15]\n\nA spokesperson for Senator McKenzie advised AAP FactCheck the source of her claim was data.gov.au, the central source of Australian open government data.\n\nThe most recent Social Services department data dated December 2018 captures the number of people receiving Newstart benefits. The \u201cPayment Duration\u201d table shows the average payment duration for all people on Newstart in December 2018 was 156 weeks or three years. [16]\n\nThe Payment Duration table shows that of all the 722,923 people getting Newstart in December 2018, 241,415 or 33 per cent received it for under one year, almost 18 per cent or 128,139 were on the payment for one to two years, 200,196 or 27 per cent were on it for two to five years, just over 17 per cent or 125,408 people had been on the benefit for between five and 10 years and 27,765 or just under 4 per cent had been getting it for over 10 years. This table shows about 66 per cent of people on Newstart were receiving the benefit for between one to 10 years. [16]\n\nAnother table in the same data document titled \u201cExits 12 months\u201d shows the number of people who began receiving Newstart between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. This 2017 table shows there were 376,031 people who started receiving Newstart in 2017. Of this 2017 group, 236,530 exited within 12 months or 63 per cent. [16] This table supports the claim that two thirds of people on Newstart existed within 12 months but only for 2017.\n\nA July 25, 2019 investigation by Crikey using Department of Social Services data found \u201cthe proportion of Newstart recipients on payments for more than a year climbed from 69 per cent in 2014, to 73 per cent in 2016 and to 76.5 per cent in 2018. [17]\n\nThe Guardian Australia found on July 23 that the government was using select Newstart payment data between January-December 2017 to support its claim. [18]\n\nThe Conversation found on July 24, 2019, the contradiction between the government\u2019s claim that most people who enter Newstart quickly leave compared to most people on Newstart who have been on it for a long time, was the difference between flow and stock. It found most Newstart recipients had to survive on Newstart long-term and \u201cat any one time the overwhelming majority of the people\u201d on Newstart had \u201cbeen on it for more than a year\u201d. [19]\n\nThe Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS) has also disputed the government\u2019s claim stating: \u201ctwo thirds of people receiving Newstart have received the payment for 12 months or more\u201d. [20]\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck found the claim that \u201ctwo thirds of Newstart recipients end that payment within 12 months,\u201d made by Ministers McKenzie, Frydenberg, Dutton, Cormann and Fletcher, plus Senators Askew and Stoker and Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, to be false.\n\nTwo thirds of people on the Newstart benefit have been receiving it for over a year, according to Department of Social Services' ongoing data, the opposite of what the government has claimed. The government\u2019s claim is only true when referring to the number of people who started and exited Newstart in the 2017 calendar year.", "lang": "en"}
