According to Ofcom, RT failed to preserve \u201cdue impartiality\u201d in its programing, especially \u201cwhen dealing with matters of major political and industrial controversy and major matters relating to current public policy.\u201d\n\nThe media watchdog said there was \u201ca significant increase in the number of programs broadcast that we considered warranted investigation as potential breaches of the [regulatory] Code\u201d following the March 4, 2018 Novichok poisoning.\n\nOfcom stated it had not sanctioned RT for its divergence from established media narratives.\n\nIn recognizing RT\u2019s mission \u201cto make available an alternative point of view on world events, especially Russia-related ones,\u201d Ofcom said that due impartiality \u2013 not favoring one side or another in news coverage \u2013 \u201cdoes not mean an equal division of time has to be given to every view, or that every argument and every facet of every argument has to be represented.\u201d\n\nOfcom, however, said RT had failed to maintain this standard in over a half dozen instances during less than two months.\n\nOfcom\u2019s first documented breach concerns a March 2018 broadcast on \u201cSputnik,\u201d a current affairs discussion program, in which the hosts George Galloway and Gayatri Pertiwi \u201cdid not challenge\u201d former Kremlin advisor Alexander Nekrassov for calling the Skripal poisoning a \u201cbadly prepared provocation\u201d carried out when the U.K. government needed a distraction from domestic troubles, as well as a means \u201cto undermine the process of Brexit.\u201d\n\nRT argued it had strived for balance but received \u201c37 refusals\u201d while trying to secure commentators who would expertly present the U.K. government\u2019s version of events. The broadcaster argued that the \u201cSputnik\u201d program \u201cdoes not purport to be a news program.\u201d It also claimed that balance had been achieved through the totality of RT\u2019s programing schedule, if not within that individual program, as well as through statements appearing on captions and banners.\n\nOfcom found that RT had failed to \u201cgive due weight to an appropriately wide range of significant viewpoints in relation to the relevant matters of major political controversy and major matters relating to current public policy dealt with in the program.\u201d\n\nOfcom found that another edition of \u201cSputnik\u201d covering the Skripal poisoning on April 7, 2018, likewise failed to maintain due impartiality \u201con matters of major political and industrial controversy,\u201d and also failed to provide \u201can appropriately wide range of significant views.\u201d\n\nIn her tweets, Simonyan also touched on the case of Richard Murphy, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria who appeared on the current affairs program \u201cCrosstalk\u201d to discuss the situation in Syria, stemming from a complaint on the rebroadcast of the program on April 13, 2018.\n\nOfcom found that Murphy\u2019s contribution to that debate was \u201csignificantly undermined by the fact that he was repeatedly interrupted by the presenter and given little opportunity to respond fully to the presenter\u2019s increasingly vigorous and aggressive challenges.\u201d\n\nOfcom added: \u201cThis contrasted markedly to the manner in which the presenter treated the other two contributors, who we considered were allowed to express their views at length and often with the clear endorsement of the presenter.\u201d\n\nRather than being sanctioned for merely interrupting Murphy, RT was once again found to have breached its obligation to provide due weight to an appropriately wide range of viewpoints, which was in part (but not entirely) due to the nature of host Peter Lavelle\u2019s interactions with the American diplomat.\n\nThe next two breaches cited by Ofcom, on April 16, 2018 and April 20, 2018 were also committed by Crosstalk \u2013 again for failing to provide due impartiality in discussing the conflict in Syria.\n\nAnother Syria-related violation occurred in a March 18, 2018 news item, which covered a Russian Defense Ministry allegation that the U.S. military were arming and preparing rebel fighters in Syria to stage a chemical weapon attack in the south of the country in order to give the U.S. a pretext to launch airstrikes against the Syrian government.\n\nRather than simply failing to challenge Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, as stated by Simonyan, Ofcom found that a \u201cserious allegation\u201d had been made against the U.S. government which was \u201cclearly attributed to senior figures in the Russian military and Government,\u201d creating an obligation that alternative views are presented to ensure due impartiality, which Ofcom found RT had failed to do.\n\nLikewise, during an April 26, 2018 news item concerning the Ukrainian government\u2019s position on Nazism and the treatment of Roma Gypsies, RT was not fined for merely failing to provide an alternative point of view regarding what Simonyan described as a \u201cchildren's drawing competition in honor of the \u2018Galicia\u2019 SS division.\u201d\n\nRather, Ofcom reported that political commentator Avigdor Eskin accused the Ukrainian government of officially \u201cpromoting the glorification of Nazism,\u201d and drew \u201ca parallel between the Ukrainian Government\u2019s policies and actions towards minorities in Ukraine and the atrocities committed by the Nazis.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ofcom, there was no content in that news item \u201cthat could be described as reflecting the viewpoint of the Ukrainian Government on the serious accusations that the Ukrainian Government \u2018glorified Nazism\u2019 and had a policy of failing to protect ethnic and minority groups, including Jewish and Roma people, at a state level.\u201d\n\nOfcom found that by allowing these serious accusations to go unchallenged, as in the previous six instances, RT had failed in its obligation to maintain due impartiality.\n\nTherefore, Polygraph.info finds Simonyan\u2019s characterization of the events leading to the RT fine misleading.", "lang": "en"}
