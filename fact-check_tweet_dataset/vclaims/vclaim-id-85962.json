And that means that in recent years the Treasury has had to go into the private market and issue bonds to investors on Wall Street and overseas in order to make good a relatively small percentage of benefit payments \u2014 about $75 billion in 2013. (Contrary to the view of some commentators, this is not a controversial statement. It comes directly from the Social Security Trustees report: \u201cThe Trustees project that this cash-flow deficit will average about $75 billion between 2013 and 2018 before rising steeply.\u201d See also pages 223-224.)\n\nWhy do some people say the trust funds have nothing but IOUs?\n\nBut, then, doesn\u2019t the government have to pay for them somehow?\n\nThis is where it gets confusing. The bonds are a real asset to Social Security, but they also represent an obligation of the rest of the government. Like any entity that issues debt, such as a corporation, the government will have to make good on its obligations, generally by taking the money out of revenue, reducing expenses or issuing new debt. The action taken really depends on the resources available at the time. There is nothing particularly unusual about this, except that the U.S. government is better placed to make good on these obligations than virtually any other debt-issuer.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t the surplus cash generated by Social Security placed in stocks or something else?\n\nThat has been an option discussed from time to time, though people were concerned about government control of corporate assets and having retirement funds subject to market swings. But it\u2019s important to remember that if the $2.8 trillion now in the Social Security trust funds had been invested in some other security, not only would the value of the trust funds be subject to more volatility, but all things being equal, the publicly held debt of the United States would be $2.8 trillion higher today. That\u2019s because for years the Social Security surpluses were used to help fund government operations, thus reducing the overall budget deficit at the time.\n\nIs there anything wrong with issuing new debt as benefits exceed tax revenue?\n\nWould creating individual accounts, as Republicans advocate from time to time, also require more debt?\n\nYes, if the accounts are funded out of existing payroll taxes, which was favored by then-President George W. Bush when he unsuccessfully attempted to overhaul the system. Creating such accounts would require Social Security to tap the trust fund even faster. That is because the system would need to keep paying current beneficiaries while also funding nascent accounts for people who are not likely to retire for decades. If no new source of revenue is added, some sort of loan, potentially worth trillions of dollars, may be needed to help bridge the financing gap in the early decades of a revised program.\n\nAre there other ways to deal with a financing gap in Social Security?\n\nIt seems like I put a lot of money into Social Security and won\u2019t get a lot back.", "lang": "en"}
