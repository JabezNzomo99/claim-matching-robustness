The \u2018report\u2019 states that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is withdrawing the Rs 2000 currency note from circulation.\n\nAlt News has received numerous requests on its official app for verification of this information.\n\nThe image in question has been taken from an e-paper Dainik Purvoday, a Hindi daily published in the northeast. The article in question was published in the Guwahati edition on December 1. Alt News found that a portion of the report was clipped and circulated on WhatsApp with the intention of misleading readers into believing this as genuine news. This report was a clarification of the said rumour, stating that the information of RBI withdrawing the Rs 2000 note after December 31, 2019, is false. This is evident from the e-paper of December 1, where the full report is visible.\n\nAs can be seen, the report clearly states in a box, \u201c\u0938\u094b\u0936\u0932 \u092e\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0916\u092c\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u095e\u0930\u094d\u095b\u0940 \u201d (The information viral on social media is false- translation).\n\nAlt News contacted Mr Ravi Shankar, editor of Dainik Purvoday who clarified, \u201cSomeone has done mischief. A part of our report was clipped and circulated on WhatsApp, and this soon became viral. The report clearly stated that this information is false. A portion of it has been clipped and misused to mislead readers.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper published another report on December 8 asking readers not to be misled by the viral, clipped image of the newspaper report of December 1.\n\nNO NEWS ON WITHDRAWAL OF Rs 2000 NOTE\n\nIt is NOT true that the RBI will be withdrawing the Rs 2000 currency note after December 31, 2019. There has been no such announcement from the Reserve Bank of India. Any communication put forward by the RBI is published on the official website of the Central Bank, where no such notification has been put up.\n\nThe misinformation was viral in October 2019. Alt News had contacted the Reserve Bank of India for clarification. Department of Communication, RBI had stated, \u201cThese are all rumours. There has been no such notification (by the RBI). Please refer to the website for all communication\u201d.\n\nMoreover, Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, stated in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on December 3 that there is no government proposal to phase out Rs 2000 notes.\n\nThe false news was also circulated through a morphed screenshot of a broadcast by Aaj Tak channel. It may be reiterated that there is no truth to the claim that the Rs 2000 note introduced after demonetisation in November 2016 is going to be scrapped by the end of the year.", "lang": "en"}
