It was a favor returned: Lukashenko had congratulated Maduro after a similarly rigged vote in 2018 that triggered a leadership crisis persisting today.\n\nMaduro put out a statement praising Lukashenko for his \u201cundeniable victory.\u201d\n\nThe outcome, it said, was \u201ca clear triumph that expresses the loyalty of the Belarusian people to their national sovereignty to guarantee their integral development, prosperity, and maintenance of peace and security.\u201d\n\nIn fact, furious protests began immediately after the polls closed. Lukashenko\u2019s chief opponent \u2013 whose husband, a former candidate, is jailed \u2013 fled the country. Media reports said thousands of protesters have been arrested since Sunday, and the internet was taken down for hours at a time.\n\nAccording to election officials, Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, received 80 percent of the votes versus 10 percent for Tikhanovskaya, who the opposition says won.\n\nAccording to CNN, observers reported widespread ballot stuffing. \u201cI believe my own eyes, the majority was for us,\u201d Tikhanovskaya said. \"We do not recognize the election results. We have seen real protocols. We urge those who believe that their voice was stolen not to remain silent.\u201d\n\nRussian sociologist Grigory Yudin wrote on Facebook that counting was unreliable on both sides \u2013 the government for non-transparency and the opposition for unclear methodology. Still, he estimated based on available data that Tikhanovskaya won with about 70 percent of the vote.\n\nInternational leaders from Germany, the U.S. and the European Commission expressed concerns, with the commission stating the elections were \u201cneither free nor fair\u201d and that \u201ccredible reports of domestic observers show that the electoral process did not meet\u201d international standards.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited \u201csevere restrictions on ballot access for candidates, prohibition of local independent observers at polling stations, intimidation tactics employed against opposition candidates, and the detentions of peaceful protesters and journalists.\u201d\n\nDuring three days of protests, 7,000 people were detained by police, 250 were injured and one was killed. Minsk journalist Franak Via\u010dorka tweeted that reporters were being targeted while covering the events. AP News reported that 30 journalists were detained, three of whom were sentenced to administrative arrest (10 to 15 days).\n\nOn Wednesday, Via\u010dorka tweeted that \"there are multiple pieces of evidence that police have used lethal weapons yesterday in Belarus,\" and that the official number of 250 injured may be \"significantly underestimated.\"\n\nBelarus authorities cut off the internet amid the protests and stopped protesters from posting on social media. Lukashenko later claimed the internet outages were caused by a foreign adversary, not his government.\n\nIn 2018, Lukashenko played the same congratulations card after Venezuela\u2019s disputed presidential election.\n\nHe publicly congratulated Maduro for winning, saying that \u201cthe election outcome testifies to the broad public support for the ideas of the Bolivarian Revolution and construction of socialism of the 21st century that you, dear Nicolas, have been fearlessly defending amidst difficult political situation abroad and economic counteraction of numerous aggressive forces.\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s election was marred by controversies and called a \u201cfarce\u201d by the opposition. Voter turnout was historically low: 46 percent, compared to 79 percent in the three previous elections (2006, 2012 and 2013), as Eugenio Mart\u00ednez, an expert journalist in electoral processes, told BBC.\n\nMoreover, several organizations and opposition figures expressed concerns over irregularities of the electoral process \u2013 such as barring the participation of popular opposition candidates and shortening the voter registration period \u2013 all of which led the European Union, the Organization of American States (OAS) as well as countries like the U.S. and Australia to reject the electoral process.\n\nMaduro\u2019s win marked the beginning of the country\u2019s continuing presidential crisis. In January 2019, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as leader of the opposition-led National Assembly, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president and quickly received support from over 50 countries, including the United States.\n\nStrategic relations between Venezuela and Belarus had increased under the leadership of Hugo Chavez, Maduro\u2019s mentor and predecessor \u2013 resulting in joint enterprises such as Petrolera BeloVenezolana, established in 2007. Under the current government, they continue to expand.\n\nIn 2017, both nations started working on a road map for cooperation (first introduced in 2013), which could \u201ccontribute to the expansion of bilateral cooperation, the development of the industrial sector of Venezuela, building up export capacity, improvement of the financial system, food security, development of agriculture, construction and other sectors of the country,\u201d Belarus' Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko said.\n\nWhether Belarus might follow Venezuela\u2019s path is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was reported that Tikhanovskaya left for Lithuania with her children. According to CNN, she posted a video on her husband\u2019s YouTube channel describing her choice to leave.\n\n\"I made a very hard decision, I've made this decision on my own ... and I know that many people will understand me, many will judge me and many will hate me, but God forbid you will ever have to face the choice that I had to face,\u201d she said.\n\nShortly after the video was published, however, a pro-government channel on Telegram shared a video of Tikhanovskaya reading from a piece of paper and asking Belarusians to stop protests \u2013 insisting that \u201cthe nation has made its choice.\u201d\n\nThe video spurred speculation that Tikhanovskaya had been threatened. Her husband, a popular opposition YouTuber, was arrested and prevented from running for president in May \u2013 and remains in jail.\n\nMaduro joined other autocratic world leaders who sent congratulations to Lukashenko, including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan.", "lang": "en"}
