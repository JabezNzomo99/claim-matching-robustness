It is this type of wide spread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great \u2018Mr. President.\u2019\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe supposed tweet is dated Dec. 20, 2017. That\u2019s the day Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that Trump signed into law a few days later. Pelosi opposed the measure and Democrats criticized it as favoring the rich.\n\nWhile the blue-checked Twitter handle that appears in the image (@NancyPelosi) might seem legitimate, her actual Twitter account handle is @SpeakerPelosi. What\u2019s more, she uses a different photo for her Twitter account than the one we see in this Facebook image.\n\nHe\u2019s right. It was outed as fake long ago.\n\nSnopes, in December 2017, and FactCheck.org, in October 2018, reported that the tweet was a fake, posted by Tweeterino, a fake-tweet generator that shut itself down in June 2018.\n\nIt has also been debunked by the conservative-leaning Washington Examiner.\n\nAn image shared on Facebook that appears to be a tweet from Pelosi saying she is disgusted with Trump over tax breaks was posted by a now-defunct fake-tweet generator.", "lang": "en"}
