The post accompanying the article claims Nisha Patel, who previously worked as a program officer for the Gates Foundation from 2008 to 2011, died in a drowning incident alongside her daughter and father-in-law. The post appears to suggest that the drownings were not accidental.\n\n\u201cShe was the US Program officer at the Bill Gates Foundation,\u201d reads the Facebook post. \u201cShe oversaw 17 BILLION in Federal Grants & budget spending. (Interesting how none of that is mentioned in the CNN article). Herself, her daughter and a grandfather all drowned in their new pool. Ok sure! 3 people drowning in a pool at once seems very likely.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former Gates Foundation employee has not died. A representative for Social Policy Institute, where she currently works as a senior fellow, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that she is \u201calive and well.\u201d (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Visit Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Island 17 Times?)\n\n\u201cPlease let your readers and the world know that as of June 26, 2020, I am alive and well,\u201d she told the fact-checking website Lead Stories. \u201cThere are multiple people named \u2018Nisha Patel\u2019 in the United States, and I am just one of them, which is why I often use my middle initial \u2018G.\u2019 across public platforms.\u201d\n\nNisha Patel, who no longer works for the Gates Foundation, is 45-years-old and lives in Washington D.C., according to Lead Stories. She currently serves on the foundation\u2019s Alumni Network Advisory Board.\n\nA 33-year-old woman with the same name drowned in an above ground pool in East Brunswick, New Jersey, on June 22, according to CNN. Her father-in-law, Bharat Patel, and her 8-year-old daughter drowned in the same incident, The Associated Press reported.", "lang": "en"}
