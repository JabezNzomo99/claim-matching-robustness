In the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye. I punched my music teacher because I didn\u2019t think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled. I\u2019m not proud of that, but it\u2019s clear evidence that even early on I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known in a forceful way. The difference now is that I like to use my brain instead of my fists.\n\nWhether this passage describes an actual event from Donald Trump\u2019s childhood is doubtful. While the GOP candidate reportedly got into trouble as a child and has often talked about how he loved to fight in his youth, some skeptics have cast doubt on his story about his giving his second grade teacher a black eye, and even Trump himself has since backpedaled on it:\n\nIn his memoir, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump wrote that his main focus as a youngster was \u201ccreating mischief.\u201d As a second-grader, he wrote, he \u201cactually\u201d gave his music teacher a black eye because \u201cI didn\u2019t think he knew anything about music, and I almost got expelled.\u201d None of Trump\u2019s childhood friends recall the incident or Donald talking about it then. Asked about the punch recently, Trump said, \u201cWhen I say \u2018punch,\u2019 when you\u2019re that age, nobody punches very hard.\u201d At a 2009 reunion, [classmate Donald] Kass said, the teacher, Charles Walker, told him that Trump had never struck him.\n\nAdditionally, The Art of the Deal was not actually authored by Donald Trump, but by a hired ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz, who observed afterwards that Trump was often untruthful and \u201cseemed to remember almost nothing of his youth\u201d:\n\nFor the book, Trump needed to provide [Schwartz] with sustained, thoughtful recollections. He asked Trump to describe his childhood in detail. After sitting for only a few minutes in his suit and tie, Trump became impatient and irritable. He looked fidgety, Schwartz recalls, \u201clike a kindergartner who can\u2019t sit still in a classroom.\u201d Even when Schwartz pressed him, Trump seemed to remember almost nothing of his youth, and made it clear that he was bored. Far more quickly than Schwartz had expected, Trump ended the meeting. Week after week, the pattern repeated itself. Schwartz tried to limit the sessions to smaller increments of time, but Trump\u2019s contributions remained oddly truncated and superficial. Lying is second nature to him,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cMore than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
