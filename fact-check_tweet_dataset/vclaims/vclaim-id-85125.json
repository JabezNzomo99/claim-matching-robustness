After a 41-year-old factory worker was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, he asked the judge to replace his court-appointed male attorney with a female one. The judge went through the list of a half-dozen women practicing law in the county and picked Clinton. She has said she was not thrilled with the assignment but felt she had little choice but to take the court appointment \u2014 which the prosecutor in the case confirmed to CNN.\n\nCourt records describe a sad tale. Shelton, at the time 12 years old, went out for a late-night drive with Tom Taylor, then 41, a 20-year-old cousin, and a 15-year-old boy with whom she was apparently infatuated. They bought a pint of Old Grand-Dad whisky, which was mixed with Coca-Cola for Shelton. After hanging out at a bowling alley for a few hours, they allegedly drove to a ravine where the two older men left Shelton and the 15-year-old together. The two then had sex, the boy told police. After they were finished, Taylor approached the truck and apparently attacked Shelton. The boy reported that Shelton screamed and he saw Taylor hitching up his pants.\n\nAs part of her handling of the case, Clinton filed an affidavit July 28, 1975, requesting that the girl go through a psychiatric examination. \u201cI have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI have also been informed that she has in the past made false accusations about persons, claiming they had attacked her body. Also that she exhibits an unusual stubbornness and temper when she does not get her way.\u201d\n\nAlthough Clinton\u2019s legal maneuver would likely be prohibited today under Arkansas rape shield act, the law was not passed until two years after the case. Shelton said one of her worst memories of the case was being questioned repeatedly by appointed experts. \u201cIt got so bad that I told my mom I wasn\u2019t going back, and whatever happened, happened,\u201d said Shelton. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that a 12-year-old had to go through what I had to go through, because for days I cried and cried and cried over it.\u201d\n\nFor a variety of reasons, a plea agreement to a reduced charge was reached. Investigators mishandled evidence of Taylor\u2019s bloody underwear, cutting out the stain that contained semen for testing and then losing it. Newsday also quoted a retired detective on the case as saying that Shelton\u2019s \u201c \u2018infatuation\u2019 with the teenage boy, which she refused to admit,\u201d led to \u201cserious inconsistencies in her statements about the incident.\u201d The detective also said Shelton\u2019s mother \u201cwas so eager to end the ordeal she coached her daughter\u2019s statements and interrupted interviews with police.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Oct. 15: The gofundme site keeps getting changed. Notably, the story that Shelton told on the Sean Hannity show on Oct. 13 is different than Shelton\u2019s original account on the gofundme site: \u201cOn May 10, 1975, in Springdale, Arkansas, two men lured me into their truck with the promise of a soda. I knew them and trusted them.\u201d Now to conform with her interview on Hannity, it says: \u201cOn May 10, 1975, in Springdale Arkansas two men, one around age 40 and the other in his teens, yanked me off my bicycle as I was riding to church.\u201d She also told Hannity that she spent five days in a coma, but court records show that four days after the rape, which took place at 4 a.m., an investigator signed a report on his conversation with Shelton.\n\nMemories are malleable over time. The record shows that Shelton\u2019s memories of the case have changed, specifically concerning being forced to take a psychiatric exam that, it turns out, was not approved by the court. Shelton did not know about Clinton\u2019s affidavit asking for the exam in the 41-year-old case until it was shown to her by a reporter nine years ago. There is little indication that the outcome of the case would have been much different, no matter the defense attorney, given the mishandling of the evidence and Shelton\u2019s difficulties as a witness. Yet now the exam has become a key part of her story in order to raise funds.", "lang": "en"}
