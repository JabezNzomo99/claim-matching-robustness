The claim also encourages people to \u201cstock up\u201d on supplies and invites users to resend the message with their community. Many of the texts say the information was shared by \u201cmilitary friends\u201d in Washington D.C. ( here , here ).\n\nMost of the posts on social media featured a screenshot of a text message or plain text that reads:\n\n\u201cPlease be advised, within 48 to 72 hours the president will evoke what is called the Stafford Act. Just got off the phone with some of my military friends up in DC who just got out of a two hour briefing. The President will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make supply of everything. Please forward to your network. Note: my military friend just sent me the above text.\u201d\n\nThis claim is false. On March 15, 2020 the National Security Council (NSC) confirmed on Twitter that these \u201ctext message rumors of a national quarantine\u201d are fake( here ). President Trump did invoke the so-called Stafford Act. However, this law has nothing to do with mandating a quarantine but instead allows for the unlocking of federal funding for disaster relief.\n\nTrump invoked the Stafford Act at least two days before the fake text message started circulating, when declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency on March 13, 2020 ( here ).\n\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist state and local governments during \u201cnatural catastrophes\u201d and coordinate the nation\u2019s response. FEMA controls more than $40 billion in federal funding for disaster relief, that could be used to help build medical facilities and transport patients, among other measures.\n\nFEMA is commonly associated with natural disaster responses but the agency can also address pandemics ( here ).\n\nTrump has invoked the Stafford Act at various times during his presidency, approving major disaster declarations to address flooding in the Midwest and wildfires in California, among other events. In 2000, former President Bill Clinton used it to pay for mosquito control efforts to address outbreaks of the West Nile virus in New Jersey and New York.\n\nThe Federal Government, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has the authority \u201cto take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States and between states\u201d, but these measures have previously been directed to individuals and small groups. ( here ) The CDC gives an example of a quarantine order given to a person suspected of being infected with or having been exposed to COVID-19 here . The CDC also reports that \u201cIf a quarantinable disease is suspected or identified, CDC may issue a federal isolation or quarantine order\u201d but that a federal quarantine is rare. A large-scale isolation was last enforced during the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic in 1918-1919. (here).\n\nThe CDC also reports that \u201cIf a quarantinable disease is suspected or identified, CDC may issue a federal isolation or quarantine order\u201d but that a federal quarantine is rare.

On March 16, 2020 Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days and not congregate in groups larger than 10 people. He also said people should avoid discretionary travel and going to bars, restaurants, food courts or gyms ( here ).\n\nFalse: The Stafford Act recently invoked by Trump unlocks emergency response funds, it is not to mandate a nationwide quarantine\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
