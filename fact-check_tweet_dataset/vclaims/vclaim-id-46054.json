Sputnik said that Johnson would \u201cundergo artificial lung ventilation,\u201d citing an unnamed source \u201cclose to the U.K. healthcare authorities.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, April 6, the U.K. government denied the story and labeled it \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesperson also denied the use of ventilation and said that the prime minister was \u201ccomfortable.\u201d On Monday morning, Johnson said on Twitter that he was still in the hospital under observation, but was in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 3:35 pm EST: Later on Monday, UK officials said Johnson's condition worsened and he was moved into intensive care.\n\nSputnik also ran another story on Monday citing the spokesperson\u2019s statement that Johnson had not required a ventilator. Still, the article with the original claim remained up on the internet, as well as the tweets linking to it from Sputnik\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nOn March 27, Johnson announced he was self-isolating after testing positive for COVID-19 coronavirus. He is not the only world leader to be affected by the virus.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel spent two weeks in self-quarantine after learning that a doctor who had administered a vaccine to her had tested positive for COVID-19. She returned to work on April 3. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also underwent isolation after his wife Sophie tested positive.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is also reportedly self-isolating after shaking hands with a doctor who later tested positive for the coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
