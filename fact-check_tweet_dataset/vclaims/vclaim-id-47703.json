{"title": "FALSE: WHO issues protocols for lockdown periods", "subtitle": "WHO did not release any protocol for lockdowns, and calls this claim 'baseless and fake'", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Apr 17, 2020 8:57 AM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-47703", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/who-issues-protocol-coronavirus-lockdown-period", "vclaim": "In a tweet, WHO Southeast Asia said, \"Messages being circulated on social media as WHO protocol for lockdown are baseless and FAKE. WHO does NOT have any protocols for lockdowns.\" The tweet also tagged India's Ministry of Health and Press Information Bureau, as well as the United Nations in India.\n\nIndia's Press Information Bureau also issued a fact check on the claim with a graphic saying, \"WHO has NOT issued any such protocols or procedures of lockdown.\"\n\nThe false claim indicated India would \"relax the lockdown\" from April 15 to April 19, and that the \"second lockdown\" will run from April 20 to May 18. However, on April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the lockdown will be extended until at least May 3.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Inter-Agency Task Force on the coronavirus is set to discuss on Monday, April 20, what will happen after the end of the Luzon-wide lockdown on April 30.\n\n\"We will discuss what that scenario or possible scenario will be, the pros and cons, what we are ready to allow, new dos and dont\u2019s, guidelines after April 30,\" said Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Friday, April 17.\n\nAs of Friday, April 17, the number of coronavirus cases recorded in the Philippines approached the 6,000-mark, with 5,878 cases, 387 deaths, and 487 recoveries. Globally, over two million people have been infected with the virus, with a death toll of at least 137,500. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
