These claims have been repeated by outlets such as the Daily Wire and InfoWars, garnering more than 900,000 views altogether. Before this article was published, similar or identical claims were also made by multiple outlets, with many based on research findings that were not peer-reviewed and are of dubious validity. (Health Feedback covered several of these claims here, here, and here.)\n\nMosher\u2019s argument is based on announcements made by the Chinese government and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology in which China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, called for containment of the virus in a speech on 3 February 2020 and the Ministry \u201creleased a new directive\u201d on improving biosafety measures. The writer of the original article in New York Post asserts that these announcements indicate that \u201cChina [is having] a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong\u201d, and that \u201cevidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\u201d, which he labeled a \u201cbioweapons research lab\u201d. He finally concludes by saying that \u201cChina has unleashed a plague on its own people.\u201d\n\nInfectious disease experts who are actively involved in the coronavirus outbreak response explained to Health Feedback that Mosher\u2019s claims are inaccurate and misleading. Danielle E. Anderson, assistant professor and virologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, and part of the team that developed the world\u2019s first antibody test for COVID-19, said it is \u201csimply false\u201d to label the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as a bioweapons research lab, adding that biosecurity at the institute is top-notch.\n\n\u201cI have worked in this exact laboratory at various times for the past two years,\u201d she said. \u201cI can personally attest to the strict control and containment measures implemented while working there. The staff at WIV are incredibly competent, hardworking, and are excellent scientists with superb track records.\u201d\n\nAnderson pointed out that there was nothing unusual about the Chinese ministry\u2019s directive. \u201cThis sort of directive is something that is put in place immediately when dealing with a new pathogen\u201d, she said. \u201cI can guarantee that every research lab or hospital that handles the virus, virus derivatives, patients, or patient samples has drafted a similar mandate. I know that all the institutes that my work falls under have done so. It is a positive directive designed to enhance safety.\u201d\n\nMarc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, came to the same conclusion. \u201cAny responsible government would strengthen safety and security procedures in high-containment# labs that will and should be working with the novel coronavirus to develop countermeasures and diagnostics.\u201d\n\nOverall, this claim is based on unsupported speculations and scientific inaccuracies. In spite of this, it continues to be perpetuated in many outlets and public officials, have real-world repercussions. Peter Daszak, epidemiologist and president of the EcoHealth Alliance who has collaborated with WIV researchers, warned during an interview with the journal Science: \u201cThese rumors and conspiracy theories have real consequences, including threats of violence that have occurred to our colleagues in China.\u201d\n\nThe persistent spread of misinformation about the coronavirus prompted 27 eminent public health experts in the U.S., Europe, the U.K., Australia, and Asia to publish a statement in The Lancet on 19 February 2020 defending the integrity and response of China\u2019s health professionals:\n\n\u201cWe have watched as the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China, in particular, have worked diligently and effectively to rapidly identify the pathogen behind this outbreak, put in place significant measures to reduce its impact, and share their results transparently with the global health community. This effort has been remarkable. [\u2026] The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2@) and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] as have so many other emerging pathogens.\u201d\n\n\n\n Danielle E. Anderson, Assistant Professor, Duke-NUS Medical School:\n\n To provide context for my opinion, I will disclose that I am a scientist trained to work in high containment and have collaborative projects with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). I have worked in this exact laboratory at various times for the past 2 years. I can personally attest to the strict control and containment measures implemented while working there. The staff at WIV are incredibly competent, hardworking, and are excellent scientists with superb track records.\n\nThe article states: \u201cChinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: \u2018Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus\u2019\u201d and then implies that this is an abnormal directive designed to fix a lab breach. On the contrary, this sort of directive is something that is put in place immediately when dealing with a new pathogen. I can guarantee that every research lab or hospital that handles the virus, virus derivatives, patients, or patient samples has drafted a similar mandate. I know that all the institutes that my work falls under have done so. It is a positive directive designed to enhance safety.\n\nDesignating the Wuhan Institute of Virology as \u201cone of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China\u201d is simply false, as is stating [that Maj. Gen. Chen Wei is] the \u201cPeople\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s top expert in biological warfare\u201d. I don\u2019t know where to start on this comment. Mentioning that \u201cMaj. Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax\u201d doesn\u2019t even make her unique. Hundreds of scientists have that exact expertise. Swap \u201canthrax\u201d with \u201cNipah virus\u201d and that is also my CV.\n\nOne negative statement in the article is true, and that is the accidental infection with SARS (although surprisingly the article doesn\u2019t greatly emphasize the only fact). The story can be found here.\n\nThe article claims that bats are not sold at the Wuhan market, so they could not be the source of infection. The author chooses to imply that these animals are not sold illegally at the market, yet has no problem implying that lab animals are illegally sold.\n\nOverall, this is an appalling article.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health:\n\n This article contains lots of circumstantial evidence put together in an inflammatory way. Any responsible government would strengthen safety and security procedures in high-containment labs that will and should be working with the novel coronavirus to develop countermeasures and diagnostics, etc. This hypothesis for its origin has been judged very unlikely by leading experts in viral evolution.\n\n#: For a brief overview of different levels of biocontainment, please see this Public Health England website.\n\n @: The virus responsible for COVID-19 has been named SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization explains that: \u201cThis name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. While related, the two viruses are different.\u201d\n\nSimilar or identical claims on the origins of the coronavirus have been fact-checked by multiple organizations, including PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and AAP FactCheck.\n\nHealth Feedback also fact-checked other inaccurate claims that the novel coronavirus was artificially modified:\n\u2022 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) does not contain \u201cpShuttle-SN\u201d sequence; no evidence that virus is man-made\n\u2022 No, \u201cHIV insertions\u201d were not identified in the 2019 coronavirus, contrary to claims based on questionable bioinformatics study\n\nSeveral competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain where the novel coronavirus actually came from. Health Feedback investigated the three most widespread origin stories for the novel coronavirus (engineered, lab-leak or natural infection), and examined the evidence for or against each proposed hypothesis in this Insight article.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Zhou et al.
