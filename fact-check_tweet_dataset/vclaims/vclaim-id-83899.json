No, a firefighter inspecting the blaze\n\nMultiple social media accounts have shared a video showing a man in a high-visibility jacket in one of Notre-Dame\u2019s towers just after the fire broke out on Monday. Captions with the video imply the fire which ravaged the cathedral was not accidental, as investigators believe. However, the person in the video is a firefighter.\n\nThe video, posted by US-based Twitter user @TipsyPianoBar (archived link) on Tuesday has racked up more than 10,000 shares. The footage is accompanied by the caption, \u201cNo workers onsite. Who tf is this?\u201d The low-quality video, which appears to have been filmed on a smartphone, shows a man wearing a high-visibility jacket walking along a passage in one of Notre-Dame\u2019s towers.\n\nIn a later post, @TipsyPianoBar insists the person \u201cis not a firefighter\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is and have made no claims, but it is not a firefighter or a clergyman and French authorities say no workers present,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the cathedral\u2019s evacuation shortly after the fire broke out.\n\nIn a similar post, Ezra Levent, who describes himself as \u2018rebel commander\u2019 of alternative Canadian news site The Rebel Media, shares the video with the caption, \u201cWho is this? A fireman? A construction worker? Or someone else?\u201d The post has been retweeted more than 2,000 times.\n\nThe footage has also been shared by Italian and French Twitter accounts. One user said the person was dressed \u201cin a Muslim way\u201d.\n\nFrench lawmaker Meyer Habib also posted the footage, with the caption \u201cAccident or arson? No possibilities should be ruled out (...) The truth and nothing but the truth!\u201d\n\nThe video likely came from a tweet in Spanish, posted Monday at 8.51pm Paris time, as French fact-checking site Check News has reported. The footage appears to show a person on a smartphone filming a TV news report by Spanish channel RTVE.\n\nAmerican news station CNBC also broadcast a high-quality version of the footage on its YouTube channel. The person in the high-visibility jacket comes into shot 42 minutes into the video.\n\nShortly after, a man arrives wearing a helmet and oxygen tank (42 minutes 50 seconds). He appears to unroll a hosepipe before another man joins him.\n\nContacted by AFP, the Paris fire brigade confirmed that the man in the high-visibility jacket was a firefighter. \u201cIt's the Paris fire brigade\u2019s operations manager,\u201d spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gabriel Plus told AFP. He said the man was performing an \u201cinspection\u201d to assess the state of the fire.\n\nThe man was wearing a high-visibility jacket because he was the head of the rescue operations, said a fire brigade spokesman.\n\nInvestigators are treating the fire as an accident, the Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said Tuesday. \u201cNothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,\u201d he said, as AFP reported.", "lang": "en"}
