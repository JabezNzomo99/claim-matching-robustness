The claim is misleading; the New Zealand Defence Force said the video shows military cadets taking part in an annual training exercise for overseas deployments.\n\nThe video was published here by a New Zealand-based Facebook user on July 18, 2020. The clip has been viewed more than 22,000 times.\n\nText superimposed over the bottom of the video reads: \u201cSnowhaven Accommodation Ohakune, New Zealand\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s caption states: \u201cHere it is guys armed military in towns training up to control towns near you,\n\n\n\n \u201cGetting conflicting messages but have spoken to someone in the army he has said this is \u201cfairly new this kind of training and that things have definitely changed. But then people claiming this is common??\n\n\u201cEither way martial law is here and ready to be enforced with lockdown kind of a reality check to how things may look in the near future.\u201d\n\nOne Facebook user commented on the video claiming it shows \u201cmartial law\u201d, while another said: \u201cthis has been happening for years and years\u201d.\n\nOhakune is a small town on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, close to the active volcano Mount Ruapehu.\n\nNew Zealand ended its coronavirus lockdown in late April, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing some social distancing restrictions would remain, as AFP reported here.\n\nThe same video was also viewed more than 15,000 times after it was published here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nIt was also published here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe same video was shared again here with a claim which drew comparison with the current lockdown in the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nIt was also shared here on Facebook with a claim that it shows soldiers who \u201cwant to come into our home and vaccine us\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook posts, however, are misleading.\n\nThe video was filmed in Ohakune, as seen here on Google Street View.\n\nThe New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) military base at Waiouru is situated some 27km (16.7miles) from Ohakune.\n\nAn NZDF spokesperson told AFP in a July 21 email that the video shows military personnel taking part in a yearly training exercise for overseas deployments.\n\n\u201cThe video shows participants in Exercise Santici, a training exercise for New Zealand Army Officer Cadets based at Waiouru [military base],\u201d the NZDF spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cIt is carried out every year in and around Ohakune. The purpose is to train Officer Cadets in security and stability operations that they may have to use in overseas deployments.\n\n\u201cMost Ohakune locals are used to seeing the exercise being carried out.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the Ruapehu District Council, which presides over Ohakune, said military training exercises are run by the NZDF in the town.\n\n\u201cThe NZDF has a major training base in near-by Waiouru and uses Ohakune and other townships in the surrounding Waimarino area for training exercises from time-to-time,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Ohakune community paper, Ruapehu Bulletin, covered the military exercises in the July 22, 2020 edition here.\n\nAnother story here from the September 11, 2018 edition of the Ruapehu Bulletin reported on that year's Santici military exercises which also took place in and around Ohakune.\n\nPhotos from the 2018 exercises were posted on the New Zealand Army's Facebook page here.", "lang": "en"}
