He looked up to see a black woman being surrounded by the police. The police had her handcuffed, and were beating her. He thought the woman had committed a terrible crime. He found out \u201cthe crime\u201d she committed was to sit in a section reserved for whites. Paul McCartney was shocked. There was no segregation in England. But, here in America, the land of freedom, this is how blacks were being treated. McCartney and the Beatles went back home to England, but he would remember what he saw, how he felt, the unfairness of it all. He also remembered watching television and following the news in America, the race riots and what was happening in Little Rock, Arkansas, what was going on in the Civil Rights movement. He saw the picture of 15-year-old Elizabeth Eckford attempt to attend classes at Little Rock Central High School as an angry mob followed her, yelling, \u201cDrag her over this tree! Let\u2019s take care of that n**ger!'\u201d and \u201cLynch her! Lynch her!\u201d \u201cNo n**ger b*tch is going to get in our school!\u201d McCartney couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in America. He thought of these women being mistreated, simply because of the color of her skin. He sat down and started writing.\n\nAt least one detail in the post, that McCartney wrote the song in the U.S.m is not accurate: McCartney said in a 25 May 2002 interview with KCRW that he wrote \u201cBlackbird\u201d in Scotland, explaining that \u201cI remembered this whole idea of, \u2018You were only waiting for this moment to arise\u2019 was about, you know, the black people\u2019s struggle in the southern states, and I was using the symbolism of a blackbird. It\u2019s not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know. It\u2019s a bit more symbolic.\u201d\n\nThe post does, however, accurately recount McCartney\u2019s meeting and acknowledgement of Thelma Mothershed Wair and Elizabeth Eckford on 30 April 2016, when he tweeted a photograph of himself with the two women, who were among the first nine African-American students to enroll at Little Rock Central High School after the school\u2019s all-white attendance policy was deemed unconstitutional as part of the Supreme Court verdict in Brown vs. the Board of Education.\n\nThe photograph was posted the same day as McCartney\u2019s concert in Little Rock, when he introduced \u201cBlackbird\u201d with an explanation of the song\u2019s origin:\n\nWay back in the Sixties, there was a lot of trouble going on over civil rights, particularly in Little Rock. We would notice this on the news back in England, so it\u2019s a really important place for us, because to me, this is where civil rights started. We would see what was going on and sympathize with the people going through those troubles, and it made me want to write a song that, if it ever got back to the people going through those troubles, it might just help them a little bit, and that\u2019s this next one.\n\nThe title of McCartney\u2019s 2001 poetry book, Blackbird Rising, is also a reference to the song.", "lang": "en"}
