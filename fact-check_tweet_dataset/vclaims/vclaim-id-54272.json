This is false; the article had not been published at the time the claims were made, making it impossible for Carlson\u2019s home to have been targeted as a result.\n\n\u201cThis puke from the NEW YORK TIMES has published Tucker Carlson\u2019s home address & location,\u201d claimed a July 20, 2020 Facebook post shared nearly 9,000 times.\n\n\u201cANTIFA has shown up threatening his wife & kids,\u201d according to the post, which included a photo from a Google Image search for Murray Carpenter, a freelance journalist who sometimes works for the Times.\n\nOther social media users shared similar claims, with some even accusing Carpenter of calling for an attack on Carlson after revealing his address. These hoaxes led some people to support the release of Carpenter\u2019s private information in retaliation, a process known as doxxing.\n\nThe claims emerged after Tucker Carlson mentioned on July 20, 2020 that The New York Times was working on a story about the home that he lives in with his family.\n\n\u201cWhy is The New York Times doing a story on the location of my house? Well you know why, to hurt us,\u201d Carlson said on his show \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d before mentioning Carpenter and the photographer allegedly working on the story by name.\n\nCarlson\u2019s show, which leans pro-Trump, has an average audience of several million viewers every weeknight, and is the most-watched show in the history of cable TV.\n\nHowever, the Times\u2019 article has not yet been published.\n\nA search for \u201cTucker Carlson\u201d on the newspaper\u2019s website on July 22 showed that the most recent article featuring the TV presenter\u2019s name was a July 11 piece about a writer for Carlson\u2019s show who resigned after it was revealed he penned racist, sexist and obscene tweets.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not confirm what may or may not publish in future editions, The New York Times does not plan to expose Tucker Carlson's residence, which Carlson was aware of before his broadcast,\u201d the newspaper told AFP in an emailed statement.\n\nContacted by AFP, Carpenter declined to comment on the situation.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman told AFP by email that Carlson had taken issue with not being contacted about the story.\n\n\u201cMurray Carpenter has not reached out to Tucker Carlson for his story, nor has the piece been published,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nWhile Carlson\u2019s home was not targeted as a result of an article by the Times, political activists did gather at his residence two years earlier.\n\nIn November 2018, members of the self-proclaimed anti-fascist (Antifa) group Smash Racism DC gathered outside Carlson\u2019s residence in the US capital, yelling that he promotes \u201chate.\u201d They spray-painted an anarchy symbol on his driveway.\n\nDisinformation surrounding Carlson and The New York Times emerged shortly after a sexual harassment lawsuit accusing Carlson of making suggestive comments to a woman who had appeared regularly on his show. The lawsuit was filed by two women, and also targeted host Sean Hannity, commentator Howard Kurtz, and former chief national correspondent Ed Henry.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post, Fox said it had conducted a \u201ccomprehensive independent investigation\u201d and had found the claims \u201cfalse, patently frivolous and utterly devoid of any merit.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
