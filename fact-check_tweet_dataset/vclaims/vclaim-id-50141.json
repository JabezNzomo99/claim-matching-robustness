While measures have been introduced to send a second round of payments to Americans, they have not yet been signed into law.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law on March 27. The CARES Act, a $2.2 trillion relief package meant to alleviate the economic burden caused by the coronavirus pandemic, included direct payments of $1,200 to many Americans, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe viral Facebook post claims people can apply to receive a second, monthly stimulus check through a provided link. The user alleges she \u201calready filed for mine and will be receiving $2,000 a month for the next year\u201d and encourages everyone to sign up.\n\nBut the supposed application link is a hoax. The link the user provides directs people to an image of a gorilla with its middle finger extended, not an application. (RELATED: Was The CARES Act First Introduced In 2017?)\n\nWhile the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, which authorizes a second stimulus payment, has been introduced, it has so far only passed the House, according to CBS News. Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey also introduced in May a bill that would give many Americans direct payments of $2,000 a month, but it has not passed the Senate at the time of publication, according to CNBC.\n\nAs of press time, the U.S. has reported over 3.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and some 140,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
