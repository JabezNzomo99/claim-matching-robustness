This has been the main driver behind the family separations. Because children can\u2019t be prosecuted with their parents, the government treats them as though they had crossed the border alone and places them in shelters or with relatives living in the United States.\n\nCourts have ruled that the Department of Homeland Security must release undocumented immigrant children in their custody within 20 days. They must be housed in the \u201cleast restrictive setting\u201d while their immigration claims are resolved. Trump\u2019s executive order effectively directs the Justice Department to seek court approval to keep children detained for more than 20 days when necessary. That\u2019s how they plan to avoid family separations, because the decision to prosecute all parents still stands.\n\nWhat happens in the interim? And what about the children who have been separated already? The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that 2,342 children have been separated from their parents since May. The Department of Health and Human Services said it has not received new orders on how to handle them.\n\nThe key difference now? Under its \u201czero-tolerance policy,\u201d the Trump administration is choosing to prosecute all adults for illegal-entry offenses. This is a misdemeanor for first-time offenders under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. No president has chosen to enforce the INA\u2019s illegal-entry provision with the Trump administration\u2019s zeal, and no administration has separated families at the rates seen over the past several weeks.\n\nGraham mischaracterizes a 1997 federal consent decree. According to a 2016 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the \u201cFlores\u201d consent decree requires the federal government to release rather than detain all undocumented immigrant children, whether they crossed with parents or alone. The agreement doesn\u2019t cover any parents who might be accompanying those minors, but neither does it mandate that parents be prosecuted or that families be separated.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened since 2012, since DACA, just talking about unaccompanied children. Prior to that, somewhere between 3- or 4,000 unaccompanied children from Central America came into this country. Then DACA was instituted in 2012, and that problem skyrocketed. The numbers on it: about 225,000 unaccompanied children just from Central America, about \u2014 almost half a million family members. So we\u2019ve got another 750,000 individuals, very sympathetic, that we\u2019re just incentivizing to come here, and we have to stop.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.)", "lang": "en"}
