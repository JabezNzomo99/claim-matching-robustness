Andrew Cuomo\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis is theft of our money,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThere is no evidence Pelosi diverted money from Social Security for this purpose. The claim comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nPelosi is often a target of dubious claims on social media. In this case, a Facebook user shared a screen grab of an article alleging that the House speaker diverted $2.2 billion from Social Security to Cuomo\u2019s state budget. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Church Ask Her To Not Come Until She \u2018Finds God And Gets Help\u2019?)\n\n\u201cSince the outbreak of the deadly pandemic crisis that\u2019s been running rampant in the United States, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has been taking every opportunity he can to overshadow President Trump and add his \u2018expertise\u2019 to the conversation,\u201d reads the beginning of the article. \u201cHis constant, daily beseeching of aid for his especially-hard-hit state has become rote. And now\u2026\u201d\n\nThe headline and paragraph lift nearly word-for-word from an article published on Tatersgonnatate.com, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d However, the screen grab being shared on Facebook fails to disclaim the satirical nature of the content, portraying it as real.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have made baseless claims about Pelosi diverting Social Security funds. In January, the Daily Caller debunked a Facebook post claiming she had used $2.4 billion from Social Security to cover the costs of impeachment.\n\nSocial Security Works Executive Director Alex Lawson told CBS affiliate WUSA that it would be impossible for Pelosi to divert money from Social Security for such a purpose, saying, \u201cThe law is really clear here that the premiums that we pay into Social Security can only be used for benefits and the administration of services to provide those benefits.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
