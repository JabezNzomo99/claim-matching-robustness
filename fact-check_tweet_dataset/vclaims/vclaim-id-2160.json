And we have raised questions - there are still gaps, inconsistencies that need to be clarified by the Syrian authorities. There are suspicions that some chemical weapons are still hidden by the Syrian government. The recent incident in Khan Sheikhoun does reinforce such suspicions.\u201d\n\nA year earlier a report written by Uzumcu and seen by Foreign Policy stated that more and more gaps in the Assad regime\u2019s declarations were becoming apparent as the OPCW continued its work:\n\nIn a confidential two-page summary of the report, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu writes that the majority of 122 samples taken at \u201cmultiple locations\u201d in Syria \u201cindicate potentially undeclared chemical weapons-related activities.\u201d Many of Syria\u2019s explanations for the presence of undeclared agents, he added, \u201care not scientifically or technically plausible, and \u2026 the presence of several undeclared chemical warfare agents is still to be clarified.\u201d\n\nThis situation does not appear to have improved. Just a week before the Russian Foreign Ministry released its latest statement, Reuters published a report based on information from chemical weapons inspectors and diplomatic sources, who said that the Assad regime has been far from forthcoming in its declarations:\n\nSyria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\nSyria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learnt that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\nAt least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\nGiven the frankness of statements from the OPCW director-general in public, let alone more explicit statements from inspectors speaking under condition of anonymity, it cannot be seen how the Russian Foreign Ministry can justify its claim that the OPCW has overseen the complete destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal, nor how this could prove that the regime was not responsible for Khan Sheikhoun.", "lang": "en"}
