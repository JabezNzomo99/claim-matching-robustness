One post quotes the EU\u2019s chief election observer as calling it the most democratic vote in Nigerian history, while another claims the United Nations and West African regional bloc ECOWAS have asked the party of defeated candidate Atiku Abubakar to accept the results, calling them free, fair and credible. These remarks have been fabricated and they are more positive in tone than what the observers actually said.\n\nAmong the posts is this one by Facebook user Idris Ahmed, shared 2,300 times:\n\nIn a separate post Ahmed quotes Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia\u2019s former president and the head of the ECOWAS mission to Nigeria for the election, as saying that the election result \u201creaffirms the massive support of the Nigerian public to the fight against corruption\u201d.\n\nHe further quoted Eva Palmans of the European Center for Electoral Support (ECES), a non-profit group, as calling the election \"the most positive\" in Nigeria\u2019s history, and cites Maria Arena, the EU\u2019s chief observer for the election, as calling it the \u201cmost democratic\u201d Nigeria has ever held.\n\nThe EU, African Union, ECES and ECOWAS made various public statements about their monitoring of the February 23 election, which did not include these remarks. The real statements were more restrained in their tone.\n\nECOWAS published a statement Friday calling the words attributed to Johnson \u201cfake news\u201d and said she \u201cdid not at any time make such a statement\u201d. It said readers should look instead at the bloc\u2019s preliminary declaration, published on February 24, for the official ECOWAS position.\n\nThat document balances praise and criticism for handling of the election. ECOWAS said it \u201cconsiders the electoral process was largely peaceful and transparent as voters were able to cast their votes freely\u201d. But it also said there were \u201cmany shortcomings\u201d including logistical problems that led to the vote being delayed by a week, and misinformation during the campaign. Published before President Muhammadu Buhari was declared re-elected, it called on all party leaders to \u201cshow tolerance and restraint leading up to, and after, the announcement of the results\u201d.\n\nECES, like ECOWAS, called on Nigerians to ignore the posts on social media quoting its head of programmes Eva Palmans, describing the posts as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nLike ECOWAS, EU observers did publish a statement about the conduct of the election but were similarly restrained in their comments.\n\nThe EU mission said Nigeria\u2019s electoral commission, INEC, had operated in a difficult environment and that \u201cserious operational shortcomings\u201d had led to delays, but that election officials had made a number of improvements since the last presidential vote in 2015.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, there is a great need for more transparency and communication during the whole process, with political parties, civil society, the media and, most importantly, citizens,\u201d Arena said.\n\nINEC officially named Buhari as the winner on Wednesday, ushering him into a second term in the presidency. Atiku, his main challenger of the Peoples Democratic Party, rejected the result, calling it the worst in Nigeria\u2019s history and vowing to mount a legal challenge.\n\nMany of the false quotes have been posted and shared by people expressing support for Buhari\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress. Opposition PDP supporters have also been circulating some election results which AFP found to be fake.\n\nThe United States, Britain and France are among the countries that have congratulated Buhari on his re-election. The US said international and domestic observer missions had affirmed \u201cthe overall credibility of the election, despite localized violence and irregularities\u201d.\n\nThe British government concluded that \u201cthe UK believes the Nigerian people can have confidence in the result\u201d.\n\nBut it added in a statement: \u201cWe also recognise that independent Nigerian voices have expressed concerns about the conduct of the electoral process, in particular logistics and results collation, and reports of intimidation of election officials. We urge any party or individual who wishes to challenge the process to do so peacefully and through the appropriate legal channel and we encourage Nigerian authorities to examine all allegations of wrongdoing carefully, and take the necessary action against individuals found responsible.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
