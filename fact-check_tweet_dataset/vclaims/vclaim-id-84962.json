I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school \u2014 it just didn\u2019t seem possible.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Clinton, acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, July 28, 2016\n\nClinton has told this story in numerous speeches and even wrote about it in her 2003 memoir, \u201cLiving History.\u201d In these quotes, the woman sending Clinton to New Bedford is Marian Wright Edelman, president and founder of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, an organization Clinton worked for in the 1970s.\n\nSome New Bedford officials were \u201clivid\u201d at Clinton\u2019s portrayal of their home town in the DNC speech, while others were \u201creally proud.\u201d Then a former New Bedford mayor told local news outlets that Clinton\u2019s claim was incorrect, as his city provided transportation for children with disabilities in the 1970s. Several readers asked us to check it out to see who\u2019s correct, so we looked into it.\n\nFrom July 1973 to March 1974, staff members of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund worked with local organizations in 30 areas in nine states, including in New Bedford, to study just how many children didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t go to school. The 1970 Census had found that nearly 2 million children between 7 and 17 years old were not enrolled.\n\nBut the census data didn\u2019t fully capture the problem. For example, children weren\u2019t included in the data if they were expelled for disciplinary reasons or reported as receiving home or alternative education because they were pregnant or had a disability. The Children\u2019s Defense Fund wanted to get a better sense of all the barriers that kept children from attending school.\n\nAmong other things, the organization found that children with special needs or physical or mental disabilities were being excluded from school. Some parents elected not to send their children to school. Some public schools denied these children admission. At the time, 48 states (including Massachusetts) had compulsory attendance laws but also had statutes exempting children with disabilities. \u201cThe exclusion of handicapped children has grown out of the view that they are ineducable,\u201d read the Children\u2019s Defense Fund\u2019s 1974 report.\n\nIn 2008, the Boston Globe interviewed Bill do Carmo, then head of the local NAACP, who recalled meeting Clinton in New Bedford. But few others remembered her there, the Globe reported, as researchers were always coming to the city to study its high rates of poverty and school dropouts, especially among Portuguese immigrants.\n\nJohn Markey, the city\u2019s mayor from 1972 to 1982, told The Fact Checker that New Bedford contracted with a bus company to provide transportation for children with disabilities. He took issue with Clinton\u2019s highlighting the lack of access that New Bedford children faced in the 1970s. The service was already available when he was elected in 1971, and it kept running while he was mayor, Markey said.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Markey is incorrect, said Jonathan Carvalho, spokesman for New Bedford Public Schools. The school system couldn\u2019t track down a bus contract in the 1970s, but Carvalho said it\u2019s reasonable to believe that some students with disabilities had access to school transportation, while other children with disabilities stayed at home. It\u2019s not unique to New Bedford and is a reflection of the lack of compulsory attendance enforcement, Carvalho said.\n\nThanks to ace researcher Alice Crites, we found contemporaneous news articles confirming that not all children with disabilities in Massachusetts had access to school. In July 1974 \u2014 four months after the Children\u2019s Defense Fund staffers finished their field research \u2014 state newspaper the Lowell Sun published an article about a law set to take effect that September, mandating that all schools provide education to children with special needs. (The articles are embedded at the end of this fact-check.)\n\nIn September 1978, a Massachusetts law took effect requiring all \u201cmainstream\u201d schools to educate children with disabilities. That was three years after the federal government passed a law requiring all states to educate children with disabilities through the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).\n\nBased on contemporaneous news coverage and the 1974 Children\u2019s Defense Fund report published after the project carrying Clinton\u2019s name, it\u2019s clear that not all children in New Bedford (and elsewhere in the country) attended school if they had a disability or any other physical or economic barrier. That is not surprising, given that the federal law requiring all states to educate children with disabilities didn\u2019t pass until 1975.\n\nThe former New Bedford mayor acknowledged that not all students with disabilities may have taken advantage of the transportation service the city provided in the 1970s. That essentially renders concerns about the veracity of Clinton\u2019s story moot. Based on the information available from the time, there\u2019s no reason to doubt Clinton\u2019s story of meeting children in New Bedford in 1973 who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t go to school because of a disability.
