The claim is false -- a reverse image search and close comparisons with images from Google Maps confirm that the truck accident took place in Brazil, on a notorious stretch of road known in Portuguese as the \u201cdeath curve\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, shares pictures of the overturned truck on a scenic road. A closer look through the damaged truck door shows some coffins inside.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cThere is Hope for South Africa , This truck rolled and nothing was stolen from it.\u201d\n\nThough looting in South Africa has made international headlines in recent months, a reverse image search on TinEye quickly shows the images are from an accident in Esp\u00edrito Santo, a state in southeastern Brazil, in April 2017.\n\nLocal reports here and here describe in Portuguese how a truck loaded with coffins toppled over on the afternoon of April 10, 2017. The accident happened on a stretch of highway called ES-164, which connects Cachoeiro to Vargem Alta.\n\nThe reports and many more articles online speak about the numerous lives the stretch has claimed, describing it as the Curva da Morte, or \u201cdeath curve\u201d in English.\n\nAFP Fact Check confirmed the location of the accident using Google Maps Street View, marking the distinctive shape of the silhouette of the mountains in the horizon, the electrical lines on the right side of the road, and the rocky wall on the left rising over a sidewalk.\n\nTo confirm that we had correctly located the \u201cdeath curve\u201d on Google Maps, we also compared Street View images from the opposite direction to a 2015 local news video report about another accident on this stretch of highway.\n\nFrom the other direction on Street View, you can see big towering mountains \u2014 and the same ones in the video. So we can be sure that this is indeed the deadly stretch of the ES-164.\n\nEarlier this year officials said they would be writing to Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s director general of highways, Luiz Cesar Maretto, urging safety improvements for the road before it claimed more victims.\n\nHowever, this past weekend local news outlets reported that a bus accident there had claimed at least four lives, two of them children.", "lang": "en"}
