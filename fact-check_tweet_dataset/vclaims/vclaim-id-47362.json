The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\n\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\n\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork \u2014 depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries \u2014 was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994,\u201d the posts read. \u201cTell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\u201d\n\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport\u2019s public art available on the airport\u2019s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is \u201cnot from DEN\u2019s art collection.\u201d The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\n\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It\u2019s called \u201cChildren of the World Dream of Peace,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\n\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\n\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting \u2014 posted by Trinidad days earlier \u2014 on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece \u201cMaskcommunication.\u201d\n\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\n\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\n\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, \u201cUnited Against Corona- Express through Art,\u201d by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\n\nThe competition website lists the \u201c[d]ate of submission\u201d as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\n\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February \u2014 though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\n\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name \u201cNEHA\u201d appears in the top left corner of the painting.\n\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting \u2014 and we\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.\n\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 \u2014 and it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s a mural in the Denver airport.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
