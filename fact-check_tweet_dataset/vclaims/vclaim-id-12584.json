The report contains a full list of election \"observers,\" along with their party affiliations if known. The report can be found here.\n\nOn November 11, authorities in the Russian-occupied, self-proclaimed \u201cDonetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics\u201d held elections which were roundly condemned by the Ukrainian government. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv called the elections a \u201csham,\u201d while the European Union issued a statement declaring them to be \u201cillegal and illegitimate,\u201d and stating that the E.U. would not recognize them. The German and French government also issued similar statements condemning the elections.\n\nOn November 12, however, Russian state media agencies reported the results of the elections, and RIA Novosti reported that the elections were \u201cdemocratic and open\u201d according to observers.\n\n\n\n Russia has a history of using unqualified election observers both for elections within Russia and in the territories it controls by proxy. Polygraph.info has reported on this practice on several occasions. Typically the observers are a mixture of openly pro-Moscow individuals from various far-right and sometimes far-left European political parties.\n\nThis election appears to be no exception. For example, the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group noted that one of the requirements for being an election observer is that the individual monitors do not reside within the territory of the DNR or LNR.\n\nHowever, some observers clearly do reside within those territories, and some of them have either actively engaged in pro-\u201dseparatist\u201d activities or, in one case, have actually served in the military forces of the Russian-led \u201crepublics.\u201d\n\nFor example, one of the \u201cobservers\u201d was Janus Putkonen, a Finnish citizen who not only resides in occupied Donetsk, but also founded a media outlet there. A Vice reporter detailed an encounter with Putkonen in Donetsk, where he was also serving in the \u201crepublic\u2019s\u201d information ministry and vetting all foreign reporters working within the territory. He has reportedly lived in Donetsk since 2015, meaning that even by the pseudo-state\u2019s own regulations, he would be disqualified.\n\nOne story from the Russian news agency TASS quotes one \u201cobserver\u201d named Artur Leier, who is described as an assistant to a member of the Hamburg parliament. However, it turns out that Mr. Leier is a representative of the \u201cEurasian Society of Germany.\u201d In a video from April 19, 2018, Leier is interviewed by a pro-Kremlin \u201cjournalist\u201d Caleb Maupin in Yalta, in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nThe United Nations, in a report on election observation for its publication \"Women Watch\" pointed to the need for impartial observers, assembled from outside the election location:\n\n\u201cInternational observation groups usually keep themselves separate from domestic groups in order to preserve their image of impartiality, since the credibility of their assessment and conclusions will depend to a large extent on whether they are perceived as neutral and impartial,\u201d the report stated, noting there can be advantages to having a \u201cdomestic\u201d monitoring team working with international observers.\n\nIn Donetsk, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not carry out any observation of the elections.\n\n\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know who exactly might have observed over this weekend, there was no one involved from the OSCE,\u201d a spokesperson from the OSCE\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights wrote in response to Polygraph.info.\n\nThe OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which observes other activities in the territories, did mention the elections in a recent spot report, but could not comment on their authenticity.\n\n\u201cOn 11 November, in non-government-controlled Donetsk city, the SMM observed a slight increase in the presence of armed formations members in some areas of the city centre,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cIt saw buildings with signs that read \u2018polling stations\u2019, with two to four people in full combat gear and with assault rifles present outside most of them. In the vicinity, the SMM saw stalls similar to market ones.\u201d\n\nBeyond this, the report states that \u201cOther civilians separately shared concerns that people felt compelled \u2018to vote\u2019, as otherwise they would face interruption of salaries or health care in non-government-controlled areas.\u201d\n\nIn regards to international election monitoring missions, the Carter Center, the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute developed a set of principles for election monitoring, which the organizations say serve as \u201cprofessional guidelines for election observations\u201d \u2013 guidelines endorsed by more than 50 organizations.\n\nThe principles noted by the Carter Center include a lengthy process.\n\n\u201cElection observation missions start long before election day, with experts and long-term observers analyzing election laws, assessing voter education and registration, and evaluating fairness in campaigns,\u201d the Carter Center Democracy Program states on its Web site.\n\nElection day tasks include polling place observation, that continues for \u201cdays and weeks after the election\u201d as observers evaluation vote tabulation, any disputes over the election and final results.\n\nTASS reported on the day of the Donetsk election that \u201cforeign observers\u201d arrived just the day before the election.The TASS article noted that the delegation from Russia included members of the Federation Council and Russia and that observers who arrived on Saturday came from Abkhazia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, France, and South Ossetia. We have not seen a full list of the foreign observers.\n\nNovaya Gazeta reported November 12 that only Russian state media were allowed to be present at polling stations and that \"Russian, Ukrainian and foreign media were allowed on the territory of the republics.\"\n\nInterestingly, the newspaper reported that Kremlin officials had declined to recognize the legitimacy of the election, only that they \"respect\" the outcome.\n\nOnly days before the election, U.S. State Department Special Representative Kurt Volker in a conference call with reporters November 8 called the elections \"a mockery\" where people under occupation have \"no freedom of choice.\"\n\nHe called for a UN peacekeeping mission to create security and conditions for free elections \u200b.\n\n\"With the UN forces there you would need a period of time to organize elections, to allow for registration, to allow for candidates, to allow for campaigning, and to have those elections go forward,\" said Volker answering the question of a TASS writer.\n\nAnd so our judgment is that a statement the day after that \u201cthe elections were democratic and open\u201d can only be judged as false, given the lack of professional standards and what we know of the make-up of those who arrived Saturday.", "lang": "en"}
