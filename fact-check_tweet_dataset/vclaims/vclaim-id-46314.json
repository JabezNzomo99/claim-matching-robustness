Horse girls are supposed to love horses, not misinformation. But it\u2019s perhaps a big-hearted penchant for ponies that has led us to this moment: social media users indiscriminately amplifying a post that wrongly claims dozens of horses need to be saved from imminent death.\n\n\"ANYONE WITH A FARM WANT FREE HORSES,\" begins a message that is being widely shared on Facebook. \"FREE HORSES!!!! 52 thoroughbred horses need homes. Will go to Sugarcreek this Sat. for slaughter. Gentleman died due to COVID-19 and his son wants nothing to do with them. Most broodmares are broke and some are in foal weanling, yearlings, 2 yrs. and 3 yrs. old most are gelded. FREE and papered. Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes. (XXX) XXX-XXXX in Texas. Please copy and paste this on your status. I would hate to see all these horses put down. PLEASE someone help they are FREE and papered!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPlease don\u2019t call the number listed in the Facebook post. We\u2019ve replaced it with Xes here, but it might not matter. Other versions of the message are appearing on Facebook with the same promise of 52 thoroughbred horses who need homes but with different phone numbers and locations. This one claims they\u2019re in Fairhill, Md. In 2012, a version of this post claimed the horses were in the United Kingdom.\n\nYes, 2012! Well before the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 didn\u2019t exist when Snopes fact-checked what was already an out-of-date plea about the horses that originated after a longtime horse breeder in Ohio died in January 2011. His friend used Facebook to rehome the animals.", "lang": "en"}
