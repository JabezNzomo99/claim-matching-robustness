These claims are missing crucial context: masks are recommended in addition to and in conjunction with other methods such as social distancing in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Medical authorities have never said masks alone would stop the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe post reads: \u201cIf masks work, then let family back into hospitals and nursing homes to be with their loved ones. If they don\u2019t work, get them off our children. Someone is lying\u2026\u201d\n\nThe claim questions why families cannot enter hospitals or nursing homes if they have masks under the assumption that masks alone prevent the spread of COVID-19. While masks help prevent the spread, they need to be combined with other prevention methods to reduce contagion.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes on its website: \u201cSocial distancing should be practised in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\u201d ( here )\n\nCOVID-19 spreads in near contact with others and masks are a barrier that helps prevent respiratory droplets from traveling further ( here ). Wearing a mask in addition to keeping a distance of six feet can lower the chances of the disease being spread. A full list of prevention measures can be found here .\n\nSocial distancing effectively may be difficult in a crowded hospital or nursing home. Since older adults and those with existing medical conditions are considered at highest risk for severe illness, nursing homes and hospitals are restricting visits from family members and friends ( here ). In the United States, people aged 85 and above accounted for 31.7% of recorded COVID-19 deaths, while 79.3% of total COVID-19 deaths were among those 65 and older ( here ).\n\nOn the other hand, COVID-19 is rarely severe or fatal in children ( here ) but, like everyone else, they can transmit the coronavirus ( here , which is why masks are recommended for children. More on recommended mask wearing by age group is visible here .\n\nSome states like New Jersey have begun allowing visitors to nursing homes in an outdoor space ( here ) Other states like Texas allow visitors in nursing homes if there are no coronavirus cases among staff and residents. ( here )\n\nFollowing confusion over how masks protect people, the Atlantic reported in April on the benefits of wearing masks, which not only protect the individual but more importantly the people they come into contact with ( here ).\n\nResearch has shown that effective prevention methods such as mask wearing, and hand washing combined with social distancing \u201ccan be pivotal to achieving control over a COVID-19 epidemic.\u201d ( here )\n\nMissing context. The CDC recommends social distancing in combination with other preventative methods such as wearing a mask, avoiding touching your face and frequent hand-washing.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
