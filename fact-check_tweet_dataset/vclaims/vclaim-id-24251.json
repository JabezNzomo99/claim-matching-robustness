But that\u2019s only the average. It doesn\u2019t account for the kind of precipitation events or where they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true it\u2019s going to rain more everywhere,\u201d said Jack Scheff, an atmospheric scientist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, in a phone interview.\n\nIt will rain more in some places, he said, but less in others, and some may not change much at all. Or, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s fifth assessment report put it, \u201cChanges in precipitation will not be uniform.\u201d\n\nWith global warming, precipitation changes are more difficult to assess than temperature. So, scientists are less certain about them, and different climate models disagree about what will happen for much of the globe. But for the places on which the majority of the models do agree, it\u2019s typically drier spots that are projected to see drops in precipitation, while the bumps happen in wetter areas.\n\n\u201cThe high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation,\u201d the IPCC synthesis report said of a scenario with continued warming. \u201cIn many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase.\u201d The IPCC defines likely as having a 66 to 100 percent probability.\n\nAveraged precipitation also hides the precipitation-related part of climate change that scientists are most confident about: increases in extreme precipitation.\n\n\u201cWith global warming, there is more water vapor in the atmosphere and that tends to increase the intensity of certain precipitation events,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Gorman, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a phone interview. \u201cBut importantly, that applies mostly for heavy precipitation events.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Gorman noted that models project that most places on Earth, with the exception of certain ocean regions, will see heavy precipitation getting stronger.\n\nDownpours might be helpful in some cases, but they contribute to flooding, including flash flooding, runoff and soil erosion. And they can decrease water quality, as pollutants are washed into waterways humans rely on for drinking.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear it\u2019s not just going to be positive impacts,\u201d O\u2019Gorman said.\n\nAngeline Pendergrass, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who studies how precipitation changes with global warming, added that not only will heavy precipitation likely get heavier as the world warms, but light and moderate rainfall will become less frequent.\n\nKing jumped from his presumption of increased rainfall in \u201cmore and more places\u201d to concluding that deserts might shrink in a warming future.\n\nWhen asked about shrinking deserts, Pendergrass said, \u201cI would say that\u2019s not a thing. If anything, we expect deserts to expand.\u201d\n\nThere is some evidence, she said, that the large-scale circulation patterns that govern rainfall in the tropics and lack of rain in the subtropics might extend, widening the area without much rain.\n\nUniversity of Maryland climate scientist Sumant Nigam has researched the Sahara and found that the desert has increased over the last century, in part due to climate change. He pointed us back to the long-term trends in observed rainfall that find precipitation increases and decreases in different places.\n\n\u201cSome of the decreasing regions overlap with current deserts, like the Sahara, which is expanding,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThat does not, however, rule out the possibility that precipitation may be increasing over another Desert, but this was certainly not the case over the largest one.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Gorman said he was not aware of \u201cany evidence that would suggest the deserts would decrease in extent.\u201d\n\nUNC\u2019s Scheff, however, didn\u2019t reject the idea because he said it depends on a person\u2019s definition of a desert. Traditional definitions are pegged to precipitation amount, or the ratio of how much precipitation falls relative to the ability of the air to evaporate moisture \u2014 or what is called potential evapotranspiration. Under those definitions, he said, most research would suggest that deserts would stay about the same size or increase as warming continues. But if someone defines a desert by a lack of vegetation, deserts could shrink because global warming might increase plant growth, as we\u2019ll explain below.\n\nKing also suggested that added precipitation would \u201cexpand the green growth.\u201d Scheff said that some scientists, Scheff included, do think that a warming world might get greener \u2014 but not because of precipitation changes.\n\nInstead, what drives the added growth, he said, is the increase in carbon dioxide, which, because of basic plant biology, would allow plants to get more of the gas they need without losing as much water.\n\nPlants take in CO2 through tiny pores in their leaves called stomata. When the pores are open, however, plants lose water, so it\u2019s a delicate balance for a hungry plant to get all the CO2 it wants to perform photosynthesis and grow, while not becoming dehydrated and wilting.\n\nIf there\u2019s more CO2 in the air, which would be the case with increasing emissions, then plants don\u2019t need to open their stomata as much, reducing their demand for water. Scheff said that might mean plants would be able to grow more on the same amount of water, and that with climate change, there\u2019d be more plant growth.\n\nWhile the idea is somewhat controversial, Scheff said there is evidence that it\u2019s already happening. Satellite images, for example, show a greening trend in recent decades.\n\nBut, Scheff said, it\u2019s not necessarily clear that the greening trend will continue as the world warms. \u201cIf it gets too hot,\u201d he said, \u201cplants might start dying.\u201d\n\nAnd while Scheff leans toward the green growth aspect being helpful overall, it would come with some downsides. Weeds and some allergens, such as ragweed, he said, are likely to do especially well under higher CO2. So that part of farming might become more difficult, and people\u2019s allergies might get worse.\n\nAs Scheff noted in an email, and as we\u2019ve written about before, plant biologists have also shown that crops would become less nutritious \u2014 a process Scheff likes to call \u201cglobal starching\u201d or \u201cglobal fattening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is because with CO2 so abundant relative to other nutrients, the leaves become enriched in carbohydrates,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut depleted in nitrogen- and phosphorus-bearing compounds like proteins and phytochemicals.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve just established, King isn\u2019t wrong that climate change might have some upsides. But it\u2019s also true that there are many potential detrimental effects.\n\nThe exact impacts will vary region to region and will depend on how people adapt, MIT\u2019s O\u2019Gorman said. But, he said, there is a risk of \u201csome very serious negative effects,\u201d such as sea level rise and heat stress. \u201cThose would outweigh many of the possible benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nScheff said he considers CO2\u2019s ability to reduce the water requirements of plants one of the few silver linings of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s a silver lining on some really scary stuff,\u201d he said, also citing heat stress and sea level rise, as well as increases in extreme weather and the spread of disease. \u201cThere are way more bad things.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
