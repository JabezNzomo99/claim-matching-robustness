As their will be spraying medicine in the air in order to kill the COVID-19!! Share this information to all your friends, relatives and your families...Thank you!\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false, as there is no such government order for residents of Chandigarh, Bengaluru, or any other city.\n\nThe message is viral on Facebook as well as on Twitter.\n\nWe found that no such order has been issued by any state government or the municipalities of Chandigarh or Bengaluru.\n\nIn fact, the 'PIB Fact Check' Twitter handle, which is meant for countering misinformation related to government policies and schemes, has denied this viral message and tweeted, \"Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak, misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.\"\n\nAlso, no such vaccine to cure coronavirus is available worldwide and research to develop one is still under process.\n\nHence, these viral posts regarding spraying of chemicals to kill coronavirus is bogus.", "lang": "en"}
