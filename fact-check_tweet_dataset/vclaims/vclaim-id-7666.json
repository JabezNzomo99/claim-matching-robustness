It\u2019s not.\n\nThe story claims that a 79-year-old woman in Los Angeles \u2014 specifically, in the Watts neighborhood infamous for the 1965 riots \u2014 shot gang members with an AK-47 assault rifle after they had opened fire on two police officers.\n\nThe website that posted the story as though it were news also shared it on Facebook, where users wrote comments like, \u201cGuns save thousands and thousands of people\u2019s lives a year good going granny keep it up,\u201d and, \u201cWay To Go Grandma!!! Crooks can\u2019t win with an even playing ground!!!\u201d\n\nBut other Facebook users were skeptical and flagged the story as being potentially false. They are right.\n\nThe story first appeared on World News Daily Report in September 2015. That website includes a disclaimer that says: \u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Canadian publisher of World News Daily Report has been criticized for being a major source of misinformation, he maintains that his intent is to get people to think differently about important issues by using satire, as he explained in a French-language interview on Radio-Canada.\n\nBut, as is a common problem with false stories like this one, pieces written as satire are copied and posted on websites that don\u2019t have a disclaimer. In this case, it was the site patriotswalk.com, which is registered to an owner in Kosovo. At least four other clickbait websites are registered to the same owner.\n\nIn addition to questionable domain ownership, the story that the website copied also has some tell-tale signs that it\u2019s not true. To start, the photo of the elderly woman wearing camouflage and holding a gun has been making the rounds online since at least 2013, when it was featured in a Guns & Ammo caption contest.\n\nThe story also shows a picture of two police officers \u2014 who were misidentified \u2014 that dates back to 2010. It was posted on a neighborhood blog for a different area of the city than Watts.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cGRANDMOTHER WITH AK-47 SAVES COPS BEING ATTACKED BY STREET GANG.\u201d Patriotswalk.us. 28 May 2018.\n\nYates, Jeff. \u201cInterview with a Quebecer responsible for one of the worst sources of misinformation in the world.\u201d Radio-Canada. 27 Mar 2017.", "lang": "en"}
