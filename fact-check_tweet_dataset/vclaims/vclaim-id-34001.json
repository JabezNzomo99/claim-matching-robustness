A search of ProPublica\u2019s archive of deleted tweets yielded no results. There aren\u2019t any credible sources linking the statement to him online either.\n\nSanders, who was raised Jewish, has spoken about his religious beliefs on a number of occasions during his political career. For instance, he told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview that he believes in God but is \u201cnot actively involved with organized religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaith is a guiding principle in Bernie\u2019s life. Everyone practices religion in a different way,\u201d the Sanders campaign told the Interfaith Alliance of Iowa in a recent interview. \u201cFor Bernie, he would not be running for president of the United States if he did not have a strong religious and spiritual foundation.\u201d\n\nSanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has criticized \u201cunfettered capitalism\u201d in the past but also stated that he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve the government should own the means of production,\u201d according to Time. In a June speech at George Washington University, Sanders proposed a \u201c21st century economic bill of rights,\u201d including health care, affordable housing, education and a living wage.", "lang": "en"}
