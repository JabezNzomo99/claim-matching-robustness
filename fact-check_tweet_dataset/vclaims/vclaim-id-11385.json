We are close not only as Muslim brothers, but also as friends. We understand the nature of war and of what is happening in your country, in Palestine.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Palestinian delegation, Talal Naji, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, responded: \u201cWe love and are proud of President Vladimir Putin, because he is a friend of Palestine and not only Palestine, but all the people who are seeking freedom. President Putin succeeded in restoring Russia\u2019s authority in the international arena and forced all to respect Russia.\u201d\n\nBoth of Naji\u2019s assertions \u2013 that Putin supports \u201call people seeking freedom,\u201d and that he has succeeded in restoring Russia\u2019s authority and respect globally -- are false.\n\nThe Palestinian official praised Putin\u2019s supposed support for freedom-seeking people, in Grozny. The capital of Chechnya, however, was bombed to ruins during two wars between the Russian military and a Chechen insurgency that began as a secessionist movement in 1994 but turned jihadist in the early 2000's, after years of brutal fighting.\n\nIronically, Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s father, Akhmad Kadyrov, first declared a jihad against the Russian state. This marked a turning point for the insurgency that eventually lead to the emergence of violent radicalism in Chechnya.\n\nThough Grozny has been rebuilt, many Chechens say nothing has been forgotten. Anzor Maskhadov, who now lives in exile in Europe after the Russian Special Forces assassinated his father Aslan Maskhadov, who was Chechnya\u2019s first democratically elected president, posted this photograph in Facebook:\n\nAn American scholar, expert on Russia, the North Caucasus, and the Middle East, Walter Richmond posted the same photograph on Facebook in July comparing the photo of Grozny to recent images from Syria. Russia bombed indiscriminately the city of Aleppo, which according to the U.N., may have constituted a war crime.\n\nThe following developments have taken place under President Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership:\n\nAccording to multiple independent sources, Russia\u2019s immediate neighbors see Moscow as unfriendly and posing a security threat rather than an ally or partner.\n\nIn the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d zones in Russia\u2019s immediate neighborhood, Moscow has been playing a dubious role, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn Nagorno-Karabakh, while officially serving as a key peacekeeping authority, Russia has sold arms to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nIn Georgia, Russia openly supports the two secessionist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, including militarily.\n\nRussia maintains a military presence in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, a scenario that is being repeated in eastern Ukraine.\n\nNegative views and mistrust towards Russia among its neighbors increased after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, and then masterminded and orchestrated a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe shooting down of the civilian airliner MH-17 over Ukraine, which international investigators have held the Russian military responsible for, despite Moscow\u2019s denials and falsified evidence, further hurt Russia\u2019s reputation in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union, a group Russia created as an alternative to the European Union, is falling apart.\n\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stripped Russia of voting rights.\n\nRussia has lost its membership in the G7, an informal global club of industrial nations.\n\nIn response to Russia\u2019s state-orchestrated use of a military-grade chemical agent against a former Russian military intelligence agent and his daughter in Britain, dozens of countries expelled nearly 70 Russian spies posing as diplomats.\n\nBoth the EU and the U.S., and a number of other nations, have imposed sanctions against Russia for Moscow\u2019s international actions, including interference in the political processes of other countries.\n\nPew Research Center polls in 2017 showed \u201cRussia\u2019s international image is more negative than positive,\u201d with 34% of respondents viewing Russia \u201cin a positive light overall\u201d and 40% viewing it \u201cnegatively.\u201d Of the countries surveyed in the Middle East, where the United Nations has implicated Russia in war crimes in Syria, 93% of Jordanians, 62% of Turks and 61% of Israelis expressed a negative view of Russia, according to Pew. The Pew Research Center found that worldwide, a median of 60% say they lack confidence in Putin\u2019s global leadership.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations' tenth annual Preventive Priorities Survey ranked Russia among its eight \u201ctop tier risks\u201d to watch for 2018.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Russia\u2019s economic growth remains \u201cmodest\u201d (1.5% in 2018) despite relatively high oil prices.\n\nRussia\u2019s international reputation as a business partner has been tarnished by multiple corruption scandals and state-level criminal activities, including money laundering.\n\nIn Europe, Russia\u2019s state energy giant Gazprom is the target of an antitrust investigation involving eight EU countries.\n\nThe Freedom House 2018 report ranked Russia as \u201cnot free,\u201d calling its political system \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s 2018 Freedom House ranking for Russia marks a significant drop compared even to years immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thus, in 1999, the last year of pre-Putin Russia, Russia was ranked \u201cpartly free.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
