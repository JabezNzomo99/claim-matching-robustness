On 7 May, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, at a public meet in Mandawali, New Delhi, claimed that Congress has completely failed and that Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi was seen teaching abuses to innocent children of Amethi. Yogi Adityanath was reported by news agency ANI as having said: \u201cCongress has completely failed, Shehzada also failed so they brought in their Shehzadi. She was teaching abuses to innocent children of Amethi, please and go teach these abuses in Italy.\u201d CM Adityanath\u2019s claims were based on a viral video which was seen doing the rounds on social media a few days ago. The video was then shared by many, including Union Minister Smriti Irani and Abhijit Majumder, editor of MyNation, with similar claims. Uncouth to the core. Imagine the filthiest of abuses that a Prime Minister has to endure from people whose only claim to fame is a nose. Lutyens outrage anyone ???? https://t.co/T5sPyKtmbr \u2014 Chowkidar Smriti Z Irani (@smritiirani) April 30, 2019 Your hatred for PM Modi so deep rooted @priyankagandhi that you actually giggle gleefully when little children shower him with filthy abuses just to score some brownie points from you?? Being a mother yourself, didn't you feel ashamed of your actions even for a minute?? #Shame pic.twitter.com/NqSuDyX0Yy \u2014 Chowkidar Priti Gandhi (@MrsGandhi) April 30, 2019 The video begins with a man yelling \u201cChowkidaar\u201d, to which the children are seen enthusiastically responding \u201cchor hai\u201d, as Priyanka looks on. The sloganeering then segues into another slogan, where the children use expletives, to which Vadra is seen raising her hand to her mouth in shock. No, Video of People Raising Pro-BJP Slogans Not From Balochistan\n\nDid Priyanka Gandhi Teach Abuses to the Children? The claims made about the viral video are not true. Priyanka Gandhi did not teach abuses to the children of Amethi. The viral video is a doctored version of the original video. In the full video, Priyanka Gandhi actually stops the children after they raise the abusive slogans. The video was taken on 30 April when Priyanka Gandhi was in Amethi. Here is the full video, shared by Sarai Patel, national convener at Congress\u2019 social media department: When kids in their excitement make distasteful remarks against PM Narendra Modi.@priyankagandhi ji discourages them against raising such slogans and says \"Ache Bachhe Bano\"! pic.twitter.com/yNghJwJm91 \u2014 Saral Patel #AbHogaNyay (@SaralPatel) April 30, 2019 What Does Priyanka Gandhi Actually Say? The video begins with the children sloganeering \u201cchowkidar chor hai\u201d and then shows the children making use of abusive language. They can be heard chanting, \u201cNeem ka patta kadva hai, Modi s***a b****a hai.\u201d However, the original video shared by Patel shows Priyanka Gandhi and others telling the children, \u201c\u092f\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u092f\u0947 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u093e\u0964 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947 \u092c\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u094b\u0964,\u201d soon after they raise abusive slogans. Hence, in the original video, Priyanka Gandhi actually stops the children after they chant objectionable slogans and discourages them from using such words. But the edited video does not show that and has been framed in way to deliberately mislead.\n\nAt a press briefing later in the day, Priyanka Gandhi told ANI that she stopped children from raising objectionable slogans. \u201cI stopped children from saying slogans which I think weren\u2019t correct about PM. BJP edited the tape, removed the part where I was stopping them and they\u2019re making the allegation, which is typical of them. What they do is twist truth, what I do is speak the truth.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
