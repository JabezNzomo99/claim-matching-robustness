The clip is being shared with the claim that 'communists' in the state attacked a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).\n\nThe 47 seconds clip was shared on Twitter with the caption, \"this is how Communists in Kerala attacked peaceful #BJP & RSS bike rally in support of #CAA & NRC. (sic)\"\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nBOOM has in the past debunked fake and misleading posts shared by the same Twitter user.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nWe searched on Facebook with the same caption and found that it was viral with the misleading caption.\n\nWe broke the video into key-frames and ran a reverse image search using Yandex, a Russian search engine which results showed that the video was a year old and was not recent as claimed.\n\nThe search results led us to an article dated January 3, 2019, by the Times of India titled, \"Sabarimala row: Mob attacks hartal supporters at Edappal in Malappuram district of Kerala\" that had the same screen grab from the viral video.\n\nIn the 51 seconds clip by TOI, one can spot the same visuals as in the viral video. According to the TOI report, a large number of people attacked the supporters of a rally being held at Edappal in Malappuram district of Kerala.\n\nThe report further states that the organisation Sabarimala Karma Samithi had called a dawn-to-dusk hartal in the state in protest against the entry of young women to the Sabarimala temple.\n\nAfter two women under the age of 50 managed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Sabarimala temple the Sabarimala Karma Samithi had called for the daylong hartal in the state on January 3, 2019 reported the News Minute on January 2, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
