Claire McCaskill f", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26017", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/", "vclaim": "That\u2019s true \u2014 with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest.\n\n\"The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a \u2018pass\u2019 \u2014 free or otherwise \u2014 to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States,\" David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. \"It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse.\" The Biden administration \u201chalted deportations for all illegal aliens \u2014 murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported.\"\n\nBier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking it\u2019s wrong to \"prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child,\" that is not what this proposed law would do.\n\n\"It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents,\" Barreto wrote in an email. \"People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration.\" The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barreto\u2019s firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nThe bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawley\u2019s charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesn\u2019t make it more right.", "lang": "en"}
