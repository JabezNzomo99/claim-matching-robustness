Next, Adler said in his tweet, accompanied by a photo of the Jeopardy clue: \"What is the safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running?\"\n\nIs all of that true about Austin?\n\nNot all: In 2017, we found Half True an Adler reference to Austin as the state's safest big city. Not for the first time, we noted then that the FBI advises against using crime data it collects to declare one city \"safer\" than another. That said, such statistics at the time suggested both that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions and that El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016.\n\nThe morning after Adler posted his comment, which was retweeted more than 200 times, we reached mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford. Stanford advised by phone that Adler didn\u2019t have fresh information to offer in support of his 2018 \"safest big city in Texas\" statement. He suggested we check federal statistics to confirm Austin\u2019s jobless rate and told us that U.S. News had consecutively named Austin the nation\u2019s best place to live.\n\nOur search for Austin\u2019s jobless rate on the Texas Workforce Commission website showed that from January through March 2018, the latest month of available data, the city's jobless rate ran shy of 3 percent. We also fetched a longer view showing the city\u2019s jobless rate mostly staying below 3 percent from January 2017 on (all the rates not seasonally adjusted).\n\nAustin's unemployment rate was last above 3 percent, according to the TWC, when it was 3.1 percent in August 2017. The Austin rate's 15-month low, 2.5 percent, occurred in December 2017:\n\nAustin ranked best place to live two times in a row\n\nOn April 10, 2018, U.S. News announced that for the second straight year, the online publication found Austin the best place to live in the United States among the country's 125 largest metropolitan areas; Colorado Springs, Colo., placed second.\n\nThe rankings were based on affordability, job prospects and quality of life, U.S. News said, and on surveying thousands of U.S. residents \"to find out what qualities they consider important in a home town. The methodology,\" U.S. News said, also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--plus U.S. News rankings of the country\u2019s high schools and hospitals.\n\nAustin, the self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the planet, earned a score of 7.7 out of 10 for the 2018 rankings, U.S. News said, with even its few downsides having upsides.\n\nThe story says: \"The median sale price for a single-family home in Austin is well above the national median.\" Then again, the story says, \"Austinites' pocketbooks benefit from no personal or corporate income tax, and a low state and local tax rate.\"\n\nAnother semi-warning in the story: \"Summers in Austin take some getting used to, with temperatures often scorching.\" Though, the story says, the \"metro area experiences mild weather throughout the rest of the year, though temperatures have been known to drop in the winter.\"\n\nThe story also notes: \"Austin is among the nation's worst metro areas for traffic congestion.\"\n\nBut, the story says, that \"can be addressed with flexible work schedules, due diligence when choosing a neighborhood and, for those wanting to get in some exercise while commuting, using public transportation, walking and biking.\"\n\nAdler referred to Austin as the \"safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running.\"\n\nHizzoner was right about Austin\u2019s jobless rate of late and Austin getting named the city\u2019s best place to live two years in a row though it\u2019s worth clarifying that the rankings considered only the country\u2019s 125 largest metro areas.\n\nWhether Austin is the safest big Texas city rests on interpreting crime data the FBI counsels against using to compare communities. This said, we previously found that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions while in the first half of 2016, El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin.\n\nOn balance, we rate this Adler claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
