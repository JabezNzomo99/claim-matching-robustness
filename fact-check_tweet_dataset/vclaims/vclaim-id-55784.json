He claimed to have the \u201cultimate authority\u201d on such decisions and that his authority was \u201ctotal.\u201d\n\nAfter declaring independence from Britain and shaking off the yoke of King George III, the Founders of the United States adopted a system of government in which power would be split between the states and a centralized federal government.\n\nThe federal government has enumerated powers that it cannot expand, but the state legislatures are free to adopt powers not explicitly forbidden by their constitutions or the U.S. Constitution, according to Robert F. Williams, an expert on state constitutional law at Rutgers University Law School in Camden, N.J.\n\nThe 10th Amendment says, \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d\n\nJames Madison wrote in the Federalist 45: \u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s powers, Madison wrote, \u201cwill be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.\u201d The states, he wrote, would have power over \u201call the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to covid-19. Many states have adopted stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of the virus, but the economic costs have been steep and millions of people have lost their jobs amid the lockdown. Trump says he has the \u201cultimate authority\u201d to decide when states reopen for business. But a variety of governors and legal experts say he\u2019s wrong.\n\n\u201cThis is basic federalism \u2014 the role of the states and the role of the federal government,\u201d said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.). \u201cWe don\u2019t have a king in this country. We didn\u2019t want a king, so we have a Constitution and we elect a president. \u2026 All other powers remain to the states.\u201d\n\nThe moment the president declares a national emergency, as Trump did for covid-19 on March 13, many limits on presidential power can be set aside. But not all limits. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any constitutional provision, federal statute or court ruling that allows Trump to override the emergency actions taken by the states. Like the federal government, states also have strong emergency powers in their body of laws, especially to protect public health and safety. The stay-at-home orders in place operate under those laws.\n\n\u201cThe President has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses,\u201d Stephen I. Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has reinforced the separate roles of the states and the federal government multiple times. The court ruled in 1992 that the federal government cannot force states to run federal programs, what\u2019s known as the \u201canti-commandeering doctrine.\u201d In 1997, a court majority ruled that parts of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated the 10th Amendment because it was a federal law requiring state and local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on people attempting to purchase handguns.\n\nTrump said at the briefing that \u201cnumerous provisions\u201d in the Constitution gave him power over the states. The White House did not respond when we asked for an explanation.\n\nTrump claimed to have \u201ctotal\u201d authority over the states and the \u201cultimate authority\u201d to decide when they will reopen their businesses. But he couldn\u2019t point to any law or constitutional provision backing up that assertion, and the White House did not respond to our query.", "lang": "en"}
