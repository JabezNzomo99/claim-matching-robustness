A perfect summing-up of this approach can be found in the statement above by Nunes, who described it as \u201ca massive coverup of a major scandal that reached the highest levels of our government.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 2, President Trump declassified a memo written by GOP staff members of the House Intelligence Committee led by Nunes. Much of the GOP memo is about the FBI seeking a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The order was obtained on Oct. 21, 2016, about a month after Page said he had resigned from the campaign, and was renewed at least three more times over the course of a year.\n\nThe memo claimed that a source inside the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) spy agency alleged that Trump had financial ties to influential Russians and that the FSB had evidence of his engaging in compromising personal behavior, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. Steele told the FBI that he did not know whether the Shearer memo was accurate. (Winer, in an opinion article for The Post, said he did not share the Shearer material with anyone at State.)\n\nThe Clinton campaign, via a law firm, did seek \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump and Russia. Steele did rely on Russian sources, supposedly contacts mined from his years as a spy. Steele did actively seek to draw attention to what he had found, though virtually no reporters wrote about his allegations before the election because they could not confirm them. And the FBI did use Steele\u2019s reports to help obtain a court order allowing surveillance of a Trump associate \u2014 but that was after Page had quit the campaign.\n\nFor some, that may seem like a lot of smoke. But it\u2019s a huge leap to say Clinton colluded with Russians to do this. Instead, you have (a) the campaign hiring (b) a research firm that hired (c) a researcher who spoke (d) to Russian sources. Steele, for his part, has suggested he tried to alert reporters and the FBI because he was appalled by what he had discovered. The closest connection to Clinton is the fact that Steele gave to the FBI material written by Clinton associates, but it\u2019s unclear what the FBI did with that memo.\n\nMeanwhile, there is little dispute over the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia developed a clear preference for Trump \u2014 and that Russian entities hacked into Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign accounts to obtain emails that were then leaked to undermine her campaign. It certainly would have been a sophisticated game of three-dimensional chess for Russia to simultaneously seek to undermine Clinton\u2019s campaign while supplying her with information to spur an investigation of Russian activities on behalf of Trump.\n\nFinally, the Nunes memo disclosed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence operation in July 2016 because of allegations concerning another Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos. But Papadopoulos was never mentioned in any of Steele\u2019s reports. He came to the attention of the FBI because he had told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had obtained thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special counsel.", "lang": "en"}
