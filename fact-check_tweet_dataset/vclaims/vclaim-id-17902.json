No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real. Earlier on a site from the same network falsely posted a story about her checking into hospice but that was not real either.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on December 30, 2018 titled \"Loretta Lynn Leaves Note For Fans, Dies Peacefully\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLoretta Lynn checked into hospice yesterday looking to spend the last month or two of her life enjoying life on a morphine drip. Unfortunately, this morning, she passed away in her bed with a smile on her 93-year-old face and a note to her fans at her side. The note said: \"Dear fans, I'm dying. I wouldn't be so okay with it if our President was anyone but the wonderful Donald Trump. Please support him in the next election.\" Loretta has also donated her entire estate to the MAGA 2020 campaign, and urges everyone else to do the same: \"Whether you have a few dollars or millions, give it to Donald. Don't let him suffer when the Democrats start registering the caravan to vote.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and they would not have known it was fake from that:\n\nEarlier today a site belonging to the same network of satirical websites made up the story about her checking into hospice and leaving her estate to Donald Trump's re-election campaign:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
