On listening closely, the group can be heard saying: \u201c\u0938\u094b\u092b\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0939\u092c \u0915\u0926\u092e \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0913, \u0939\u092e \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948\u0902; \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092d\u093e\u0908 \u0915\u0926\u092e \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0913, \u0939\u092e \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u201d\n\nTaking cue from the name \u201cSofi\u201d and the word \u201cBJP\u201d, The Quint ran a search with the two keywords.\n\nThe results show that the people in the video were sloganeering for Mr Sofi Yousuf, the state vice president of BJP for Jammu and Kashmir, who is also the party\u2019s Lok Sabha candidate from Anatnag in Kashmir. His twitter handle is @sofi_yousuf.\n\nHe can also be seen in the video, although not very clearly.\n\nThe next step was to ascertain the location where the video was shot. The Quint searched with the keywords: \u201cSofi\u201d, \u201cKashmir\u201d and \u201cBJP\u201d.\n\nThe search led us to a video put up by Fast Kashmir where it was clearly stated that the video was of BJP Candidate Sofi Yousuf filing for nomination in South Kashmir's Anantnag.", "lang": "en"}
