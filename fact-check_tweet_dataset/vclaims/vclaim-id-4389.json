The host introduced Seagal as a \u201cRussian actor of American descent\u201d and asked Seagal to explain his \u201cdeep ties with Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nInternational Panorama is a TV program first aired in 1969, that became one of the Soviet Union\u2019s main informational weapons against the United States during the Cold war. The program survived throughout the years without even changing its theme music, and in many respects the show remains unchanged from 49 years ago.\n\n\u201cI am a Russian citizen since 2016. My father was an ethnic Russian from Vladivostok, Baikal, Irkutsk, Yakutiya,\u201d Seagal said.Then the actor said President Vladimir Putin is a \u201cpersonal friend\u201d due to their mutual love for martial arts.\n\nWhen the host asked about Russia\u2019s foreign policy and how it is reflected on Russia\u2019s international reputation, Seagal first said he \u201cwants to stay away from politics.\u201d However, Seagal went on to say he would do everything in his power to improve U.S.-Russian relations, adding that there is no reason for the bilateral relationship not to be \u201cgreat.\u201d He then praised Putin for pursuing a foreign policy aimed at \u201cfixing\u201d the \u201cimbalance of power\u201d that has been \u201cconfusing\u201d the world since the \u201ccollapse of the USSR.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure that President Putin\u2026 is trying to create a situation, in which the balance of power is more stable, and a little more logical and predictable,\u201d the actor said.\n\nSeagal's interview with the Info Wars Alex Jones (in which he claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin has defeated ISIS) translated into Russian and published on YouTube channel belonging to a group positioning themselves as Russian nationalist.\n\nThe Polygraph.info verdict on Seagal\u2019s claim is \u201cmisleading,\u201d since policy is always open to some degree of interpretation.However, let\u2019s look at the facts.\n\nSince 2014, Putin has faced international criticism and Russia has endured sanctions for its invasion and annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in February of that year. Seagal is well aware of those actions, as he performed at a concert celebrating the annexation in the Crimean city of Sevastopol in August 2014.\n\nIn addition to the annexation of Crimea, Putin also instigated a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced many more. The so-called \u201cpro-Russian rebels\u201d receive ammunition, financing, supplies, and training from Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry and intelligence agencies.\n\nRussia\u2019s intervention in Syria emboldened the regime of Bashar al-Assad, allowing it to prolong the war by launching offensives to retake Aleppo, Eastern Ghouta, and most recently, Daraa. During this time there have been three documented chemical attacks on civilians.\n\nRussia\u2019s military has also been involved in a number of other incidents since 2014, typically violations of the airspace of neighboring countries. One study found 39 such incidents in 2014 alone.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, although President Donald Trump tweeted as recently as this week that Russia has said it \u201chas nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!\u201d\n\nSeagal applied for and was granted Russian citizenship in 2016, and Putin personally presented Seagal with his new Russian passport in the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cI hope this will be yet another step, albeit small, probably a sign of normalization of our interstate relationships,\u201d Putin said, offering Seagal his pen to sign the passport.\n\nThe Russian leader might have placed his hope in a wrong celebrity. Seagal\u2019s reputation in the country of his birth is not spotless. What is more, his political influence in the United States seems non-existent, although last year he weighed in against professional American football players protesting treatment of African Americans by the police, and was quoted by a conservative newspaper.\n\nThe actor faces accusations by two women of rape and assault, which have been covered extensively in the mainstream Western media as well as the Hollywood press.\n\nPolygraph.info attempted to reach a talent agency that lists Seagal as a client, and a lawyer who has been quoted in recent news stories, but received no reply.\n\nSeagal\u2019s grandparents came to the U.S. from Russia. The actor himself was born in Lansing, Michigan.", "lang": "en"}
