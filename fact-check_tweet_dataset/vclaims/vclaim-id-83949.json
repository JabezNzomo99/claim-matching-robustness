(L&TFS)\n\nThe fake account Piyush Sharma, posting vulgar comments about Kashmir women, had listed his profession as 'Branch Manager at L&T Financial Services' in his Facebook bio.\n\nA reverse image search of two photos posted by the account also showed that they were stolen from the Facebook profile of one Alec Soffer.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the imposter account.\n\nLarsen and Toubro Financial Services has been firefighting a PR crisis after Twitter users tagged the company's official account with screenshots flagging the Facebook account Piyush Sharma's abusive replies.\n\nThese comments included making certain pornographic references towards Kashmiri Muslim women in the Facebook comments section.\n\nThe Facebook profile has since be deleted but an archived version of the profile can be found here. On further investigating Sharma's Facebook profile, BOOM also found some Islamophobic posts. Archived version of such posts can be found here and here. Note, the posts contain inappropriate language.\n\nBOOM reached out to L&TFS which in turn confirmed that the individual was not an employee of the company or associated with any of its subsidiaries.\n\n\"...This individual has falsely represented himself as an employee of L&T Financial Services. We confirm that he is not our employee and we are taking up this matter with appropriate authorities,\" a spokesperson for L&TFS told BOOM.\n\nThe company also tweeted a statement denying any association with the account.\n\nIt also clarified to multiple users that Piyush Sharma was falsely claiming to be one of its employees.\n\nThe fake account is another drop in the steady drip-feed of disinformation seen online on the back of the Indian government\u2019s shock announcement to abrogate Article 370 and revoke Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status.\n\nBOOM has debunked several such posts pushing certain narratives, since the announcement.", "lang": "en"}
