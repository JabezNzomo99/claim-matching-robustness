But clearly the photo used in the post being circulated is old and not related to Naikoo\u2019s death.\n\nIt is clear that the picture in question has no relation to the death of Riyaz Naikoo.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
