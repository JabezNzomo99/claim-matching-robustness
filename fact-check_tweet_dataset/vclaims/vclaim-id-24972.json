How these differences affect general intelligence remains a subject of academic discussion.

Of course, there are some Marie Curies, though that is rare,\u201d Smirnov added, citing the Biblical story of Eve seducing Adam with an apple.\n\nSmirnov\u2019s claims made headlines and sparked a public discussion in Russia. The independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta published an open letter to Smirnov, while popular writer Maria Arbatova calling the archpriest\u2019s statement \u201cextremism\u201d accused the Russian Orthodox Church of being \u201cunable to provide itself with the mentally healthy speakers.\u201d\n\nSmirnov\u2019s ideas are not unique to Russia, and in support of those ideas, two contemporary studies are cited the most in the media worldwide and among those sympathetic to the ideas expressed by the Russian Orthodox Church official.\n\nOne is \u201cSex differences in brain size and general intelligence,\u201d a study conducted by a group of scholars at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands and published in 2017. It has frequently been cited as direct proof that men are intellectually superior to women.\n\nThe study\u2019s co-author, Professor Dimitri van der Linden of the Institute of Psychology at the Rotterdam Erasmus University, told Polygraph.info that, \u201cIn general, this topic is a quite complex one, in which different studies show different results and many researchers have different and often strongly contrasting opinions.\u201d Asked for his opinion, van der Linden suggested reading the study and drawing conclusions based on that.\n\nThe abstract summary of the study reads:\n\n\u201cMales displayed higher scores on most of the brain characteristics, even after correcting for body size, and also scored approximately one fourth of a standard deviation higher on general intelligence (g). Mediation analyses and the Method of Correlated Vectors both indicated that the sex difference in g is mediated by general brain characteristics. Selecting a subsample of males and females who were matched on g further suggest that larger brains, on average, lead to higher g, whereas similar levels of g do not necessarily imply equal brain sizes.\u201d\n\nBut author and science journalist Angela Saini told the Sunday Times, the study is part of a long-running attempt by male neuroscientists to undermine women.\n\n\"For more than 100 years, male anatomists and neuroscientists have sought to find evidence of women's intellectual inferiority by comparing their brains to those of men. It's surprising that in the 21st century those efforts haven't ended,\" Saini said.\n\nFeminism in Russia is traditionally viewed as inappropriate and that view is supported by the government policy, a Russian scholar, Alexandra V. Orlova in a recent study.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, the Russian state has been deliberately pursuing politics of masculinity that aim to actively undermine feminist dissenting voices by presenting feminism as something that is foreign and inappropriate for the Russian context,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe one sphere in which feminists in Russia are advancing against the status quo is art, the Calvert Journal reported, calling the \"wave of feminism\" a \"tsunami.\"\n\nRussia's feminist group the Pussy Riot gained global fame after staging a protest at the Moscow Cathedral in February 2012. The Russian orthodox clergy condemned their performance as \"sacrilegious.\" Three members of the group had been convicted of hooliganism and sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nThe second study is \u201cTesting the Empathizing\u2013Systemizing theory of sex differences and the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism in half a million people,\u201d published in November 2018 by the U.S. National Academy of Science.\n\n\u201cThere is no scientific basis to Dmitry Smirnov\u2019s claim. There is no evidence for one sex being intellectually weaker,\u201d said a co-author of the study, Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Center at that U.K.\u2019s Cambridge University.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that, on average, males and females show different patterns of interest, a bias towards people-centered interests being more common in females and a bias towards objects and patterns (systems) being more common in males. These are differences on average, so do not apply to all individuals of one sex or another,\u201d Baron-Cohen told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cSadly, Smirnov\u2019s claim is no different to the sexist claims of the 19th century, which were groundless and morally repugnant and simply served to exclude women from careers in many fields,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is often criticized as being a powerful tool in the Kremlin\u2019s \u201chybrid wars\u201d both in Russia and abroad.\n\nPublic descriptions of women as \u201cinferior\u201d to men are not limited to religious figures, but often expressed by politicians, including Russia\u2019s top lawmakers.", "lang": "en"}
