In 1993, he married Elaine Chao. Now the secretary of transportation, Chao received a large inheritance when her mother died in 2007. McConnell reported it on his financial disclosure form in 2008 as a \u201cgift from a filer\u2019s relative\u201d valued at $5 million to $25 million.\n\nThe \u201cgift from a filer\u2019s relative\u201d has since generated much speculation \u2014 and years of fodder for negative ads \u2014 that McConnell and his in-laws are cashing in on Chinese connections while he leads the Senate. (He became majority leader in 2015, years after the inheritance.)\n\nRuth Mulan Chu Chao and James S.C. Chao were born in China, married while living in Taiwan and moved their family to the United States in 1961. The Chao family owns a shipping company called Foremost Group, based in New York, that has a sizable fleet of ships transporting dry bulk goods in Asia. James Chao founded the company in 1964 and the chief executive is now Angela Chao, Elaine\u2019s sister.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes magazine obtained a copy of Ruth Chao\u2019s will and posted it online, finding \u201cshe personally had nearly $59 million of assets to her name.\u201d Forbes calculated Elaine Chao would have received about $9 million from the will after her mother\u2019s death in August 2007. \u201cSecretary Chao has no interest, ownership or involvement in the company,\u201d a spokesman for Foremost Group said. The Transportation Department has said the same.\n\nElaine Chao, who was labor secretary under President George W. Bush, has earned significant income on her own, serving on corporate boards that brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, according to her financial disclosure report when she joined President Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nThe story of how McConnell got rich has nothing to do with Chinese trade deals, spycraft or the coronavirus. He simply married into a higher tax bracket. Other than the inheritance in 2007, no record shows McConnell or his wife receiving a financial windfall from the Chaos.\n\nThe last time McConnell sought reelection, in 2014, Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes charged he \u201cquadrupled his net worth on the backs of hard-working Kentuckians that can\u2019t afford it\u201d \u2014 a reference to the inheritance. In 2018, a Republican candidate in West Virginia ran ads dubbing McConnell \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d because of the connection to Foremost Group. His evidence? The inheritance. The Lincoln Project, a media-savvy group of disaffected Republicans running ads of its own this year, recently received Three Pinocchios for suggesting McConnell got rich through government service. The evidence? Yes, you guessed it, the inheritance.\n\n\u201cMillions and millions came to McConnell and his wife in recent years from a company whose business was powered by Chinese trade,\u201d said Terry Sebastian, McGrath\u2019s campaign spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s more than fair to point out that fact to voters.\u201d\n\nKevin Golden, McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, called the ad racist. \u201cCould anyone imagine this ad running in an election if Elaine Chao was born in Europe?\u201d Golden said. \u201cThis is a despicable attack on Senator McConnell\u2019s wife whose family fled communism, earned their success through relentless hard work, and have lived the definition of the American dream.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve given these ads Three Pinocchios before and will do so again. McConnell became rich because he married into a wealthy family with a profitable business. Specifically, his wife, Elaine Chao, received an inheritance from her mother.", "lang": "en"}
