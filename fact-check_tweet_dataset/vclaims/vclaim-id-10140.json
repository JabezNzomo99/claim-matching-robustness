The full text of the hoax read:\n\nWe have found no reports in any reputable news source about this strike. It is not known at the time of publication if the perpetrator of the prank managed to get to stay home. But judging by the spelling and grammar of the prank it is perhaps not such a bad idea for the prankster to attend a few classes... Bad writing or not, the article managed to fool several thousand people into liking, sharing or commenting on it on Facebook today.\n\nTrend News is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles. All pages on the site carry following disclaimer at the bottom:\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!", "lang": "en"}
