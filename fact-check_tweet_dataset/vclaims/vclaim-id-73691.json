(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBut these are not pictures of Blake, a 29-year-old Black man who was shot and partially paralyzed by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23, while his children watched from a nearby vehicle.\n\nFirst of all, the person in the images doesn\u2019t resemble Blake.\n\nSecond, they previously spread on social media in connection with the death of 16-year-old Pierre Loury, who was shot by a police officer in 2016 in Chicago.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find credible sources confirming that the person in these photos is Loury, either. His Facebook account now only shows two photos, including one that says \"R.I.P.\"\n\nA different photo the Chicago Tribune published from Loury\u2019s Facebook page in 2016 shows him posing with a gun. His mother \"said the photo was taken while he was promoting a rap song, nothing more,\" the caption says.", "lang": "en"}
