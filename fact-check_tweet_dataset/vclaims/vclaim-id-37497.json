[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck has examined the contention that eating disorders are the most deadly psychiatric disorder.\n\nFirstly, the term psychiatric disorder is interchangeable with mental disorder. The two key diagnostic reference manuals used by medical professionals in Australia - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [2] - both classify eating disorders as mental disorders, and both specifically name anorexia nervosa in this category, among other eating disorders. It\u2019s relevant to note that harmful use of, and dependence upon, psychoactive substances are also classified as mental disorders [3].\n\nIn 2014, the results of a meta\u2010review (or review of systematic reviews) exploring the risks of mortality from major mental disorders were published. The Risks of All\u2010Cause and Suicide Mortality in Mental Disorders meta-review covered 407 relevant reviews, with data on more than 1.7 million patients and in excess of 250,000 deaths. It concluded: \u201cThose with the highest all\u2010cause mortality ratios were substance use disorders and anorexia nervosa.\u201d [4].\n\nThis followed the results of a 1998 study, Excess Mortality of Mental Disorder [5], which also found the \u201chighest risks of premature death, from both natural and unnatural causes, are for substance abuse and eating disorders.\u201d\n\nIn summary, it is AAP FactCheck\u2019s position that while Butterfly Foundation chief executive Christine Morgan\u2019s statement was not misrepresentative, it would have been more accurate to say eating disorders have the \u201cjoint highest\u201d mortality rate of any mental disorder.", "lang": "en"}
