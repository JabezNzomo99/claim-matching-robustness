JNU Students\u2019 Union president Aishe Ghosh was also injured in the ruckus.\n\nSoon after, a collage of two photos one showing Ghosh with a bandage on her left hand, and the other with a bandage on the right hand has been going viral on social media. While the first photo shows her walking with some people, the second photo in the collage shows her speaking holding a microphone. Both pictures show her head bandaged as well.\n\nThe claim along with the viral collage says Ghosh has been faking injuries. You won\u2019t be able to figure out when a bandage on the left hand jumps on to the right, says the text in Bengali superimposed on the collage. The claim in Hindi translates to, The injuries of JNU\u2019s Aishe Ghosh are special. Yesterday it was on one hand, today in another. And we are all fools.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the second image has been flipped to mislead. Ghosh was injured on her left hand.\n\nFacebook user Ravindra Bharatiya posted the claim, the archived version of which can be seen here.\n\nAFWA reverse-searched both images separately and also used keywords to unearth the truth. We found that the first image in which Ghosh is seen walking with some people appeared in a news article by News18.\n\nThe article, dated January 8, shows Ghosh with bandages on her left hand and head. The image credit has been given to news agency PTI.\n\nThe second image showing Ghosh holding a microphone in hand appeared in a news article by Hindustan Times on January 7.\n\nThe caption in broken English along with the photo says, JNUSU President Aisi Ghosh addresses media personnel at JNU campus during a protest against the Sunday\u2019s attack on attack.\n\nThe photo, clicked by HT photo journalist Vipin Kumar, shows Ghosh with her left hand and head bandaged. The viral photo has been flipped. Here\u2019s the comparison:\n\nThe article also carries a video, and it is clear from both the video and photo that Ghosh was injured on her left hand.\n\nHence it is clear that the viral image of Ghosh holding a microphone has been flipped and she was injured on her left hand.", "lang": "en"}
