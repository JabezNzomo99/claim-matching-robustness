And it was a month after the administration declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability.\n\n\u201cThe CDC designed a good system.\u201d Fauci said on March 13. \u201cIf you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.\u201d\n\nAnother problem, which we\u2019ve outlined before, was a manufacturing issue with the CDC\u2019s test kits, which it had sent to state and local public health labs in early February.\n\nThe CDC didn\u2019t provide a fix for the manufacturing issue for more than two weeks after it revealed the problem. The Food and Drug Administration then, on Feb. 29, said it would allow labs to create and use their own in-house tests immediately, and about a week later, private diagnostic companies began to step in with their own tests.\n\nWeeks prior, two former Trump administration officials, in a Jan. 28 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, had recommended working with the private sector to meet the anticipated testing needs, saying past experience showed the CDC wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the volume of testing.\n\n\u201cIf the number of cases increases, experience from the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2015 Zika epidemic suggests that the CDC will struggle to keep up with the volume of screening. Government should focus on working with private industry to develop easy-to-use, rapid diagnostic tests that can be made available to providers,\u201d wrote Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, and Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA.\n\nDr. Pierre E. Rollin, who worked for the CDC for 27 years, retiring in 2019 as head of an epidemiology team for the Viral Special Pathogens branch, told us the U.S. government, and the CDC in particular, \u201cnever had the capability\u201d to produce large quantities of tests. It hasn\u2019t been the case, Rollin said, that one institution \u201cgovernmental or nongovernmental\u201d would produce test kits for the entire population.\n\nRollin pointed to flu testing as an example: Those are commercial tests, with the CDC playing a role in checking different commercial tests and helping labs verify they\u2019re getting good results.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be reasonable for a government institution to decide to compete with private industry. That doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Rollin, who wrote a March 26 opinion piece for STAT, saying it \u201cshouldn\u2019t come as a surprise\u201d that the CDC wasn\u2019t able to respond quickly to a pandemic like this but questioning why the CDC \u201cseems to be sitting on the sidelines for this pandemic\u201d now.\n\nBorio also told NPR in a late March interview that \u201ctraditionally, our nation has relied on the CDC to get the initial testing out to public health labs. So they\u2019re the first to launch, and they have done so with tremendous success over prior epidemics. But we have to remember that they\u2019re not a manufacturing facility; they are a research and reference lab,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in this instance, they encountered some serious technical challenges which really exposed a significant vulnerability in our national capability to roll out tests quickly.\u201d\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC during the Obama administration, from 2009 to 2017, similarly told USA Today that Trump\u2019s claim about a \u201cbroken\u201d testing system is \u201cjust wrong. They inherited the system that has worked in every prior emergency. Now, it\u2019s fair to say this is an emergency like no other. But CDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the United States.\u201d\n\nFrieden said in a March 31 opinion piece for USA Today that in addition to the CDC\u2019s flawed test kit being a problem, the FDA \u201cwas slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests\u201d and the Department of Health and Human Services was also late in working with the private sector to develop widely distributed tests.\n\nTrump, however, has blamed \u201ca testing situation that just wasn\u2019t right,\u201d as he said in the March 29 coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cIt was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation.\u201d\n\nFormer and current officials have explained that having the CDC distribute tests was only good for a relatively small situation, but that doesn\u2019t mean the system was \u201cobsolete\u201d or \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\nThe following day, the president repeated the assertion, saying in the task force briefing that \u201cthis administration inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn\u2019t work. It was okay for a tiny, small group of people, but once you got beyond that, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have built an incredible system.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump said in a March 30 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview: \u201cWe inherited a broken test. The whole thing was broken and we rebuilt it.\u201d (There was, of course, no inherited \u201ctest\u201d for the new coronavirus, but the president appears to have misspoke in that instance. He went on to talk about the amount of testing being done now in the United States.)\n\nWe asked the White House for an explanation of the president\u2019s repeated comments, but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nHere we provide a timeline of the testing issues and the administration\u2019s statements and response.\n\nJan. 18: The CDC test was operational, as a subsequent CDC report suggests.\n\nJan. 20: The CDC used its own kit to confirm the first case of COVID-19 in the U.S.\n\nJan. 24: The CDC confirms the second case in the U.S. \u201cCurrently, testing must take place at CDC, but CDC is preparing to share these test kits with domestic and international partners,\u201d the agency said.\n\nJan. 31: The Department of Health and Human Services declares a public health emergency for the U.S.\n\nFeb. 5: The CDC ships test kits to state and local public health labs, as well as international labs.\n\nFeb. 12: The CDC reveals that some labs were having problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked. It was a manufacturing problem with one component of the test, CDC later says.\n\nFeb. 25: Only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing \u2014 in addition to the CDC processing tests itself. \u201cCommercial labs will also be coming online soon with their own tests,\u201d a CDC official tells reporters.\n\nFeb. 28: The CDC says it had a fix for the manufacturing problem and had manufactured new tests.\n\nFeb. 29: The FDA says labs can create and use their own in-house tests as long as they complete an emergency use authorization request within 15 days.\n\nMarch 4: Trump falsely claims that he had to end an Obama-era FDA \u201crule\u201d to more quickly provide diagnostic tests to the public. Experts later told us no such formal regulation was ever implemented under President Barack Obama. Trump may have been referring to the Feb. 29 FDA announcement, allowing labs to use their own tests before getting an emergency use authorization approved by the FDA. But that announcement allowed an exception to a de facto FDA policy; there was no \u201crule\u201d that needed to be overturned.\n\n\n\nMarch 5: LabCorp says its test is available for health care providers to order. Quest Diagnostics says it will provide testing four days later.\n\nMarch 6: The U.S. had conducted 1,326 tests, according to data collected by The COVID Tracking Project, including tests with results pending. The group, run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, says it attempts to provide \u201cthe number of people being tested, not specimens submitted,\u201d but it also notes state public health authorities, the source of the bulk of the data, are inconsistent in the way they report their information and the quality of their data varies.\n\nMarch 12: In a congressional hearing, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asks who was in charge of \u201cmaking sure \u2026 as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible.\u201d Fauci answers: \u201cThe system \u2014 the system does not \u2014 is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. \u2026 The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.\u201d\n\nMarch 13: Trump declares a national emergency. The administration holds a coronavirus task force briefing in which Trump announces a \u201cnew partnership\u201d with the private sector. \u201cTen days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the same briefing, Fauci says: \u201cThe system was not designed \u2014 for what it was designed for it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you\u2019re seeing, because you can\u2019t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it.\u201d\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, credits Trump for asking for \u201can entire overhaul of the testing approach\u201d and calling on \u201cprivate sector laboratories\u201d to develop tests. \u201cFollowing the meeting last week, major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic companies took immediate action to adopt and develop new testing systems,\u201d she says.\n\nTrump and Birx suggest Google was developing a screening website that large numbers of Americans could use to see if they should be tested and where they could go to get a test. But it turns out the website is a project of a sister company to Google and limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nMarch 16: Roche announces that it will have completed shipping the first 400,000 of its high-volume tests to hospitals and reference labs by the end of the week.\n\nMarch 16: A total of 41,814 tests had been conducted in the U.S., according to The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nMarch 21: The FDA announces it has given emergency use authorization to a 45-minute test developed by Cepheid for point-of-care use in hospitals to help manage patients and health care workers. Cepheid plans to start shipping tests by the end of March.\n\nMarch 24: Trump and other administration officials tout a milestone in testing, saying by that day the U.S. will have done \u201cmore testing\u201d in eight days than South Korea had done \u201cin eight weeks.\u201d But on a per-capita basis, the U.S. still lags behind South Korea, and other countries, as we explain.\n\nTrump says, without evidence, that the U.S. test \u201cis considered the best test.\u201d One expert told us there\u2019s \u201cno reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)\u201d than those being run in other countries.\n\nMarch 27: Abbott labs announces that it has received emergency use authorization from the FDA for its point-of-care test, which provides results within 13 minutes. Unlike the LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics tests, specimens don\u2019t need to be mailed in to be tested \u2014 a process that can take several days \u2014 and instead can be run on a toaster-sized machine in urgent care clinics or doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. had conducted 1.1 million tests, according to The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nMarch 31: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio tells CNN the state isn\u2019t \u201cquite sure\u201d when it will see a peak in cases but expects it will be \u201cbetween mid-April and mid-May.\u201d DeWine says: \u201cPart of this is driven by the fact that we don\u2019t have, you know, widespread testing. That is not unique to Ohio.\u201d\n\nCorrection, April 2: We originally wrote that it was more than a month after HHS declared a public health emergency that the administration took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, including by the private sector. It was one month before the FDA allowed labs to use their own in-house tests, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability.
