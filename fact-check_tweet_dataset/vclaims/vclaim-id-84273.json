Bill 84, which aims to prohibit hate-promoting demonstrations on the grounds of the Ontario legislature in Toronto, does not make any mention of Christians or Christianity. The Ontario MP who proposed it told AFP that Christians are not targeted by the bill.\n\n\u201cCanada Moves to Ban Christians From Demonstrating in Public Under New Anti-Hate Proposal,\u201d according to a headline on Big League Politics, an online website founded by former employees of ultraconservative US website Breitbart News. The article adds in a subhead that \u201cThe Canadian province of Ontario is considering legislation that would officially criminalize Christianity.\u201d\n\nThe article, which was shared more than 16,000 times on Facebook and on Twitter, refers to Bill 84, a proposed law in Ontario\u2019s provincial legislature otherwise known as \u201cProhibiting Hate-Promoting Demonstrations at Queen\u2019s Park Act, 2019.\u201d\n\nAlthough the article features a photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Liberal head of the federal government is not connected to the bill. The bill is not federal, but provincial and was moved by Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario member of parliament Roman Baber.\n\nThe bill, which passed two readings and is currently referred to the Standing Committee on Justice Policy, aims to prohibit \u201cany demonstration, rally or other activity that, in the opinion of the Speaker, is likely to promote hatred against any identifiable group from being permitted on legislative precinct grounds.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clegislative precinct grounds,\u201d refers to the Ontario Legislative Building\u2019s site, on Queen\u2019s Park in downtown Toronto. If passed, Bill 84 would amend the Legislative Assembly Act, the set of rules for the Ontario legislature, to include a ban on demonstrations deemed to promote hate against a particular group.\n\nBaber, a member of Ontario Premier Doug Ford\u2019s ruling party, told AFP that \u201cit\u2019s inconceivable, given the way that the bill is drafted, that it could be used to suppress the free speech of Christian Ontarians or of any other religions.\u201d\n\nThe Big League Politics article quotes at length from an opinion piece published on Life Site, presenting opinion as fact.\n\nThe Life Site article raised concerns over the definition of \u201chate,\u201d but Baber said that the intent of the bill is to refer to section 319 of the Canadian Criminal Code.\n\nA search for the words \u201cChristian\u201d and \u201cChristianity\u201d in the bill\u2019s text shows no results, nor are any other specific religious, social or political groups mentioned.\n\nIf the bill passes the justice committee, it will have to go through a third reading in the Ontario Legislature.", "lang": "en"}
