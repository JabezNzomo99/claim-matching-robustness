There is no evidence that Pelosi ever said this.\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2014, Reuters reported that wait times for emergency care could increase under Obamacare, citing a report by emergency physicians.\n\nThat same day, an article appeared, supposedly penned by Pelosi herself, that addressed this prospect directly. \u201cI doubt such dire fears will ever come true,\u201d it quotes her as saying. \u201cBut for argument\u2019s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that \u2018Obamacare\u2019 will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do. In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?\u201d\n\nAt the top of the article, Pelosi is quoted as making the remark found in the meme.\n\nIf these words sound far-fetched, that\u2019s because they come from Duh Progressive, a political satire website. Pelosi\u2019s office told Politifact in 2014 that the congresswoman never made this statement, and we found no news clips or press reports suggesting that she did.\n\nThough Duh Progressive has a disclaimer noting that it\u2019s a satire website, the meme shared on Facebook not only fails to issue a similar warning, it deceptively insists that the quote is real.", "lang": "en"}
