It is impossible for anyone to own a million tons of gold.\n\nOnly an estimated 190,040 metric tons of gold has ever been mined worldwide throughout history, according to the World Gold Council, a market development organization for the gold industry. This is equivalent to 209,483.24 US tons.\n\nOn the other hand, the US Geological Survey's (USGS) website says that there are 187,000 metric tons (or 206,132.21 US tons) of gold that have been historically produced.\n\nThe USGS also says there are 57,000 metric tons (62,831.75 US tons) of underground reserves of gold, which brings the total amount of discovered gold to 244,000 metric tons (268, 963.96 US tons).", "lang": "en"}
