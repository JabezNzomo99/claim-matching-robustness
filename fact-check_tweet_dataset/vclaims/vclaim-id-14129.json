The post, which also contains other pictures purporting to show human flesh, is misleading; the images are actually from a vegan protest and a promotional event for a video game.\n\n\n\nThe photos shared in this Facebook post show people smeared with a red liquid that looks like blood and wrapped in what resembles supermarket meat packaging.\n\nThe post, which has been shared more than 133,000 times since it was published on August 14, 2017, also includes images of tinned tuna and what looks like meat in the shape of a person.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Filipino-language caption, translated to English, says in capital letters:\n\n\u201cWill you believe\u2026 Reminder to all OFWs abroad don\u2019t buy corned beef or meal tuna there\u2026 Their content is human meat\u2026 This is spread out all over the world\u201d.\n\nOFWs refers to Overseas Filipino Workers, millions of whom are deployed outside of the country for their jobs, according to this report by the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nA reverse image search on Google traced the vertical photo back to this article dated May 12, 2010, about a protest held by animal-rights organisation People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in the US.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the image from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the picture as it appears in the report on PETA (R):\n\nAnother reverse image search on Google traced the top-right image in the Facebook post to this report in UK newspaper the Telegraph, dated May 23, 2016, about a demonstration in Spain against meat production and consumption.\n\nThe image is visible eight seconds into a video that is embedded in the report.\n\nBelow is an image comparing the picture in the misleading Facebook post (top) with the video still in the Telegraph report (bottom):\n\nThe bottom-right image in the post is a montage that was deemed potentially \u201cviolent or graphic\u201d on Facebook and greyed out.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the image:\n\nA reverse image search of the bottom picture in the montage led to this 2012 multimedia report in the Daily Mail about an event to promote the launch of the video game \u201cResident Evil 6\u201d, which included meat in the shape of human body parts.\n\nHere is a screenshot from 1:17 in the video included in the report, which shows the fake \u201cmeat body\u201d:\n\nThe upper image in the montage also came from the same video-game event. This post on canada.com, dated October 2, 2012, uses the image.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report, which credits the image to Capcom, the developer of Resident Evil 6:\n\nComments like the one below show some people believed the misleading post was genuine.\n\nThis comment, when translated to English, says: \u201cThis is true even my parent-in-law in America she saw herself that those are humans not all corned beef contain beef so please watch news about other countries so that you will know the truth\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
