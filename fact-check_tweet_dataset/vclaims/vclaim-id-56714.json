Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay shooting an effigy of Mahatma Gandhi. Fact: There is no BJP MLA with the name \u2013 \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019. Many random videos are being posted on social media falsely attributing them to a fictitious character \u2013 \u2018BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019. In the video posted on social media, the woman shooting at Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s effigy is Hindu Mahasabha National Secretary Pooja Shakun. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThrough reverse image search, the same video was found to be uploaded by \u2018Times of India\u2019. As per the news video, the woman seen shooting the effigy of Mahatma Gandhi is Hindu Mahasabha National Secretary Pooja Shakun. She was later arrested by the UP Police for her actions.\n\nWhen searched on the \u2018My Neta\u2019 website about \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019, it was found that there is no BJP MLA with the name \u2013 \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019. But there were two persons with that name- one is Dr. Anil Upadhyay, a leader from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Rajasthan and the other is Anil Kumar Upadhyay, an independent candidate from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAnother image (archived) showing a semi-naked man groping a woman is also being shared claiming that the man in the photo is BJP MLA, Anil Upadhyay. But as we have found earlier, there is no BJP MLA with the name \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019.\n\nEarlier, when several other videos claiming to be related to \u2018BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019 were shared on social media, FACTLY has debunked them through this fact check.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman shooting Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s effigy in the video is Hindu Mahasabha national secretary Pooja Shakun. Also, there is no BJP MLA with the name \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
