But a widely shared Facebook post claims, without evidence, that he died from something else.\n\n\"I have a friend who is a friend of Joe Diffie,\" the April 13 post says. \"They labeled his death as a COVID-19 death and it wasn\u2019t! So the family asked why it was listed as the COD and the nurse told them they\u2019ve been labeling as many as they can with the virus because that\u2019s how they\u2019re getting funding. So there ya go! Now we know that the numbers are false because many who have passed didn\u2019t die from the virus, but another cause. That\u2019s how they\u2019re getting the $$$$ and that is the truth.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOn March 27, Joe Diffie posted a statement on his verified Facebook page that said: \"I am under the care of medical professionals and currently receiving treatment after testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). My family and I are asking for privacy at this time. We want to remind the public and all my fans to be vigilant, cautious and careful during this pandemic.\"\n\nOn that same Facebook page, on March 29, a photo of Diffie was posted with the dates 1958-2020.\n\n\"GRAMMY-winning country music legend Joe Diffie passed away today, Sunday, March 29 from complications of coronavirus (COVID-19),\" the post said. \"His family requests privacy at this time.\"\n\nSome social media posts have claimed that Diffie died of lung cancer. On Instagram, Diffie\u2019s wife unequivocally disputed that.\n\n\"My husband @officialjoediffie did NOT HAVE LUNG CANCER,\" she wrote. \"His father passed, same name, November 2018 to stave IV lung cancer. STOP STARTING FAKE NEWS. I\u2019ve seen multiple posts and it\u2019s upsetting to all of us.\"\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve looked into claims that hospitals get paid more for patients who are suffering from COVID-19. While it\u2019s standard for Medicare to pay hospitals more for patients who go on ventilators \u2014 and Medicare is paying an additional 20% for the treatment of COVID-19 victims as part of a federal stimulus deal \u2014 evidence indicates that COVID-19 cases are being undercounted, not inflated so that hospitals can cash in.", "lang": "en"}
