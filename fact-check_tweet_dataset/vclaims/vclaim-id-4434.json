The article, bearing the headline \u201cSenate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced by U.S. Constitution,\u201d began as follows:\n\nStill reeling from Trump\u2019s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn\u2019t yet another crony of something called \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d Senate Democrats announced Friday. \u201cTime and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. \u201cAnd it\u2019s always \u2014 always \u2014 the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don\u2019t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it\u2019s time for that to end.\u201d Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn\u2019t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. \u201cWe need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren added. \u201cNot people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,\u201d stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.\n\nOf course, Senators Schumer, Warren, and Booker did not make the statements attributed to them in the article, which was satirical in nature. Nonetheless, after the Babylon Bee article was published, someone worked its headline and the three (fake) quotations from Democratic Senators into meme form, along with additional critical commentary:\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who created this meme, but it was provided with greater online reach after it was posted to Facebook by David Clarke, the former Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump. In an edited Facebook post, Clarke later acknowledged that the quotations were made up from the Babylon Bee and apologized for what he called the \u201cglaring omission\u201d of failing to mention (at first) that the underlying source was satirical.\n\nInevitably, the meme and the fake quotations it contained were taken seriously by some viewers, who posted criticisms of Schumer, Warren, and Booker in response to Clarke\u2019s post.", "lang": "en"}
