There is no mention of crime or drugs, and it assumes a $12 billion to $15 billion wall. The Trump administration has requested $18 billion for the first installment of the wall, but as we have written, experts believe the final price tag would be $25 billion.\n\nRecall that Trump during the campaign claimed Mexico would be forced to pay for the wall along the border with the United States, but now that he is president he has asked for money from Congress. So suggesting the wall pays for itself is a way of softening the blow of breaking a campaign promise.\n\nFirst of all, readers should know that this is supposed to reflect lifetime (i.e., 40 years) fiscal impact (taxes paid minus services used) of immigrants by education. According to Camarota\u2019s calculation, each undocumented immigrant results in a net fiscal drain of $74,722, largely because they are less educated. Although Fox News assumed undocumented immigrants \u201cgo on the federal dole,\u201d Camarota correctly noted that less-educated illegal immigrants have less fiscal impact than less-educated legal immigrants, and so he adjusted for that.\n\nThe savings are counted upfront, even though they would only play out over a long period. This is done under a concept known as net present value, which essentially boils down a whole bunch of numbers involving decades of costs or benefits into one big number. This makes it easier to compare an immediate fact (the building of a wall) with a long-term fact (the nonarrival of an immigrant).\n\n\u201cThis makes no sense,\u201d she said. \u201cAn average is appropriate when you have similar things with variation and you are trying to get a central tendency. Our eight scenarios are completely different ways of thinking about the question.\u201d She likened it to \u201caveraging not just apples and oranges, but watermelons and blueberries and saying the answer tells you something about fruit.\u201d\n\nDonehower said her own calculation, using a scenario that she thought was most appropriate, is that each undocumented immigrant blocked at the border would actually cost the U.S. government $8,000 a person, rather than save $75,000, largely because of the impact of children. We won\u2019t get too deep in the weeds, but essentially any cost of the initial immigrant ($18,000 in her calculation) would be made up by the impact of children (+$26,000).\n\nChristopher Mackie, the NAS study director, said he found the 160,000 to 200,000 estimate \u201chighly dubious\u201d because \u201cnet migration across the border has been zero, and possibly a bit less than zero (net out-migration), since around 2008.\u201d He also said the CIS study failed to account for an economic/labor market cost to slowing immigration. \u201cTo the extent that the wall would decrease immigration, it would shrink the economy, especially given the current demand for low-skill workers in certain industries (construction, food processing, farming),\u201d he said.\n\nCamarota defended his analysis, saying he was \u201ctrying to be reasonable\u201d in his assumptions and purposely did not rely only on scenarios that would have made the net fiscal savings even higher. He argued it was fairer to rely on an average. \u201cThe one scenario Gretchen picked out of eight is the only one that produces a positive number,\u201d he said. \u201cAll seven others, with or without descendants, produce negative numbers.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the president and Fox News should have been more careful about how they characterized the study. It\u2019s an estimate of an estimate of an estimate, which falls short if any of the variables change. Even if one accepts the numbers, it still does not cover the expected cost of the wall in 10 years.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to offer Pinocchios in this instance, given the dispute over assumptions, but it is striking that the experts who assembled the NAS study reject Camarota\u2019s use of their data. We will be watching carefully to see if other politicians \u2014 or the president \u2014 cite this research again without the appropriate caveats.
