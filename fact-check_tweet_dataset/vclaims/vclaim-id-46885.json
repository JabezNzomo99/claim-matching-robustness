Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh Police have been drawing flak for its treatment of protesters demanding the scrapping of the Citizenship law.\n\nThe 19 second long clip was tweeted by All India Congress Committee's national secretary Dheeraj Gurjar with a misleading narrative in the wake of the CAA protests.

Is this the way Modi government respects women?\"\n\nThe video is also viral on Facebook, where netizens have identified it as an incident from Lucknow. The video has been doing the rounds with the caption, \"The video is being said to be from Lucknow and it is shared from there.

We were directed to the same video that was used in an ABP news bulletin in January 2016. According to the report, the video is from Delhi where protesters were thrashed outside the RSS headquarters, when they were demonstrating against the suicide of Hyderabad-based Rohith Vemula. Vemula, a PhD scholar in the University of Hyderabad, committed suicide after being suspended from the varsity on grounds of a complaint lodged by the BJP's student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). Vemula's stipend of Rs 25,000 was also stopped, after he raised issues \"under the banner of the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA). His death triggered nationwide student protests. The video was described as, \"Delhi police brutally assaults female protesters demanding justice in Rohith Vemula case\"", "lang": "en"}
