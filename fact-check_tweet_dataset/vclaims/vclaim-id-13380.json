Telegraph's report says that the image is of a protest staged by the women's wing of political party Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Bhubaneswar, Orissa against the central government's decision to phase out subsidy on LPG cylinders. The image was clicked by their reporter Ashwinee Pati. Click here to read the article.\n\nWhile Eyewitness's article does not say that women protested using gas cylinders, it claimed that some women showed their LPG gas bills when BJP leaders asked them for signatures of support. Citing 'reports' the article claims, women asked them to fix the LPG rates before deciding whether women need to enter Sabarimala. It also says, BJP and Congress are working together to score politically, leaving people confused about their real political intentions.\n\nBOOM did not find other Malayalam dailies reporting the incident. And, though the image of women holding the cylinder was not of Kerala, Eyewitness did not specify that it is a representational image. Moreover, it is evident that there were attempts to hide the fact that the photos are from Orissa.\n\nA comparison of the original image and the image used by Eyewitness shows that it has been edited to cover the Oriya text in the banner behind the women. And, since the image has been cropped, the scarves wrapped around their neck are not fully visible. However, the original picture (see the image on the right) shows that the scarves have the conch, BJD's logo, printed on it.\n\nBOOM also found another image of the protest from a website called WomanOdisha filed in August 2017. Below is a screenshot of the article.", "lang": "en"}
