The claim is false; the footage in fact shows a man diving in the Indian city of Indore, which experienced major flooding in August 2020.\n\nThe 49-second video was published on Facebook here on August 25, 2020. It has been viewed 2.1 million times and shared 13,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cKarachi, Surjani Town ! The poors\u2019 Charna Island.\u201d\n\nSurjani Town is a neighbourhood in Karachi, a major port city in Pakistan. Charna Island is a small uninhabited island just north off the coast of Karachi and is a popular swimming and diving destination.\n\nThe same footage was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here; on Twitter here and here; and on YouTube here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA commenter on the misleading YouTube post suggested the video was actually recorded in Indore, a city in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nA keyword search found the video was also published in several posts on Twitter that identified the location as Indore. One of the tweets, for instance, reads: \u201cRains in Indore broke a 100 year record yesterday. Chacha (uncle) wasted no time.\u201d\n\nFurther online searches found a man claiming to be the diver in the video.\n\nThe man, who identified himself as Indore resident Zafar Ahmed Khan, addressed the false claim in a video published on Facebook here on September 1, 2020.\n\nThe man states in the video: \u201cMy name is Zafar Ahmed Khan \u2026 Due to flooding we were busy rescuing the people. After that I dived [into the water] and the video became viral. After it became viral it was broadcast as a video from Karachi, Pakistan \u2026 That is fake news. I am in fact a resident of Indore, Madhya Pradesh.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis guy who lives in Indore is Zafar aka Bhura Bhai, a few days back he was seen jumping from his terrace in a pool of rainwater. His video got viral. That video was shared by Indian Media News18 with a claim that it is from Karachi, Pakistan. Listen to what Bhura Bhai has to say.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Facebook video (L) and the footage shared in the misleading posts (R):\n\nHeavy rainfall and widespread flooding in Indore in late August 2020 was widely reported by Indian news outlets; for example by India's National Herald newspaper here and by English-language daily newspaper The Times of India here.", "lang": "en"}
