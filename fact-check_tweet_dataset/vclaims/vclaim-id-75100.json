You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Allegiant Air Tickets! We only have 468 Tickets remaining so hurry up!\" claimed a website with the URL allegiant.com.flywithallegiant.win/Nn57col.\n\nThe alleged number of tickets left randomly fluctuates every time the web page is refreshed \u2014 sometimes 149 tickets remain, at other times the number goes up to 571, or 596, or drops to 322.\n\nRegardless of the number, the overall claim is not true.\n\n\"This link is not a valid promotion,\" Allegiant spokeswoman Krysta Levy told PunditFact. \"We are working with our legal team to take appropriate action.\"\n\nTypically, if a promotion is sponsored by Allegiant, it will appear on the airline\u2019s main website, www.allegiant.com, or appear on its verified social media channels, Levy said.\n\nWe\u2019ve debunked similar posts claiming to offer two free tickets to fly on Southwest Airlines and on Delta Air Lines after the completion of surveys. They were both scams. There\u2019s also no truth to another post going around claiming \"Walmart rewards everyone with $75 coupon to celebrate its 125th Anniversary,\" in exchange for taking a three-question survey.\n\nA website\u2019s promise of two free tickets on Allegiant after taking a survey isn\u2019t based on reality. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
