For example, in 2013, Kasich signed into law a requirement for ultrasounds to be performed to look for a fetal heartbeat before a woman can have an abortion. If there is a fetal heartbeat, the doctor must offer a chance for the mother to listen to it or see an image.\n\nOhio has had restrictions on abortions since before Kasich. State law imposes bans on \u201cnon-therapeutic\u201d abortions, defined as abortions \u201cperformed or induced when the life of the mother would not be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or when the pregnancy of the mother was not the result of rape or incest reported to a law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights advocates and opponents in Ohio we spoke with explained that a \u201cnontherapeutic abortion\u201d generally refers to elective abortions for pregnancies that are not a result of rape or incest or that threaten the mother\u2019s life. But such incidents are underreported to law enforcement, so abortion rights advocates view the reporting requirement as an additional barrier for victims of sexual assault or rape to get an abortion.\n\nThe \u201clife of the mother\u201d exception is much more restrictive than the broader \u201chealth of the mother\u201d exception, which gives doctors flexibility to determine when a pregnancy poses a risk to the mother\u2019s health. Under Ohio law, there must be a \u201cmedical emergency,\u201d defined as a condition that \u201cso complicates the woman\u2019s pregnancy\u201d that the woman has to be in imminent risk of death or \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\nOne measure Kasich signed into law is not consistent with his stance against abortions except in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother: a 2011 law prohibiting women from getting an abortion after the fetal age of viability, generally pegged at 24 to 28 weeks from the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Post-viability abortions are banned unless the doctor decides the fetus can\u2019t survive outside of the womb. There is an exception for life of the mother, but not for rape or incest.\n\n\u201cThe statute operates on the reasonable assumption that a woman who has been subjected to rape or incest would have had an opportunity, well before the time that a child would be viable, to consider her options and decide whether or not to get an abortion,\u201d said Rob Nichols, Kasich campaign spokesman.\n\n\u201cWhether an exception to a regulation pertaining to abortion is appropriate depends on the nature of the regulation,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cFor example, it would not make sense to add [those exceptions] to a law that required abortion clinics to have a backup generator or use sterile medical supplies. So you would not expect that all laws that could affect abortion in some way would have a rape or incest exception.\u201d\n\u2022 None House Bill 63 (2011): Requires Ohio minors to get court approval for an abortion if they do not have parental consent. If there is a medical emergency that threatens the life or physical health of the minor, the mother can bypass the court. There is not a separate exception for rape or incest because the mother can cite rape or incest as the reason why she believes having an abortion is in her best interest, Nichols said. This law requires judges to use a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard, which is stricter than common standard of proof in civil cases, according to Guttmacher Institute.

Bans coverage in the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchange for nontherapeutic abortions.\n\u2022 None State budget (2011): Bans use of public funds or facilities for nontherapeutic abortions. Bans use of public funds or facilities for nontherapeutic abortions.\n\u2022 None State budget (2013): Contains several provisions relating to abortion, such has the requirement for ultrasound and fetal heartbeat testing. One of the major provisions effectively reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state. State law required abortion providers to have a transfer agreement with a hospital that can transfer a patient in case of an emergency. But this law banned public hospitals and abortion providers to enter into transfer agreements, reducing the number of hospitals abortion providers can use for transfer agreements.

But NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio noted that the bill banned rape crisis centers from receiving money through this fund if they counsel rape survivors about abortion. This provision includes an exception for the case of a medical emergency for the mother, but not for rape or incest.\n\nKasich\u2019s policy decisions largely have been consistent with his antiabortion stance except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment to mother\u2019s life. In general, the laws Kasich passed apply to \u201cnontherapeutic abortions,\u201d which are for pregnancies that were not a result of rape or incest reported to police, or that threaten the mother\u2019s life. Abortion rights advocates argue this is a restrictive definition, because it creates a barrier for women who do not report such incidents to police.\n\nThere is one law that is not consistent with Kasich\u2019s view, which is the ban on late-term abortions after the fetus is considered \u201cviable,\u201d meaning it can survive outside of the mother\u2019s womb. This law does include an exception for the life of the mother, but does not include rape or incest. While this law could qualify Kasich for One Pinocchio, it\u2019s worth noting that two out of 43 states that have a ban on late-term abortions explicitly list a rape or incest clause. And the reason, according to his campaign and abortion rights opponents, is the mother has up to five or six months to decide to abort the baby.\n\nStill, Kasich\u2019s claim that he is \u201cpro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother\u201d doesn\u2019t quite rise to the level of a Geppetto Checkmark, given some of the caveats we\u2019ve explained above. It would be different from a fact-checking perspective if Kasich said or implied that every abortion-related law he signed included these exceptions. Perhaps that ambiguity is by design, since he prefers not to talk about his abortion-related policies. We will give this claim No Rating.", "lang": "en"}
