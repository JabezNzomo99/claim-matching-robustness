This, they claimed meant that Scindia took a contradictory stand against his own party which has opposed the bill.\n\nInterestingly, Swarajya quoted Dainik Bhaskar while misreporting Scindia's comment to the media in Indore. The website called it a major embarrassment for the Congress party.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\n\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nDainik Bhaskar had earlier reported that Scindia said that the bill was in accordance with Indian culture. The headline read, \"Jyotiraditya Scindia endorses; Says- This Is Contrary To The Constitution, But According To Indian Culture\".

BOOM found that the Congress leader was being misquoted.\n\nWe analysed video footage uploaded by two different news channels on YouTube and found that Scindia was infact opposing the bill in his statement to reporters in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Scindia refers to the stiff opposition to the CAB Bill in the north eastern states of the country and clearly states that the bill is not according to Indian culture.\n\n\"I believe, it (CAB Bill) is contrary to the Indian constitution is one thing, but it is fundamentally not according to Indian culture,\" said Scindia clearly opposing the bill.\n\nAt the 40 second timestamp in this video clip uploaded by Kanak News, on being questioned by reporters on his stance on the CAB Bill, Scindia says, \"Not only Congress, but several parties are protesting, that too on the road. See the situation in the north-eastern states and other states\u2026the founder of our constitution Babasaheb Ambedkar had said while writing the constitution that people will not be seen on the basis of their caste, creed or religion, people will be seen as Indian citizens. Look at history, and do not talk only about democracy, in the course of 3,000 to 4,000 years\u2026 this Indian soil has always accepted everyone. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) has been the specialty of India in the world.\"\n\nFurther talking on the bill he adds, \"And the bill that has been put forward, today, and yesterday. I believe that the Indian ideology and culture is to take everyone together\u2026 it is also in the bill on the basis of religion and state. Earlier this has happened on the basis of countries, but never on the basis of religion. I believe, it is not just contrary to the Indian constitution, but it is fundamentally not according to Indian culture.\"\n\nOne can also hear him making the same statement in this clip uploaded by News 24 MP & Chhattisgarh on YouTube at the seven seconds timestamp.\n\nScindia's views become even more clear when he later tweeted the same statement, opposing the bill, \"#CAB2019 It is against the basic spirit of the Constitution, and also contrary to Indian culture. Ambedkar did not see anyone from the point of view of religion, caste while writing the constitution. Across history in India, we have always adopted everyone - Vasudev Kutumbakam is the speciality of India. Never before has it happened on the basis of religion.\"\n\nScindia has in the past taken a contrary line to his party while supporting the BJP government's decision to scrap Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Scindia had then justified his contrarian stand by saying that the government's move was in the country's interest.\n\nThe bill was recently passed by the Lok Sabha (Lower house of parliament) in the wee hours on December 10, 2019 and is now slated to be voted on in the Rajya Sabha (Upper house of parliament).", "lang": "en"}
