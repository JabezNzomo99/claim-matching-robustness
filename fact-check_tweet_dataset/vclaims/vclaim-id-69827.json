Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., railed against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing Kavan", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-69827", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2018/oct/25/josh-hawley/schumer-pac-has-spent-dark-money-mccaskill-not-muc/", "vclaim": "Her opponent in Missouri\u2019s U.S. Senate race, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, claimed in a tweet on Sept. 25 that McCaskill \"has had Chuck Schumer spend more dark money for her than for any senator in America.\" Hawley claimed that the amount was \"$16 million and counting!\"\n\nWhen we asked the Hawley campaign how it came up with those numbers, it pointed us to spending by two political action committees: Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward.\n\nSenate Majority PAC, established in 2010 to support Democratic U.S. Senate candidates, is considered a super PAC, with the ability to raise unlimited sums of money. The third biggest super PAC in the nation, Senate Majority PAC is required to report its donors, who include George Soros, Bill Maher and Seth MacFarlane, to the Federal Election Commission monthly during election years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAs of Oct. 22, Majority Forward has spent over $35 million in total during the 2018 election cycle, according to data calculated by the FEC and gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. It\u2019s mostly spending against Republican candidates; barely over $3 million of this goes in support of Democrats.\n\nDark money groups don\u2019t always promptly disclose their spending, Anna Massoglia of the Center for Responsive Politics said in an email on Oct. 9. Some dark money spending isn\u2019t reported at all, especially when dark money groups run \"issue ads\" that don\u2019t explicitly endorse or speak out against one specific candidate. These ads don\u2019t have to be reported to the FEC.\n\nThough his numbers were based on reported expenditures, Hawley may be more correct than he thought. Massoglia noted that grassroots organizing, voter mobilization campaigns and digital ads are hard to track and \"may be unaccounted for until long after the election is over.\" This makes extra dark money spent for McCaskill or against Hawley difficult, if not impossible, to account for.\n\nGlavin pointed out Majority Forward\u2019s unreported expenditures in Missouri. \"According to media reports Majority Forward has been spending money in Missouri since 2017 on get out the vote activities and ads that do not require reporting to the FEC,\" Glavin said.\n\n\"The most outside spending reported in FEC disclosures for McCaskill or against Hawley that could be loosely attributed to Schumer as of this date totals just under $15 million at this date,\" Massoglia said.\n\nHawley is correct that Missouri\u2019s Senate race has been the target of the most spending by Senate Majority PAC on one candidate, as well as the most between Senate Majority and Majority Forward, the two PACs attributable to Schumer.\n\nIt is hard to account for all of the dark money spent in an election, and more continues to flow in. But Hawley\u2019s claim was based on reported spending numbers. He\u2019s off by roughly $13 million, considerably inaccurate in assessing the amount of dark money spent on McCaskill\u2019s behalf.", "lang": "en"}
