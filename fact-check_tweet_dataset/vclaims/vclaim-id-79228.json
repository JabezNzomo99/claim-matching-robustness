Ted Cruz.\n\nBefore bringing on Trump, host Chuck Todd showed a new Cruz ad criticizing the real estate tycoon\u2019s support for eminent domain, the government\u2019s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects. The ad quotes Trump as saying, \"I think eminent domain is wonderful.\"\n\n\"It made him rich \u2014 like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino,\" the ad says.\n\nTrump launched into his critique right away.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Trump in the clip, \"and I have to tell you his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he\u2019s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it\u2019s false advertising.\"\n\nTodd said, \"Well, all right, the accusation was that that\u2019s what you wanted to do.\"\n\nTrump stood by his takedown: \"No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn\u2019t do it.\"\n\nIt turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow\u2019s home.\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll focus on Trump saying Cruz has \"got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.\"\n\nIn a prior fact-check, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice \"wonderful\" as recently as October.)\n\nEminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the 2005 case Kelo vs. New London, Conn., said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.\n\nCruz\u2019s ad references a period in the 1990s, prior to Kelo, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking.\n\nTrump has said he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn\u2019t give up her home. In 1994, New Jersey\u2019s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house.\n\nThe dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking\u2019s house, telling the New York Daily News that he was \"no longer an interested buyer.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is it's too bad for Atlantic City, but it's not too bad for me because I'm not interested in the property,\" Trump said. \"Nobody gets under my skin.\"\n\nCoking\u2019s supporters painted Trump as a villainous fat cat. Coking herself called him \"a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb.\"\n\nTrump Plaza closed in September 2014 after struggling financially. Trump told the New York Times that ownership of Coking\u2019s property would not have saved it.\n\nBack to Cruz\u2019s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got \"rich\" after bulldozing an elderly widow\u2019s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated when he said \"when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it.\" It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested.\n\nTrump says Cruz's ad has \"got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.\"\n\nIf you read the ad as Trump does, he is right: The woman\u2019s home was never destroyed as a result of eminent domain. He never got rich off of this deal because the case for eminent domain didn\u2019t pan out.\n\nBut that reading ignores another interpretation of Cruz\u2019s point: Trump certainly tried to take over the property before the state Superior Court stepped in and ruled in the woman\u2019s favor. Trump didn\u2019t mention the years-long legal battle on Meet the Press.\n\nFor glossing over some important context, we rate his claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
