No, that's not true, the guy did not mistake the flashlights and police lights for lightsabers and laser beams. The fake story was made up by a Spanish satire website.\n\nIt was published in an article on April 10, 2018 titled \"Man skipped police control and alleged he thought they were filming 'Star Wars'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\n24 year-old Zamora (Spain) resident was arrested last saturday night after skipping a police alcohol test control. The officers decided to chase him after trying hard to make him stop without success. When they finally caught him, the youngster response was that he did not stop at the control because he thought it was all a 'Star Wars shooting'.\n\nDespite the broken English it still looked more or less like a real news story on social media:\n\nEarlier this week the site made headlines with a massively viral hoax about the Pope deciding to cancel the Bible, we debunked that here: Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Cancel The Bible, Did NOT Propose To Create New Book.\n\nThe site There Is News carries a \"Legal Warging\" (archived here) that reads:\n\nThe site \"There is news\" (http://thereisnews.es) (hereinafter referred to as TIN) is a humor site whose purpose is entertainment. The content of TIN is fiction and does not correspond to reality. All references, names, brands or institutions that appear on the site are used as contextual elements, as in any novel or fiction account.\n\nThe site is the English language version of the Spanish satire site Hay Noticia, which is owned by Spanish humor website/collective La Fabrica de la Comedia S.C.", "lang": "en"}
