Former AAP minister Kapil Mishra had alleged that he saw Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal accepting Rs 2 crores from Satyendra Jain. What followed was a no-holds-barred contest between the news channels to launch an attack on Kejriwal and AAP. A corruption charge on a self-proclaimed anti-corruption crusader saw non-stop media coverage and endless debates with screaming anchors baying for blood. One year later, it has now been reported by Times of Indiathat \u201cCBI had conducted an inquiry against Kejriwal based on a complaint but found no merit in it and so didn\u2019t launch a formal probe. On the basis of CBI\u2019s inquiry, the lokayukta too closed the case.\u201d Other reports suggest that the Delhi Lokayukta has dropped Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s name but have not yet closed the case and CBI has said that it had never initiated any preliminary enquiry in the case. Alt News brings you an analysis of TV media coverage of the two events \u2013 the \u2018allegation\u2019 and the subsequent \u2018clean chit\u2019 by the CBI.\n\nRepublic TV which was launched on May 6th was only one day old when Kapil Mishra made these allegations against Arvind Kejriwal. It was difficult for Arnab Goswami to control his excitement at this godsend opportunity for bashing Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party. The channel promoted hashtags like #IsKejriCorrupt and #ArvindGate on the basis of the allegations. They wanted Kejriwal to resign and even ran a poll on it.\n\nHilariously, Republic TV crew kept busy in \u201ctracking\u201d and tweeting the movements of Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nMonths after the newsbreak, Republic TV continued to give coverage to Kapil Mishra and ran several hashtags like #AAPDonationgate, #AAPSundayDrama and #KejriCorruptionCharge#KejriCorruptionCharge\n\nTimes Now\u2019s coverage of the allegations ran on a similar pattern as Republic TV. AAP and Kejriwal are the channel\u2019s favorite punching bags and it ran hashtags like #\u0906\u092a_\u0915\u0947_\u091f\u0941\u0915\u0921\u0947, #AAPKaSach, #AAPKaGhotala, #KejriKaKalaSachand #KejriwalKiSafai\n\nIn the \u201cBiggest Allegation Ever\u201d, the nation wanted to know if Kejriwal had taken a bribe.\n\nLike RepublicTV, Times Now also wanted to know \u201cWill Kejriwal resign now?\u201d\n\nKapil Mishra continued to feature in Times Now programs over the next few months with hashtags like #KejriwalCheatedDelhiand #AAPKaKyaHoga\n\nKapil Mishra\u2019s allegations got extensive coverage on India Today as well. Though the coverage was not as cacophonic as Republic and Times Now, the channel ran a poll asking people whether they believed the charges.\n\nOn May 7th alone, the channel tweeted 18 times on the issue. According to India Today, it was a #KejriBribeBomb that had exploded.\n\nThe \u201c2 cr donation scam?\u201d was breaking news on CNN News 18 as well. The channel covered the story extensively but with a more neutral hashtag of #HeatOnAAP.\n\nNDTV\u2019s coverage was comprehensive but without any insinuating hashtags. Though there were no noisy debates and anchors asking for Kejriwal\u2019s resignation, Kapil Mishra continued to grab headlines at the channel for days to come.\n\nZee News ran a DNA on the corruption charges asking \u201cHas fighting against corruption turned Arvind Kejriwal corrupt?\u201d\n\nAAP supporters have produced a collage of the coverage, which we are reproducing here. The party continued to be under attack by Hindi news channels after allegations came to light. It was a media trial \u2013 the terminology used was insinuating, the tone was mocking and the anchors had pronounced the judgment of holding Kejriwal guilty even before the CBI investigation.\n\n<This section has been intentionally left blank as so far none of the news channels mentioned above have tweeted any update regarding the clean chit>\n\nThe above is a summary of the prejudiced coverage by TV news channels of the bribery allegations against Arvind Kejriwal. Barring a few channels, the others twisted the narrative and ran headlines and hashtags pronouncing Kejriwal as guilty. The \u2018nation wants to know\u2019, asked one channel as it demanded Kejriwal\u2019s resignation on the basis of charges that were not investigated and substantiated at that time. Now one year later when the charges have not been pressed and there is conflicting news about a \u201cclean chit\u201d, does the nation not deserve to know?", "lang": "en"}
