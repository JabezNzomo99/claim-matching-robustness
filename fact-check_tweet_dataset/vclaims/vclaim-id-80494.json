And, taking a dig at Gandhi, said that he agrees with him for the first time.\n\nThe quote translates to 'Generally we see one or two ministers involved in corruption but in Karnataka whole government is involved in corruption.'\n\nHowever, the BJP MP shared the clip assuming it to be a recent one or a goof-up by the Congress President.\n\nUnion Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani also retweeted a tweet that linked the video, without offering any comment.\n\nHowever, BOOM found that the clip is neither a recent one nor is the Congress president accusing Siddaramaiah of corruption.\n\nThe clip is from an April 26, 2013 video of Rahul Gandhi's public rally in Tumkur, Karnataka.\n\nGandhi in his speech had launched an attack against the previous BJP government in Karnataka led by Jagadish Shettar for being corrupt and depleting people of their money. Watch the original video below (between 5:25-5:45)\n\nWhile the published date on the YouTube video shows June 5, 2013, exactly one month after Karnataka went to polls, it could be a case of late addition of the video by the Congress to its YouTube channel. The Congress ousted the ruling BJP government winning the state elections in May 2013.\n\nSeveral news articles dated April 27, 2013 also reported Gandhi's statements against corruption at the rally in Tumkur. Read here and here.\n\nEither ways, Rahul Gandhi can be heard several times pointing out to the audience that it is time for the state to vote out the ruling BJP government and restore the Congress. Between 7 and 7:30 mins in the 10:31 minute video, Rahul Gandhi had this to say-\n\nIn the run-up to the Karnataka Assembly elections, both the parties have attempted to paint each other as corrupt. While the Congress have raised the issue of past cases of corruption against BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate B S Yeddyurappa and the inclusion of the infamous Bellary brothers in the party, the BJP has repeatedly raised the issue of the source of Siddharamaiah's alleged ownership of a Rs 40 lakh watch.\n\nAmit Shah and Ananthkumar, Union Cabinet Minister for Parliamentary Affairs have also rekindled the controversy by referring to his expensive watch as a symbol of Siddaramaiah's corruption.", "lang": "en"}
