Through this article let\u2019s verify the claim.\n\nClaim: A Goat has been arrested by the Kanpur police for not wearing a mask. Fact: According to a tweet by the Kanpur police, an unclaimed goat roaming around was brought to the police station and later handed over to the owner. But Circle Officer of Anwarganj of Police Station, Saifuddin Beg said that the man accompanying the goat ran away leaving behind the goat as he was not wearing a mask, so they bought the goat to the police station. Though both the versions of the police are different, the goat has not been arrested for not wearing a mask. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we ran a search on the internet for more information regarding the issue we came across a tweet by the Kanpur Nagar Police in which they said that an unclaimed goat which was roaming around Dada Miya intersection was brought to Beconganj police station and later handed over to its owner Khanikujjma, son of Mohammed Ali.\n\nContrary to what Kanpur police has tweeted, Circle Officer Anwarganj Police Station, Saifuddin Beg said that on seeing the police, the man accompanying the goat ran away as he was not wearing a mask, and hence they brought the goat to the police station. News articles reporting the same can be seen here and here.\n\nWhen we reached out to Saifuddin Beg, Circle Officer Anwarganj Police Station through phone, he reiterated the same that on seeing the police the man who was accompanying the goat ran away leaving behind the goat as he was not wearing a mask, and hence they brought the goat to the police station and later handed over the goat to the owner after levying a fine for not wearing a mask. He ruled out the claim that the goat has been arrested for not wearing the mask as funny. Also, it is not possible to arrest an animal under IPC or CrPC, he added.\n\nTo conclude, Kanpur police did not arrest the goat for not wearing a mask.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
