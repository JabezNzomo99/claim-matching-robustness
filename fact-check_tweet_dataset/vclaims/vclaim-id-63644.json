The photo attached to the tweet was denied by the Electricity Company of Ghana as originating from them when it surfaced in 2016.\n\n\n\nGhana\u2019s recent history includes battling serious energy crisis that saw intermittent power cuts popularly known as \u2018dumsor.\u2019\n\nGhana, during the National Democratic Congress\u2019 (NDC) Mahama administration, saw publications of power outage schedules to indicate rationing of power in the country.\n\nThe development has remained a major area of controversy between the opposition NDC and the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP).\n\nA leading member of the NPP, Mr Otchere-Darko via his Twitter page on Sunday, August 2, 2020, made a post in which he claimed that power outages during the Mahama era extended from 2011 when he was Vice President to 2016 when the former president was voted out of power.\n\nMr Otchere-Darko accompanied his post with a photo of one of the purported publications on power rationing schedule [for August 1, 2016, to August 14, 2016] to prove that the power rationing extended to 2016.\n\nThe post has so far received over 1,000 reactions on Twitter.\n\nA Deputy Minister for Power during Mahama\u2019s administration, John Jinapor, in a counterclaim, challenged Mr Otchere-Darko\u2019s position in a statement where he said: \u201cthere was no load shedding schedule published in the whole of 2016.\u201d\n\nIn verifying the image shared by Mr Otchere-Darko as the supposed power rationing schedule published by the government in 2016, we conducted a reverse image search whose results showed a variation of the image tweeted by Mr Otchere-Darko.\n\nThe variant image, which is of much better quality, had the exact information (except the dates) and its text positioned in the same way as those in the photo tweeted by Mr Otchere-Darko.\n\nThe variant was seen on document-archiving site VDocuments on October 16. 2015. That image bears the date of a load-shedding exercise that was planned for March 17, 2014, to March 30, 2014.\n\nGraphic Online also published that same schedule on its website on March 19, 2014.\n\nSee the difference below:\n\nOur further checks revealed that the Electricity Company of Ghana in a statement on July 23, 2016, indicated that the supposed load-shedding schedule for August 1 to August 14 that had been widely circulated at the time was fake.\n\nThe statement was also shared on ECG\u2019s official twitter handle.\n\nThe same disclaimer was published by Yen.com.gh.\n\nWe, therefore, conclude that the supposed 2016 load-shedding schedule tweeted by Mr. Otchere-Darko is fake and false.\n\nA series of Google searches conducted revealed that there were a number of extensive power outages experienced in the country in 2016 with areas such as Dansoman, Awoshie, Achimota, Taifa, and Kasoa mentioned as some of the areas most affected.\n\nAccording to Daily Graphic, President John Mahama at a meeting with the Council of Christian Churches in Kumasi on Thursday, June 30, 2016, admitted that the country was having a power challenge.\n\n\u201cHe said the crisis appeared to have been prolonged by the non-supply of gas from neighbouring Nigeria to feed thermal plants as a result of sabotage which led to the shutdown of the Asogli power plant\u2026. President Mahama who was on his final leg accounting to the people\u2019s tour of the Ashanti region expressed the hope that there would be more rains to increase the water levels of the Akosombo dam to improve hydro power to augment thermal production. Currently, Akosombo was operating below its minimum capacity of 240 feet but President Mahama was optimistic the situation will improve.\u201d \u2014 Excerpts of Graphic\u2019s report read.\n\nA publication on Peacefmonline sourced from Classfmonline in July 2016 also revealed how there were calls on the government and the Public Utilities and Regulatory Commission (PURC) by the Africa Centre for Energy Policy (ACEP) to publish a load-shedding schedule to help residents plan their activities accordingly.\n\nThe then opposition party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), also issued a statement demanding a load-shedding schedule from the government but the Head of Public Affairs at the PURC, Nana Yaa Juantuah, in a response captured in a Citi FM report said the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) could not release a load shedding timetable because the erratic power supply at the time was only a temporary problem.\n\nThree weeks earlier on Wednesday, July 6, 2016, President Mahama, while delivering an address at that year\u2019s Eid Celebrations at the Independence Square in Accra, said he would not declare a load-shedding because he was confident things would normalize soon.\n\n\u201cWe are not declaring load shedding; I believe things will normalize but we are taking steps every day to ensure that Ghana has security when it comes to power\u2026Because of sabotage in Nigeria on the terminals, crude oil that we ordered last month has not arrived and so it has created some generational problems for us,\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\nThe Deputy Minister for Power at the time, Mr Jinapor, in an interview on the Joy Super Morning Show on October 26, 2016, admitted that the country was having power challenges, confessing that \u201cmoney has been one of the challenges\u201d in fixing the issue.\n\nBased on the evidence above, we find that although there was a major power issue in 2016, the government did not formally declare it as a power crisis and was hesitant in releasing a power rationing schedule.\n\nIndeed, there is no evidence of any official power rationing schedule. The ECG denied photo which was shared by Mr Otchere-Darko when it surfaced in the public domain.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship in partnership with Citinewsroom to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
