No, that's not true: The story is made-up, fabricates a quote, and did not offer an on-the-record source for its claim. The site behind this story is known for publishing hoaxes and other falsehoods.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by City News (ab-tc.com) on February 8, 2020, titled \"BREAKING: Autopsy reveals Wuhan Doctor didn't die of coronavirus; he was murdered in sick bed - China Hubei News\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nAn autopsy supervised by the Chinese Police has revealed that Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn the world about the coronavirus outbreak was murdered. News broke out that the doctor died after contracting the virus while treating patients in Wuhan. His death sparked widespread of public anger and grief in China which called for an independent autopsy to be conducted. A statement by the police says six heath care officials have been arrested in connection with the doctor's death.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe story made a bold claim that Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had warned about the threat of the new coronavirus, was murdered in his hospital bed. However, the article does not attribute this claim to any official source, and no other media outlet is reporting this development.\n\nCBS News reported that Li, 34, \"died from the [coronavirus] illness early Friday,\" on February 7, 2020.\n\nThe City News site fabricated a quote from a made-up individual, David Shangfen. It said Shangfen \"told the press\" he suspected something was wrong, but ab-tc.com is the only site on the Internet with that exact quote. A Google search revealed only one result:\n\nThe article did lift a quote from a BBC article that interviewed Li's father, but that comment had nothing to do with the allegation he was murdered:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes ab-tc.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.

But all of them taken together strongly suggest it is the same person or persons.\n\nWe wrote about ab-tc.com before.
