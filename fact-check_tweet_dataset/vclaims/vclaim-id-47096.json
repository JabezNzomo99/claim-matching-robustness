But, FACTLY has found that no such order banning the Chinese Apps from the Google and Apple stores was issued by either Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology or National Informatics Centre. Also, one can see that there are some errors in the order (\u2018MeitY\u2019 written as \u2018Moity\u2019). The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has tweeted that the order is fake. The PIB\u2019s tweet has been retweeted by both MeitY and NIC.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
