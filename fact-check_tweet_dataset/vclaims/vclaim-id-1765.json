The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan\u2019s fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005.\n\nThe arrests caused an uproar in Congress, and the Obama administration pledged to reexamine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq War.\n\nA U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged \u201cunfortunate delays\u201d in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process.\n\n The State Department\u2019s National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. \u201cWe are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,\u201d the official said.\n\nCOLLINS: \u201cSo my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we\u2019re not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cYep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense\u2019s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused.\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cThat is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don\u2019t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.\u201d\n\nState Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. But it\u2019s unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said \u201cpace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl,\u201d indicating some were still being approved.\n\nUpdate: Former Obama administration official Jon Finer denied that any ban in Iraqi refugee admissions was put in place under Obama. \u201cWhile the flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration\u2019s review, refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time, and there was not a single month in which no Iraqis arrived here,\u201d he wrote in Foreign Policy. \u201cIn other words, while there were delays in processing, there was no outright ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama never imposed a six-month ban on Iraqi processing. For several months in 2011, there was a lower level of Iraqi resettlement, as the government implemented certain security enhancements. Indeed, as we identified new and valuable opportunities to enhance screening, we did so. Nobody should object to a continual effort to identify legitimate enhancements, but it is disreputable to use that as a pretext to effectively shut down a program that is overwhelmingly safe and has enabled the United States to exercise world leadership. In any event, there was never a point during that period in which Iraqi resettlement was stopped, or banned.\u201d\n\nFirst, Obama responded to an actual threat \u2014 the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, was a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. (His staff has pointed to attacks unrelated to the countries named in his order.)\n\nSecond, Obama did not announce a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano\u2019s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it had a policy to halt all applications. Indeed, it is now clear that no ban was put in place. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval.\n\nUpdate: In light of the response from Obama administration officials that there never was a point when Iraqi resettlement was stopped or banned, we are updating this ruling to Three Pinocchios. Iraqi refugee processing was slowed, in response to a specific threat, but it was not halted. The Trump White House, meanwhile, has failed to provide any evidence for its statement.", "lang": "en"}
