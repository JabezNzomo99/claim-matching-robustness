Wake!! Up!!\u201d\n\nThe March 31 video has been viewed over 175,000 times, received over 1,800 interactions and over 850 comments.\n\nCOVID-19 infection cases have now passed 5,700 in Australia, with the death toll at 36. The video, created by an Australian anti-vaccination campaigner and one-time political candidate, Tom Barnett, claims \u201cyou cannot catch a virus,\u201d that viruses \u201cdo not attack cell tissue\u201d and that \u201cviruses are not living\u201d.\n\nViruses are parasitic biological entities that have genetic material contained inside a protein coat or shell. They invade cells of other organisms and hijack them to reproduce themselves. The first virus know to affect humans, Yellow Fever, was discovered in 1901.\n\nUniversity of Sydney Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Hannah Sassi told AAP FactCheck that humans can catch viruses and do so in different ways depending on the type of virus. \u201cWe can inhale them, we can ingest them, or get them through skin contact and punctures,\u201d she said.\n\nViruses attack the cells within the tissue, not the tissue itself, said Dr Sassi. In biology the term tissue refers to a group of cells with a similar structure that function together as a unit.\n\nThere is some scientific debate over whether viruses should be classified as \u201calive\u201d because they rely on other organisms to survive and reproduce. According to University of California Professor of Molecular Biology Luis P. Villarreal, scientists have grappled with how to define viruses for 100 years: \u201cFirst seen as poisons, then as life forms, then biological chemicals, viruses today are thought of as being in a gray area between living and nonliving,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the video, the speaker states: \u201cviruses are nothing more than a solvent\u201d that are \u201ccreated within the cells of the body\u201d.\n\nDr Sassi told AAP FactCheck that solvents are chemical solutions that have nothing to do with viruses. \u201cViruses are a genome, which means it has DNA and RNA and they reproduce. Chemicals don\u2019t reproduce,\u201d she said.\n\nThe video also claims that viruses detoxify the cells within the body and \u201cwhat needs cleaning out of the cells are environmental toxins, such as heavy metals, plastics, any type of industrial pollutants\u201d.\n\nDr Sassi said viruses are unrelated to toxins, heavy metals, plastics, or any type of industrial pollutants. \u201cThe virus is just trying to reproduce to survive,\u201d she said.\n\nThe video then says \u201cviruses are specific to certain cells in the body. A virus that attacks the lungs will not affect the kidney\u201d.\n\nMost viruses are specific to certain types of cells, but they can also travel to different parts of the body, Dr Sassi said. \u201cOne virus that is really good at replicating once inside the body is Ebola Virus. It will replicate until it\u2019s in the bloodstream, then once it\u2019s in the bloodstream it can be carried throughout the body,\u201d she said.\n\nEbola targets the liver and the immune system, preventing the body from clearing toxins from the bloodstream and allowing it to travel.\n\nThe speaker in the video states: \u201cbecause a virus is not transmissible within your own body, it should make sense that a virus is not transmissible between people\u201d. He then claims that \u201cthis is why you can\u2019t get an avian flu or swine flu, a bat flu and monkey flu or any other flu\u201d.\n\nHumans can transmit viruses. When a person becomes infected with a virus, their body can become \u201ca reservoir of virus particles, which can be released in bodily fluids \u2013 such as by coughing or sneezing,\u201d writes Bond University Associate Professor Lotti Tajouri. Viruses are transmitted when particles either end up on a new potential host or an inanimate object, he says.\n\nHumans can contract swine flu, avian flu and other types of viruses from animals, according to the federal Department of Health. These viruses are types of zoonotic diseases, which can be spread when humans come into direct contact or indirect contact with infected animals, through insect bites and contaminated food or water, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.\n\nAustralian National University Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases David Tscharke told AAP FactCheck many viruses require more than one species. \u201cThink about dengue fever: the virus grows in mosquitoes and it also grows in the affected people,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that everyone six months or older should be vaccinated against influenza during April to avoid a \u201cdouble-up of flu and coronavirus\u201d.\n\nBarnett also asks: \u201cWho is actually counting these deaths, and who\u2019s actually verifying that the deaths aren\u2019t from any standard flu?\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for the federal Department of Health said the department is notified by state and territory health departments.\n\n\u201cThe current case definition for the notification of a COVID-19 case, including associated deaths, requires laboratory confirmation for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19),\u201d the spokesperson said.", "lang": "en"}
