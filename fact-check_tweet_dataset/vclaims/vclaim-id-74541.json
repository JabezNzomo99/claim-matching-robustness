They\u2019ll say that\u2019s not true,\" Keilar said. \"But the other thing is, the campaign hasn't been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails, so there's no way to even really completely fact-check what she's saying, because they don't want to get into all of the details of those things.\"\n\nWe were curious about Keilar\u2019s claim that Clinton \"hasn\u2019t been clear\" about when she wiped her server clean.\n\nThe Clintons began using the private server in question when President Bill Clinton was in office, Hillary Clinton said at a press conference March 10, 2015. According to Clinton, it contained around 30,000 personal emails and 30,000 work-related emails from during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nClinton said she deleted the personal emails \u2014 \"emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations,\" she said \u2014 sometime in the fall of 2014 and sometime after the State Department asked on Oct. 28 for Clinton\u2019s work-related correspondence.\n\nClinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and communication relevant to her role as head diplomat to the State Department on Dec. 5. Sometime after that, the entire server was \"wiped clean,\" said Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Benghazi committee, on March 27.\n\nWhen exactly did that happen? Keilar has a point when she says it\u2019s unclear.\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server shortly after they were turned over to the State Department on Dec. 5. They referred us to a letter Clinton\u2019s lawyer David Kendall wrote to Gowdy. The Benghazi committee subpoenaed Clinton\u2019s emails on March 4, 2015, and Gowdy asked for the physical server about two weeks later on March 19.\n\nAccording to Kendall\u2019s letter, dated March 27, the emails relevant to Benghazi were in the State Department\u2019s possession and the committee had no legal right to the server. What\u2019s more, what Gowdy wanted no longer existed.\n\n\"During the fall of 2014, Secretary Clinton\u2019s legal representative reviewed her [email protected] account for the time period from Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013,\" Kendall wrote. \"After the review was completed to identify and provide to the Department of State all of the secretary's work-related and potentially work-related emails, the secretary chose not to keep her non-record personal emails and asked that her account (which was no longer in active use) be set to retain only the most recent 60 days of email.\"\n\n\"No emails from [email protected] for the time period Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013, reside on the server. Thus, there are no [email protected] e-mails from Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate and legally authorized.\"\n\nTo recap, Clinton\u2019s private server was wiped clean \u2014technically, filtering out emails older than 60 days \u2014 sometime between Dec. 5, 2014, and March 27, 2015. No clearer timeline has been stated.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nAfter receiving Kendall\u2019s letter, Gowdy issued a statement accusing Clinton of \"unilaterally\" and \"permanently\" deleting all the emails when she wiped the server. The Clinton campaign and Kendall, meanwhile, contend that all the emails relevant to Benghazi and her time as Secretary of State still exist and are in State Department\u2019s possession.\n\nKeilar said, \"The (Clinton) campaign hasn\u2019t been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server \"shortly after\" she turned them over to the State Department on Dec. 5, 2014, but did not provide a date.\n\nThe paper trail so far gives us a window of sometime between December 2014 and March 2015, but no more.\n\nThat\u2019s better than nothing, but Keilar is largely correct when she says the picture isn\u2019t clear. We rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
