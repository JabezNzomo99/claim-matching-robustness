Kamala Harris\u2019 name.\n\nThe tweet is fabricated. There is no record of Trump tweeting the statement.\n\nThe image claims to show a screengrab of a tweet, purportedly from Trump\u2019s verified Twitter account @realDonaldTrump, that disparages Harris, who recently became former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. It also appears to reference the debunked theory that Harris is not an American citizen.\n\nThe alleged tweet reads, \u201cKARMALA what the hell is that name anyway??? Sounds like a terrorist! Not EVEN American!! Need birth certificate! When Obama was president, he allowed 9/11. We can\u2019t LET that happen again!!!\u201d (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, \u2018Some Oldies Will Have To Die\u2019?)\n\nWhile Trump did promote a \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory about Harris and retweet posts calling her \u201cCamel Laugh,\u201d there is no record of Trump ever sending the tweet. Searching Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets didn\u2019t turn up any matches. Such a tweet would almost certainly have garnered media attention.\n\nIn recent months, Check Your Fact has debunked numerous fabricated Trump tweets.
