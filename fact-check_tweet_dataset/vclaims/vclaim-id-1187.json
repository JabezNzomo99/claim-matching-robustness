It will never be okay to be white on our watch\u201d.\n\nThe format mimics a headline from The Guardian, a British newspaper to which Lammy periodically contributes (here).\n\nLammy's articles often discuss race issues, with his latest calling on British PM Boris Johnson to take action over racial discrimination (here).\n\nThe headline in the social media posts, however, is fabricated and appears to have been created using a meme headline generator.\n\nThe website \u2018guardianmeme\u2019 allows people to create fake headlines for various Guardian contributors, including Lammy.\n\nThe fake headline does not appear in the archive of Lammy\u2019s work on the Guardian website (here), and web searches do not reveal any other articles featuring the comment.\n\nGrammatical mistakes in the headline such as \u201cLets\u201d, \u201cits\u201d and \u201cnazi\u201d also point to its fabricated nature.\n\nFalse. David Lammy did not write an article with this headline for The Guardian.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
