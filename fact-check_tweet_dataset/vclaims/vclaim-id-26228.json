It was at that event more than two years ago that the picture depicting demonstrators holding the banner was taken.\n\nContrary to what the Facebook post claims, the banner did not encourage violence against Republicans. A reverse image search revealed that the image has, in fact, been digitally altered to make the banner read, \u201cAssassinate Republicans that beat Democrats.\u201d It has also been cropped.\n\nThe original image, found on the local Fox affiliate\u2019s website, shows several demonstrators holding a banner that actually says, \u201cTrump makes America hate, our students make America great.\u201d Student protestors carried the banner as they marched to the arena where the rally was set to be held, according to the caption shared on the Fox 32 News Twitter account.\n\nA similar picture was taken by photographer Matt Marton for The Associated Press at the same event.
