(RELATED: Did Ben Carson Say, \u2018Before Obama, People Barely Noticed Skin Color\u2019?)\n\nMandela served as South Africa\u2019s first black president from 1994 to 1999 and is credited with helping bring an end to apartheid in the country. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.\n\nThroughout his career, Mandela delivered many speeches and wrote multiple books. However, the quote featured in the image does not appear anywhere credible online, including the web archive for the Nelson Mandela Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot authenticate this quotation,\u201d a spokesperson for the foundation told TheDCNF in an email.\n\nWhile the origin of the quote is unclear, it has been widely attributed, without sourcing, to Mandela online. In 2017, CNN host Chris Cuomo tweeted out the saying.\n\nMandela passed away in 2013 at the age of 95.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
