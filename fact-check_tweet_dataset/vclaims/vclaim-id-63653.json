Sharing this video, the post claims 100 crores worth of gold was spent on the decoration of this temple. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A temple in Madhya Pradesh decorated with 100 crores worth of gold for Lakshmi pooja. Fact: Video in the post shows Vaikunta Ekadashi celebrations in Ranganatha Swamy temple, located in Hyderabad city of Telangana. It is not related to the celebrations of Lakshmi pooja at a temple in Madhya Pradesh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of screenshots in the posted video, we found a video showing the similar visuals in a YouTube channel. It is mentioned in the description of the video that it shows the celebrations of Vaikunta Ekadashi festival in Hyderabad Ranganatha Swamy temple. When searched for more sources using these keywords, we found a video posted in the official YouTube channel of \u2018ETV Telangana\u2019 on \u20186 January 2020\u2019. Showing the similar visuals where it is mentioned that video shows the celebrations of Vaikunta Ekadashi festival in Jiyaguda Ranganatha Swamy Temple.\n\nSri Ranganatha Swamy temple in Hyderabad celebrates the Vaikunta Ekadashi festival every year in a grand fashion by decorating the temple. Videos related to the past celebrations of Vaikunta Ekadashi in this temple can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, celebrations in Hyderabad Ranganatha Swamy Temple are being falsely portrayed as the Gold decorated Lakshmi Temple in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
