The 9th Circuit is as well organized as any in the country. Of the very few 9th Circuit cases the Supreme Court takes up, a significant portion are overturned, but that\u2019s true for every circuit, several of which are overturned at a higher rate than the 9th Circuit. And overall, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of 9th Circuit decisions are overturned by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n \u2014 House Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking Democratic member John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), opening remarks during House hearing, March 16, 2017\n\nOne measure of an appeals court\u2019s record is the rate at which its decisions are reversed by the Supreme Court. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against his original executive order on immigration, President Trump has criticized the court as a rogue one with an excessively high 80 percent reversal rate.\n\nEach court\u2019s reversal rate changes every year, so it\u2019s easy to cherry-pick data from different years to support your case. And looking at just the raw numbers is not that helpful. For example, in the 2014-2015 term, four courts had 100 percent of their cases reversed, but the raw numbers were small (one case for the 2nd Circuit, three for the 3rd Circuit, three for the 7th Circuit and five for the 11th Circuit). The court with the second-highest reversal rate was the 8th Circuit, with seven of eight cases reversed. The 9th Circuit had six of 10 cases reversed.\n\nMost cases reviewed by the Supreme Court get reversed, so the number or rate of reversals is not necessarily reflective of the court\u2019s performance. While the Supreme Court weighs different factors in granting review of an appellate court\u2019s decision, \u201cthe most important influence on whether Supreme Court review is granted is the existence of a conflict among different circuits over how to interpret a section of a federal statute or a constitutional provision,\u201d according to SCOTUSblog.\n\nSince John G. Roberts Jr. became chief justice in 2005, the 9th Circuit court has not set a \u201crecord\u201d for reversals. The 9th Circuit\u2019s reversal rate was usually higher than the average in a given term, but not always. And since 2005, the 9th Circuit has not had the highest reversal rate (100 percent) in any term.\n\nThe Supreme Court reviewed less than 0.1 percent of cases terminated in the 9th Circuit in 2015, according to an analysis by EmpiricalSCOTUS.com. But that is not unique. The highest review rate of terminated cases that year was approximately 0.3 percent, for the 10th Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, according to the analysis.\n\nStill, the number of 9th Circuit cases on the docket is proportionate to the size of the circuit\u2019s caseload. Since 2005, the 9th Circuit comprised about 20 percent of the Supreme Court\u2019s docket. In 2015-2016, the share of cases commenced or terminated by the 9th Circuit was roughly 20 percent (about 12,000 out of about 60,000).\n\n\u201cReversal rates have nothing to do with circuit administrative performance,\u201d said Sidney R. Thomas, chief judge for the 9th Circuit, in a March 16 written testimony to Congress. \u201cThe question of how a court would decide the merits of a handful of cases is not reflective of court administration. It is not a proper measure, under any circumstances, of whether a circuit should be structurally divided.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to our request for comment. A spokeswoman for Conyers said: \u201cMr Conyers pointed out that only 1/10 of 1 percent of cases from the 9th Circuit are reversed in order to show that you cannot draw a reasonable conclusion about how well a court is functioning by comparing the handful of cases that ever reach the Supreme Court since it is such a small percentage of the overall docket. This would be true of any Circuit.\u201d\n\nAlthough the reversal rate is one way to measure a court\u2019s record, using figures such as 80 percent or one-tenth of 1 percent does not add much to the debate. The 9th Circuit is not the most overturned court by the annual reversal rate. It does have a high raw number of reversals or number of cases on the Supreme Court docket. But it also reviews more cases than other circuits, is larger than other circuits and terminates far more cases than other circuits.\n\nGenerally, politicians citing accurate statistics that lack context qualify for at least Two Pinocchios. Conyers provides more context than Trump does by noting that several other circuits are overturned at a higher rate than the 9th Circuit. Still, the usage of the one-tenth of 1 percent figure is not very helpful. The Supreme Court already reviews a small percentage of cases every year, so the number of reversals will reflect a tiny portion of the circuit court\u2019s total number of cases per year.\n\nTrump ventures into Three- to Four-Pinocchio territory when he says the 9th Circuit has been \u201coverturned at a record number.\u201d But recently, he has said more generally that the 9th Circuit has a high rate of reversal. We\u2019ll award Two Pinocchios to both Trump and Conyers for their use of the different reversal rates, which only give one side of the story.", "lang": "en"}
