The academy will conduct scenario-based training on \"defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests\" in Chicago so residents can see how ICE agents do their work.\n\nAs so-called undocumented immigrants in the U.S. struggled to avoid deportation and risked their health during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, government agencies created potential new challenges for them. In July, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) department announced they would be offering a six-day Citizens Academy training starting in September in Chicago, which would allow civilians and ICE officers to \u201cengage\u201d with each other.\n\nSnopes readers shared the following letter from ICE, reportedly sent to potential participants across Chicago, and asked us if it meant the agency would be training civilians to assist in the apprehension of undocumented people. The answer is complicated.\n\nWe found that this was an actual letter sent by ICE. Although they said they were planning to conduct trainings in September and would show civilians how they made arrests, the notion that this would lead to civilians actually apprehending undocumented people was disputed by the agency. Immigration advocates, however, were skeptical.\n\nIn order to understand the actual nature and likely outcome of these trainings, we reached out to ICE, as well as immigration advocates, and looked at past examples of such academies.\n\nWhat Does the Training Entail?\n\nAccording to an ICE press release, the interactive program would occur once a week over six weeks. Participants would learn about ICE policies and procedures from ERO officers, while officers would hear participants\u2019 perspectives and \u201cdebunk myths\u201d about ICE.\n\nMany in Chicago received letters from ICE inviting them to apply. The letter said, \u201cattendees will participate in scenario-based training \u2026 including, but not limited to defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests.\u201d\n\nNicole Alberico, an ICE spokesperson, responded to Snopes\u2019 request for more information about the training (emphasis ours):\n\nThe spokesperson said that they also had not determined whether media would be permitted to attend the training, as they were considering health precautions because of the pandemic and privacy concerns.\n\nIn sum, according to their own descriptions, ICE plans on showing civilians how they as an agency carry out arrests but will not be training civilians to do arrests themselves.\n\nHas This Kind of Training Taken Place Before?\n\nAccording to one report, such a Citizens Academy has already taken place in Los Angeles for years, with participants simulating drug busts, arrests, and stakeouts. According to one graduate, the course immersed people in what the agents do. While the Chicago program was to be run by ERO, the Los Angeles Academy was being run under ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) department.\n\nThe goal of such training appeared to be to get more people to understand ICE\u2019s perspective, see how they operate, and eventually construct a positive image of the agency in various communities. There is no available evidence that such trainings led to civilians participating in actual arrests.\n\nWhat Do Immigration Advocates Say?\n\nTestimony from activists, human rights organizations, and reporting show ample proof of ICE\u2019s history of violating detainee\u2019s rights, inhumane arrests of undocumented immigrants, separating children from their parents, and the lack of accountability surrounding their operations. ICE has also used civilian informants before.\n\nThe Citizens Academy announcement faced swift backlash from activists and government officials, including Chicago\u2019s alderman, Rossana Rodriguez, who labeled it a \u201cvigilante academy.\u201d In July, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley put forward an amendment to the Homeland Security spending bill, barring agencies like ICE from using government funds to run \u201cCitizens Academy\u201d courses.\n\nImmigration activists said these classes were at best propaganda and at worst would train civilians to \u201csnitch\u201d on undocumented immigrants. Lam Nguyen Ho, executive director of Beyond Legal Aid, an organization that provides legal services to immigrants in Chicago, spoke to Snopes about the dangers of such academies:\n\nIn sum, ICE confirmed that the Citizens Academy course will take place, but denied they will train civilians to carry out arrests. Based on ICE\u2019s history of abuses against immigrant populations, the fears surrounding this particular training aren\u2019t unreasonable, but the exact nature and outcome of the training remains to be seen. Based on all of the above factors, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
