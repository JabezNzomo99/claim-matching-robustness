The posts are false; the road shown in the photo is from Turkey.\n\nThe captions in the posts, such as this one, claim the road connects three cities in West Java province in western Indonesia.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post.\n\n\n\n The Indonesian-language caption in the post reads: \u201cThis is the coolest toll road in Indonesia, Cileunyi-Sumedang-Dawuan, which splits a mountain and goes through a mountain. Only happens in the era of #Jokowi.\u201d\n\nWidodo is popularly known in Indonesia as Jokowi. He won a first term as president in 2014, and is seeking a second term in national elections to be held on April 17, 2019. Here is the Indonesian election commission\u2019s website with details on the election.\n\nThe caption in the misleading post urges people to vote for Widodo, who is number one on the ballot, in the election.\n\nPart of it translates to English as:\n\n \u201cLet\u2019s vote No 1\n\n ONLY NO 1 \n\n Just NO 1\u201d\n\nOther Facebook posts, such as here and here, have the same photo claiming the road is in West Java and also voice for Widodo ahead of the election.\n\nThe same image with the same claim and calls for supporting Widodo are also on Twitter, including here and here.\n\nAFP published a fact-check on February 14, 2019, about the same image when it circulated on Indian social media claiming the road was a national highway in western India. AFP determined then the road is the Mersin-Antalya Highways in Turkey. Here is the AFP blog post.\n\nHere is the Google map satellite image of this specific part of the road in Turkey.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the satellite image and the photo used in the misleading Indonesian Facebook posts. AFP has circled key features that are the same:\n\nThere is actually a toll road being built in West Java linking the three cities referred to in the misleading Indonesian posts. Here is a Jakarta Post report on that road project, and here is an official government website about it.", "lang": "en"}
