That wasn\u2019t always the case, however, as Newsweek wrote in a June 2020 profile of the long-serving politician:\n\nBiden has become infamous, both as vice president during the Obama administration and in his current presidential campaign, for garbled statements and inappropriate remarks \u2026 Yet between his stuttering youth and his current occasionally irascible elder statesman status, Biden rose to prominence with a reputation for being an exceptional speaker given to soaring prose and inspirational sentiment. (Yes, really.) A 1985 profile in the Philadelphia Inquirer cited a group of politicos who regarded Biden as, \u201cwith the possible exception of Jesse Jackson, the most spellbinding orator in the Democratic Party.\u201d In February 1986, the Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory noted Biden was \u201cmuch in demand as a star speaker, one guaranteed to rouse Democrats from the melancholy torpor in which they have languished.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, in May 2020 numerous pundits began circulating a clip from a Biden television interview in which the presidential candidate supposedly proclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m going to beat Joe Biden\u201d:\n\nThat clip was a short excerpt taken from an interview Biden gave with CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on May 22, 2020, and according to the transcript of that interview, Biden actually said he was \u201cgoing to be Joe Biden.\u201d Given the obvious similarity in pronunciation between \u201cbe\u201d and \u201cbeat,\u201d it\u2019s not possible to definitively determine exactly which word Biden uttered during that interview, but in the full context of the conversation at that point, Biden\u2019s use of \u201cbe\u201d made perfect sense, while his saying \u201cbeat\u201d would have been a rather bizarre non sequitur.\n\nBiden was responding to a question in which host Joe Kernen questioned how, given his status as a \u201cmoderate,\u201d Biden might appeal to Democrats who initially supported more progressive Democratic rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Biden\u2019s response was to assert that he had built up a record over 40 years in public service, and he was going to stick with that record \u2014 that is, he was going to \u201cbe Joe Biden\u201d and not try to mirror the positions of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders:\n\nJOE KERNEN: I\u2019m great. You know, some pundits, democratic pundits, sir, say that Sanders and Warren\u2019s voters are essential for you to win. I know you\u2019ve probably seen that. But some aren\u2019t quite there yet. Others point out though, that your candidacy surged when it became apparent to mainstream Democrats that Sanders might be the nominee. And, and then they flock to you, a more moderate perhaps candidate. Are you prepared now to say you\u2019re going to govern as a progressive and enact programs in the mold of Sanders and Warren? And if so what does that say to either moderate Democrats or Independents or even some Republicans dissatisfied with President Trump? VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I\u2019m prepared to say that I have a record of over 40 years. And that I\u2019m going to be Joe Biden. Look at my record. The fact is that some areas that I think, for example, I think health care is a right not a privilege. I do not support Medicare for All. I will not support Medicare for all. But I do support, making sure that Obamacare is around with a public option, for those who can afford, those who qualify for Medicaid and they don\u2019t get in their state, they would be able to buy it and be able to automatically enroll in the public option, Medicare, that would \u2014 but I do not support, you know, forgiving debt loan for every single solitary person no matter where you went to school. But I do support the idea that if in fact you have student debt as a consequence of going to a public university, and your income is under $125,000, it should be forgiven. I do believe that anyone going to school, that in fact goes to a public university and or Community College, they should be able to go for free if income is under $125,000. My wife has a great expression: any country that out-educates is going to out-compete us. We have a whole generation that\u2019s being put behind the eight ball, Joe. You know that. They\u2019re in real trouble. They\u2019re in real trouble right now.\n\nAdditionally, mainstream news accounts of the interview referenced Biden\u2019s saying \u201cbe\u201d rather than \u201cbeat.\u201d The Associated Press reported, for example:\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres countered that Biden\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d is the center-left. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run on who you are,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cIf he becomes a politician of the left, it\u2019s going to hurt his ability to consolidate the 54% of Americans who voted for someone other than Donald Trump in 2016.\u201d Biden deflects the risks. Asked whether his recent moves mean he\u2019ll govern as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d Biden retorted on CNBC: \u201cI\u2019m going to be Joe Biden. Look at my record.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the New York Times wrote that:\n\n[I]n a television interview with CNBC, Mr. Biden pledged that he would repeal the tax cuts signed by the president in 2017 and raise the corporate tax rate. He added that he would not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, as he seeks to outline his plan for American economic recovery in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Biden gave some of his most detailed explanations of his economic policy. He rejected the idea that he would govern as an economic progressive, saying, \u201cI have a record of over 40 years, and I\u2019m going to be Joe Biden. Look at my record.\u201d\n\nGiven that an interpretation of Biden\u2019s words exists which is much more sensible and reasonable that the one asserted above, we rate this claim to be False.\n\nVideo of the full CNBC interview with Biden is viewable here:", "lang": "en"}
