David Crowley says voters should factor in how effective he and state Sen. Chris Larson have been as lawmakers.\n\nIn a March 11, 2020, debate on WISN-TV, both Milwaukee Democrats were asked what sets them apart from their opponent. Crowley said this:\n\n\"The biggest difference is that I\u2019ve actually been able to be effective in the state Legislature,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve passed more bills than Sen. Larson has, because if I\u2019m not mistaken he hasn\u2019t passed any.\"\n\nIs he right?\n\nIt turns out that \u2013 just like deciding whether Minnesota or Wisconsin has the most lakes \u2014 it\u2019s all about how you define the term.\n\nBills passed is an interesting place for Crowley to plant his political flag, given that neither he nor Larson has been exactly prolific.\n\nLarson has been in office since 2011, and Crowley since 2017. Both the Assembly and Senate have been under Republican control since 2011, meaning slim odds for bills from Crowley, Larson or any other Democrat.\n\nSpokesman Garren Randolph said Crowley\u2019s claim referred to bills signed into law on which the legislators were the \"lead author.\"\n\nBills can originate in either the Assembly or the Senate, and they must have at least one author or sponsor in each chamber. Other lawmakers in favor of the legislation can also sign on as coauthors or cosponsors.\n\nCrowley here is referring to only the first author in the originating house.\n\nBy that tally, Crowley comes out ahead: 1-0.\n\nHe was the lead sponsor on a bill enacted in April 2018 that provided a $210,000 grant for a nonprofit organization to set up a website and phone system to provide referrals for community-based services and crisis intervention. It passed unanimously in both chambers.\n\nThe grant continued an existing program administered by 2-1-1 Wisconsin.\n\nSo it didn\u2019t create anything new \u2014 but it was a bill, and it was authored by Crowley, and it passed.\n\nLarson, indeed, has not been the lead author on any bills passed into law.\n\nBut Crowley\u2019s definition is narrower than the authorship criteria used by the state.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau maintains an \"author index\" of all legislation. The bureau\u2019s requirement for authorship is established by a Joint Rule of the Legislature. It says lawmakers are listed as the author if they are one of the first two authors in the originating house or the first cosponsor in the other house.\n\nBy that criteria, both Crowley and Larson have passed three bills into law, according to the author indexes from the 2019, 2017, 2015, 2013 and 2011 sessions. Here those bills are with their official description:\n\u2022 AB780 \u2014 Relating to notice to a school of a permanency review or hearing, notice to a school district of a foster home or group home license or out-of-home care placement, and transfer of pupil records (2017)\n\u2022 SB99\u2014 Relating to venue requirements for domestic abuse, child abuse, and harassment cases (2017)\n\u2022 SB700 \u2014 Relating to creating a fee schedule for certain laboratories (2019)\n\u2022 SB99 \u2014 Relating to designating and marking the Richard A. Grobschmidt Memorial Bridge (2017)\n\u2022 SB512 \u2014 Relating to deposits on the sale of certain lead acid batteries (2013)\n\nCrowley claimed he has \"passed more bills than Sen. Larson has, because ... he hasn\u2019t passed any.\"\n\nCrowley\u2019 staff leaned on a narrow definition of authorship \u2014 only the first author in the chamber where the bill originated. If we consider authorship as being the person primarily responsible for a bill, Crowley has a point.\n\nBut his claim didn\u2019t specify such a strict definition, and he\u2019s referring to a subject where the state already has an official definition. Under the state standard, both Crowley and Larson have passed three bills.\n\nWe define Mostly False as having an element of truth but ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we rate Crowley\u2019s claim.", "lang": "en"}
