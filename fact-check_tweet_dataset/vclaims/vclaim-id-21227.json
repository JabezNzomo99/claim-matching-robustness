They spend an average 51 days at an ORR shelter before they\u2019re placed with a sponsor in the United States, according to HHS. The government is required to place these children with family members whenever possible, even if those family members might be undocumented immigrants. \u201cApproximately 85 percent of sponsors are parents\u201d who were already in the country \u201cor close family members,\u201d according to HHS. Some children have no relatives available, and in those cases the government may keep them in shelters for longer periods of time while suitable sponsors are identified and vetted.\n\n\u201cDuring the Obama administration there was no policy in place that resulted in the systematic separation of families at the border, like we are now seeing under the Trump administration,\u201d said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cOur understanding is that generally parents were not prosecuted for illegal entry under President Obama. There may have been some separation if there was suspicion that the children were being trafficked or a claimed parent-child relationship did not actually exist. But nothing like the levels we are seeing today.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
