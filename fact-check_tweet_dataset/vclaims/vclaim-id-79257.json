In these images, a person wearing a helmet can be seen posing on pothole-ridden roads. Amar Ujala stated that these images were sent to them by a concerned citizen.\n\nUP Congress Committee\u2019s social media vice-chairperson Pankhuri Pathak posted two similar-looking images and took a jibe at the ruling BJP government in the state. Pathak had also shared the images with the same claim on her Facebook page.\n\nIn response to her tweet, some people tweeted a screenshot of an Instagram post where it was claimed that the images were from Bilaspur, a city in Congress-ruled Chattisgarh.\n\nAt the same time, some even claimed these images were from Bihar.\n\nWith a reverse image search on Russian search engine Yandex, we found the same images posted on a blog (aanavandi.com) on October 14, 2019. Here, the images were said to be from West Bengal.\n\nIn the blog, some more similar images have been posted. One of the images shows a billboard carrying a picture of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee along with Bengali text.\n\nMoreover, the image on the blog seems to be a better quality photograph of the one viral on social media. With a closer look at the images, we were able to spot vehicles that bore a number plate beginning with \u201cWB\u201d suggesting that these are vehicles are registered in West Bengal.\n\nUpon performing a keyword search in Bengali, we found a report by Dhaka 18 which carried these images. According to the report, images of pothole-ridden roads in Malda were shot by a resident of West Bengal\u2019s English Bazaar Sangeet Roy. It also informed that Roy had posted these images on his Facebook account.\n\nWe found that Sangeet Roy had posted six images on October 13, 2019.\n\nNewschecker had earlier fact-checked these images. They are not from Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh or Bihar but from West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
