At the same briefing, the president said a \u201cteam of experts now agrees\u201d that the U.S. can begin the process of reopening businesses that have largely been shut down during the pandemic.\n\nTrump, April 16: The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries. Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we\u2019re calling, \u201cOpening Up America Again.\u201d And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: We\u2019re opening up our country. And we have to do that. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.\n\nWe asked the White House what information the president relied on, but we did not receive a response.\n\nHe\u2019s wrong based on recent data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world.\n\nThe university has calculated the \u201cobserved case-fatality ratio\u201d \u2014 the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 for around 130 countries. As of April 16, at least 90 of those nations had a lower rate than the U.S. rate of 4.9%.\n\nSome of those nations with a lower rate were Singapore (0.2%), New Zealand (0.6%), Australia (1%), Israel (1.1%), Japan (2.1%), South Korea (2.2%) Turkey (2.2%), Germany (2.9%), Portugal (3.3%) and Canada (4.1%).\n\nThe data does show the case fatality rate in the U.S. was lower when compared with the other countries that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. had the third lowest rate among the 10 countries Johns Hopkins University said were \u201cmost affected by COVID-19 worldwide,\u201d as of April 16. Only China (4%) and Germany had lower rates than the U.S. (and data as of April 17 indicate that China\u2019s rate may now be up to 5.5%). Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Spain all had rates higher than 10%.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Johns Hopkins University says differences in mortality rates can be caused by a number of reasons such as testing, demographics and health care systems.\n\n\u201cWith more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio,\u201d the university said, for example.\n\nTrump himself made this point at a March 29 briefing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we\u2019ve been testing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also one of the reasons that we\u2019re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we\u2019ve been doing more testing.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., which is the third most populous country, has conducted more tests than any other nation \u2013 about 3.4 million, as of April 16, according to Our World in Data. But it lags behind other countries on a per-capita basis, as we have written before.\n\nWe should also point out that these case fatality rates are based on only the known coronavirus cases and deaths. Because unreported cases and deaths are not included, it\u2019s difficult to say exactly what the rate of death from COVID-19 is in any country.\n\nBut based on the global data we currently have about the disease, Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. mortality rate is lower than nearly all other nations is wrong.\n\nCorrection, April 20: We originally said the U.S. had the \u201ceighth lowest rate\u201d among the 10 most affected countries. It had the third lowest rate.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. Please consider a donation.
