You can read our article with the latest figures on where households from Grenfell Tower and the surrounding area are living here.\n\n\u201cMost of the people made homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire are not in permanent accommodation.\u201d \u201cWe have 201 of the 210 households who have accepted or moved into temporary or permanent accommodation.\u201d\n\nMost households that lived in Grenfell Tower or in neighbouring Grenfell Walk made homeless by the fire have not yet moved into permanent accommodation. It\u2019s also correct that most have accepted or moved into temporary or permanent housing.\n\nAccording to Grenfell Support, a Kensington and Chelsea council-led initiative, 75 of the 210 households from Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk have now moved into permanent homes. This is just over one third.\n\nThey say 63 households have moved into temporary accommodation, while 72 are still in emergency accommodation. These figures are accurate as of 17 May.\n\nThe Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea told us the most up to date figure as of 17 May was that 202 households had now accepted or moved into temporary or permanent homes. This 202 figure can\u2019t be reached from Grenfell Support\u2019s published figures, which do not break down what kind of accommodation the people who have accepted offers are currently living in.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that Dominic Raab gets bi-weekly updates on the figure, and when BBC Question Time was recorded he had most recently been briefed with Monday\u2019s figure of 201.\n\nDuring a Commons debate on 16 May on the Grenfell Tower tragedy, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government James Brokenshire said there were \u201cpeople who have accepted an offer of a permanent home still living in emergency accommodation\u201d.\n\nGrenfell Support also say that \u201chouseholds currently living in temporary accommodation provided by the Council or our partners, also have the option to make these properties their permanent home if they wish.\u201d\n\nAfter the fire, 128 households moved out of their homes in the area surrounding Grenfell Tower.\n\nOf the 128 households who left the surrounding flats, as of 17 May, one had accepted and moved into a permanent home. 39 households had returned to their homes, 16 households were in hotels, serviced apartments or were staying with friends and family and 72 households had moved into temporary accommodation.\n\nThe council has published more information on who is eligible for their wider Grenfell rehousing policy here.\n\nGrenfell Support updates their rehousing figures for Grenfell Tower and Walk residents and wider Grenfell area tenants once a week. Since this article was originally written new figures have been released.\n\nAs of 24 May, 80 households from Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk are now in permanent accommodation, 58 are in temporary accommodation and 72 are in emergency accommodation. The council told us 203 households had moved into or accepted offers for permanent or temporary homes.\n\nFor households in the wider Grenfell area, the figures are largely the same, although one less household is in a hotel, serviced apartment or with friends and family, and one more is in temporary housing.", "lang": "en"}
