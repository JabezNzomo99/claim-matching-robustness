Only one quote was actually made during the current campaign season; the rest come from Trump\u2019s past, from as long as 27 years ago. Obviously, it is up to readers to decide whether these remarks are appropriate \u2014 or relevant to the pursuit of the presidency.\n\nTrump made this statement in 1994 during an interview with ABC News, after saying he had made a mistake by allowing his first wife, Ivana Trump, to take a management role at one of his casinos. Here\u2019s the context in which he made this statement, which is slightly different from the way it is rendered in the ad (\u201cyour wife\u201d vs. \u201ca wife\u201d).\n\n\u201cI think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in business for yourself, I really think it\u2019s a bad idea to put your wife working for you. I think it\u2019s a really bad idea. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana.\u201d He said after he noticed a change in her demeanor while she was working for him, that changed his feelings toward her. \u201cIvana would get angry at somebody over the telephone, all of a sudden, who was at the casino, and she\u2019d start shouting. And I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want my wife shouting at somebody like that, I really don\u2019t want that,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd a softness disappeared,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere was a great softness to Ivana, and she still has that softness, but during this period of time, she became an executive, not a wife.\u201d\n\nTrump also expressed mixed feelings about allowing his then-wife, Marla Maples, to take a job. \u201cI have days where I think it\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I have days where, if I come home \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to sound too much like a chauvinist \u2014 but when I come home and dinner\u2019s not ready, I go through the roof.\u201d\n\nTrump Plaza Hotel and Casino President John R. O\u2019Donnell, in the 1991 book \u201cTrumped,\u201d claimed that Trump once said that \u201claziness is a trait in blacks.\u201d Here is the full context for the statement, as described in the book. O\u2019Donnell relates a conversation with Trump about a finance employee, who happens to be black and who O\u2019Donnell believes has shortcomings.\n\nInstantly, Donald was enthused. \u201cYeah, I never liked the guy. I don\u2019t think he knows what the f\u2013\u2013\u2013 he\u2019s doing. My accountants up in New York are always complaining about him. He\u2019s not responsive. And isn\u2019t it funny, I\u2019ve got black accountants at the Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. Those are the kind of people I want counting my money. No one else.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe I was hearing this. But Donald went on, \u201cBesides that, I\u2019ve got to tell you something else. I think that the guy is lazy. And it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not something they can control. \u2026 Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\nStill, Trump has made other remarks, in public, that could be considered racially insensitive. In 1989, he told Bryant Gumbel in an interview: \u201cA well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market. \u2026 If I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really do believe they have the actual advantage today.\u201d\n\nThis particular quote, unearthed by BuzzFeed, was made in 2005 during a discussion that concerned the ranking of actresses on \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d Trump rated Nicolette Sheridan a \u201csolid four,\u201d but said that when she was younger she had once been an \u201ceight.\u201d But he said he couldn\u2019t say she had ever been a \u201c10\u201d because of the size of her breasts. Here\u2019s how he explained his reasoning, starting at about the 5:50 mark in the interview:", "lang": "en"}
