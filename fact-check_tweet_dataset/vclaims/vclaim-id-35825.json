Spending has outstripped revenue from Scotland since around 1990, although in recent years the gap has decreased.\n\nSome of this spending is \u2018non-identifiable\u2019, which means it is spent by the UK as whole and not necessarily in Scotland. This includes defence spending and debt interest payments.\n\nUnder current UK constitutional arrangements the amount of money raised from taxes in Scotland is less than the amount spent by the public sector in Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Government has put forward a number of reasons why public spending per person is higher in Scotland than most other parts of the UK, including lower population density which \u201cincreases the cost of providing the same level of public service activity, particularly in areas such as education, health, and transport.\u201d\n\nThey also cited costs for public services which are not provided in England such household water and sewerage services. The Scottish Government says that the spending also reflects \u201cScotland\u2019s greater need for some public services such as in health and housing relative to the rest of the UK\u201d.\n\nCurrently, Scotland provides less per person in revenues than the average across the UK. This has been the case since 2014-15 when Scotland\u2019s north sea oil industry declined to the point that revenues were lower than the UK average even with the geographical share of oil and gas production.\n\nPrevious to this, Scotland was contributing more than its population share of tax revenues to the UK, but still received more in public sector spending than it raised in tax revenues.\n\nMichael Russell was responding to a UK government tweet that included figures on the economic relationship between Scotland and England.\n\nThe animated video said that Scotland benefited from a \u201c\u00a310bn dividend\u201d under the current constitutional arrangements. It cites the 2018-19 GERS report as the source for this figure.\n\nThis figure does not appear in the report itself but it can be calculated from the data within it.\n\nGERS data shows that in 2018-19 \u00a31,968 more was spent per person than was raised in taxes. The UK government has multiplied this \u00a31,968 figure by the current population of Scotland year to reach reach the figure of \u00a310.6bn.\n\nCivil servants have cautioned against using GERS data to calculate a figure for the amount of money transferred to Scotland from the rest of the UK. This is sometimes called the \u201cfiscal transfer.\u201d\n\nIn a response to a freedom of information request on this topic, Scottish Government officials said: \u201cOfficial figures for any fiscal transfer are not available.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason this information is not available is that such a figure requires a number of assumptions to be made. For example, as the UK as a whole spends more than is raised in revenue, an assumption would need to be made about which parts of the UK borrowing is undertaken for, or which types of public spending are financed by borrowing as opposed to taxation.\u201d\n\nThe GERS data is an official statistics publication produced by the Scottish Government. As such it provides the most accurate information available on Scottish public spending.\n\nThe latest report includes information on the margin of error associated with the figures that are estimated. Overall, statisticians calculated that the estimated figures used in the report have a margin of error of 2.2 per cent.\n\nClaims that apply GERS data to support an argument about a notionally independent Scotland should also be treated with caution.\n\nIf Scotland were to become independent, it is likely that different political choices would be made about taxation and public spending. It is also likely that the structure of the wider Scottish economy would change.\n\nThe amount of money raised in Scotland from taxes is less than the amount spent in Scotland by the public sector, even when revenue from oil and gas in the North Sea is included. Therefore, the claim from Michael Russell that \u201cScotland pays out more that it gets back\u201d is incorrect.\n\nUK government figures in this tweet that calculate values for a \u201cfiscal transfer\u201d between the UK and Scotland should be treated with caution.\n\nIn response to a Ferret Fact service request for evidence, the UK Government provided an explanation of how they had calculated the figures in their tweet. The Scottish Government has not responded.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
