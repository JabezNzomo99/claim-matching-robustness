This statement has been attributed to Priyanka Chaturvedi, national spokesperson of the Congress party, by a Facebook page Yogi Sarkar. Yogi Sarkar has a following of over 480,000. The quotation was posted on September 17 and has been shared over 6200 times so far.\n\nOn September 13, three terrorists belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammed were killed in an encounter with security forces at Reasi district in J&K. After the encounter ended, the slain terrorists were chained and dragged by security personnel. It is in the context of this photograph that the quote has been attributed to Chaturvedi.\n\nThe Congress spokesperson meanwhile has clarified via a tweet that she has not made the statement ascribed to her.\n\nPriyanka Chaturvedi has been a constant target for purveyors of misinformation who have credited false statements to her. Earlier, when the Mandsaur rape case had surfaced, a quotation was ascribed to Chaturvedi according to which she had defended the rapist saying that the Congress party stands with him, and that it is the right of Muslims to rape.\n\nFollowing the circulation of this fake quote, Chaturvedi and her daughter were threatened on social media.\n\nIn another instance, when the Asian Games were on at Jakarta in August 2018, a fake quote ascribed to Chaturvedi was doing the rounds, according to which she had said, \u201c\u0915\u0930\u094b\u095c\u094b\u0902 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u0916\u0930\u094d\u091a \u0915\u0930\u0915\u0947 \u0939\u092e \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0967\u0966 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e \u091c\u0940\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902, \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0908 \u0915\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0959\u0930\u0940\u0926\u093e \u091c\u093e \u0938\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u092d\u0942\u0916\u093e \u092e\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0907\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0947\u0932 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0941\u0932\u0947\u091f \u091f\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u095c\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u201d (We spent crores to win 10 grams of gold, with this money we can buy many kilograms of gold instead. Farmer is dying hungry and they are concerned about sports and bullet trains- translated).\n\nThis too was fake, as was confirmed by Chaturvedi herself in a tweet of August 24.\n\nAttributing false quotations to public figures is among the most predictable and routinely used tactic on social media, requiring only an image and provocative and/or ludicrous text to be placed together. Despite the obvious nature of these quotations and clarifications to the contrary, there hardly seems to be a let-up.", "lang": "en"}
