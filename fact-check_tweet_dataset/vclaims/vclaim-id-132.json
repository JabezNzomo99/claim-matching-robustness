He called on wealthy countries to help the developing world, for their own sake. ( here )\n\nIn the same interview Guterres stated: \u201cNinety percent of the cases are in the G20 countries which hold 80 percent of the global economy. They shouldn\u2019t be working alone, each in their corner, but in a coordinated manner to find treatments and vaccines to put at the world\u2019s disposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the virus mutates, all the investment we are putting into vaccines will be for nothing because the virus will then travel from the South back to the North,\u201d Guterres added. \u201cSo it is in the interest of countries in the North to help the South.\u201d\n\nThe claim on social media comes amid a racism row in France, over two doctors\u2019 suggestion that a COVID-19 trial using the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis, should first be tested on Africans.\n\nDuring an April 1 television broadcast, Jean-Paul Mira - head of intensive care at the Cochin hospital in Paris - asked: \u201cIf I can be provocative, should we not do this study in Africa where there are no masks, treatment, or intensive care, a little bit like it\u2019s done, by the way, for certain AIDS studies or with prostitutes?\u201d ( here ) The question is visible here .\n\nCamille Locht, the research director from France\u2019s Inserm, responded: \u201cYou are right. And by the way, we are in the process of thinking in parallel about a study in Africa ... That doesn\u2019t prevent us, in parallel, from also thinking about a study in Europe and in Australia.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on April 3, Mira\u2019s employer, the Paris network of hospitals, quoted Mira as saying: \u201cI want to present all my apologies to those who were hurt, shocked and felt insulted by the remarks that I clumsily expressed on LCI this week.\u201d\n\nInserm said on Twitter that the video of the exchange was being misinterpreted, without elaborating, and noted that the vaccine is only being trialled in Europe and Australia at present ( here ).\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the remarks. Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"Africa can't and won't be a testing ground for any vaccine\" ( here ).\n\nOn April 2, Australia\u2019s national science agency said that it had commenced the first stage of testing for potential vaccines for COVID-19, as it joins a global race to halt the pandemic ( here ).\n\nKaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute has also launched a federally sponsored clinical trial in the U.S.( here ).\n\nThere is still no vaccine on the market against the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, that causes the respiratory illness COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nAs of April 7, overa million people have been infected and more than67,000 have died ( here ).\n\nFalse: Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, did not announce a coronavirus vaccine trial in Africa.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
