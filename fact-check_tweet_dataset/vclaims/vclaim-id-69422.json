Other proposals he might also call \"common-sense,\" such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, held 56 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. And they were narrowly opposed by voters in households with a gun, with 52 percent against such measures.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Obama said \"overwhelming majorities of Americans\" support gun legislation \"like background checks.\" The poll cited by the administration, as well as other independent polls in 2013, do show support for universal background checks above 80 percent among voters, even those who own guns.\n\n \n\n But people would get the impression from Obama's statement that there is similar support for other White House gun proposals, when the reality is weaker majority support among voters and slim opposition among gun owners. That\u2019s a point worth clarifying. We rate the president\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
