The claim is false; the individual identified in the photo is in fact a parliamentarian for Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling party from Sri Lanka\u2019s North Central province, not the doctor.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on October 10, 2019, where it has been shared more than 24,000 times.\n\nIt shows Sajith Premadasa, the candidate fielded by Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling party-led coalition in the country's upcoming presidential poll, delivering his speech at the inaugural rally at the Galle Face Green in Colombo on October 10, 2019.\n\nAnother man\u2019s face in the image has been circled in red.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala text superimposed on the image translates to English as:\n\n\u201cDoctor Shafi who performed sterilization surgeries, is behind men who don\u2019t have children\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala caption translates to English as: \u201cDr. Shafi who massacred thousands of wombs of Sinhala mothers is now on Sajith\u2019s stage. Are you happy now?\u201d\n\nThe same photo was shared here on Facebook with a similar claim, and text posts making the same claim without the photo were published on Facebook here and here.\n\nDr. Shafi is a reference to Seigu Shihabdeen Mohamed Shafi, a doctor from the Kurunegala hospital who was arrested on May 24, 2019 on suspicion of amassing wealth through links to an Islamic extremist terror group. He subsequently faced false allegations that he performed non-consensual sterilisation procedures on Sinhala women during C-section surgeries.\n\nThe case accusing him of mass sterilisation was brought before the Kurunegala Magistrate\u2019s Court on June 27, 2019 and, in a 210-page report submitted to the court, the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka said no evidence was found to link Shafi to non-consensual sterilisation procedures. He was also cleared of any terror links. The court ruling was translated in this AFP fact check report.\n\nThe claim made in the misleading posts is false; the individual from the image circled in red is not Dr. Shafi.\n\nThe man circled is actually Ishak Rahuman, a ruling party Parliamentarian representing the Anuradhapura electoral district.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his profile on the Sri Lanka Parliament website:\n\nRahuman told AFP by phone on October 11, 2019 that he attended his party\u2019s rally to support presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa.\n\n\u201cI attended the inaugural rally yesterday in Colombo as I wished to pledge my support to our party\u2019s Presidential poll candidate in person. The entire country knows who I am and which electorate I represent. I condemn this type of actions aimed at tainting political opponents,\u201d Rahuman told AFP.\n\nBelow is an image comparison between Dr. Shafi (L) and MP Rahuman (R):\n\nAFP also contacted the office of State Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Ashok Abeysinghe, who was pictured standing next to MP Rahuman at the rally.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post with Abeysinghe circled in yellow:\n\nMinister Abeysinghe\u2019s Private Secretary Chakila Abeysinghe told AFP by phone on October 11, 2019 that Abeysinghe stood next to MP Rahuman at the rally.\n\n\u201cThese claims are absurd, the individual standing between Minister Premadasa and Minister Abeysinghe is UNP MP Ishak Rahuman,\u201d he told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
