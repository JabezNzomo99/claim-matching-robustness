An article published by The Indian Express on March 18, 2016, stated, \u201cThe Bihar Police have booked Kishanganj jail superintendent Kripashankar Pandey for sexually abusing the daughter of the jail\u2019s material supplier after initial probe found the allegations to be prima facie true. The investigation by the local police was conducted after a video of the alleged act went viral on the social media.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that Viral India had published an article about a three year old incident with an unrelated images of an incident from Bihar.\n\nMoreover, Times of India \u2018fact checked\u2019 this claim and came to the false conclusion that no such incident had occurred in the first place. The TOI article stated, \u201cTimes Fact Check team has found claims of BJP leader indulging in \u2018objectionable\u2019 acts with a female ABVP leader inside a temple to be fake\u201d. It has been established that this is clearly not true, as the said incident did take place in 2015 and it is the representative image that is fake.\n\nUnearthing old news stories and labelling them as recent incidents along with unrelated images is a commonplace tactic for fake news purveyors. Social media users need to be circumspect with regard to such questionable websites which clearly betray an agenda of systematically spreading misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
