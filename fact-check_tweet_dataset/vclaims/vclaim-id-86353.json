The Trump campaign has mined years of Biden statements on China, dating back to when he was vice president. It also highlights the business dealings in China of Hunter Biden, his son. The Biden campaign has fresher material \u2014 the many of weeks of Trump saying in January and February that he trusted the Chinese government was doing what it could to halt the outbreak.\n\nWe\u2019re going to look at these themes through four video ads \u2014 two by the Trump campaign, one by the Biden campaign and one by the Bulwark, an anti-Trump group started by Republicans. We normally do not post full ads without breaking down what is misleading, but in this case we will make an exception so readers can see them in full. We will identify many of the misleading claims along the way.\n\nThe other guy blew it \u2014 Biden\u2019s version\n\nThe ad then makes a misleading claim for which we have previously awarded Two Pinocchios \u2014 that the U.S. government shipped more than 17 tons of masks and medical supplies to China that day. The impression left by the ad is that these were U.S. government goods, shipped on Trump\u2019s order. In reality, these were donations by private charities and public companies at a time when the U.S. case count was still low. All the State Department did was supply planes \u2014 headed to Wuhan to pick up 800 consulate workers, their families and other Americans \u2014 that would have been empty anyway.\n\nThe other guy blew it \u2014 Trump\u2019s version\n\nOne of the Trump ads even clips a quote by CBS correspondent Major Garrett when he starts to note this uncomfortable fact. The ad quotes Garrett as saying \u201cthat travel restriction on China, as every public health official we talked to, bought the country time,\u201d but leaves off the rest of his comment: \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem now? We don\u2019t have enough tests. They\u2019re not being administered fast enough. And we don\u2019t know how many cases the country has. That\u2019s why you see dominoes falling all day today across sporting venues, colleges, athletic events. People are shutting things down. Because they don\u2019t know what the risk factor is. One of the reasons for that is because the administration was slow to move on testing.\u201d\n\nAs one can imagine, there also are plenty of quotes that the Biden team could draw from when Trump praised Chinese leaders when he was in Beijing. Trump routinely knocked his predecessors and said he did not blame China for trying to take advantage of the United States with unfair trade practices. \u201cI don\u2019t blame China. After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the sake of its citizens?\u201d he said in November 2017. \u201cI give China great credit.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Trump ads often feature Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who until recently was on the advisory board of a Chinese American fund called BHR Partners that received backing from Chinese financial institutions. One ad features a Fox personality, Stu Varney, saying, \u201cBiden\u2019s son inked a billion-dollar deal with a subsidiary of the Bank of China.\u201d (Not really \u2014 the fund said it would try to raise $1.5 billion for investments outside China.) The \u201cpuppet\u201d ad, without citing a source, features a ludicrously false claim: \u201cBiden\u2019s son received over $1 billion from a Chinese government-owned state bank.\u201d (Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney has said in 2017 he took an equity stake worth $420,000.)\n\nTrump probably has a bigger burden in this battle over China because his quotes praising the Chinese response to the coronavirus are so recent \u2014 and the opposite of the tough-on-China message he now has adopted. The Trump campaign can try to make the case that Biden is in the pocket of the Chinese or is soft on China, but most of the Biden quotes are old and there is no clip of Biden actually criticizing the travel restrictions imposed by Trump.", "lang": "en"}
