The president several times has referred to 1 in 3 migrant women being sexually assaulted as they traveled through Mexico, while news organizations (including The Washington Post) have cited a figure almost twice as large just for rapes, attributing it to Amnesty International.\n\nThe Amnesty International figure has been quoted repeatedly over the years. \u201cAmnesty International estimated in 2010, 60 percent of young women making that journey are raped,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said during a Senate hearing in 2018. \u201cAmnesty International has released figures of upwards of 60 percent of the young women trying to find a better life here in the United States are being raped before they get here,\u201d then-Coast Guard Commandant Paul Zukunft said in 2014. \u201cAccording to Amnesty International, 60 percent of migrant women and girls are raped while migrating,\u201d the United Nations University in Japan website says.\n\nTrump states as a fact that 1 out of 3 women traveling through Mexico are sexually assaulted. But the report did not conduct a random-sample survey that could be applied to all migrant women. Instead, the group interviewed nearly 500 people whom its doctors treated, of which 12 percent were women. So the statistic is derived from the experiences of 56 women and cannot necessarily be considered representative of all migrant women.\n\nNo source for this information was cited. It took a little digging, but eventually we located a 2010 report issued by Amnesty International: \u201cInvisible Victims: Migrants on the move in Mexico.\u201d Buried in the report is this line: \u201cIt is a widely held view \u2014 shared by local and international NGOs and health professionals working with migrant women \u2014 that as many as six in 10 migrant women and girls are raped.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the 60 percent figure is mentioned in conjunction with another, even higher estimate, that 80 percent of migrant women are raped, attributed to a 2014 report by Fusion. The Fusion report says 80 percent of Central American girls and women crossing Mexico en route to the United States are raped along the way, claiming the information came from directors of migrant shelters. But the report adds: \u201cThe actual figures are impossible to know.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201craped along the way\u201d in the Fusion piece \u201cis problematic and inaccurate; it should say \u2018sexual assault,\u2019\u201c said Erin Siegal McIntyre, one of the reporters of the Fusion piece. \u201cIn my brief experience working in TV, this kind of error happened a lot. Looking at the piece now, I\u2019m kind of stunned to see \u2018rape\u2019 in the lead and not \u2018sexual assault.\u2019\u201c\n\nAnecdotal estimates are not a substitute for detailed, documented interviews with migrants, though those can be difficult to obtain because of a reluctance to report sexual violence. The Mexican National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in 2011 interviewed 750 migrants in Tapachula, Mexico, near the Guatemala border and reported that 8.3 percent of women surveyed said they were forced to have sex during their journey, 9.2 percent said they were sexually fondled or touched and 28.2 percent said they exchanged sex for goods or services. But this also was before much of the journey through Mexico had started.\n\nThis turns out to be a bad case of academic telephone. Each time the statistic was repeated in another paper, nuance was lost. A number that originally referred to any kind of sexual experience, whether wanted or not, eventually became rape. It appears no one bothered to look back at the original source document. They were content to simply rely on a citation to Amnesty International, even if it was not Amnesty\u2019s figure.\n\nSexual violence against women is a serious issue, and it\u2019s important not to minimize it. Though it is thorough, the 2017 Doctors Without Borders report based on recent interviews does not suggest, as Trump does, that it applies to all migrant women. (Trump\u2019s framing is worthy of Two Pinocchios.) Moreover, note that the percentage of women who reported rape is about 10 percent, similar to the NIPH study.", "lang": "en"}
