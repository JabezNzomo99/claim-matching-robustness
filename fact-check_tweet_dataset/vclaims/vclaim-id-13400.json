We do not have information about what kind of agent was used, how much of it there was, what its volume was; we do not have information about who was poisoned, what happened to them, where they disappeared to, etc.\u201d\n\nBut Peskov said despite the \u201clack of cooperation,\u201d the \u201cuse of such strong chemical warfare agents in Europe is a very dangerous fact, and is a matter of great concern.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, November 23, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed the Skripal poisoning case was merely an attempt by British authorities to distract from Britain\u2019s upcoming withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\"I don\u2019t ask rhetorical questions any more. I insist: in this primate way [British Prime Minister Theresa] May\u2019s government tries to play down the agenda of Brexit and the discussion of their own resignation. Too banal? It\u2019s the best that they can do,\" Tass cites Zakharova as saying on her Facebook page on Friday.\n\nWhile it is not possible to know the motivation of British authorities for releasing the video at this time, Moscow has long denied evidence showing a Russian hand in the Skripal poisoning and it is evident the Kremlin has attempted to advance other distractions.\n\nThe case for Russian involvement in the Salisbury poisoning incident is quite strong. As Polygraph.info previously reported, the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) confirmed that the substance used to poison the victims was Novichok, a nerve agent that was developed by Russia.\n\nThe latest CCTV footage release builds on previous photo evidence putting the suspects at the scene of the crime on the day of the poisoning. The suspects also returned to Moscow on the same day the Skripals were poisoned, after two trips to Salisbury on their with their two day \u201ctourist\u201d visit.\n\nTraces of Novichok were also found in the hotel room booked by the two suspects. The perfume bottle which held the chemical was also recovered, after a British man picked up the bottle and gave it to his girlfriend. Dawn Sturgess died and Charlie Rowley fell ill, but recovered.\n\nShortly after the poisoning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the motivation behind the Skripal poisoning could \u201cbe found among those who are seeking to obstruct the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\u201d\n\nBut that conspiracy theory, just like the current attempt to say the Skripal affair is nothing but a distraction from Brexit, was false.", "lang": "en"}
