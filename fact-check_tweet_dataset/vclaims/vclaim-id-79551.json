That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says.\n\nAn acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is to the water used by three average Austin households in a year.\n\nAnd the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority.\n\nThis result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years.\n\nAnother way to suss Meszaro\u2019s claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years\u2019 worth of Austin\u2019s water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011.\n\nMeszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austin\u2019s water use.\n\nEqualed or exceeded is the long and short of it. We rate this claim as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
