The crime volume consists of both index crimes and non-index crimes or less serious offenses.\n\nIn a speech at the police service\u2019s 115th anniversary celebration, Dela Rosa said:\n\nDela Rosa was PNP chief from July 2016 to April 2018.\n\nFrom July to December 2016, the PNP recorded 63,690 index crimes, a 33.51 percent decrease from 96,198 incidents in the same period in 2015.\n\nA report from the Office of the President said index crimes dropped 29.07 percent from 124,477 cases from July 2016 to June 2017 to 88,293 cases for the same period a year after.\n\nIndex crimes went down to 26,120 or by 32.28 percent for the period of January to April 2018, compared to 38,570 cases recorded in the same period the year before.\n\nA total of 6,156 index crimes were listed in April 2018 when Dela Rosa retired from service. This was a 46.5 percent drop from the 11,503 index crimes tracked in June 2016, a month before his appointment.\n\nDela Rosa\u2019s campaign ad is accurate in stating 1.3 million drug offenders had surrendered, if it meant the surrenders from July 2016 to April 2018 when he was PNP chief. According to PNP\u2019s annual reports in 2016 and 2017, a total of 1,258,597 million drug pushers and users turned themselves in.\n\nThe PNP, however, was not always at the helm of the Duterte administration\u2019s anti-illegal drug campaign.\n\nIn October 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte sidelined the PNP from his war on drugs and handed over sole responsibility to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. The PNP returned to the drug war two months later, with PDEA still as the lead agency.\n\nDela Rosa\u2019s official TV ad employs association and dramatization. It emphasizes Dela Rosa\u2019s association with Duterte who is shown raising the candidate\u2019s hand at the end of the video.\n\nThe ad features a layout and computer-generated effects inspired by comic books, most notably referencing Mars Ravelo\u2019s \u201cDarna\u201d and her use of a glowing \u201cbato\u201d (stone) to transform. The storyline and cinematography also recall classic Filipino action films.\n\nAs drug addicts portrayed like zombies chase innocent civilians through dark alleys, Dela Rosa, just like \u201cDarna,\u201d is summoned using a stone to fight the drug addicts.\n\nOffice of the President.
