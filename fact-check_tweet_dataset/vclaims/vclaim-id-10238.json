No, that did not happen. The stomach-churning act never took place, the story was not true. It was invented by a site specializing in publishing fake stories.\n\nIt first appeared on April 10, 2018 on the website World News Daily Report and was titled titled \"Man contracts flesh-eating disease after eating boyfriend's anus while he had diarrhea\" (archived here). The article opened:\n\nSan Francisco, CA | A 28-year-old man is lying in critical condition after he contracted necrotizing fasciitis, a rare form of flesh-eating bacteria.\n\nAdam Rader, 28, was transported to UCSF Medical Center after suffering from severe pain in his mouth and throat, as well as fever, and vomiting. Rader was rapidly diagnosed by the medical staff after his boyfriend told doctors his mouth had been in contact with diarrhea. \"He knew I had gastroenteritis but I guess he was still really intoxicated from the GHB and the ecstasy\" his boyfriend, Benjamin Segura, told reporters.\n\nRader apparently did not heed his boyfriend's warnings and attempted oral sex on his partner's anal region, although he was apparently already suffering from the flu.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail might have mistaken the story for a real news article:\n\nBut the man in the picture was actually found in a Tucson, Arizona park in 2015 after suffering a seizure and the blurred out region of his face was not eaten by flesh-eating bacteria, it was just some band-aid:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Panel of Saudi Scientists Did NOT Conclude Europeans Evolved From Pigs\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Get Arm Bitten Off By Pet Shark He Raised In His Bathtub\n\u2022 Fake News: Child NOT Born In India With 12-inch-long Penis, NOT Venerated As Incarnation Of Ganesh\n\u2022 Two Canadian Men Arrested For Running Fake News Site To Fund Poutine Addiction\n\u2022 Fake News: Nursing Home Employee Addicted To Sex Did NOT Force-Feed Elderly With Viagra", "lang": "en"}
