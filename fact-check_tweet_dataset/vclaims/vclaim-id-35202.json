The study found bats \u201cmay be candidates as the natural host\u201d of the SARS coronavirus.\n\nThe post states: \u201cRemember in the early days of the new novel coronavirus, that it was suggested in the media that bats may have been involved!\u201d.\n\nHowever the link between bats and viruses, including coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS, has been documented before and since the 2010 study.\n\nA 2013 study published by The Royal Society, the United Kingdom\u2019s national science academy, found bats host more than 61 viruses infectious to humans.\n\nA 2006 American Society for Microbiology study stated \u201cthe virus responsible for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this group of bat-associated viruses\u201d. The \u201c2002 to 2003 outbreak\u201d refers to SARS, which affected 26 countries in that period.\n\nAnd a January 2019 paper also examined how bats are able to harbour many types of coronavirus.\n\nThe post then refers to a paper published on January 31, 2020, on bioRxiv, a website that makes unpublished,unedited and non-peer-reviewed life sciences studies available.\n\nThe study, which was withdrawn within days of being posted following criticism of its scientific research methods, claimed to have found four \u201cinsertions\" of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - \u201cwhich are unique to the 2019-nCoV\u201d that all have \u201cidentity or similarity\u201d to those found in two strains of the HIV-1 virus.\n\nUniversity of New South Wales microbiology expert Professor Peter White described the study as \"complete nonsense\".\n\nProf White said the study\u2019s analysis was flawed because the matches between the two viruses were just random matches of \"very short sequences of the entire 10,000 long amino acid sequence of the 2019 novel coronavirus.\"\n\n\u201cThe first flaw is that they didn\u2019t validate their method, and when sought to show HIV compares with the novel coronavirus, they got a positive result.\n\n\"Any other virus (of the more than many thousands we know exist) would have produced a similar result.\"\n\nThe post also says that the paper claimed the four HIV sequences in 2019-nCoV \u201cwould not be possible in nature,\u201d and says \u201cHence the new novel coronavirus is MAN-MADE\u201d.\n\nBut the paper does not state that the sequences are \u201cnot possible\u201d. In the abstract the authors state: \u201cThe finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity / similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.\u201d\n\nAsked if insertions meant human intervention, Prof White said it did not and that an \u201cinsertion\u201d of a new segment \u201ccould easily happen by mutation in nature\u201d.\n\nThe withdrawn paper made no claim that the virus was man-made.\n\nThe bioRxiv website has placed a warning on new coronavirus-related research papers stating that \u201cthese are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed\u201d and \"should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice / health-related behaviour, or be reported in news media as established information\".", "lang": "en"}
