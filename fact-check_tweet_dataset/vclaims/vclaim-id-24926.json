Former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony before Congress had pundits trying to answer that question.\n\nOn the July 25 episode of \"Fox & Friends,\" host Ainsley Earhardt said news reports that said Trump could be indicted after leaving office were \"not factually correct\" because they didn\u2019t take into account a correction Mueller made to his testimony.\n\n\"He corrected himself and he said something about, \u2018we couldn\u2019t come up with a determination,\u2019 which means that they couldn\u2019t find a crime,\" Earhardt said. \"But if you watched ABC, if you watched CBS, if you watched NBC, ABC said that Trump could still face criminal charges after he leaves office. That\u2019s not necessarily true.\"\n\nHowever, \"true\" is the exact word Mueller used when asked if Trump could be charged after his presidency, and the former special counsel\u2019s correction was about something totally different.\n\n\"A president can be indicted when he leaves office, I know that,\" Earhardt said on air the next day. \"I was questioning whether this president will be indicted based on the Mueller report.\"\n\nSince the topic involves speculation about future legal issues, we decided not to rate Earhardt\u2019s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. But there\u2019s clearly some confusion over whether Trump could be prosecuted once his time in the White House ends, so we wanted to step in with the facts.\n\nThe bottom line: Mueller testified twice that a president could be indicted after leaving office, and the four legal experts we spoke to all agreed.\n\nWhat Mueller said about charges after office\n\nThroughout his testimony, Mueller made it clear that Trump the president could not be indicted. But Trump the citizen, like all ex-presidents, is a different story.\n\nHere\u2019s Mueller\u2019s first exchange on the matter, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.:\n\nNadler: \"Under Department of Justice policy, the president could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice crimes after he leaves office, correct?\"\n\nHere\u2019s the second exchange, with Rep. Ken Buck, R-Co.:\n\nBuck: \"Okay, but could you charge the president with a crime after he left office?\"\n\nBuck: \"You believe that he committed \u2014 you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office?\"\n\nMueller: \"I'm not certain because I haven't looked at the ethical standards, but the OLC opinion says that the prosecutor, while he cannot bring a charge against a sitting president, nonetheless he can continue the investigation to see if there are any other persons who might be drawn into the conspiracy.\"\n\nNotably, while Mueller said Trump could face charges after he leaves office, he did not say that the president should face charges.\n\nLegal experts we spoke to agreed with Mueller.\n\n\"Once a president is out of office, the primary reasons to avoid prosecution \u2014 deference to impeachment and the need to avoid distraction of the chief executive from his or her important duties \u2014 both evaporate,\" said Mark Osler, professor of law at the University of St. Thomas.\n\nArguments based on the president\u2019s \"supposed position at the top of the prosecutorial hierarchy\" also lose force for ex-presidents, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz.\n\nDiane Marie Amann, professor of law at the University of Georgia, pointed out that even the Justice Department ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted includes a line specifying that the prohibition fades when he or she leaves office.\n\n\"The constitutional structure permits a sitting president to be subject to criminal process only after he leaves office or is removed therefrom through the impeachment process,\" it says.\n\nEarhardt and others \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 confused Mueller\u2019s remarks about Trump being charged after his presidency with other comments Mueller later corrected.\n\nBut Mueller made one correction to his testimony, and it had nothing to do with whether Trump could be charged once he\u2019s out of the White House.\n\nThe correction addressed Mueller\u2019s response to a question from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., when the former special counsel seemed to suggest Trump would have been indicted were it not for the Justice Department\u2019s ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange between Lieu and Mueller:\n\nLieu: \"The reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?\"\n\nOn its face, Mueller\u2019s answer implied that the OLC ruling was the only reason Trump was not indicted. But that\u2019s not what his team has said in the report or in public statements.\n\nLater, Mueller clarified his response. He said:\n\n\"I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu, who said, and I quote, \u2018You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion.\u2019\n\nThat is not the correct way to say it. As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.\"", "lang": "en"}
