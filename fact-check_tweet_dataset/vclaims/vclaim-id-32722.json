Mulroney and her husband have both denied the claim as well.\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry announced in early January that they intend to \u201cstep back\u201d as senior members of Britain\u2019s royal family and seek financial independence.

Her husband, Ben, also called the claim \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf certain investigative journalists were to do their jobs, perhaps they would see that the Shoebox Project Foundation is owned by a Mr Roy in North Carolina and has no affiliations or ties to our charity The Shoebox Project,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThe Shoebox Project Foundation that registered the domain is indeed a separate entity from Mulroney\u2019s The Shoebox Project. Her charity, which helps homeless and at-risk women across the U.S. and Canada, is registered in Canada, whereas the Shoebox Project Foundation is registered as a nonprofit corporation in North Carolina under someone named Tye Roy.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the individual who registered that domain using the organization name \u2018Shoebox Project Foundation\u2019 is not, and has never been, associated with our charity in any way,\u201d Lesley Hendrey, the executive director of The Shoebox Project, said in a statement to Fox News.", "lang": "en"}
