The article states that, \"India, that is Bharat, shall be a union of states and the territory.\"\n\n\"From June 15, Bharat's name will remain only Bharat in every language: (Supreme Court). Congratulations to the countrymen,\" Facebook posts in Hindi say.\n\n\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nOn searching with the same caption, we found that it was viral with the false claim.\n\nWe searched for news reports on the verdict being mentioned and found that a plea was filed before the Supreme Court of India by a petitioner who had sought a direction to amend the Constitution and replace the word 'India' with 'Bharat' or 'Hindustan'.\n\nHowever, the apex court had not given a verdict in favour of renaming the country, nor did it state that from June 15, 2020, the name of the country would be called 'Bharat' in all languages.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court disposed of the petition filed for changing the name of India to Bharat, while allowing it to be treated as a representation before the concerned Union ministries.\n\nThe three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde stated that the court cannot pass any directions to amend the Constitution for such name change. \"We cannot do that. India is already called Bharat in the Constitution\", CJI SA Bobde said, referring to Article 1 of the Constitution reported Live Law.\n\nArticle 1 of the Indian Constitution says that, \"India, that is Bharat, shall be a union of states and the territory,\" and the petitioner had approached the court to replace the word 'India'.\n\nBOOM read the order pronounced by the court, which states, \"The present petition is directed to be treated as a representation and may be considered by the appropriate Ministries. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.\"\n\nWe found no mention in the order that states India would be referred to as 'Bharat' in all languages from June 15, 2020.\n\nThat would mean, the issue stays alive and if the Centre does not act or rejects the representation, the petitioner could move to the Supreme Court again.", "lang": "en"}
