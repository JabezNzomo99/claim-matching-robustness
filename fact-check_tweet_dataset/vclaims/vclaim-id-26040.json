The winner of their Aug. 14, 2018 primary will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\n\nNicholson\u2019s 30-second ad shows clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump, including saying Trump is offensive to different groups of people. It starts -- and ends -- with Vukmir saying:\n\nThat leaves the impression that Vukmir never endorsed Trump for president. But she she eventually did -- prominently.\n\nThe clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump are from March 2016, prior to Wisconsin\u2019s primary election in April 2016. Trump lost that contest by 13 points to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But, of course, Trump went on to win the GOP nomination before defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November 2016 general election.\n\nBefore the Wisconsin primary, Vukmir first supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the GOP nomination before dropping out in September 2015.\n\nThen she backed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his run in March 2016. Vukmir said she ultimately voted for Cruz in the Wisconsin primary.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, since it is running in the days prior to the election, it makes it seem as if this is Vukmir\u2019s current position. It\u2019s not.\n\nNicholson says that Vukmir said: \"I\u2019m not endorsing Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut that was before Trump became the GOP nominee for president in 2016. After he won the nomination, Vukmir endorsed Trump and prominently supported him, as she does today.", "lang": "en"}
