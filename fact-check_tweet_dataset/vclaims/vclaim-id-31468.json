Stoddard, who cautioned viewers not to count out Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg even though the former New York City mayor looked \u201cuncoachable\u201d and committed \u201cmany blunders\u201d in the Democratic debate on Feb. 19.\n\n\u201cI think that Donald Trump had disastrous debate performances. Many answers were so cringeworthy, you just couldn\u2019t even believe he was still standing on the stage, and he\u2019s president,\u201d Stoddard said on Neil Cavuto\u2019s Fox News program on Feb. 20.\n\nTrump initially lashed out on Twitter saying that \u201cI won every one of my debates,\u201d and challenged Stoddard and Cavuto to \u201c[c]heck the polls taken immediately after the debates.\u201d\n\nTrump expounded on that during the rally in Colorado a few hours later, again referencing the segment on Cavuto\u2019s show but refusing to use Stoddard\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, wait a minute, I won every debate, it\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we sent them polls. Poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but I won them by a lot. \u2026 I\u2019m just saying, every poll \u2014 you you know they do those polls right after 3, 4, 500,000 people. Time magazine.'\u201d\n\nTwo minutes later, Dan Scavino, the Trump campaign\u2019s social media manager, handed Trump a stack of news clippings. Trump then spent the next 10 minutes reading numbers from what he called \u201cpolls\u201d taken by Time, CNBC, Drudge and others immediately after the debates that indicated the public overwhelmingly believed Trump won all of the primary and general election debates.\n\n\u201cI won every single debate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThen three and a half, four years later, I have to listen to a person saying how we didn\u2019t do well. Because these people [Trump then pointed toward the press] are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign for details about which polls specifically Trump was citing, but we did not get a response.\n\nHowever, from the ones that Trump held up, we could see that he was referring to online opt-in surveys such as these from Time and CNBC, in which readers are asked to respond or vote online for who they thought won the debate. They are not scientific polls, and they carry disclaimers making that clear.\n\u2022 From a Time survey after the second Republican primary debate, published on Sept. 17, 2015: \u201cDISCLAIMER: This web poll is informal, not scientific. It reflects opinions of site visitors who voluntarily participate. Results may not represent the opinions of the public as a whole.\u201d\n\u2022 From a Time survey after the 12th Republican primary debate, published on March 11, 2016: \u201cA disclaimer: Online reader polls like this one are not statistically representative of eligible primary voters. They are a measure, however imprecise, of which candidates have the most energized online supporters, or most social media savvy fan base.\u201d\n\u2022 From a CNBC survey after an Oct. 28, 2015, Republican primary debate: \u201cDisclaimer: This is an informal poll. Results are not scientific and may not necessarily reflect the opinions of the public as a whole.\u201d\n\nAfter the first general election debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton on Sept. 26, 2016, Trump tweeted the results of more than a half dozen of such informal polls, commenting, \u201cSuch a great honor. Final debate polls are in \u2013 and the MOVEMENT wins!\u201d At the rally, Trump read the results from three of those polls \u2014 including two from the conservative outlets Breitbart and Drudge, both of which showed more than 75% of respondents thought Trump won the debate.\n\nBut those opt-in, online surveys stand in stark contrast to the result of scientific polls. Here\u2019s a sampling of those polls on who won the first debate:\n\nThe statistical website FiveThirtyEight, which is owned by ABC News, wrote on Sept. 28, 2016: \u201cEvery scientific poll we\u2019ve encountered so far suggests that voters thought Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in Monday night\u2019s debate.\u201d\n\nExperts at the American Association for Public Opinion Research warn that opt-in internet surveys are notoriously unreliable, and they have cautioned that self-selection into a survey means that it is not randomized \u201cmaking it impossible to know the probability or likelihood of any particular individual being included in a study.\u201d\n\nAfter several Fox News hosts cited online opt-in surveys to suggest that Trump won the debate, Fox News\u2019 vice president of public-opinion research, Dana Blanton, sent a memo to producers and the politics team reminding them that such polls \u201cdo not meet our editorial standards.\u201d\n\nIn the memo \u2014 obtained by Business Insider \u2014 Blanton wrote that \u201conline \u2018polls\u2019 like the one on Drudge, Time, etc. where people can opt-in or self-select \u2026 are really just for fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cNews networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls \u2014 for good reason,\u201d Blanton wrote. \u201cThey know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense, not true measures of public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs most of the publications themselves clearly state, the sample obviously can\u2019t be representative of the electorate because they only reflect the views of those Internet users who have chosen to participate,\u201d Blanton wrote. \u201cAnother problem \u2014 we know some campaigns/groups of supporters encourage people to vote in online polls and flood the results.\u201d\n\nIndeed, The Daily Dot, which covers internet culture, reported after the first general election debate in 2016 that Trump supporters used sites like Reddit and 4Chan to bombard the online surveys and manipulate the results in Trump\u2019s favor. Whether that happened, or to what degree, is impossible to know, but the fact that it could have happened points to the unreliability of such surveys.", "lang": "en"}
