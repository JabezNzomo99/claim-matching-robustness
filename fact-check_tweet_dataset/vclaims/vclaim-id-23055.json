It includes a screenshot of a 2016 article in the Express reporting then-armed forces minister Penny Mordaunt saying this during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nThe text accompanying the image suggests this EU army will use some form of conscription. Both claims are incorrect.\n\nThe UK could not be \u201cforced\u201d to participate in EU military policies even if we stay in the EU.\n\nWhether or not EU nations wish to create an \u201cEU army\u201d, and regardless of what that might actually entail, the European Commission can\u2019t propose laws about security or defence. On issues like this, member countries effectively have a veto, so the UK would only take part if it chose to.\n\nThere are no formal plans in place for an EU army, and so there are no \u201cEU regulations\u201d on drafting people into it.\n\nThe EU does have various policies for defensive and security cooperation. For example, under the Common Security and Defence Policy, EU countries can pool military funding and resources. The UK participates in military operations through this policy.\n\nThe EU has also established Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) a strategy which aims to \u201cjointly develop defence capabilities and make them available for EU military operations\u201d which the UK has chosen not to participate in.\n\nWe wrote about the idea of an EU army in more detail back in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
