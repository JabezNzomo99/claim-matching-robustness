He tweeted this image with the text, \u201cIn the eyes of this devotee There is No Fear of brutality There is No fear of oppression This is the Power of Faith #Sabarimala #Ayyappa,\u201d suggesting that the subject of the image was perhaps a victim of brutality. At the time of writing this article, Mishra\u2019s tweet was liked over 2,700 times and retweeted over 1,400 times.\n\nThe same image was earlier circulated by Squint Woke Neon (@squintneon) and Hindu Mahasabha activist Kamlesh Tiwari who tweeted \u2013 \u201cSee the violent treatment of Kerala police on Lord Ayyappa devotees.\u201d Both these posts drew a combined retweet count of nearly 1,300.\n\nSeveral other right-wing handles on both Twitter and Facebook circulated the image with the identical narrative of brutality on a Sabarimala devotee (1, 2, 3).\n\nThe image is of photo-shoot and NOT Sabarimala protest\n\nJournalist Bobins Abraham pointed out on Twitter that a photo-shoot of a man named Rajesh Kurup was being circulated on social media as the brutality of Kerala police on Ayyappa devotees.\n\nAbraham had posted another picture of Kurup where the photographer\u2019s stamp \u2013 Midhun Krishna photography \u2013 is visible.\n\nAlt News reached out to Rajesh Kurup who confirmed to us that the pictures were part of a photo-shoot and that the one shared by Kapil Mishra was shot about four days ago.\n\nWe also contacted the photographer of the second image, Midhun Krishna. He said that the stamp on the photograph was indeed his and the picture was shot on October 6. Sabarimala was opened to women for the first time on October 17, which hints that the image could not be a depiction of protests which started after the temple permitted women\u2019s entry.\n\nSince protests against the entry of women in Sabarimala began, social media has been brimming with misinformation. Delhi MLA Kapil Mishra, prior to the aforementioned case, also spread the fake news about a devotee dying in police action. In the past, numerous other false images and claims were viral on social media.", "lang": "en"}
