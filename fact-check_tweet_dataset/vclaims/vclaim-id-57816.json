The state of the Strategic National Stockpile was not where it needed to be for the pandemic, particularly with N95 masks, which were not replenished after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. But it wasn\u2019t bare. In November 2019, the former director of the stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise, with extensive holdings of many needed items.\n\nMuir followed up on this one, asking Trump why he did not do more to address the stockpile during his three years in office. Trump blamed Democratic efforts to investigate him over Russia and Ukraine, including the impeachment trial.\n\nThis claim, which Muir did not correct, rates Pants on Fire. COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus. There was no \"bad\" test to inherit for detecting a new virus.\n\nPresented with dire outlooks for COVID-19 deaths over the summer months, Trump incorrectly said they did not take into account mitigation efforts, such as social distancing and mask requirements.\n\nMuir asked Trump about dire COVID-19 predictions from two institutions, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\nThe University of Washington\u2019s updated model shows 134,000 Americans could die by August, nearly double their previous projection. Contrary to what Trump said, this model factors in mitigation efforts.\n\n\"We\u2019ve never put forward a forecast that included no mitigation,\" said institute spokeswoman Amelia Apfel in an email.\n\nThe other model Muir mentioned, from Johns Hopkins University, stems from an internal federal government slideshow. That document contained one slide that projected 3,000 deaths per day by June.\n\nThe information came from a model created by Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Lessler told NPR that his scenarios do assume some degree of mitigation.\n\nPelosi did visit the Chinatown area in San Francisco on Feb. 24, encouraging residents to eat and shop. But she didn\u2019t talk about people going dancing, and she didn\u2019t say there was no problem concerning the coronavirus.\n\n\"I\u2019m here today, particularly, to say thank you to the community for the sense of family values and sense of community that they provide,\" Pelosi said. \"But also to say to everyone: we should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it\u2019s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.\"\n\nPelosi, at another point, specifically stressed that people be concerned about the virus.\n\n\"Prevention, prevention, prevention,\" she told reporters. \"We want people to be concerned and vigilant. However, we don\u2019t want them to be afraid.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Schumer, Trump\u2019s wrong. Here\u2019s Schumer, in a joint statement with Pelosi, on Feb. 27:\n\n\"The United States government must do more to address the spread of the deadly coronavirus in a smart, strategic, and serious way and we stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion in Congress and with the administration to achieve this necessary goal. Lives are at stake \u2014 this is not the time for name-calling or playing politics.\"\n\nAnd lastly, Trump\u2019s criticism of Schumer and Pelosi ignores some of his own statements and actions in February and March. On the same day Pelosi was touring San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, Trump tweeted: \"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.\"", "lang": "en"}
