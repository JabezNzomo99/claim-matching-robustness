A Facebook post that published on Feb. 14 would have you think otherwise.\n\n\"This planet might be able to support perhaps as many as half of a billion people who could live a sustainable life in relative comfort,\" reads the text over a picture of Clinton. \"Human populations must be greatly diminished, and as quickly as possible to limit further environmental damage.\"\n\nThis post, which attributes the quote to \"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\" was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find a credible source corroborating that Clinton said this.\n\nOther websites such as Alex Jones's Infowars and AZ Quotes, among other sources, have reported on a similar quote. But even those websites identified someone else, not Clinton, as the speaker. (And they still didn't get it right.)\n\nThe quote has previously been attributed to Eric Pianka, an evolutionary ecologist who holds the Denton A. Cooley Centennial Professor of Zoology post at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nIn a June 24, 2011, post about Al Gore and population control, Infowars describes Pianka as a \"very prominent advocate of radical human population control\" and credits Pianka as its source for the quote.\n\nPianka's essay, \"What nobody wants to hear, but everyone needs to know,\" speculates that Earth is poised for another population crash a la the Bubonic plague in the 1330s.\n\nBut his essay doesn\u2019t include the statement Infowars and others claim he said.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, has addressed population growth before. On Feb. 9, 1999, when she was the first lady, she gave a speech about Cairo at The Hague. Among other things, she discussed reproductive health care and family planning.\n\n\"The world agreed \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that smaller families and slower population growth are created by choice and opportunity, not control and coercion,\" she said.\n\nMore recently, Bindi Irwin, the daughter of crocodile hunter Steve Irwin, criticized a State Department e-journal in 2013 for revising an essay she wrote and omitting Irwin\u2019s opinion that the growing population poses the greatest risk to conservation.\n\nAs for the made-up quote in the Facebook post, we rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
