The claims in the post about what the UK would be forced to do if it stayed in the EU are incorrect.\n\nThe French Embassy in London confirmed to us that Mr Macron said none of these things.\n\nWe can find no evidence that Mr Macron has said anything like this.\n\nIf the UK remained in the EU we would of course have to continue following EU law. Following EU rules and regulations is a necessary part of membership of the EU and we signed up to this principle in 1972.\n\nThere are certain areas of EU regulation that the UK has opted out of. One of these areas is membership of the Euro currency.\n\nIf we remained in the EU, we would retain all of our opt-outs. The treaty governing the UK\u2019s opt-out of the Euro says \u201cthe United Kingdom shall not be obliged or committed to adopt the euro without a separate decision to do so by its government and parliament\u201d.\n\nWe can find no evidence that Mr Macron has said this, and it\u2019s incorrect.\n\nThere is no demand on Britain to take 300,000 migrants if it remains in the EU. Nor is this demand made of any other EU member states.\n\nAgain, there is no evidence Macron ever said this, and it\u2019s incorrect.\n\n\u00a339 billion is the estimated cost of the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d we would pay the EU as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It covers things like payments to the EU budget until 2020, and other outstanding commitments and liabilities we have towards the EU until 2064.\n\nIf we remained in the EU, we would pay our membership fee each year which would cover all these things.\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on 10 December that the UK can revoke its Article 50 notification by itself, without requiring the agreement of other EU member states. This means that there is no clear mechanism by which other member states could impose new conditions, such as the ones suggested in this claim, on the UK for remaining in the EU.", "lang": "en"}
