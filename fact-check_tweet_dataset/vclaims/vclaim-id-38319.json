Did you understand, now?\"\n\nThe screenshot of the now-deleted post can be seen below.\n\nThe photo has also been tweeted by one Renuka Jain. Along with the caption - same as in the above posts - she went on to falsely reason it that S Murlidhar saw the hate speeches by the BJP politicians, only.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the second photo in the misleading post is from when Sonia Gandhi filed her nomination for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nDuring the nomination filing at Rae Bareli collectorate, she was accompanied by Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Robert Vadra and lawyer KC Kaushik, the man who has been misidentified as justice S Murlidhar.\n\nClick here and here for articles to know more about the nomination.\n\nBOOM also found a YouTube video uploaded by Asian News International (ANI) in April last year. In the video, lawyer KC Kaushik can be seen speaking to reporters about the row at that time over Rahul Gandhi's citizenship.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the video reads: \"Amethi (UP), Apr 22 (ANI): While speaking to ANI, on objection raised on Rahul Gandhi's nomination, lawyer of Rahul Gandhi KC Kaushik said, \"Rahul Gandhi was born in India and he holds an Indian passport, there is no issue of his citizenship. His passport, voter-ID, and his income tax, everything is of India.\"\n\nAlso read: Dated Video Of Guns Hidden In Ghee Cans Falsely Linked To Delhi Riots\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the photos of the two men clearly show they are not the same.\n\n\n\nJustice S Muralidhar is in the news after the central government transferred him from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court hours after he had criticised the Delhi police for failing to register FIRs against a few politicians for their alleged hate speeches in the run-up to the riots that hit north-east Delhi this week. The move was criticised by several members of the legal fraternity and opposition parties. The government on its part has argued that the transfer order was routine and should not be politicised. The transfer had been earlier recommended by a Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice Bobde on February 12, 2020. Read more about it here.", "lang": "en"}
