According to the clip, the leaves should be sun-dried and crushed. A tablespoon of the crushed leaves should then be mixed in a glass of water to make tea.\n\nClaim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool that identifies potentially dubious posts shared across the platform, flagged the video for fact checkers to verify.

Malunggay and kamias tea is not part of this.\n\nScientists all over the world are currently racing to develop a cure and vaccine for COVID-19 but experts say it will take time.
