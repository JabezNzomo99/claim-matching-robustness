Palestinian and Israeli officials have blamed each other\u2019s bombs for some of the civilian deaths -- for example, the 15 Palestinians killed at a UN school in Jabalia on . When Tapper went on air, the UN had not yet been able to definitively resolve their conflicting claims, although they\u2019ve since .\n\nOther children have died during gunfights between the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Hamas, and it\u2019s impossible to say definitively whose bullets killed them.\n\nTracing deaths in the IDF back eight years takes a little more work. Tapper told us he looked at the Israeli government\u2019s figures on casualties for their four major military operations since 2006:\n\n\n\n That adds up to 172 deaths, and Tapper correctly accounted for the major Israeli military operations since 2006. These figures, Tapper told us, \"provide an important sense of just how large these Gaza children death numbers are -- more than all the IDF troops killed in action the Israeli government deemed necessary to protect its country in the last eight years combined.\"\n\nBesides the four operations above, three confrontations between Gaza and Israel have caused Israeli military casualties: Operations Summer Rain and Autumn Clouds in 2006, and Operation Hot Winter in 2008, which in total resulted in the deaths of eight Israeli soldiers. That takes us up to 180 deaths in what the IDF has publicly named \"operations.\"\n\nWe found a few other Israeli military deaths that likely should be added to any tally. In 2008, two Israeli soldiers were after being kidnapped during the Second Lebanon War, and an during Operation Cast Lead. An additional 34 on-duty soldiers and four off-duty soldiers also have died in (all the attacks were from Palestinians).\n\nIncluding them takes the total to 221 Israeli soldier deaths, compared to the deaths of 229 Palestinian children.\n\nTapper, while grilling an Israeli spokesman, said, \"Israel has, in the last three weeks, killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006.\"\n\nHis figure for Palestinian child deaths comes from the United Nations. According to humanitarian workers on the ground, more than 200 Palestinian children have died in the last three weeks from the Israel-Hamas conflict, though it\u2019s not clear in every case whether the Israeli bullets and bombs are directly responsible.\n\nThat is indeed more than the number of Israeli soldiers killed since 2006 while engaged in military operations, our review found.\n\nTapper\u2019s numbers are accurate, but there remains some question about who bears responsibility for the deaths of every Palestinian child. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
