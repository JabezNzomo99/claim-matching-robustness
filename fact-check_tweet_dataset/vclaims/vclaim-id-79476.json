A day before this story appeared, the same website said that Clinton was killed attempting to do a stunt while filming a documentary in Missouri as well as in an FBI raid in New York.\n\nThe latest story said Clinton was sitting at the Chappaqua Motor Speedway in upstate New York (spoiler: it doesn\u2019t exist) \"when 11 tons of American steel and irony jumped the rails, injuring thirty-five people and killing Clinton.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s Twitter feed shows what she has actually been up to, and it doesn\u2019t involve monster truck rolls. On April 30, she said she was headed to an event in New York City for Onward Together, an organization she founded with former Gov. Howard Dean after the 2016 election to work on progressive causes.\n\nClinton is alive. This story rates Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
