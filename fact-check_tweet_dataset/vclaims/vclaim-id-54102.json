The caption also describes a unique tradition of Norwegian citizens of serving food in restaurants.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nWith the help of Google Reverse Image Search, we found this image on Shutterstock.com.\n\n The caption under the picture claims it to be from Berehove, Ukraine, dated December 14, 2017, in which a poor old man receives a hot lunch at a public kitchen for poor and homeless people.\n\nFurther when we put the keywords \u2018Berehove\u2019 \u2018Ukraine\u2019 \u2018public kitchen\u2019 \u2018poor and homeless people\u2019 we found similar images that prove that this picture is from Ukraine.\n\nOn digging further, we google searched by putting keywords such as \u2018suspension coffee\u2019 \u2018Norway\u2019 and we got to know that when one participates in the Suspended Coffee program for humanity, one can buy things for someone less fortunate.\n\nWe searched on the official website of suspended coffee and found that there are 14 cafes linked to this movement in Norway and none of them are similar to the photo that is posted on the Facebook page above.\n\nIn conclusion, the above fact-check proves that the picture in the Facebook post is not from Norway and the Facebook caption is not related to the picture at all.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
