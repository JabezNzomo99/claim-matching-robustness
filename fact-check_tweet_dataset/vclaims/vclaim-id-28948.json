The words were superimposed onto a 2013 image of Evans wearing a plain white Under Armour t-shirt.\n\nEvans, star of the popular \u201cCaptain America\u201d and \u201cAvengers\u201d films, has been politically vocal in recent years, publicly supporting Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. In March, outlets reported that he would be launching a bipartisan political website called \u201cA Starting Point\u201d with the stated goal of creating \u201cinformed, responsible, and empathetic citizens.\u201d\n\nThis meme, which first appeared after President Donald Trump was elected president, shows Evans wearing a t-shirt that bears the statement: \u201cNope. I won\u2019t stop whining or suck it up. Your vote supported a xenophobic, sexist, hate-filled, anti-gay, anti-choice platform. This is morally unacceptable to me and I proudly stand by my values.\u201d (RELATED: Did Morgan Freeman Say He Hates The Word \u2018Homophobia\u2019?)\n\nThe image, however, has been altered. The original, taken in 2013, shows Evans and one-time love interest Minka Kelly walking together, according to The Daily Mail. The photo has been cropped and photoshopped, with the original depicting Evans wearing a plain white Under Armour t-shirt.\n\nThere is no evidence that Evans has ever said, written or worn clothing that bears the statement found in the meme.", "lang": "en"}
