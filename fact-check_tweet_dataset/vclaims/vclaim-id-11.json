Other \u201creal names\u201d refer to nicknames, maiden names or middle names held by these figures. Such variations are common, and not evidence of fraud.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was born Barack Hussein Obama, II, as shown here on his birth certificate here . As reported by Reuters here , his stepfather was named Lolo Soetoro. \"Barry\" was a nickname here for Barack growing up.\n\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was married to a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi (as referenced here ), but there is no evidence of a connection to the name \u201cEsmi\u201d.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was born Kirsten Elizabeth Rutnik (as mentioned here ), not \"Rutnick.\" She went by \"Tina,\" (as referenced in a story here ) until she reached her 20s. In 2001, she married Jonathan Gillibrand (as referenced here )\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (whose last name is two words, not one) was born Warren Wilhelm, Jr, but this is no longer his legal name. Four years after his father's suicide, 18-year-old Bill changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm (as mentioned in a story here ), citing his mother's Italian family as the \"single most important influence\u201d in his life. In 2002, he officially shed his father's names. (More here ).\n\nBill de Blasio speaks with WNYC about his father's suicide here in 1979\n\nThe last name of the former Democratic congressman from Texas is spelled O'Rourke, not \"Orourke.\" His full name is Robert Francis O'Rourke (as referenced here ), but has gone by \"Beto,\" a nickname for \"Roberto\" since his childhood. (More here )\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was born Bernard Sanders (as referenced here ). \"Bernie\" is a common nickname for Bernard. The false claim that his last name is actually \"Gutman\" may come from a document here listing passengers from Antwerp, Belgium processed through Ellis Island in 1921. The name of Sanders' father was recorded as \"Eliasz Gitman,\" whose mother's name was written as \u201cJetti Gutman.\u201d Senator Sanders can be seen looking at this document with historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. at the 31:03 mark in the October 3, 2017 episode here of \"Finding Your Roots\" on PBS. Also in that episode, Sanders can be seen reviewing his father\u2019s Certificate of Naturalization, which names him as \"Elias Sanders.\" Bernie Sanders' father's 1928 Petition for Naturalization can be found here\n\nKamala Harris was born Kamala Devi Harris to Shyamala Gopalan and Donald Harris (as referenced here ). Donald Harris is a professor, emeritus at Stanford University. (Link here ). Her younger sister, who served as her campaign chairwoman before she ended her presidential run in December 2019, is named Maya. (More here )\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, was born Elizabeth Herring (as referenced here ). Growing up in Oklahoma City, she was known as \"Betsy\" to her mother and \"Liz\" to her classmates (More on that here ). She took the last name of her first husband, Jim Warren, when they married in 1968. After they divorced in 1980, she did not change her last name back to Herring, nor did she take the last name of her second and current husband, Bruce Mann, (as mentioned here ) when they married in 1980 (Click here for more facts on her).\n\n9. \u201cCory Booker was known as Tony Booker\u201d\n\nThe middle name of Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., is Anthony (as mentioned here ). Reuters could not find any information to suggest that he has ever gone by \"Tony,\" a common nickname for Anthony.\n\nHimpton is the middle name of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (as referenced thehill.com/people/eric-holder ). Reuters could not find any information to suggest that he has ever gone by \"Eric Himpton.\"\n\nPartly false: the ten Democrats with allegedly false names either go by their birth names, their nicknames, their married names, and/or their legal names.", "lang": "en"}
