He added that it will \u201csoon be catching up with our export of weapons.\u201d He noted specifically the growth of export of agricultural commodities.\n\nPutin\u2019s assertion, however, is contradicted by statistics in the Russian Federal Customs Service\u2019s 2016 economics report. According to the report, from January to September 2016, the export of food and agricultural products from Russia amounted to 5.1 percent of total exports with a 2.5 percent increase compared to 2015. The two main agricultural exports \u2013 wheat and vodka \u2013 totaled less than $3 billion in the first nine months of 2016.\n\nRussia crude oil and other energy products remain the largest part of the exports, amounting to 62.3 percent in January-September 2016 \u2013 a 6.2 percent decrease compared to 2015.\n\nOverall, the export of civilian products in 2016 decreased in the first nine months by 22.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015. It will take a productive fourth quarter for Putin\u2019s prediction to come through.\n\nRussian military exports officials said that from January to August 2016 military exports exceed $7 billion. Officials said military exports would likely be on par with 2015.\n\nOn November 22, Putin issued a presidential decree, classifying information about Russia\u2019s military export as a state top secret \u201cin the interests of national security.\u201d\n\nEdward Lucas, a chief editor at The Economist and senior vice-president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Polygraph.info that Putin\u2019s ability to tout civilian exports is limited.\n\n\u201cPutin has been talking about modernization since 2000,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then we have had seen endless promises and many efforts. They haven't worked. Russia has excellent entrepreneurs with excellent business ideas. But the predatory state hampers them.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
