Its headline for the sham Locsin report bore special characters and not just letters, ostensibly to evade detection: \u201cPagkatapos ng 1st Test Para Sa C0V|D19, Angel Locsin Nagpositibo sa Naturang Sakit sa 2nd Test Nito (After the 1st test for COVID-19, Angel Locsin turned out positive for the disease on her 2nd test).\u201d\n\nIts content is likewise deceptive, carrying an edited three-second clip from the March 6 episode of the GMA program Stand for Truth, where journalist Atom Araullo reported on \u201ctwo new cases\u201d of COVID-19 in the country. It replaced the show\u2019s original inset of locals with a screengrab of Locsin playing a tuberculosis patient, taken from an October 2013 episode trailer of the ABS-CBN drama series Maalaala Mo Kaya.\n\nRandomnames.club\u2019s fabricated story bears the same elements VERA Files Fact Check has observed in other hoaxes: the video content that stops playing after three seconds, which then invites viewers to share it on Facebook (FB) to continue watching, the abundance of ads on the story\u2019s landing page, and a deceitful publish date, which reads \u201cPublished Today\u201d despite the passage of time.\n\nA visit to the site's Home page also leads to an Error 404 page, while its About Us, Contact Us, and Privacy Policy tabs bear no useful information on the website\u2019s origin, purpose, contact details, and privacy guidelines.\n\nThe hoax circulated the same time Locsin announced the success of her UniTENTweStandPH campaign, which has raised over P11 million to buy isolation and sanitation tents, personal protective equipment and other supplies for 135 hospitals nationwide tending to COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe fake Locsin story, which is circulating through various seeded links redirecting to one post, has received over 3,000 reactions on FB.
