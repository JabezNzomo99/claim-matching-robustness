But he\u2019ll likely spend less time than that behind bars. During his brief stay behind bars, Turner will remain in protective custody, as perpetrators of sexual assault are often targeted by other inmates, according to TMZ. Turner\u2019s father had an outrageous statement regarding the crime, saying his son\u2019s conviction is \u201ca steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.\u201d And as if his comment wasn\u2019t already flat out lunacy, Turner Senior also told media outlets that \u201cthese sort of incidents are proof of how different people are treated unequally based on the circumstances they are portrayed in.\u201d \u201cI was born in this country, grew up here, spent my whole life being a law-abiding citizen. And then you have children, and one of them makes a slight mistake and gets sentenced to months in jail, while the slut that tricked him gets away completely free. This is just incredible.\u201d \u201cI know women are the weaker sex and all that, and I completely understand they should be treated a bit differently in certain situations, but come on. Being a slut isn\u2019t a crime yet, even though I think it should be. Tricking young, perspective athletes who are the future of this country by staging rape should be punishable by law. I mean, that girl ought to be given an Academy Award for her performance, seriously,\u201d he added. \u201cDoes anyone here have Steven Spielberg\u2019s phone number?\u201d Turner\u2019s father asked members of the press. \u201cOr maybe Angelina Jolie, I hear she\u2019s also trying out as a director? Maybe Mel Gibson, he\u2019s been through a lot and is always on the lookout for crazy, new talent? No? Too bad. Because I think that girl definitely deserves a shot at Hollywood, she was that good. I\u2019ve heard of faking orgasms, but faking a rape? She\u2019s something else. Great things await that girl in the future, if not in Hollywood, then she could always do porn. I mean, she\u2019s obviously a natural.\u201d\n\nThe article wasn\u2019t widely circulated until Turner was released from jail (after serving only three months) in early September 2016. Its first paragraph referenced a letter written by Turner\u2019s father that proved controversial during the trial, holding that Brock\u2019s sentence was a \u201csteep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.\u201d But as with all articles published by Newslo (as well as related sites sites Religionlo and Politicalo), the item used a factual introduction before introducing believable untruths. All articles on those three fake news sites featured a \u201cshow facts\u201d or \u201chide facts\u201d button (though all items displayed by default in \u201chide facts\u201d mode, obfuscating subsequent fabrications to new readers):\n\n\n\n Although Turner\u2019s father did write a letter in mid-2016 which included the \u201csteep price\u201d line, he did not say \u201c[b]eing a slut isn\u2019t a crime yet, even though I think it should be, \u201c[t]ricking young, perspective athletes who are the future of this country by staging rape should be punishable by law, or \u201cthat girl ought to be given an Academy Award for her performance, seriously.\u201d\n\nNewslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo articles almost always follow a format comprised of one paragraph containing true information and a balance of embellishments upon the truthful fraction. Previously, those sites spread falsehoods holding Chris Christie said a female version of Viagra would lead to increased \u201clesbianism\u201d and voted down a gender pay parity bill for religious reasons, an Alabama politician proposed saliva-based \u201chunger tests\u201d for food stamp recipients, Ted Cruz said the death of Antonin Scalia was suspiciously timed, Pat Robertson stated David Bowie was still alive after his death, and Mike Pence opined that if abortion was allowed in instances of rape that women would attempt to \u201cget raped\u201d in order to obtain an abortion. As with those articles, the item took Turner\u2019s father\u2019s letter and appended a balance of falsified statements.", "lang": "en"}
