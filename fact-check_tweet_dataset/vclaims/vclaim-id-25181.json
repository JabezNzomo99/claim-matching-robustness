The video shows Kejriwal seated in a car and speaking to the camera. His speech appears to be slurred. The accompanying claim is that Kejriwal is drunk. The duration of the video is around one minute.\n\nThe above tweet posted by a user @Being_Humor on January 7 has been retweeted over 1100 times so far. The video has been posted with the hashtag #DarubaazKejri. The same video has also posted by another user @himmat0606 and by the handle @UnPaidTimes. The video is watermarked with the words \u2018Tik Tok\u2019 and \u2018@rkumarmadaan\u2019.\n\nThe video has also circulated widely on Facebook where Kejriwal has been pilloried. The above screenshot is of the group WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI where it was posted by a user. The video has also been posted on another group Arnab Goswamiwhere it has been shared over 200 times.\n\nAlt News found that the video was first posted by a user Rajan Madaan on Facebook. The video which has been shared subsequently has been watermarked with @rkumarmadaan. A look at both profiles suggests this is the same person. The earliest instance of the video that we could find on Twitter was of January 4.\n\nThe original video was posted by Arvind Kejriwal himself on his official Facebook page. Kejriwal had posted the live video on January 29, 2017 when he was campaigning for his party in Punjab ahead of the assembly election which took place that year. The video is posted below.\n\nAs can be seen, the original video sounds nothing like the viral video, which has been deliberately slowed down so as to give the impression that Kejriwal is in an inebriated condition. The original video is around 1 minute and 50 seconds long.\n\nSHARED BY SEVERAL USERS ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS\n\nSeveral individual users too have shared the video which has gone viral. Some users have posted it with the hashtag #Viral_SMS suggesting that the same is being shared on messaging platforms as well.\n\nApart from Facebook, Twitter and messaging apps, the video has also been posted on YouTube.\n\nKejriwal is routinely targeted via misinformation on social media. Earlier, a fake quote on Kashmir was attributed to him and circulated widely. In another instance, he was falsely targeted over celebration of his birthday on the day former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee passed away.", "lang": "en"}
