Make shabu legalize in PH.\"\n\nIn the article, Vice President Leni Robredo allegedly said she is \"ready to become president\" and demanded the \"legalization of shabu and marijuana\" to end the anti-drug campaign.\n\nThe facts: There is no such Rappler article, and also no such statement from Robredo.\n\nThe screenshot indicated that the \"Rappler article\" was \"published\" at 6:50 am on August 15 and \"updated\" nearly an hour after.\n\nHowever, in Ranada's Rappler profile page, the only articles published on August 15 under her byline are the following:\n\n\n\nThe \"screenshot\" of the supposed \"Rappler article\" was posted after President Rodrigo Duterte said in a speech last Tuesday, August 14, that he is ready \"to step down\" should the military and police \"find\" the right successor. He rejected, however, the idea of having Robredo as his successor.\n\nBack in April 2017, Robredo had floated the idea of \"decriminalizing\" drug use as an alternative method in the \"war on drugs.\" She cited Portugal's similar move enacted in 2001. \u2013 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
