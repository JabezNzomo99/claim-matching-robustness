The caption in the video claims that NASA has developed a machine that produces rain-generating clouds. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has not developed a machine that produces rain-generating clouds. The video has BBC logo on the top left corner and the video seems to be produced by the BBC.\n\nA video shared on Facebook shows a machine that produces white fumes. The video claims that the machine produces fumes and generates rain clouds. The video has been shared by the Facebook user Ankit Dwivedi. The video has a BBC logo on the top left corner.\n\nVishvas News started the investigation by putting the keywords \u201cNASA Rain-Cloud Machine\u201d on Google Search. We found an article titled \u2018There Is No NASA Cloud Machine \u2013 Here\u2019s The Real Explanation Of That Viral Video\u2019 on Forbes dated April 9, 2018.\n\nWe searched the profile of the author who is the contributor of the article. We found that the author had worked as the Research Meteorologist at NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nIn the article, it was explained how testing the rocket, R-25 in this case, produces water vapour.\n\nThe article reads: The exhaust from the RS-25 is primarily water vapor because the engine burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Oh\u2026..guess what happens when they combine: You get H2O (also known as water). Therefore, the \u201cclouds\u201d that you see in the pictures or videos are a by-product of a very simple scientific process (see below). If the water vapor condenses, it actually may form drops large enough to fall as liquid or what appears as \u201crain.\u201d\n\nWe could see the logo of the BBC in the video. We performed Google search using the keywords \u201cBBC video on R-25 rocket test.\u201d\n\nVishvas News found a 2.52-minute long video on Youtube\u2019s channel \u2018Top Gear\u2019. This version of the BBC video on R-25 rocket testing was uploaded on October 29, 2010.\n\nThe viral video shared on social media is the trimmed version of this video and is shared with a false claim.\n\nVishvas News contacted BBC and showed them the viral video. As per BBC, the viral video is the trimmed version of the original video and is shared with the false claim.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that the viral post claiming that NASA developed a machine to produce rain-generating clouds is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
