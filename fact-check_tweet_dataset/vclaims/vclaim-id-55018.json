It originated on a satirical website.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop people from sharing it in posts without any disclaimers to indicate it was fabricated.\n\nOne Twitter user posted the satire story\u2019s headline, \"Tom Brady: \u2018If Anyone on My Team Kneels, I Quit,\u2019\" and then wrote, \"Do you agree with him?\"\n\nThe phony quote originated on the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense website, which contains a disclaimer that says everything posted on it is fiction.\n\nThe site is run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has been publishing fabricated stories for years and says his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing false claims on social media.\n\nRELATED: If you're fooled by fake news, this man probably wrote it\n\nBrady, a six-time Super Bowl winner, typically refrains from making public comments on non-football topics, but he told Oprah Winfrey in a June 2018 interview that he respects players who choose to kneel in protest during the national anthem before football games.\n\n\"I think there were a lot of really good, healthy conversations coming out of it in our locker room,\" Brady said in the interview. \"I respect why people are doing what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re doing it for different reasons, and that\u2019s OK. You can do things for your reasons, they can do things for their reasons, and you have respect for that. But I thought it was great.\"\n\nPosts claim that Brady said he would quit football if his teammates kneeled during the national anthem.\n\nHe never said that. The quote came from a satirical website and was erroneously copied and shared in posts as if it were legitimate.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
