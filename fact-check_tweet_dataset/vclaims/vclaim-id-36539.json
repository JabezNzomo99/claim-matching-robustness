The man is being accused of donating 10% of his income to \u201cjihadists\u201d.\n\nThe tweet below by @REAL___HINDUVT garnered over 2,600 likes and close to 1,300 retweets.\n\nIt is also massively circulating on Facebook.\n\nTwitter user Bharat Sanghvi, who is followed by prime minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, had tweeted the photo with the accompanying claim in March 2020.\n\nA handle @Read_Bannaji wrote that Himalaya Drug Company should be avoided by all Hindus since its founder Mohammed Menal is a Muslim and Muslims donate 10% of their income to \u201cterrorists\u201d.\n\nA reverse-image search of the man\u2019s photograph reveals that he is not the founder of Himalaya Drug Company. A 2016 article in The Economic Times identified him as Philipe Haydon, the CEO of the company.\n\nThe founder of Himalaya Drug Company is not Mohammed Menal but Mohammad \u2018Manal\u2019. The company website states that \u2018M Manal\u2019 found the company in 1930 in Uttarakhand\u2019s Dehradun.\n\nManal passed away in 1986. Therefore, the claim that he has been giving away 10% of his income to \u201cjihadists\u201d does not hold water.\n\nMoreover, Himalaya Drug Company called out the misinformation on Twitter.\n\nA photograph of the CEO of Himalaya Drug Company has been used to falsely claim that he is the founder, Mohammed Manal, who donates a part of his income to fund terrorism.", "lang": "en"}
