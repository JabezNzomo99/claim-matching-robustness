I don't like the sound of this at all #Palmyra #Baal #Temple\n\nWhether the arch in London will be moved to New York after a period of initial display.\n\nReplicas of the arch from Syria's Temple of Baal were planned for London and New York City's World Heritage Week in April 2016; New York's project was shelved indefinitely as of early April 2016.\n\nOn 22 March 2016, an apocalypse-centric blog reported that the Temple of Baal, an ancient temple located in Palmyra, Syria, and consecrated to the Mesopotamian god, was being reconstructed in New York and London:\n\nI realize that the headline of this article sounds like it must be false, but it is actually completely true. The Temple of Baal (also known as the Temple of Bel) was a world famous landmark that was located in Palmyra, Syria. In August 2015, this temple was destroyed by ISIS, and most of the world recoiled in terror at the loss of a \u201ccultural heritage site\u201d. In an attempt to \u201cpreserve history\u201d, two exact replicas of the 50 foot arch that stood at the entrance to the temple will be erected in April 2016 in Times Square in New York City and in Trafalgar Square in London. Needless to say, a lot of people are quite disturbed by this. In ancient times, child sacrifice and bisexual orgies were common practices at the altars of Baal, and now we are putting up a monument of worship to this false god in the heart of our most important city \u2026 A lot of secret societies and occult groups have traditions that tell them that Nimrod/Marduk/Osiris/Apollo/Baal will someday be resurrected and will once again rule the world With all of the preceding in mind, could it be possible that we are actually erecting a temple for the Antichrist in New York City next month?\n\nOther blogs added to the cacophony of fear, suggesting that the structure was one of many planned for myriad sites, and that its construction could invoke the wrath of God:\n\nThe reproductions of the 50 foot arch that stood at the Temple of Baal in Palmyra, Syria that will be erected in New York City and London next month will only be the first of many. As you will see below, it turns out that there are plans to put arches in hundreds more cities all over the globe. The organization behind this is the Institute of Digital Archaeology, which is a joint venture between Harvard University, the University of Oxford and Dubai\u2019s Museum of the Future. The initial arches from the Temple of Baal that will be erected in New York and London as part of UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Week in April are intended \u201cas a gesture of defiance\u201d, but ultimately the plan is to share this \u201ccultural treasure\u201d with as many cities around the planet as possible.\n\nBringing the Temple of Baal to New York City is quite fitting. In 2016, we have become a nation that does not want God, does not want His Book, and most importantly has locked His Son Jesus Christ outside the doors of the professing Christian church. We have become greedy, selfie-centered, powerless wanderers, not realizing that the judgement of God has already fallen down upon us. Many are saying that recreating the Temple of Baal in New York and London will \u2018open a portal\u2019 to sinister forces, and that the planets will be aligned in such a way during that time as to portend dark things. Now I don\u2019t know about that, I guess we will just have to wait and see what happens but I do know this. For the last 8 years as a nation we have begged God to leave us alone and to remove Himself from our affairs.\n\nMost such items cited a 16 March 2016 New York Times opinion column that addressed the reconstructions from a culture-based (not news reporting) pespective:\n\nNEXT month, the Temple of Baal will come to Times Square. Reproductions of the 50-foot arch that formed the temple\u2019s entrance are to be installed in New York and in London, a tribute to the 2,000-year-old structure that the Islamic State destroyed last year in the Syrian town of Palmyra. The group\u2019s rampage through Palmyra, a city that reached its peak in the second and third century A.D., enraged the world, spurring scholars and conservationists into action. Numerous nongovernmental organizations are now cataloging and mapping damaged cultural heritage sites in the region. It will be uncanny and thrilling to see this arch from an ancient desert civilization set against the bright lights of New York. Unfortunately, facsimiles can achieve only so much. Denuded of people, stripped of the rich social contexts in which they were once embedded, antiquities appear just as evidence of the grandeur of the past, the accomplishments of another place in another time. But what did these assemblages of stone mean to the modern Iraqis and Syrians who lived with them?\n\nThe first-century relic\u2019s destruction at the hands of ISIS was confirmed on 31 August 2015:\n\nThe Times\u2018 editorial referenced the construction of a \u201cfacsimile,\u201d not an actual permanent house of worship, and cited a more straightforward item published on 28 December 2015 about the reproduced structures that were planned for New York City and London. Among the details in that earlier piece was contextual information about the purpose and duration of the Baal temples:\n\nReplicas of an arch in the 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel, among the last remaining parts of an ancient Palmyra, Syria, structure demolished by the Islamic State, will be erected in London and New York. The temple has been systematically razed, with the 50-foot-tall arch among the few remaining elements of the building still standing. The temple, dedicated in 32 A.D. to the Mesopotamian god Bel, attracted 150,000 tourists per year until 2011, when the civil war in Syria began. The full-scale replicas, now under construction in China, will stand in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square and New York\u2019s Times Square during World Heritage Week in April 2016.\n\nHistory reported that the projects encompasses full-scale replicas of the Temple\u2019s arch (not the entire structure):\n\nA representative from the Institute for Digital Archeology (IDA) described the replicas as \u201cart\u201d:\n\nRoger Michel, the IDA\u2019s executive director, told the Times: \u201cIt is really a political statement, a call to action, to draw attention to what is happening in Syria and Iraq and now Libya. We are saying to them \u2018if you destroy something we can rebuild it again\u2019. The symbolic value of these sites is enormous. We are restoring dignity to people.\u201d Given that the temple has already been targeted in Syria, Karenowska accepted that building the arches could pose a security risk, although she downplayed its impact. \u201cA building like the National Gallery or Trafalgar Square, these are major targets by virtue of what they are,\u201d she said. \u201cSimply by placing a thought-provoking piece of art in one of those spaces, the level of heightened risk is very limited. This is something we are thinking about very carefully and that people involved are thinking about on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nOn 8 April 2016, Britain\u2019s Telegraph reported that the New York Temple of Baal arch was indefinitely delayed; no specific reason was provided:\n\nWhen the IDA revealed last December that it was intending to use its data and expertise to build not one but two replica Palmyra arches \u2013 to be unveiled simultaneously in Trafalgar Square in London and Times Square in New York \u2013 it generated headlines across the world. Since then there has been some backtracking on the original idea. There will be no simultaneous unveiling in New York \u2013 they may transport the London arch there later, or build another one \u2013 and the Palmyra arch that is being reconstructed is no longer the entrance to the Temple of Bel (which survived an attempt to blow it up in August 2015) but the Arch of Triumph (partially destroyed in October) formerly located at one end of the Great Colonnade.\n\nWhile it is true replicas of Palmyra\u2019s Temple of Baal arch were planned for temporary display in New York and London, the project solely involves reproducing the structure\u2019s arch and not creating a functional building. The project was tweaked for its London incarnation, and put on hold indefinitely in New York. However, interest in reproducing the demolished antiquity remained archeological in nature, not religious.\n\nOn 19 September 2016, the Palmyra arch was unveiled in City Hall Park in Manhattan for a one-week long installation.", "lang": "en"}
