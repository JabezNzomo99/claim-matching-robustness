It also provides instructions, which takes users to the COVID-19 exposure notification service on their respective phones.\n\n\n\nHowever, this is neither a tracker nor a sensor, it is an application programming interface which provides support to contact tracing apps by public health authorities.\n\n\n\nIn order to put the fears to rest, we decided to explore some of the key questions people have regarding this new service that has appeared in our phones so suddenly.\n\n\n\nIn May 2020, Apple and Google announced their joint initiative in creating a new technology \"that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones\".\n\nThe service, which comes in the form of an API or application programming interface, allows other apps to collect random IDs of phones in the vicinity and detect the exposure to a positive COVID-19 case. Although this service is already available in the list of services on Google and Apple smartphones, its functionality needs to be activated by the user by downloading a compatible contact tracing app.\n\n\n\nHere is how this service works, according to Google:\n\u2022 Once you opt-in to the notification system, the Exposure Notifications System will generate a random ID for your device. To help ensure these random IDs can't be used to identify you or your location, they change every 10-20 minutes.\n\u2022 Your phone and the phones around you will work in the background to exchange these privacy-preserving random IDs via Bluetooth. You do not need to have the app open for this process to take place.\n\u2022 Your phone periodically checks all the random IDs associated with positive COVID-19 cases against its own list.\n\u2022 If there's a match, the app will notify you with further instructions from your public health authority on how to keep you and the people around you safe.\n\nHere is a visual representation of the entire process, provided by Google in a blogpost:\n\nFurthermore, this is a default service which was rolled out through an Operating System update, and cannot be deleted from the phone. However, users will have the option to turn off the service or deleted the randomly generated IDs by going to the COVID-19 notifications settings in their respective phones.\n\n\n\nGoogle and Apple have explicitly stated that this service does not collect location data from phones, and that it works solely by conveying randomly generated IDs through Bluetooth.\n\n\n\nGoogle also claims that the API will not make the user's identity to other users or to Google and Apple, even if that person is tested positive.\n\n\n\nDoes It Work With Aarogya Setu app?\n\nOver the past few months, contact tracing in India has become synonymous with Aarogya Setu, the Union Health ministry's flagship app to help trace COVID-19 cases through contact and notify others on their exposure to such cases as well.\n\nAlso Read: Aarogya Setu App Crosses 50 Mn Downloads: All You Need To Know\n\nWill Aarogya Setu be able to use the latest exposure notification API by Google and Apple for contact tracing? The answer is no.\n\n\n\nA Google spokesperson told BOOM that the Indian government uses its own API, and thus will not require this latest service by Google and Apple to run Aarogya Setu.\n\nFurthermore, Aarogya Setu works by collecting location data from users, which is not permitted by Google and Apple's API. Therefore, Indian users will not be able to use this service, even if it shows up in their phones' settings.", "lang": "en"}
