The Congress government of the time banned the song without taking any action. A salute to the man who dug out the song and uploaded it on WhatsApp.\u201d \u2013 read the message circulated along with a video of the song.\n\nThe video has been shared by multiple individual users and pages on Facebook.\n\nThe same Rafi song was also viral earlier in March this year in the backdrop of the Pulwama terror attack. It was, however, shared with a slightly different caption. It was claimed that the song, which was a part of a movie, was censored from the film fifty years ago. \u201c\u092a\u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u0907\u0938 \u0917\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0947\u0902\u0938\u0930 \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u091f\u0935\u093e \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902? \u0938\u0941\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0930\u092b\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u091c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092f\u0939 \u0917\u0940\u0924 \u091c\u094b \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u0932\u0940\u091c \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b \u092a\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0928 \u0915\u0930 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0907\u092f\u0947! \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947 (Fifty years ago, why was this song censored and cut?

Our Congress govt. also quietly banned this song.Hats off to the person who now brought this song out pic.twitter.com/zmvQpRL0YN The song viral on social media is \u2018Jannat ki hai Tasveer\u2019 and was part of the movie \u2018Johar in Kashmir\u2019 released in 1966. The film was set in Kashmir, circa late 1940s, after India was partitioned. Alt News found a Gazette of India document from 1966, which included official orders by the Central Board of Film Censor, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. As seen in the screenshot below, only the underlined words \u2018Haji Pir\u2019 were asked to be deleted from the song. Some of the lines mentioned in the official document cannot be found in the lyrics of the song available online, hinting that the lyrics were modified after the censor board order. Alt News contacted Mohammed Rafi\u2019 son, Shahid Rafi, for further insights. \u201cThat the song was censored is completely false. It was neither banned nor censored.\u201d Shahid Rafi informed Alt News. \u201cHow could the song be a part of \u2018Johar in Kashmir\u2019 if it was banned?\u201d he added.", "lang": "en"}
