The claim may have stemmed from a remark he made at an April 13 press briefing.\n\nThe viral post alleges Trump said that he was \u201cgetting calls from hundreds of governors,\u201d despite there being only 50 U.S. governors.\n\nSearching his Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any record of the president making the remark. The statement also appears nowhere in Factbase, an online database that collects Trump\u2019s interviews, speeches and tweets.\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from Trump\u2019s remarks at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on April 13, after he showed a video that included clips of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, among others, praising his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump then said at the briefing that he could \u201cgive you hundreds of clips like that from governors,\u201d according to the transcript. (Did The NBA Tell Trump To \u2018Resign Or We\u2019ll Never Play Again\u2019?)\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of statements,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cHundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors.\u201d\n\nDuring a phone interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d several weeks earlier, Trump said, \u201cI get on calls, and I get on a lot of the governor calls where we\u2019ll have all 50 governors plus where we have some territories also, but we have 50 governors, and I\u2019ll tell you what if you could listen to those calls, you\u2019d never hear a complaint.\u201d\n\nOther fact-checkers have also looked into the claim and found no evidence that Trump ever said he was \u201cgetting calls from hundreds of governors.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
