Over the past few days, Indian and Chinese troops appear to be heading towards a face-off in several disputed areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh. However, FACTLY has found the image going viral on social media to be of 2019 and not related to any recent incident. As per PTI, the image is of a wreath-laying ceremony at CRPF camp in Budgam and it shows Tricolor draped coffins of the CRPF personnel who had lost their lives in Pulwama terror attack in February 2019. Also, there is no news of Indian soldiers being killed by China at Ladakh recently.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
