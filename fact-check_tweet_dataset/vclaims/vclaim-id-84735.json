Seven people have been arrested in the matter,\" added Singh.\n\nBOOM also reached out to Rishi Kumar, Station House Officer, (SHO) Kurra and asked him about the SC/ST case reported by Hindi news outlets.\n\n\"I do not know which case is under trial, but even if there is any case under SC/ST Atrocities Act, why would fight among Thakurs would ever be considered under that Act?,\" he said. \"This incident has been made political without any reason.\"\n\nThe SHO also denied that the second man beaten - Naresh, who the FIR names as Naresh Tomar is a Dalit\n\nThe two groups have filed cross FIRs and the police have arrested seven so far - Roop Singh, Satendar Singh, Rinku Singh, Mangal Singh, Arjun Singh, Karanpal Singh, and Sunil Singh.\n\nThey were arrested under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 308, 307, 452, 504 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nThe two people who were injured, Dal Singh and Naresh, during the clash and were admitted to Saifai Hospital.", "lang": "en"}
