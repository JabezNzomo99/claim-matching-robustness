Their aim is to encourage more individuals to come forward and report domestic abuse.\n\nWhat do the statistics tell us?\n\nWhile the term \u2018domestic violence\u2019 is used familiarly, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) use the term \u2018domestic abuse incidents and crimes\u2019, to distinguish from those domestic abuse incidents that include a chargeable offence.\n\nThe PSNI\u2019s statistics on domestic abuse report that in the twelve months from October 2016 to September 2017, there were 29,404 incidents recorded with a domestic abuse motivation. Of these, 16,810 did not contain a crime (meaning no \u2018notifiable offence\u2019 occurred); the remaining 12,594 incidents contained one or more crimes.\n\nHow does this compare to the rest of the UK and Ireland?\n\nThere were a total of 1,068,020 domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2017, with 46% recorded as domestic abuse-related crimes.\n\nIn Scotland, from 2016-17 there were 58,810 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police and 47% of these incidents included the recording of at least one crime or offence.\n\nIn Ireland, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na record domestic abuse incidents without a chargeable crime as \u2018domestic abuse \u2013 no offence caused\u2019. For domestic abuse incidents that do contain a criminal offence, the Garda Inspectorate noted in a 2014 report that these are not being recorded as a \u2018domestic crime\u2019 (and the Inspectorate recommended that they should be). Likewise, the Inspectorate reported that 45% of domestic violence calls to Garda\u00ed were not recorded in the organisation\u2019s Pulse computer system.\n\nThis situation has been reported by The Irish Examiner, in an article published on 13 May 2017 (\u201cGardai\u2019s domestic violence stats \u2018not robust\u2019\u201d). Since then, the Central Statistics Office has published some data \u201cunder reservation\u201d. We deem the data for domestic violence and abuse in Ireland as unreliable, and we do not include it here.\n\nDo the statistics tell us everything?\n\nWomen\u2019s Aid points out that \u201cwomen often don\u2019t report or disclose domestic abuse to the police and may under-report domestic abuse in surveys, particularly during face-to-face interviews. In addition, prevalence estimates do not take into account important context and impact information, for example whether the violence caused fear, who experienced multiple incidents and who experienced coercive controlling behaviour.\u201d\n\nWe found that the PSNI statistics confirm Anthony Harbinson\u2019s claim that \u201cover 29,000 incidents of violence and abuse took place in our cities, towns and rural areas last year\u201d. When we compared these statistics to the rest of the UK and Ireland, we discovered that England and Wales had the highest level of reported instances of domestic violence and abuse per capita, Scotland had the lowest, and no comparison with Ireland could be made due to unreliable data. It is also worth considering the level of underreporting of domestic abuse as well as its circumstances.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
