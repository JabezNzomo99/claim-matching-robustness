For the poor, it (the government) did a lot of things. It gave them a house, electricity, toilets, gas connection, pure drinking water. Even for Delhi a lot of things. But our two parliamentary candidates, sister Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri, for this one thing don't give these two votes. I'm saying this now.

But definitely vote for them (because) Modi ji has made the country secure. That's why vote for them.\"\n\nWatch the You Tube video below from 1:20:04", "lang": "en"}
