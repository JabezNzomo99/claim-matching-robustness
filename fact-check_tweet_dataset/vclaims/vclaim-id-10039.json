Polygraph.info translated the quote back into English from the Russian interpretation of Assange\u2019s words for the state TV audience.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Pozner did not specify when the interview took place, only where \u2013 inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, UK.\n\nThe interview aired the same day U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller announced the first indictments in the U.S. investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nResponding to Pozner\u2019s question about the alleged ties between WikiLeaks and the Russian government, Assange said:\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Barack Obama, the head of the U.S. intelligence agency and James Comey, the FBI director, they say quite the opposite: they say that there is no trace of a conspiracy between WikiLeaks and Russia. The same is said by the most hawkish people in the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d (timecode 3:28\u2019\u20143:52\u2019)\n\nIn his final White House press conference on January 18, 2017, then President Obama was asked: \u201cHow do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks\u2019 connection to Russia\u2019s hacking in last year\u2019s election?\u201d \n\n \n\n He responded: \u201cFirst of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC emails that were leaked,\u201d the outgoing president told reporters. He added that the U.S. will have to \u201crecognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us -- whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes, or trying to commit acts of terrorism, or folks who want to interfere with our elections.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026the head of the U.S. intelligence agency\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Posner, Assange did not name the \u201chead of the U.S. intelligence agency\u201d he was referring to.\n\nDan Coats, the current Director of National Intelligence, was sworn into office on March 16, 2017 and has not been quoted commenting on WikiLeaks, either in official statements or by the media.\n\nCoats\u2019 predecessor, James Clapper, who served as DNI from August 2010 to January 2017, said \u201cabsolutely\u201d WikiLeaks serves as a \u201cknown propaganda platform\u201d and acts as a \u201cnon-nation state intelligence service\u201d for Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,\u201d Clapper said in testimony before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and Terrorism on May 8, 2017, after he left office.\n\nJames Comey, who served as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from September 2013 to May 2017, called WikiLeaks \u201cintelligence porn\u201d shortly before he was fired by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn his testimony before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and Terrorism on May 3, 2017, Comey said he stands by the U.S. intelligence community assessment that that WikiLeaks was a known outlet for foreign propaganda, accusing Assange\u2019s group of \u201c\u2026just pushing out information about sources and methods without regard to interest, without regard to the First Amendment values that normally underlie press reporting and simply becomes a conduit for the Russian intelligence services\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026the most hawkish people in the U.S. intelligence community\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info cannot assess Assange\u2019s claim about \u201cthe most hawkish people in the U.S. intelligence community\u201d allegedly believing there is no \u201cconspiracy\u201d between WikiLeaks and Russia, since it is not clear who he was referring to. Instead, we chose to quote for this fact-check only the statements made by these in the office in their official capacity.\n\nSpeaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC on April 13, 2017, Mike Pompeo, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, also called WikiLeaks \u201ca non-state hostile intelligence service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence\u2014the GRU\u2014had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia\u2019s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nPompeo was referring to \u201cBackground to \u2018Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\u2019: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution,\u201d a report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on January 6, 2017.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in March that \u201cthe Russians \u2018weaponized\u2019 the stolen data and used platforms established by their intel services, such as DC Leaks and existing third party channels like WikiLeaks, to dump the documents.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign for U.S. president, officials from the Obama intelligence community put out a statement saying they were \u201cconfident the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails\u201d of campaign leaders for the Democratic Party and its nominee.", "lang": "en"}
