In the image, the BJP President can be seen addressing a crowd while standing on a chowki (stool) imprinted with the Swastika sign.\n\nAs religion remains a major political tool for the BJP, several Twitter users questioned Shah on the apparent hypocrisy of standing on the Hindu symbol. But there were also many others who came to the BJP leader\u2019s defence.\n\nHowever, several social media users remained unclear on whether the photograph was real or morphed.\n\nAlt News found that the photo was present on Amit shah\u2019s official Facebook page. It was taken on December 1 when he was addressing a crowd in poll-bound Balotra, Rajasthan.\n\nThe post was captioned \u2013 \u201c\u092c\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0924\u0930\u093e (\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928): \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940 \u0936\u093e\u092f\u0926 \u092d\u0942\u0932 \u0917\u090f \u0939\u094b \u092a\u0930 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0902 \u0915\u093f \u0935\u0940\u0930\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u0935\u0940\u0930 \u0938\u0948\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0936\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e \u0915\u093e \u0905\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0926\u0947 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0940\u0964 (Balotra (Rajasthan): Rahul Gandhi might have forgotten but I want to remind him that the citizens of the land of braves, Rajasthan, can support Congress party which disrespects the gallantry and courage of brave soldiers.)\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the post with the image was deleted after the photograph went viral. Its archived link can be accessed here.\n\nWhile Amit Shah\u2019s reason for taking down the post is ambiguous, it remains clear that the image of the BJP chief standing on the Swastika sign is not photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
