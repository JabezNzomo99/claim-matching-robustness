While some have posted that the facility was built by Indo-Tibetan Border Police (under the Central Government), the others have posted giving the credit solely to Aam Aadmi Party (the State Government). Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: 10,000-bed Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre in Delhi is built by ITBP (Central Government) Claim 2: 10,000-bed Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre in Delhi is built by Kejriwal (State Government) Fact: The facility is a joint effort by the State Government (all administrative support and facilities like water and sanitation), Central Government (ITBP \u2013 nodal Agency to operate the Centre. More than 1000 Doctors, Nurses and Paramedic Staff of ITBP and other CAPFs to be deployed), Radha Soami Satsang Beas (provided the campus, other infrastructure and assistance including food) and many other agencies like Indian Railways (provided bedsheets and pillow covers), Sleepwell mattress company (provided mattresses), etc. So, the credit needs to be given to all the participating agencies. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched for the information on the Centre, a tweet by \u2018District Magistrate South Delhi\u2019 regarding the 10,000-bed Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre was found. In the tweet, it can be read that around 2000 beds are ready in the facility and the District administration had thanked ITBP, Radha Soami Satsang Beas and other sponsors & donors for their generous support. Talking to ANI, South Delhi District Magistrate BM Mishra said, \u2018Radha Soami Satsang Beas centre will be a #COVID care centre with 10,000 beds out of which 10% will be oxygenated beds. We are working on its air conditioning. The cardboard beds are lightweight, reusable and have 2 years of warranty\u2019\n\nRaghav Chadha (AAP MLA and Vice-Chairman -Delhi Jal Board) has tweeted that this COVID Centre is a perfect example of partnership between Kejriwal Government, Central Government and Radha Soami Satsang Beas. Also, in an interview to \u2018ABP News\u2019, he said, \u2018This is the biggest Joint Venture Of Delhi And Central Govt\u2019 and also, talked about providing clean water to the facility by the Delhi Jal Board.\n\nIn one of his tweets, Delhi CM Kejriwal has also acknowledged the contribution of multiple partners.\n\nIn an article published by DD News on its website, it is mentioned that \u2018ITBP was tasked by the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide medical staff and support to the Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas Chattarpur, New Delhi as a Nodal Agency to operate it. The Delhi Government has been providing all administrative support while the Radha Soami Satsang Beas Chattarpur has been providing the campus, other infrastructure and assistance including food.\u2019 Talking to media, Kishan Reddy (BJP MP and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs) said that Indian Railways has provided 30,000 bed-sheets and pillow covers and Sleepwell mattress company has provided mattresses to the COVID Care Centre. So, there is a contribution from multiple agencies. No single agency or government can take the sole credit for the establishment of the COVID Care Centre.\n\nTo sum it up, 10,000-bed Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre in Delhi is a joint effort by multiple agencies including Central and State govt.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
