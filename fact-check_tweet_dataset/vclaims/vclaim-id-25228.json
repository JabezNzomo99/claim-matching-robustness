That\u2019s equal to 21 9/11 attacks.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

According to the fiscal year 2018 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations report, the criminal records of people arrested by ICE for being illegally in the country included 2,028 homicide offenses (387 charges and 1,641 convictions). According to the fiscal year 2017 report, the criminal record of people arrested included 1,886 homicide offenses.\n\nThose offenses didn\u2019t necessarily happen during that fiscal year\u2014it just means they were on someone\u2019s arrest record when they were picked up that year. Still, what about the years prior?\n\nPicard said he didn\u2019t have anything going back to 2001, but he said there might be more information on a Department of Homeland Security web page about immigration data and statistics. The website has immigration enforcement actions reports going back to 2004, but they don\u2019t mention murder or homicide.\n\nAlex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think-tank, called the number nonsense, and pointed to a June 22 Washington Post article about the claim.\n\nBack in June, President Donald Trump said that at least 63,000 Americans had been killed since 9/11. But, the Post reports, the stat dates back to a 2005 blog post written by Rep. Steve King, who \"seems to have basically made the number up \u2026 and, since there isn\u2019t good data on the number of crimes committed by people who immigrated illegally, it was embraced by those looking to put a number to it.\"\n\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said no one keeps track of murders committed by undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"I believe the 63,000 figure is meant to include deaths, not just homicides,\" she said in an email, \"but I don\u2019t know where you are getting these figures.\"\n\nNeither did we, so we asked others who study immigration to weigh in.\n\n\"I can\u2019t think of any evidence that could support a number like 63,000,\" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nElizabeth Cohen, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said the statement \"has repeatedly been shown not just to be baseless, but to be impossible to the point of being absurd.\"\n\n\"It has no relation to any actual crime data,\" she said.", "lang": "en"}
