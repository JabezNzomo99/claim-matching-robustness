One Facebook post claimed that after the news that the Army was given a free hand to retaliate for the Pulwama attack, this soldier left his treatment halfway through and bounced back to teach the terrorists a lesson.\n\nAfter the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces were given complete freedom to act.\n\nThe Archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the soldier in the viral photo is not from the Indian Army but is actually a Russian soldier.\n\nThe image which has gone viral was posted on the Facebook page 'Mission 400+ saath hai to abhi jude' with the caption: \"When this injured soldier got news of the Army getting a free hand, he left his treatment half way and returned to take revenge against the enemy. (sena ke ghayal jawan ko pata chalte hi ki sena ko khuli chhoot milgai, ilaaj ke beech se uthkar dushman se badla lene hospital se bahar nikal aaya, ye hai hamari sena jazba, Jai Hind, Vande Mataram).\"\n\nAt the time this story was filed, the post was already shared by more than 12,000 people in two days.\n\nFacebook pages 'Political Tamasha', 'Kattar Modi samarthak group se jude aur apne 51 sathiyo ko jode' and 'Mera Bharat Mahan' have also shared the photo with the same claim.\n\nUsing reverse search, we found that the soldier in the viral image is a Russian army man. The image was taken back in 2004 in Russia when a few terrorists took around 1,100 people, mostly children hostage in the Beslan school siege on September 1. The seige continued for three days. The Russian military launched a counter-terrorist operation to rescue the hostages.\n\nThe Russian army man in the viral photo is Maxim Alexandrovich Razumovsky. During the rescue operation, he got injured thrice. Whenever he got injured he ran for medical treatment and then returned to the school to save people.\n\nWestern journalists later called him \"Russian Tank\". We found many news articles covered by local media lauding his bravery.", "lang": "en"}
