Russian politicians and state-owned media effectively debunk his claims.\n\u2022 \u201c[M]aintenance of sustainable cultural and humanitarian ties with the Balkan peoples. All this certainly applies to Albania.\"\n\nAnalyses of official rhetoric and the Russian media\u2019s narrative reveal there have been no notable signs that Russia has tried to improve relations with Albania.\n\nBy way of example, Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti state news agency reported in January 2017 that the first train to travel from Serbia to Kosovo in 17 years was made in Russia and had \u201cKosovo is Serbia\u201d written on it in 21 languages, including Albanian.\n\nRussia owns segments of Albania\u2019s online information space, and a dozen multilingual websites, including Albania-news.ru, promote the Russian political and cultural agenda. Some of these identify themselves as local sources, hiding any connection with Russia.\n\nOne such website, Senica.ru portrays itself as the \u201cinformation portal of the Russian diaspora in Serbia.\u201d It reported on January 15, 2017, that Albania had not allowed the passage of the above-mentioned train, because the \u201cAlbanian special services under orders from Pristina attempted to lay a bomb under the railway.\u201d The report was fake, but the language was not atypical.\n\nRussian media and political figures' portrayal of Albania and Albanians as \u201cradicals,\u201d and the term \u201cIslamist militants\u201d features frequently in the Kremlin\u2019s narrative.\n\n\u201cDirect military support and encouragement from the United States, NATO and European Union for the extremely aggressive plans of the Albanians only increases tensions in the Balkans and is fraught with unleashing a new conflict,\u201d Sergey Zheleznyak, a member of the foreign relations committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, was quoted as saying last month.\n\nZheleznyak\u2019s comments were published in a diatribe posted on the website of United Russia, the country\u2019s ruling party, under the headline: \u201cZheleznyak: Indulging the plans of \u2018Greater Albania\u2019, the United States is kindling a new conflict in the Balkans.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGreater Albania\u201d narrative is also a key part of the Russian news cycle and political rhetoric.\n\nRussia is revisiting its history of involvement in the Balkan conflicts with distinct pride.\n\nOn June 26, Russia\u2019s leading movie production company announced a new film telling the story of how Russian special forces seized Slatina airport in Kosovo in 1999.\n\nOne of Russia\u2019s top movie stars will play General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, now the governor of the Republic of Ingushetia, who led the 200 Russian troops sent to seize the airport in Pristina and thereby help the Kremlin ensure that Russia had a role in the peace-keeping process.\n\nThe Russian move was condemned internationally but is seen in Russia as a triumph in a power play with the West.\n\nAmbassador Karpushin\u2019s claim that Russia has no aggressive plans towards other sovereign nations, including Balkan states, is belied by Russian actions.\n\nRussia has annexed Crimea in 2014 and created an armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cUkraine is the largest displacement crisis in Europe since the Balkan wars. Now in its fifth year, with thousands dead and 1.5 million displaced, it is scandalous that this conflict remains largely forgotten,\u201d said Argentina Szabados, regional director of the International Organization for Migration, on June 11.\n\nRussia reportedly was behind a failed coup attempt in Montenegro in late in 2016. Montenegro's special prosecutor said Russian secret service operatives were behind an attempted Election Day coup in the Balkan nation in October 2016 that targeted the former prime minister.\n\nA team of Russian operatives, including ideologists, financial sponsors, policy and lawmakers, trainers, who were involved in the annexation of Crimea and destabilization of Ukraine, have been actively present in Macedonia, igniting social and political divisions and propagating anti-EU, anti-NATO sentiment.\n\u2022 \u201c\u2026nothing more than part of a major Western strategy to portray Russia as an imaginary enemy of NATO\u201d\n\nThe claim that Russia does not see the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an enemy, and that this is nothing more than a Western anti-Russian propaganda, is false.\n\nThe Russian media regularly portray NATO as evil, and frequently present NATO troops as the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to NATO, the Russian media and the nation\u2019s leader have no disagreement.\n\n\u201cI will literally create the image with my fingers: here is a ring, and our country is inside that ring. I personally feel suffocated by somebody. I feel like that somebody is NATO, because the NATO bloc is growing like a cancerous tumor.\u201d That comment was addressed to President Vladimir Putin by Dmitry Kiselev, director of the state-owned media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya, during a 2014 press conference.\n\nPutin responded: \u201cWe are not afraid of NATO, but what you have so colorfully described \u2013 is the reality.\u201d He then added: \u201cOur decision on Crimea [its annexation from Ukraine] was also motivated by the thought that if we don\u2019t do something\u2026 they will drag Ukraine into NATO.\u201d\n\nPutin reaffirmed his perception that NATO is a threat to Russia\u2019s national interests in his speech at the St. Petersburg Economic Summit last month.\n\nLast week, internationally-renowned Russian filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov drew a parallel between NATO and Nazi Germany on his TV talk show.", "lang": "en"}
