This record warmth is tied to more extreme weather events, sea level rise and other negative impacts.\n\nPruitt made his claim on Feb. 6 while speaking with Gerard Ramalho of NBC News 3 in Las Vegas (starting at 4:08).\n\nRamalho, Feb. 6: People don\u2019t seem to dispute the fact that the climate is changing, but there are two areas that are disputed and I\u2019d love to get your thoughts. One is, is man causing the climate to change? And the other area is should we be alarmed because we hear about things like the polar caps melting and oceans rising and hurricanes and tornadoes that are more intense. What are your thoughts on this? Pruitt: I think that\u2019s well said. I think that you\u2019re right that no one disputes the climate changes, is changing. We see that that\u2019s constant. We obviously contribute to it. We live in the climate, right? So our activity contributes to the climate changing to a certain degree. Now measuring that with precision is, Gerard, I think is more challenging than is let on at times. But I think the bigger question is what you asked at the very end \u2014 is it an existential threat? Is it something that is unsustainable? Or what kind of effect or harm is this going to have? We know that humans have most flourished during times of, what? Warming trends. And so, I think there\u2019s assumptions made that because the climate is warming that that necessarily is a bad thing.\n\nWe reached out to Pruitt\u2019s office for support for his claims, but spokeswoman Liz Bowman didn\u2019t provide us with any.\n\nPruitt is right that human civilization began flourishing during a warm period after the last major ice age, which ended about 12,000 years ago. This period \u2014 the Holocene Epoch \u2014 averaged about 4 to 5 degrees Celsius above the temperatures during the ice age that came before it, Andrew Glikson, an earth and paleo-climate scientist at Australian National University, told us via email.\n\nBut the burning of fossil fuels has pushed this global average even higher. Some scientists, including Glikson, even say this new warming trend deserves to be designated as an entirely new epoch \u2014 the Anthropocene.\n\nThe planet has warmed nearly 1 degree Celsius already since 1880, according to NASA. \u201cMultiple paleoclimatic studies indicate that recent years are all the warmest, on a global basis, of at least the last 1,000 years,\u201d says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nHow much warming we see in the future depends on how much action we take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFor example, if countries fulfill their pledges under the Paris Agreement, but make no further commitments to reducing emissions, the climate modeling nonprofit Climate Interactive found that the planet would see roughly 3.3 C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, though that number could be as high as 4.4 C or as low as 1.9 C.\n\nWe\u2019ve outlined some of the impacts of recent warming in previous articles.\n\nIn an article we published after Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. with record amounts of rain last August, we explained that human activities have contributed to the increase in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean since the 1970s. We also pointed out that the Atlantic Ocean is projected to see increases in hurricane precipitation in the future.\n\nIn October, we explained that global warming can bring about conditions, such as heat and drought, that make wildfires more likely to occur and spread. \u201cClimate change plays a role in increasing the rate at which vegetation dries out and becomes receptive to igniting and carrying fire,\u201d one expert told us.\n\nScientists also have high confidence global warming will lead to more heat waves, we pointed out last March. For example, Washington, D.C., is expected to see 60 to 70 days a year on average reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit between 2041 and 2070, compared with 20 to 30 days above 90 F between 1971 and 2000 \u2014 and that\u2019s for the lower emissions scenario.\n\nIn that same article, we explained that sea level already has risen about 8 inches since 1880. By 2100, scientists expect it to rise 1 foot to 4 feet. Coastal communities are particularly threatened by sea level rise. For example, New Orleans, Miami, Tampa, Charleston and Virginia Beach are among those most at risk, according to scientists.\n\nLast August, we explained that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which drives global warming, likely will have a net negative impact on agriculture. An atmosphere with more CO2 does boost crop yield in the short term via increased rates of photosynthesis. But in the long term, multiple experts told us the positive effect of increased CO2 on crops will diminish, and the negative impacts of climate change, such as higher temperatures and extreme rainfall, will grow.\n\nThe warming the planet has seen over the past decades also has \u201csignificant potential\u201d to lead to \u201cunanticipated changes\u201d in the Earth\u2019s climate, says the 2017 report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a collaboration of 13 government agencies. These \u201csurprises\u201d can come about when multiple extreme events co-occur, such as heat and drought, the report explains. The more we warm the planet the higher likelihood these unpredictable events will take place, the report adds.\n\nThis is important, given the fact that human civilization progressed into what it is today, in large part, because the Earth\u2019s climate remained relatively stable during the Holocene.\n\nIn fact, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that \u201cthe Holocene appears by far the longest warm stable period \u2026 over the last [400,000 years], with profound implications for the development of civilisation.\u201d\n\nA stable climate allowed for the development of agriculture, which ensured a reliable food source, explains NASA. It also allowed humans to \u201cdomesticate animals, settle down and develop culture,\u201d NASA adds.\n\nBut there were some changes in climate during the Holocene, some of which played a role in the collapse of civilizations. Scientists have linked drought, for example, to the demise of ancient Egyptian, Mayan and Cambodian civilizations, says NASA.\n\n\u201cWhen we excavate the remains of past civilizations, we rarely find any evidence that they made any attempts to adapt in the face of a changing climate,\u201d Jason Ur, a professor of anthropology at Harvard University, told NASA. \u201cI view this inflexibility as the real reason for collapse.\u201d\n\nIn an email to us, Ur put it this way: \u201cHuman societies have sometimes survived warming trends, but rarely unscathed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
