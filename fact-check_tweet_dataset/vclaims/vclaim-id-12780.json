No, that's not true: the story was created by a French website with a well hidden satire disclaimer, using an old unrelated photo. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Journal des Insolites on November 16, 2018 titled \"France: Un migrant africain enceinte une m\u00e8re, ses trois filles et prend la fuite\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 23-year-old African migrant fled after having pregnant a mother and her three daughters in the city of Paris. The 23-year-old migrant from Senegal said he wanted revenge on his boss for the poor working conditions he was subjected to. The mother and her three daughters discovered that they were all pregnant when they presented for their regular checkup. the family doctor was shocked to find that even the last girl in the house, aged 15, was also pregnant.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, not making it clear it was a fictional story:\n\nAccording to image search website Tineye the photo used to illustrate the story has been going around the internet since 2008, often used as an example of bad parenting (although we were unable to find out who the people in the picture are or what their relationship is):\n\nThe site that posted the migrant story features a disclaimer that reads:\n\n24Jours.com assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of some of its articles and the fictional nature of certain content. All the characters appearing in certain articles on this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle. If you want verified info, please watch France24, CNN, BBC, RT, Euronews ETC. We hope you enjoy the site.\n\nThe news was already copied by at least one site that didn't indicate the story was not true:\n\nWe wrote about 24jours.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Young French Woman Did NOT Infect 630 African Migrants With AIDS As Vengeance For Illegal Immigration\n\u2022 Fake News: FIFA NOT To Cancel French Victory Over Belgium After Arbitration Fault", "lang": "en"}
