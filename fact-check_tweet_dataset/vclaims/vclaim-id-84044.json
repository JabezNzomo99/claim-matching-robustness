One of the reasons that Parrikar and BJP are in a position to form the Govt is because of the 3 Goa Forward Party (GFP) MLAs that have extended support to BJP. However, GFP under the mentorship of Vijai Sardesai won their seats on a completely anti-BJP plank. In fact, Prabhakar Timble, the President of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), resigned from his post on 12th March 2017 after the party\u2019s three elected MLAs, led by Vijai Sardesai, extended direct support to the BJP to form the next government in Goa.\n\nSince the GFP party won on an anti-BJP plank, the tweets from various social media accounts representing the party including Goa Forward Party\u2019s own Twitter account and Vijai Sardesai\u2019s account are patently anti-BJP and have become an embarrassment for them. We have recorded some of the tweets here where in Vijai Sardesai not only pledged not to join BJP ever but also calls Manohar Parrikar a \u2018Dalal\u2019 and a \u2018Dictator\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
