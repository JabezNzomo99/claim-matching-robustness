I'm nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth,\" Judd said. \"Tell me, why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not?\"\n\nWe\u2019re happy to oblige, because Judd\u2019s claim isn\u2019t fully accurate. (We tried to reach Judd the day after the march but didn't hear back; we'll update this item if we do.)\n\nWhen it comes to sales taxes on purchases, states typically set the rules.\n\nSeven states currently exempt tampons, menstrual cups and pads from taxation, the latest of which came into effect Jan. 1, 2017 (Illinois), said sales tax consultant Diane Yetter. Washington D.C.\u2019s exemption, passed in December 2016, is pending congressional approval, and Connecticut's will kick in July 1, 2018.\n\nFive states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon) have no sales tax at all. So, as of Jan. 22, 2017, 38 states and D.C. tax feminine hygiene products.\n\nBecause it is a prescription drug, Viagra, an erectile dysfunction medicine, isn\u2019t taxed in any state except Illinois.\n\nRogaine, a product for hair loss, is exempt from taxes in eight states because it is an over-the-counter treatment and doesn\u2019t require a prescription. (Four states have qualified exemptions for nonprescription that Rogaine does not appear to qualify for.)\n\nWe won\u2019t weigh in on whether the disparity between taxation of feminine hygiene and erectile dysfunction drugs is ethical or sexist. But there is context for how that disparity came to exist.\n\nNicole Kaeding, a state tax policy analyst at the free-market oriented Tax Foundation, stressed that the term \"tampon tax\" is a misnomer because feminine hygiene products are not subject to a specific tax in any state.\n\n\"There is no more a tampon tax than there is a soap tax, shampoo tax, or toilet paper tax,\" Kaeding said.\n\nAs we mentioned, many states do provide exemptions for necessities like food and medicine. (Kaeding and the Tax Analysts\u2019 David Brunori believe these items should be taxed as well.)\n\nBut \"menstruation isn\u2019t considered a disease or illness,\" said Yetter. \"Tampons and pads are often included in the category of grooming and hygiene products.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that tax exemptions apply to broad categories and not any male product explicitly.\n\n\"You could easily pick a drug that only applies to females, say birth control pills, and those would fall under the same sales tax exemptions as Viagra or Rogaine,\" said Kaeding.\n\nJudd said, \"Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not.\"\n\nMost states do tax tampons and pads, but not Viagra. Judd is off the mark for Rogaine, which is taxed in most states.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that these taxes apply to broad categories and are not specific to tampons or Viagra. Birth control, for example, would also be exempt from taxation in most states because it, like Viagra, is a prescription drug.", "lang": "en"}
