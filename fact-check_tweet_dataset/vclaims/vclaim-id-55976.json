(RELATED: Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Making A Racist Remark)\n\n\u201cAnd for the international order that we have worked for generations to build,\u201d the clip shows Obama saying. \u201cOrdinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed both the video and transcript of Obama\u2019s roughly 36-minute speech and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited. It appears to have spliced together comments from two different parts of the speech to make it seem like Obama supports people surrendering their rights to an \u201call-powerful sovereign.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Obama actually ascribes that principle to an \u201colder, more traditional view of power\u201d that he rejects, the transcript shows. He talks about how, in his view, that \u201calternative vision\u201d is testing modern principles of government such as \u201cpower is derived from the consent of the governed\u201d and \u201claws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding,\u201d according to video of the speech.\n\nObama goes on to urge that \u201cwe must never take for granted the progress that has been won here in Europe and advanced around the world, because the contest of ideas continues for your generation,\u201d per the transcript.\n\nThe claim, previously debunked by FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and The Associated Press, has been circulating online since at least June 2014.", "lang": "en"}
