As we\u2019ve seen before, the UK met its interim target for 2013 and 2014\u2014it took 6.3% of its energy from renewable sources against a target of 5.4%.\n\nSo far the bulk of the progress has been made in electricity, with 17.8% of it coming from renewable sources in 2014, up from 7.4% in 2010.\n\nProgress towards renewable energy in transport and heating has been slower, with only 4.8% of energy in both heat and transport coming from renewable sources in 2014, up from about 3% in 2010.\n\nFurther action needs to be taken to meet the 2020 target\n\nLast autumn a leaked letter from Energy Secretary Amber Rudd to other government ministers said that her department had forecast that the 2020 target would be missed, because from 2017/18 onwards it will become more demanding. It mentions:\n\nAsked about this by Parliament\u2019s Energy and Climate Change Committee, Ms Rudd confirmed the government was set to get 11.5% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 unless action was taken:\n\nThe action to be taken wasn\u2019t specified.\n\nThe letter said that the strategy preferred by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) involved maintaining the existing support for renewable electricity projects, and increasing the use of renewables in transport and heat.\n\nIt expected this would leave the share of renewables at about 13%.\n\nIt also discussed a range of other options it thought might get it closer to the target.\n\nDECC has since published a plan setting out its objectives between 2015 and 2020. It says it\u2019s planning to take action towards \u2018decarbonisation\u2019 in a number of areas, including heat and transport.\n\nHow these relate to the renewables targets isn\u2019t clear\u2014the plan doesn\u2019t mention the 15% EU target.\n\nThe department told us it doesn\u2019t comment on leaked documents like this one. We\u2019ve asked if it can give us any more information on its plans to meet the 2020 target.", "lang": "en"}
