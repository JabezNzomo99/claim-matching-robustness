India conducted an airstrike in Kot Kharak Singh Pernawan near India Nepal border. In responding, Nepal shot down Indian jet & two Indian pilots killed.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. Two old and unrelated images have been brought together to create the post, along with a false claim. Neither has the Indian Air Force conducted an airstrike in Nepal nor has Nepal shot down an Indian jet.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. The post is viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the original source of the two images.\n\nThis picture of an aircraft on fire was published by several international news websites in 2011. According to \u201cBelfast Telegraph\u201d, it was a Lybian warplane which was shot down on the outskirts of Benghazi, eastern Libya, on March 19, 2011.\n\n\u201cCBS News\u201d published the picture with credits to photographer Anja Niedringhaus of Associated Press. As per \u201cCBS News\u201d, there were conflicting reports on whether it was a Libyan government jet or one flown by rebels in Benghazi.\n\nThis image of aircraft debris is the site where an IAF Mirage-2000 fighter jet crashed at a military airport in Bengaluru\u2019s eastern suburbs on February 1, 2019. This image was published in \u201cThe Statesman\u201d the next day.\n\nAs per the report, Squadron Leaders Samir Abrol and Siddharth Negi died of fatal injuries after the aircraft crashed while on an acceptance sortie following its upgrade by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.\n\n\u201cPIB Fact Check\u201d has also called the viral post fake as there is no evidence that IAF conducted an airstrike in Nepal territory or that Nepal shot down an Indian fighter jet.", "lang": "en"}
