That said, crime generally has been falling for the past few decades.\n\nThere are two main measures of crime in England and Wales: the Crime Survey and police recorded crime. Labour has specified crimes recorded by the police\u2014shown in the coloured bars on the chart above. Police recorded crime has risen 9% in the past year and has been trending upward since 2014.\n\nBut just because the numbers are going up doesn\u2019t mean that crime is doing the same in reality.\n\nThere are longstanding problems with these statistics, which have in the past tended to tell us more about police recording practices than about trends in crime. They\u2019re \u201cnot currently considered a reliable measure of trends in crime for most crime types\u201d, according to official statisticians.\n\nThat said, experts say at least some of the recent rises are likely to be genuine.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says that while the overall 9% bump is probably down to changes in how crimes are recorded, the recorded increases in homicide (hard to miscount), knife crime, and theft offences at least partly reflect a genuine rise in criminal activity.\n\nAnd Professor Marian Fitzgerald of the University of Kent told the BBC recently that \"any rises that we are seeing now are genuine. Improvements [to police recording practices] stabilised a long time ago\".\n\nBut the headline measure of crime is still the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This involves asking people if they\u2019ve been the victim of a crime, whether or not they reported it to the police. It\u2019s not perfect or comprehensive either, but it picks up many more crimes than are actually reported to the police.\n\nCrime has been falling for more than two decades according to the Crime Survey. In the past year the figures are basically static.\n\nThe Crime Survey is best for long-term trends. It\u2019s \u201cless reliable for providing an indication of emerging trends\u201d because of the time lag between when people are surveyed and the publication of the results. So if the police numbers are telling us about a genuine rise in criminality, that may not feed through to the Crime Survey for a little while.\n\nIn addition, the headline Crime Survey results (as seen in the red line of the chart above) don\u2019t include cyber crime. The survey only recently began asking people about their experience of crime online, so it\u2019s too early to look at trends in this data, although other sources suggest that cases of fraud and computer misuse may be rising.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see a rise in crime according to the Crime Survey in the years to come.\n\nEven if so, the big picture is that crime is much lower than it was in the 1980s and 1990s\u2014as is the case in many developed countries.", "lang": "en"}
