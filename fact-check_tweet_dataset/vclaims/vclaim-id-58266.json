The company also has not mentioned anything to that effect in a press release, nor has it listed Fauci as a director in any of the annual reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission between 1994 and the present.\n\nMicrosoft confirmed to The Associated Press that Fauci has not served on Microsoft\u2019s board.
