And by cool I don\u2019t just mean amazing, I mean literally cool, as in cold. Plus, you can\u2019t breathe through your butt.\n\nBut turtles can, which is just one of the many reasons that turtles are truly awesome.\n\nAs an ectotherm \u2014 an animal that relies on an external source of heat \u2014 a turtle\u2019s body temperature tracks that of its environment. If the pond water is 1\u2103, so is the turtle\u2019s body.\n\nBut turtles have lungs and they breathe air. So, how is it possible for them to survive in a frigid pond with a lid of ice that prevents them from coming up for air? The answer lies in the relationship between body temperature and metabolism.\n\nA cold turtle in cold water has a slow metabolism. The colder it gets, the slower its metabolism, which translates into lower energy and oxygen demands.\n\nWhen turtles hibernate, they rely on stored energy and uptake oxygen from the pond water by moving it across body surfaces that are flush with blood vessels. In this way, they can get enough oxygen to support their minimal needs without using their lungs. Turtles have one area that is especially well vascularized \u2014 their butts.\n\nSee, I wasn\u2019t kidding, turtles really can breathe through their butts. (The technical term is cloacal respiration.)\n\nWe are not turtles. We are endotherms \u2014 expensive metabolic heat furnaces \u2014 that need to constantly fuel our bodies with food to generate body heat and maintain a constant temperature to stay alive and well.\n\nWhen it\u2019s cold out, we pile on clothes to trap metabolic heat and stay warm. We could never pick up enough oxygen across our vascularized surfaces, other than our lungs, to supply the high demand of our metabolic furnaces.\n\nFor humans, a change in body temperature is generally a sign of illness, that something is wrong. When a turtle\u2019s body temperature changes, it\u2019s simply because the environment has become warmer or colder.\n\nBut even ectotherms have their limits. With very few exceptions (e.g., box turtles), adult turtles cannot survive freezing temperatures; they cannot survive having ice crystals in their bodies. This is why freshwater turtles hibernate in water, where their body temperatures remain relatively stable and will not go below freezing.\n\nWater acts as a temperature buffer; it has a high specific heat, which means it takes a lot of energy to change water temperature. Pond water temperatures remain quite stable over the winter and an ectotherm sitting in that water will have a similarly stable body temperature. Air, on the other hand, has a low specific heat so its temperature fluctuates, and gets too cold for turtle survival.\n\nAn ice-covered pond presents two problems for turtles: they can\u2019t surface to take a breath, and little new oxygen gets into the water. On top of that, there are other critters in the pond consuming the oxygen that was produced by aquatic plants during the summer.\n\nOver the winter, as the oxygen is used up, the pond becomes hypoxic (low oxygen content) or anoxic (depleted of oxygen). Some turtles can handle water with low oxygen content \u2014 others cannot.\n\nSnapping turtles and painted turtles tolerate this stressful situation by switching their metabolism to one that doesn\u2019t require oxygen. This ability is amazing, but can be dangerous, even lethal, if it goes on for too long, because acids build up in their tissues as a result of this metabolic switch.\n\nBut how long is \u201ctoo long\u201d? Both snapping turtles and painted turtles can survive forced submergence at cold water temperatures in the lab for well over 100 days. Painted turtles are the kings of anoxia-tolerance. They mobilize calcium from their shells to neutralize the acid, in much the same way we take calcium-containing antacids for heartburn.\n\nIn the spring, when anaerobic turtles emerge from hibernation, they are basically one big muscle cramp. It\u2019s like when you go for a hard run \u2014 your body switches to anaerobic metabolism, lactic acid builds up and you get a cramp. The turtles are desperate to bask in the sun to increase their body temperature, to fire up their metabolism and eliminate these acidic by-products.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to move when they\u2019re that crampy, making them vulnerable to predators and other hazards. Spring emergence can be a dangerous time for these lethargic turtles.\n\nField biologists tend to do their research during the spring and summer, when animals are most active. But in Ontario, where the winters are long, many turtle species are inactive for half of their lives.\n\nUnderstanding what they do and need during winter is essential to their conservation and habitat protection, especially given that two-thirds of turtle species are at risk of extinction.\n\nMy research group has monitored several species of freshwater turtles during their hibernation. We attach tiny devices to the turtles\u2019 shells that measure temperature and allow us to follow them under the ice.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that all species choose to hibernate in wetland locations that hover just above freezing, that they move around under the ice, hibernate in groups and return to the same places winter after winter.\n\nDespite all this work, we still know so little about this part of turtles\u2019 lives.\n\nSo, I do what any committed biologist would do: I send my students out to do field research at -25\u2103. We are not restricted to fair-weather biology here.\n\nBesides, there is unparalleled beauty in a Canadian winter landscape, especially when you envision all of those awesome turtles beneath the ice, breathing through their butts.", "lang": "en"}
